For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Last week, if you were here, I'm sure you remember that we enjoyed something together as a community of faith that was really, I think, quite special as we entered into a kind of corporate experience of gratitude and thanksgiving. Prompted, at least in part, by our study of Paul's prayer in the book of Colossians, Colossians chapter 1, verses 9 to 14, that we've been examining now for several weeks. And the prayer, at least the part we looked at last week, was this, that they, being the Colossians, would become the kind of people who, according to verse 10, end of verse 11, would joyously be giving thanks to God the Father, even in the context, and particularly in the context of circumstances, that would seem to mitigate against being able to be thankful or be grateful. which calls for what we referred to last week as a defiant kind of gratitude, the kind expressed, in fact, by the prophet Habakkuk, who in Habakkuk 3, verse 17 said this, Though the fig tree should not blossom, and there be no fruit on the vine, though my heart today is broken, and my future is unclear, yet I will exalt in the Lord, I will rejoice in the God of my salvation, Oh, yes, I will, which we called last week defiant gratitude. Because the truth is this, we said last week, the gratitude in this life will always be in spite of something. And we entered into a time in our service where we expressed our gratitude, and for many of you, it was in fact in spite of some things. And I know that because I disassume that, but I also know that because I and we heard from some of you this week who spoke of things last week where your hearts had reason to break. Profound loss, and in the middle of that with tears, expressions of gratitude because gratitude, if we're going to have it in this life, will almost always be in spite of something. But for gratitude to be real, it also has to be because of something. And that something is what Paul talks about at the end of this prayer in Colossians 1, verses 12 to 14, when Paul says that the reason we joyously give thanks to the Father in spite of negative and difficult circumstances is because He, that is, the Father, has, among other things, qualified us, verse 12, to share in the inheritance of the saints in light, an inheritance that the Apostle Peter describes in 1 Peter 1, 4 as being imperishable. This inheritance that we are qualified for is incorruptible, undefiled, and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you. So this inheritance that the Father has qualified us for is yours, and it's waiting, and it's secure, but he didn't just qualify us for this inheritance. He also, verse 13, delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sin. So he's redeemed us, and he's forgiven us, and all of that is why we joyously give thanks to the Father. But it's not just that. He did all that that makes us joyously give thanks, that makes us grateful, because it's also what it cost him to do all that that makes us grateful. And that is at least part of what we try to dial into, what we try to become present to when we come to the communion meal, When we come to the bread and to the cup, which we're going to move into in just a few moments, because the bread at this meal that we call communion speaks to the body of Christ that was broken for us, and the wine speaks to the blood of Christ that was shed for us. And they both, the bread and the wine, speak to his love for us and to the fact that he, being Jesus, the Son of God's love, that he gave everything he had, and he gave everything he had in order that he might be able to qualify us and to deliver us and to transfer us and to redeem us and to prepare for us this meal of the bread and the wine, and to do all that, he gave everything he had. And all of that brings me this morning to a story. that I actually want to read to you. I don't do that very often, just read you a story. It makes me feel very fatherly. I'm going to read you a story today. But today I think it's fitting, actually, the story that I have because I think it will help us come to the table, which is the whole point of our time together today, and prepare and participate in this meal with gratitude and joy and to do it not just in spite of, though it may be in spite of some things, but because of some things as well. The story was written by a woman named Karen Blixen in the early 1900s under the pseudonym of Isaac Denison. The story is set in an impoverished little French village on the coast of Denmark, a town of muddy streets and thatched roofs. In this grim setting, get it in your mind, a white-bearded minister led a small group of worshippers in an austere Lutheran sect. what few worldly pleasures could be found in this tiny little village this sect had renounced as a sign of godliness the pleasures being ungodly so they renounced them all they wore all black and their diet consisted of boiled cod and gruel made from boiling bread in water fortified by a splash of ale the splash of ale being their only indulgence on the Sabbath the group met together and sang songs about Jerusalem, my happy home name ever dear to me because they had fixed their compasses entirely on the new Jerusalem. And the new Jerusalem in their mind was heaven, with life on earth, grim as it was, only to be tolerated till we reached that happy shore, heaven, one day. The minister, a widower, had two daughters. Daughters who in their youth had actually been quite beautiful. villagers actually used to attend church, not so much to hear this minister, but sometimes just to get a glimpse of these two young daughters, maybe to sit near them or even hopefully to speak to them because despite their best efforts, their radiant beauty could not be suppressed. Radiant beauty cannot be suppressed. So spurning all opportunities for a life of romance and love for that clearly would be frivolous and ungodly. They did resist all that for 15 years. The old minister, their father, had died in those 15 years, leaving then these two women, now middle-aged, to carry on the mission of their father, which they accepted as the will of God, their godly duty, but now without their father's stern leadership and control, the village actually began to splinter. One brother bore a long-standing grudge against another for a business deal that had gone south believing that he'd been cheated. Rumors about a 30-year-old infidelity that never had been confirmed continued to linger as if it had happened just yesterday. A pair of sweet little old ladies hadn't spoken a word to each other for over a decade for a grievance that neither one of them could remember. They had become petty and prickly and quarrelsome as a group. Through all this, the minister's daughters remained faithful to the mission. They still met on the Sabbath, and they boiled their fish and made their flavorless gruel, and they sang their songs, the old hymns of heaven to come, but the music had begun to lose its luster. If it ever had any luster, what was there was lost. Now, it was into that scene that a young woman named Babette came one day. She arrived one night, a night too rainy for anyone to venture out in the muddy streets at the house of these two sisters. Exhausted from her travel, she collapsed when the sisters came to the door. And when she was revived, they discovered that she couldn't speak much Danish, but she had a note from a mutual friend of theirs from long ago explaining her plight. Her husband and two sons had been killed in the civil war that was raging in France. Her life was in danger. Can you please give her shelter? Oh, by the way, Babette can cook. Well, the two sisters were nothing if not merciful, so they did, in fact, take her in, but they couldn't pay her anything, and what she needed was a job. I don't need to be paid, Babette explained. I'd be happy. I would be happy to be your servant. I will boil your fish, and I will make your gruel. I know how to cook. she did know how to cook in fact what she didn't tell them however and what they couldn't have known was that this woman who could cook was in fact a world famous chef from the most famous restaurant in all of Paris the Caf√© Anglais she came into this village and she stayed for 14 years Babette stayed in this village and served them eventually actually it didn't take long she came to love them the boiled fish and bread over time began to take on a texture and flavor that actually approached pleasant it wasn't pleasant but it approached it the meal had changed being transformed by babette's skillful hand almost without their notice but the fact is there's only so much you can do with boiled fish and boiled bread now since babette had never mentioned her former life to any of these people when she was in France. It came as a great surprise to them when one day she received a letter. Babette read it and announced, matter-of-factly, that a wonderful thing had happened. Fact is, each year, a friend in Paris had faithfully renewed Babette's number in the French lottery, and this year, her ticket had won 10,000 francs. May not sound like much to you, but it might as well have been a million dollars. Babette was rich, beyond her wildest dreams, rich. Babette could leave this tiny village now and go home to Paris. Surely no one would begrudge her that. It was fitting and proper for her to go. What would she do with all that money in this tiny little place where no one's allowed to spend it or enjoy it? Well, as it happened, Babette's winning the lottery coincided with the very time that the sisters had begun to discuss a celebration to honor the 100th anniversary of their dear departed father's birth. Knowing that, Babette came up with an idea and a request. The request was this. In 14 years, I have asked nothing. She began, and the sisters both nodded. My request, therefore, is this, that you allow me to prepare the anniversary meal for your father, with two caveats. One, that I'm allowed to pay for it myself. Two, that I am allowed to have free reign. Although the sisters had grave misgivings about this extravagant idea, They had to agree that Babette never had asked for anything. In these 14 years, she'd been with them, and it was, after all, in honor of their father's birth. So after much prayerful hand-wringing, because that's always how they prayed, with hands ringing, they reluctantly said, okay. Well, Babette immediately went to work, ordering provisions that were obviously not available in this village. She sent word and money to Paris, and soon by boat, the provisions began. to arrive. Exotic and expensive things. Wheelbarrows loaded with cases of small, crates of small birds, live quail, partridge, pheasant, ham, beef, every vegetable of the season. Ingredients for pastry that she had become famous for making in Paris. Strange creatures from the sea. The whole head of a cow and a live tortoise. And cases of wine. Wine. Cases of wine. Well, now the sister's concern turned to fear. This is far too excessive. Father would never approve, but their dilemma was clear. To enjoy this would be wrong. But to go back on our word would be wrong. They were stuck on the horns of their need to never be wrong. An emergency meeting of the village was called. A decision was made. Wise decision here. We will keep our word by going to the meal. But, and, and we will honor the father, honor the memory of our dear father by not enjoying it. We will go, but we will not enjoy it. we will take no delight in it. Indeed, it was decided that they would not taste it, nor speak of it, even as they ate it. All agreed. Well, the day of the feast arrived, December 15th. It snowed that day, and believe it or not, that snow did, in fact, brighten a bit, that dreary little village with a gloss of white. Picture it in your mind. The fearful, timid people beginning to arrive, dressed in their best, most colorful black clothes. They sat down to an elegant meal. Crystal and porcelain, the likes of which they'd never seen. What opulence is this? What excess? She really must be rich. As Babette labored unseen in the kitchen, the first course was served by a young boy that had been pressed into service, an exotic turtle soup. So that's what happened to the tortoise. They all began to think. They all kept their heads down as they slowly and carefully began to ladle the soup with their spoons, afraid to look at each other for giving away any hint of delight for the food. But there was a problem. The soup was delightful. Never had tastes so exquisite been experienced by any of them. Then one among them did the unthinkable. Instead of carefully ladling the soup with a spoon, he picked up the bowl and began to drink it in full. Soon another did the same, then another and another drinking from their bowl. But they still weren't speaking, so all was not lost. Not a word about the meal, not a hint that they felt pleasure or might even be grateful. No, for they were still convinced and quite afraid that something bad would come from all of this extravagance. But the food kept coming, and the wine was poured, course after course, of tastes and textures on the tongue that they'd never imagined might exist this side of heaven. Slowly, something quite unexpected began to happen. They were experiencing joy. They didn't mean to, but there it was. First, the joy was only in the food, and that was obvious, but then it began to spread. Eye contact with another person at the table, brief but unmistakable admission of delight revealed in the face of the one detected by another. They spilled each other. They smiled at each other between bites. No one ever smiled between bites in this village. Words began to flow. They spoke of the old days when their beloved minister was still alive. They began to recall and to confess how they had mistreated each other, how they had grown petty and prickly, and as soon as one confessed, another did the same, and then another, in addition then to confession, forgiveness actually began to flow freely. One particularly quiet woman gave a modest little burp. No one ever had burped publicly before. They didn't know what to do. They all looked up, wondering how to respond when the eldest of the elders said, Hallelujah! And when they left, instead of walking off separately like they always did, they walked together. This time, arm in arm and hand in hand like old children. And they started to sing. Again, the same old song they always sang about Jerusalem, our heavenly home one day will go there if we can just endure this miserable life. But today as they sang, it seemed like a little taste of their heavenly home had come to them. They tasted joy. Just the taste. They felt delight. A sense of wonder. Thank you, Babette. It was a wonderful meal. They said it out loud With words They had confessed delight But almost as soon as they said it They remembered Babette is leaving now She's wealthy now She's going home to Paris Where wealthy people live Babette, we will always remember As long as we live this wonderful evening When you go back to Paris But I'm not going back She said all my friends and relatives are gone and it would be too expensive actually for me to live in Paris. Too expensive? You're the wealthiest person we know. You won the lottery. What about the 10,000 francs? And that's when Babette told her the rest of her little plan. See, I have no money at all. none at all not anymore because I spent everything I had I gave everything I owned for the making of that meal now in the closing scene of this story the author Isaac Denison leaves no doubt that she wrote this story entitled Babette's Feast not simply as a story of a wonderful meal but as a parable of the kingdom of God as a parable of love and grace. For Babette's story, according to the author, really is God's story. God, you see, formed this little community built on love and grace, but the people in it forgot about love and grace. And they became petty and small and prickly and surly. And even when he came among them, They didn't notice him, for he had no stately form or majesty that we should notice him. Veiled in flesh, the Godhead he. In spite of that, God's dream about a community of people who lived and who loved never died. So he spent everything he had. He gave everything he owned for the making of this meal, for the setting of the table, for the preparation of this feast. But a question remained in the mind of God, but it was kind of a question out there as well. If I do all this, will people come to the feast? And if they come, will they eat and will they drink? And if they eat and drink, will they enjoy? Will they let it touch them and come to life? Will they come to love? Will they sing and dance and laugh for joy? Will they taste and see that God is good? and his kingdom is forever and ever, or will they simply go through the motions, fulfill their obligation to eat the meal because they said they would? That is, some would, through the course of history, respond to this invitation to come and eat the banquet, come to the feast, come to life with God, and some wouldn't respond. but regardless of who would and who wouldn't the decision had been made the heart of God was set so he spent everything he had, he gave everything he owned for the making of this meal and all of that is why that is why we joyously give thanks to God the Father not just in spite of but because he has qualified us and delivered us and transferred us into the kingdom of his son and he has redeemed us and forgiven us and prepared for us this meal. So come and eat and drink and live and joyously give thanks to the Father. Let's go to the table. Thank you.
