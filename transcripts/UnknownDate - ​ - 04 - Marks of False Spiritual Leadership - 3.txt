Let's pray. Lord, I thank you for, among other things, in Matthew 23, the picture that is there that you fight for us. And you fight for those who are having the kingdom shut off from them because of systems that would present themselves as those who speak for you but do not. And I pray that you would continue to bring your message of liberation and freedom, that we would be recipients of it and proclaimers of it as well. I pray that you would do your work among us, as you will, as it relates to this truth in Jesus' name. Amen. We are, as I'm sure most of you know, dealing these weeks with the issue of spiritual abuse. The focus of the study for the dynamic of abuse, spiritual abuse, is found in Matthew 23. That's the way we're dealing with it. I believe that this teaching is a tough teaching. I think it's probably in some ways, depending on where you are with the issue, either being a victim of it or a perpetrator of it, or as we have kind of indicated, we're kind of all a little blend of both possibly, that it's possibly hard to hear some of this stuff, that it might be a little hard to process some of this stuff, that even as you're hearing it on Wednesday night, you kind of go home and it either gets bigger or it just kind of dissipates. It can't be that bad, that kind of thing. But I just need to share that I really believe that the issue we're dealing with is relevant to and vital for the church today. I believe that the issues of spiritual abuse that Jesus 2,000 years ago revealed in these verses that for many of us are just Bible verses, you know, you kind of get lost. It's something he did 2,000 years ago. I believe absolutely that those issues are as real now as they were then. I believe absolutely that they are as at work now in the church as they were here in the temple. And one of the things that kind of helps me see that is not only just what I've experienced in the church, but even as we deal with Scripture, One of the things that's very interesting and helpful for us as we would apply certain confrontations is to realize that Jesus' ministry was among God's people. The temple, Israel, they were God's people. It would be the equivalent of him coming to the church today, his moving to Israel. And I believe that Jesus still, in a very real and vital way, is standing in the courtyard of the Gentiles today, standing in the context of the religious community today, and is fighting for his church, and he's calling for his people to reality, and he's calling for his people to move past what Paul called a form of godliness that looks good on the outside but denies its power. If there was ever anywhere in Scripture a group of people who were the embodiment of a form of godliness that denied its power or denied its reality. It's the people we're meeting in Matthew 23. They had a form of godliness. It looked really good, but there wasn't any reality. It's been characterized, first of all, in our study so far, by a false authority. It's been characterized, in verse 3, by a lack of congruity, meaning they said, but they did not do what they said. In verse 4, it's characterized by tying heavy weights of legalistic performance on men's backs, but doing nothing to lift the load. It's characterized by an external show, wearing their religion is what that says, wearing their religion on the outside but not having any internal reality. Making a fair show in the flesh was their focus and their preoccupation. Image is everything is another way we could say that. That was in verse 5, verses 6 through 12. We found that in systems like this, recognition was vital, being called by men rabbi, having the chief seats in whatever gathering there was and also the issue of the place of honor, the place of honor at banquets. When we came to verse 13 last week, one of the things we noted was that the issue that Jesus was dealing with kind of got kicked up a notch. In fact, in verse 1 of this chapter, it says he spoke to the multitudes and to the disciples. In verse 13, he addresses now his words to the Pharisees and the scribes. First, he was speaking to the multitudes with the scribes and Pharisees there, speaking to them, describing them. Now he's looking at those that he just described, again for the multitude's benefit. What I believe now he is doing, starting in verse 13, is moving past just describing the characteristics of false spiritual leadership or spiritual abuse to now describing the impact of it. And as I said last week, the reason I think he's doing this, this is my view, it's not in the text, but I think it's consistent with the text, is because he is not going to allow this original group, and he's not going to allow us to minimize the characteristics he just mentioned. I think there is a tendency on all our parts to hear these characteristics and go, yeah, I've seen that, yeah, I've been in that, I may be in something like that right now, but it's no big deal. Jesus says in verse 13, it's a real big deal. Let me tell you why. Number one, systems like this, verse 13, shut off the kingdom of heaven from men. That's why it's a big deal. I told you last week that the key word there was the word kingdom. And the word kingdom means basileia, is the Greek word basileia, and it means reign of God or rule of God. What we pointed out last week was this, that what these systems were shutting people off from was not the temple. It was not, if we were to make it contemporary, they weren't shutting people off from the church, from some sort of experience or involvement with some brand of Christianity. In fact, verse 15, they would travel about on sea and land to make a proselyte. They wanted people to come to their temple. They wanted people to come to their church. What was shut off because of these characteristics was ever experiencing the reign of God. The life-giving reality of God present here is what was being shut off. The frightening piece we added there too was that the significant group of people who were having this experience shut off were not rebellious God rejecters. They were people who were looking for God. It says the ones who are getting shut out are ones who are trying to enter in at the end of that verse. You do not allow those who are trying to enter in to come. And the scenario we painted was a group of people like maybe your neighbors, like maybe you who come to a place in your life where you see there really is a God and I want to find out who he is. What's the logical place to find God? If you were a Jew 2,000 years ago, the logical place would have been the temple. When they went to the temple, they didn't find God. They found a system that kept them from God, but had God's name all over it. What's a logical place 2,000 years later to find God if you're looking for God? Church. The problem is in abusive systems, when people go to church looking for God, they find a system that has God labels all over it, but they never get to God. If they're like this, that will be the experience. It shuts off the kingdom from people trying to enter. The last thing we dealt with last time was on top of all these things, the other impact is that they devour people. And that's where we got again into that issue of role reversal, where instead of the leadership being there for the sheep, the sheep are there for the leadership. We made a comparison that for me, when I first made it, was frightening and might have been frightening when you heard it because the way it kind of crystallized for me was when I compared this devouring, taking the life from them to abuse of other sorts, like sexual abuse or physical abuse. And we have compared spiritual leadership that devours with a parent, for instance, who is in the life of that child to use their size and their strength. And it really works when I put it in that arena because a parent really is bigger. They really are stronger. They have more experience and they can use all of that to lift that child up and nurture them and set them free in the world to function well. Or they can use all of that power to suck the life right out of the child, meeting all of their needs. Sexual abuse is the ultimate expression of devouring a person to meet my needs. And I use all my power. Spiritual abuse is the same thing. I use the authority and power that God's given me. Instead of using that to nurture the flock, we use it to suck the life out of the flock to make me feel good. Or whoever the leadership is. Or whoever the person in the power place is. And by the way, the person in the power place isn't always the pastor. Sometimes the power place is in the people and the pastor gets devoured. That's really a true thing. I have a very good friend who's going through that right now. Role reversal. I'm going to just stay on this abuse thing, and this is a new piece. I've kind of given you review so far. A classic form of abuse, and it's still in the vein of this role reversal, is when I try to get you to do what I want using God's name to get you to do it. Now, I'm not sure what you heard the first week we had class when I was absent. It's possible that Jeff used this illustration. He tells a story of this incident that he had with a couple of his daughters. Aaron was downstairs in the family trying to get Jesse to do something. Share a toy. She wouldn't do it, she wouldn't do it, she wouldn't do it. She went upstairs and said this. What all kids say, get, you know, she's not sharing her toy. Get her to share the toy. And what Holly says is, tell Jesse how you feel. Go to Jesse and you tell her and don't tell me. Holly didn't intervene and make Jesse do it. What happened was Holly kind of stood at the top of the stairs and heard Aaron go downstairs and talk to Jesse. And what Aaron said to Jesse was this. Mom said, you have to give me da-da-da-da-da. And Holly responded to that real well. What she did was at some point get together with Aaron and say, I'm really unhappy with how you did that because what you did. And I don't know if these are the words, but you already know what happened there. What Aaron did was use mom's name to empower her to get Jesse to do what Aaron wanted her to do. I just gave you a classic picture of what some leadership people do, other we do to each other. And that is this. I'm going to use God's name because I don't feel like I have any personal power. So I'm going to use God's name to get you to do, had nothing to do with God. I'll use a Bible verse, but it has nothing to do with what God really wants for his people. It's what I want you to do. It's what I have a need that needs to be met. I'm going to use God's name to get you to do what I want you to do. That's abuse. If I can use God's name to get you to do what I want, I can get you to give. And giving is good. I can get you to serve. But it won't be because God told you to serve. It'll be because I told you to serve. And I'll use God's name to get you to do what I want you to do. One of the classic arenas that this gets abused in is in the area of personal prophecy. I think many of you have been abused by that. I don't think you need to call it what it is. I think it's abuse. I have a word for you. God told me to tell you that you're supposed to... da da da da or you're not supposed to da da da da da sometimes that is a word sometimes it's a way for somebody who doesn't feel a lot of personal power a personal strength in their own opinion so they bring god's name into their opinion make it sound real spiritual and if you disagree with this you're not disagreeing with the person who you disagree with you disagree with god now you're in big trouble by the way i believe in prophecy i believe in people getting words and i and i we we want to have an atmosphere where we can share those words. But one of the things we teach here, and one of the places you'll get to teaching for this is in Tom's class and some other places as well, a lot of our kinship groups. And that is, this may sound a little contrived, but if I get a word, if I get a word for Jeff, and I even think it's a word, what I'm going to do with Jeff is share the word with him this way. Jeff, I don't know if this is a word or not, but here's what I'm getting. And if it doesn't resonate with you, then disregard it. But this business of God gave me a word for you and I know what you're supposed to do is bogus. It's not going to fly here. That doesn't mean people won't do it here because we don't know. But it's not what we're about. And it's a way, I've had it done to me so I know what it feels like to be abused by that where somebody gives you their opinion, put a God thing on it and there's nowhere to go. It's abusive. But to let it sit out there, this is what I think God's saying. In fact, I even feel real strong that this is what God's saying, but I want to let it sit out there and you discern as well. We use Scripture the same way, beat people up often to get them to do what we want them to do. It's manipulative. Let's look at another impact. After they devour people, the next thing is in verse 15, they reproduce. What do you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites? Because you travel about on sea and land to make a proselyte, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourself. I love the way Jesus beats around the bush. You know, he kind of sugarcoats it and makes it feel real nice. They reproduce. Quite simply put, it's this. They pass their disease along to their victims. They pass their spiritual death to the people they convert to their spiritual death. To borrow again from the abuse scenario, the abuse paradigm, It's as if to say in this arena, the abused people become abusing people. Now, the only disclaimer I want to put on that is that is not an automatic. If you've ever been abused, you automatically become an abuser. That's not an automatic thing. But there is a clear pattern with things like that. And in this spiritual context, what Jesus is saying, I think, is this. As the dysfunction spiritually, as the distortion spiritually is passed from generation to generation, to generation, from generation to generation to generation, it gets worse and worse and worse. It's more legalistic. It gets more external. It gets more shallow. And as it's going from generation to generation, it gets cemented. And by the time I've had three or four generations of false authority, lacking congruity, tying heavy weights, wearing their religion on the outside, and needing to be recognized, if I'm on the third or fourth generation or that, and I'm living in that. I don't know any different. I think this is normal. This is normal. I wouldn't, I didn't even have any flags going up saying something's wrong here. Nothing. This is all I've ever known is getting beat by my dad. If I'm in a physical abuse situation. So all I've ever known is heavy weights. If I'm in a spiritual abuse, you know, you're not even rebelling against it. It's all you've ever known. Let's look a little closer to the text. First thing we notice about this reproduction in this verse is that this reproduction is purposeful. It's on purpose. Look at it, what he describes in Pharisees. You travel about on sea and land to make a proselyte. You're on purpose doing that. They're zealous for what they would call evangelism. There's a Bible verse to support that. Go ye into all the world. Jesus said that and preach the gospel to every nation. Now, this is where I need to be careful and make sure we're walking the line of truth. Evangelism is a good thing. It is a biblical mandate, and we embrace it here at our church. And I think if you're in our church, you know that. But what we need to understand in verse 15, and it's pretty clear in the text, that what they were doing, whatever it was, it was not evangelism. Why? Well, I know from the text it wasn't evangelism because whatever it was they were doing was producing not sons of God. It was producing sons of what? Hell, right in the text. So I know that whatever it is that they're doing, they're not euangelizo. They're not bringing good news to anybody. They're not proclaiming the truth. I think there's at least two reasons why they were producing sons of hell and not sons of God. First reason is this. And this is just kind of pulled right out of not just particularly that verse, but this entire context. The first reason they were producing sons of hell and not sons of God was because of their message. These people, this system, was not preaching a message of brokenness. If we were real in tune with Matthew right now, as we were when we originally preached this, the message of Jesus as it relates to the kingdom was in Matthew 5, blessed are the broken. It is not a message of mourning, meaning get out here, what's in here. It was not a message of calling for a hungering and thirsting for a righteousness. You can't produce yourself. It was not a message of grace or faith or your only hope being in Jesus. Their message, clearly over the last few weeks we've established this, was this. Your hope is to try harder, do more, carry the load. It's up to you and look good at all costs. Whatever you do, look good. That was their message. It did not point to grace and faith. It pointed to law and striving. It did not produce brokenness and mourning. Their message did not. Their message produced self-righteousness and pride. And the text says that their evangelism, their form of evangelism, produced sons of hell. Who think, by the way, because of their external performance, they're on their way to heaven. Pretty scary. Pretty scary. They think they're on their way to heaven because they look so good and know so much. And he says they're going straight to hell and you're even producing more sons of the same thing. So the first reason they're producing sons of hell is because of their message. The second reason, and this one is, I think, powerfully close to home, because of their motive. Because of their motive. Let me explain this with a question. They travel about on sea and land. That speaks to zealousness. Why are they so zealous? Why are they so zealous to bring converts? Well, let me give you some possibilities. Are they zealous to bring converts or proselytes because of love? Like Jesus, he saw the sheep distressed and scattered, and like sheep without a shepherd. Was that their heart? No. Was their zealousness for evangelism compassion? Was it because he saw their bondage? No, we already know that's not it from verses 1 through 12. In fact, what these people were doing, these leaders, these people also infected by this leadership, were not looking for people to lift the weight off of. They were looking for people to put the weight on. They tie heavy weights on people and don't do a thing to lay it off, take it off. So they're looking for people who will take the load. We're not looking for people who they can take the load off of. Here's what I want you to get as a mark, if you will, but also an impact of these kinds of characteristics. Even though they have a zealousness for proselytizing or evangelism, they're not evangelizing, they are recruiting. Know the difference. They are not evangelizing, they are recruiting. It's about numbers, And their motive is not to liberate lost people. Their motive, in terms of the zealous nature with which they try to recruit people, is to validate themselves. You've got to get that too. You need to understand that. They are not evangelizing. They're recruiting. They are not seeking to liberate the lost. They are seeking to validate themselves. Because the more people I can get to sign up and agree with me, the better I'm going to feel about me. I'd give a rip about you, quite frankly. I was a freshman at Bethel College. It was a Sunday afternoon. I was in my dorm room with some friends. We were watching a Vikings game. I'll never forget this. A group of three or four guys came into our dorm room, didn't know who they were, introduced themselves as being from a local Bible college that was quite a ways from us. I'd heard of this place. I'd never been there or anything like that. And I had no idea why they were there. And after they introduced where they were from, they began to make it clear to us that they were there to witness to us. It was a good thing, I suppose. I felt a little bit weird about that. And I wanted to get back to the Vikings game. But I figured, well, these guys love the Lord and they're saved and so am I. And so I let them kind of do their spiel for a little bit. And then I kind of actually settled down as they were saying all this stuff. I've done that, I've done that. When they were done, I don't know who said it, but among us, we kind of communicated to them that, hey, you know, it's okay, and we think what you're doing is fine, but we're among the redeemed as well, and we named Jesus as our Savior. And what was very odd was their response to that, and the response was they didn't believe us. And they made it pretty clear that they didn't buy the fact that we were among the redeemed, and I even remember very clearly that there were two fundamental reasons that they did not believe that we were redeemed. Number one, because we went to Bethel. That was one reason. and that's goofy for some of you. It's not true. It's absolutely true. That was one reason they believed they knew we weren't redeemed. The other reason that we weren't doing what they were doing right then. And that proves it as well. We were sitting watching a Vikings game on a Sunday when they were out winning the world. So that's another proof that we weren't among the redeemed. At that point, I said something to them that convinced them that they were indeed right about my redeemed status. Gave them all sorts of ammunition and I'm sure that when they left, they felt, I think I probably made their day. I think they were absolutely vindicated. They counted themselves among those who were persecuted for the cross of Christ. When they left, I remember feeling angry and defensive and intimidated and confused. Now, I'm a freshman in college and that certainly doesn't mean that I know everything, but I've grown up in the church and I knew the gospel of grace and I understood it. And I, at that time in my life, was kind of, I was still a pretty goofy person, but I had gone past that I don't know about this God stuff. I had embraced the God stuff pretty strongly by this time. And I remember, even at that time in my life, feeling like at first there was a strong compulsion to figure out what it was they wanted me to do so I'd be okay with them and I would do it, except it was so extreme I was able to see this one. By the way, I don't know if, I don't know if, you know, By the way, I'm giving you a little tool here on how insidious legalism is because you get sucked in right now, even if you really know this stuff. You get sucked in right now. Because if loads are being put on, you're going to do anything to get out from under it, get accepted by these people, and I was ready, except I wasn't ready to leave Bethel or the Vikings game. In the end, this was a very good experience for me because it was real clear to me that I had to make a choice. What am I going to look to to get okay? What am I going to look to right now to get okay? Am I going to look to their approval, or am I going to hang on to Jesus? I figured out real quick, because of the extreme nature with which they came, that nothing I could do could get their approval, so I erased that. I'm not going to try to get my approval from them. I'm going to just keep hanging on to Jesus. So what it did, it just cemented further that my only hope was Jesus. So ultimately, that evil thing had a good consequence in me. But let me ask you a question. Why did they come in my room? Love? a desire to lift off the load of my shame and guilt with the message of god's redeeming love was that why they were there i don't believe that for a minute in fact i don't believe they were in that room for me at all i think with all i absolutely firmly believe they were in that room for themselves they weren't in there for me i don't think they gave a rip about me they were not there to lift anybody's load they were there to try to give me theirs they were not evangelizing they were recruiting they were not seeking to liberate me they were trying to validate themselves and either way that encounter would have gone it would have validated themselves and they did if i would have received it they would have been validated when i rejected it they were validated yeah when i went out reaching out and sharing my faith with people and things like that and recruiting and it was recruiting i still did it i had a lot of love in my heart for those people because i was sincere i really thought that you know this is what this is what god wanted to do I thought, hey, I was bringing people to the Lord, you know, and some people, you know, didn't eventually bring the Lord to it. Other people were just people more burdensome. But nonetheless, I think it's unfair to say that you can say for sure that these people are doing this with their love because I know for myself personally when I was involved in a group, there were some things particularly like that. I did that with love. I was sincere. I was wrong. I was sincerely wrong, but I still have love. Okay. I received that. What I'll say to that, though, is maybe you can help me with some insight on this. I think it's a good thing to bring up. What I'll say, though, is that even with the sincerity, the impact of that abuse is nonetheless real damaging. And it's still not evangelizing. It's recruiting. It's so hard to read that one. I believe you, by the way, when you tell me that there was love in your heart. I believe that. and so now i got to visualize these guys and think okay maybe there was some love in their heart maybe there was but with the truth now now i remember talking to you last week and god's really done some neat stuff in you with this kind of stuff but that's that's another example for you of where i think it lands on all of us where not only have we've been victimized but we've been victimizers as well i think that's a good thing to put on this that there could be genuine sincerity in this and so this this real black you know broad stroke i gave needs to be tempered a tad so i'll receive that that's good galatians 6 12 says that the motive of the judaizer here is that is they compel you to be circumcised adopt this external thing simply that they may boast in your flesh and again while there might be sincerity in some in what paul is confronting in Galatians is the motive. The motive is what? That they can boast in your flesh, not love. Okay, the sincerity, what Jeff said was that the sincerity piece doesn't make it less, it makes it more because the sincerity, the scenario isn't something, aha, how can I destroy somebody? It's somebody who really believes this and it just gives it more power. It gives the approach more power. Yeah, somebody else raised their hand. Were you a younger Christian at the time? Yeah. I recall my youthful days, the first few years I was a Christian. I had a lot of zeal, a lot of excitement about what I was doing. Easy for me at that point to deceive myself from thinking that what I was doing was really an athlete. But being a baby, a couple months old, a couple years old, like a small little child, the love that I had wasn't for them. But so I'm self-deceiving. That's how I look at what he's saying. It's just self-deceiving. Okay. Yeah, see, in my case, this whole class has really just brought a lot of bitterness and anger because of the past. And the reason is because within my sincerity, I've realized what I've done, not even knowing it, and mad at the person who tried to tell me or mad at the people who told me this was totally true. And then all the people that I have in refraction told the same truth too. And that's why I think Christ says we're made to be twice as much as sons now. Because we become even more believing that this is sincerely true. So with our whole heart, we're not out there to make ourselves look good. We're out there to say, this is how we receive Christ. That really does speak to the sincerity piece. And I think that is the twice as much even as like you believe it even more than the people who are telling you, maybe. Yeah, Jeff. That's good. I was a junior high pastor for two years, from 1975 to 77. Because my perception of myself then was someone who loved junior higher. And I believed that then. But my perception of myself now of them is that I needed to have them look good so their parents were okay with me. but you didn't think that then oh no I didn't have a clue that's what I was doing I thought I loved junior highers you know and I didn't love junior highers I love junior highers now but I didn't love junior highers then I loved me then and I needed people's approval then and so I did that but even in the midst of that and I'm going to give the end of your talk that what Jesus says is but even now if you see that repent there's grace all over the place for that And I feel grateful that I have God's grace even for me who did that to people who didn't get the talks back. I mean, I'd like to get the talks back so I can feel okay. Now I'm just going to have to feel okay because of Jesus. And that's the struggle. Yeah. Sometimes when you hear a word like he did and he felt sincere, a correction or a real firm word from you feels almost like a rebuke and it makes you feel almost shamed, but it shouldn't. Rather, instead, the way to get through that is to take responsibility and let it mature me because there's a temptation to want to let it go inside you and make you feel stupid for what you did in the past. Instead, the way through it is to just take responsibility, accept it, and go forward. The way that I think people get empowered to take responsibility and accept it is when we know about grace. Otherwise, I'm going to be pushing this off all my life. It was something else. It was not me. But when we find out about grace, then we can start owning stuff. That's the liberty in the whole thing. Okay. No, I am going to talk about this later on. The text is going to talk about the fact that systems like this contaminate you. And what you need to do is get away, get out of systems like that. I think, and I'll talk a little bit later if we get to this, that sometimes you're supposed to stay. And we'll talk about fight and flight. I'd kind of like to have your stuff on that. But whether we fight the issue and stay or flight, leave, for a number of reasons. I think when you have authority who's doing this and they aren't open, unless you feel a real call of God to be an agent for truth there, for your own protection, you need to leave. And there's something in the text that's going to say that. I really heard of the gospel, the real gospel. and then I got caught up into what we were two years after it's like I lost all my joy and every real thing that God's doing it was like I used to witness but it's like in the last four years of my life it's like God's killing me I'm freeing you from the system and I've left a lot of a lot of times. It's like he made me stop witnessing because it was like he showed me. It's like when you go and witness to somebody, you have nothing to share. It's like you're saying, come and share my bondage with me. I want to come to the point where God, I have something so real in my life that it's like, give somebody something. I have nothing to share unless God gives it to me. God's going to give it to you too. So, God's going to just let God heal you. But you know what you just described? A lot of testimonies right in this room. How many can resonate with that same testimony? Could give the same one? Okay. And what you described also was the tying heavy weights. Remember that a couple weeks ago? Tying heavy weights. And we talked about three ways that people do that. One is with works righteousness, where you earn your way to God. And we don't do that. But the second thing is after an awful lot of people get saved, recognizing our only hope for salvation is Jesus, and we receive grace, and there's this delightful experience of freedom and joy in Christ, we put the load back on people, and it's all up to you again. And you live just the same way you did before you were saved. In some ways, it's worse because it's so confusing now. I think so that it ties into everything that everyone is saying, is that talking about the zeal, and you feel your heart in a lot of change out of your heart, and you're trying to get someone out of this system like that, or learning to accept the grace of God, the issue of love. What is love? And can you learn to divide between the love of the flesh and the love of the spirit? It's hard to take classes like this and going to the church and learning to read the scriptures and discern yourself to grow up to understand and discern which is real, true, spirit-given love and which is a bunch of flesh when you're all trying to get value or acceptance either as an infuser or a puppy. Right. When I'm a little kid, I want Daddy to accept it. so I'm not going to tell him that he's actually confusing or the parents that I'm going to control this kid so that he knows that I love him. Right. Yeah. Jeff? Well, I think that what you addressed also is the difference between evangelizing Jesus and recruiting to something else, you know. Those guys were recruiting you to their cause. You know, it's like they didn't need to evangelize you to Jesus because you already were at Jesus. And so it had to be something else for them to keep coming like that. and I think that even when I go visit churches on a Sunday when I'm out of town or something one of the antennas I have out is am I hearing a message that says care about the denomination or care about this cause or care about this person or try hard to be good Christian boys and girls or am I hearing a message that says hang on tighter to Jesus and that's kind of how I can tell and I grew up in a system where we were taught to recruit, you know, because of all the flack we got if we weren't out recruiting. But I could, even in the midst of doing that and feeling really ashamed and guilty if I didn't, I always wondered why would anybody want to come and join the poor self-esteem club? I mean, you know. Well, it's like the donkey going down the road with the load. Yeah, it's like, come and share my bondage. Let me tell you how the Pharisees did what he just described. The Pharisees had two kinds of converts in their mind. This is something that came from Lenski, the commentary that when I was going through Matthew, I used extensively. The first kind of convert that they spoke of was called the proselyte of the gate. The second one was the proselyte of righteousness. It's going to line up exactly with what he just said, and it'll describe the experience many of you have had in the church. The proselyte in the gate was a Gentile, and proselyte would be a Gentile who was converted to Judaism, for instance, or to God, the true God, okay? A Gentile, a proselyte of the gate is a Gentile who, when they heard of the true God and the necessity to have faith in him, believed. I call him today a simple believer, just loved Jesus, for instance. Acts 16, 14, Acts 18, 17 identifies the proselytes as the gate as true worshipers of God, simple believers, okay? This proselyte of the gate, though, to the Pharisee, though they acknowledged them as being proselytes, converted in some sense, were not impressive at all to the Pharisees. They had another term, as I told you just a moment ago, and that was the proselyte of righteousness. The proselyte of righteousness was a Gentile who was converted not just to God, but was converted to the Pharisaic system. They bought the bag, in other words. They got circumcised. They learned the rituals. They learned the rules. They embraced all of the Levitical and traditional systems. And before you even knew what was happening, these proselytes of righteousness were learning how and knowing how to be a Pharisee more than they knew how to be a man or a woman of God. The focus was being a Pharisee, not being godly. The focus was being a Sadducee, not being godly. And today when that happens, it's manifested this way. we're not learning how to become followers of Jesus we're learning how to become Baptists we're learning how to become Lutherans Catholics, Christian and missionary alliance it's when people don't get converted to God they get converted to a system or else they do get indeed converted to God but after that the load they get is really real commitment is when you buy the bag of the system you become a Baptist I'm not saying don't become a Baptist But the point is, the preoccupation is what a Baptist does, what a Lutheran does, what a Catholic does, what a charismatic does, and those are the preoccupations. I remember when I first came to this church, one of the frightening realities of it was that our elders knew the bylaws better than they knew the Bible. That's just a fact. What governed our church, what governed our decisions, yes, no, this direction, that direction, had nothing. They didn't even know the Bible. what they poured over, could quote chapter and verse, was the bylaws. Honest. I remember one of the hardest times I had embracing the denomination we're in. When I first came here, I had a very hard time embracing our denomination, the Christian Mission Alliance. And one of the reasons was because the most ungodly people in this church were waving the banner of the Alliance like nobody's business. I don't think they knew God. They knew the Alliance. And when I got to know some Alliance people who knew God, I found out that they were as upset with them as I was, and the Alliance wasn't the problem, so I kind of got that straightened out, understand? It took me a while. Have you ever seen that? I think we all have. That's because this problem is not over. This problem isn't a 2,000-year-old thing, and we read about it and go, isn't that something that that happens today? People who know what it means more to be a Baptist or Lutheran than they know what it means to be a born of the Spirit child of God. We know about our traditions, the distinctives of our denomination more than we know the word but to a pharisee the one who was really converted the really in guy or gal was the one who bought the bag of the system who really became the shiny bright baptist catholic lutheran if i were to kind of keep it with the text remember last week when we talked about going to the temple in the courtyard of the gentiles and you bring your offering but then there was a booth of approval and the temple and and a priest said no your offering isn't good enough, but you can go to one of these other booths and you'll have to pay ten times what the lamb is really worth. And I kind of see these booths in the courtyard of the Gentiles as all these different denominations. And they all have different hoops you've got to jump through. You know, a little distinctive you've got to line up to. And if you buy all that, then you're one of us. I'm going to just interject something here before I go to the next thing. We're talking about a cycle here of abuse, aren't we? I mean, we've talked about reproducing. We've talked about spiritual abuse, comparing it with sexual abuse. We're talking here about this whole thing of the proselyte of righteousness, buying the bag of religious performance rather than just a relationship with God. And it's a cycle, making them, as the text says, twice as much a son of hell as himself. Here's the question. Is there a way to break the cycle? How would you break the cycle? There's a real piece of good news in this, by the way. Okay, one way to break the cycle. Somewhere in the dynamic of freedom, of liberation from a system, you have to speak the truth. We have to hear the truth. One of the characteristics of abuse in any level, spiritual, sexual, physical, is what? Remember? Denial. Remember? Denial. One of the things that helps denial is what? Hearing the truth. Jesus said this, You shall know the truth, and the truth shall what? Set you free. I'll set you free. You'll start hearing the truth. You'll start going, that's what that was. But I've been in a system, And when I got down here, it looked normal. And then you heard a truth and you go, this is not normal. This is not what God wanted. And I'm hearing it from God, not from Dave. This is right out of the text. So the denial needs to be broken by the truth. And right enmeshed with that principle is the truth needs to be spoken. It needs to be said out loud. The silence needs to be broken. The whistle needs to be blown. It needs to be said out loud. And if you're in a system, if it's ever going to change, and again, if you are feeling like this is something God's calling you to do, it needs to be said out loud. It needs to be said out loud. The denial is broken. I see the truth. Now I say it out loud and break the silence. Now, one of the ways this really resonates with me to kind of make it even more practical than in a spiritual kind of context or a church context is keep it again, this thing of breaking the silence, In the context of an abusive family system, an alcoholic system, one of the things that needs to be done, if you are from an abusive family system, alcoholic system, sexually abused, one of the things that needs to happen to break the cycle, to keep you from being abused anymore, is it needs to be said out loud. It needs to be said out loud. And by the way, when you stand up in your family system and say out loud, I was sexually abused when I was six, and Dad, you're the one who did it, or whatever, the no-talk rule has kept a lid on, and you say it out loud, you will be so appreciated for that, won't you? No, you won't. No, they're probably not going to have a banquet for you. In fact, the truth is, and this is where I want to speak very gently and get my arms around, every single person in this room who's ever been used by God or just knew in order for your own sanity and your own safety, survival, literally, that you had to be the one who would break the cycle in your family. Let's not even make it to church yet, but just break the cycle in your family that you were the one who said it out loud in your family. There's something I know about you, and I can embrace you and comfort you in this, and that is this. I know this about you. You paid an enormous price when you said it out loud. Wherever you are, if you've ever done that, you paid an enormous price. You might have even been kicked out of your family. If not literally, then in terms of the relational dynamic, you were pushed right out of the family because you were the problem for saying out loud that there was a problem. it goes back to the sermon we talked about a few weeks ago put all of that dynamic in a spiritually abusive system go into your church and say it out loud these things are here it's in the leadership it's in the people it's in this power group over here it's maybe not in the pastor but it's in this you know about little power groups in the church little power group over here that's all say it out loud say it out loud and they'll have a banquet for you no um they'll hate you and and you will be persecuted and all the things in matthew and all the things in the gospels that talk about being persecuted for his name's sake will start coming true for you. And here's the piece that ministers to my heart. First one who ever did this, who was he? It was Jesus. It's right here in Matthew 23. Jesus was the pioneer. Jesus was the first silence breaker, no-talk rule breaker. And all my life I've heard, be like Jesus. Okay. Then let's break the no-talk rule. I'm going to be like Jesus and we're going to expose what's not true. That's Christ-like. See, I've been told all life Christlikeness is keeping quiet Don't tell the truth That's a troublemaker I haven't been told that in words The picture I derive of that When I realized that Jesus is the first one Who broke the no-talk rule I picture Jesus standing in the courtyard of the Gentiles With the multitudes And the Pharisees there Describing them in their ear shot They could hear everything they said And then he says, speaking directly to them woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, and it could be said of them what I just said of those other scenarios, and when he got done, they had a banquet for him. Right? No. What's really powerful when this started landing on me is where this conversation comes in the book of Matthew. It comes two days before they nail him to a cross. And I believe these words are what gave the Pharisees the final impetus to get out all the rage they had because he became the problem for saying there was a problem. It's right there. But out of all of that, there's a wonderful message and that's this, that Jesus fights for me. And Jesus fights for victims of systems like this. He started it. It's why he died. And when you stand to break the cycle, here's a verse for you. And when you stand to break the cycle and speak the truth, Matthew 5, verse 11, blessed are you when men cast insults at you and persecute you and say all sorts of evil things against you falsely on account of me for telling the truth. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great. And here's the thing that is good. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you. Now, you may not ever see yourself as a prophet. If you're a truth teller, and if you stood in a system of lies and told the truth, whether it be a family system or a church system, and you've told the truth, you need to know that this verse says of you that you stand in line with the prophets who did the same thing you did, and when they told the truth, they got what you're getting right now. And it doesn't take the pain away, but it lets you know you're doing the right thing. And right along with Jeremiah, Ezekiel's, Isaiah's, Paul's, Peter's, Stephen's name is yours. That encourages me. I think it's a powerful picture. The next impact or characteristic is they lie. This is kind of brutal too. They lie. They don't talk straight. Just to let this kind of sink in in terms of any experience you've had, they hardly ever say what they mean. Everything they say seems to be veiled, hidden. They'll always sound pious. Like I said last week, they will say the right thing. Rarely will you hear the real thing. And everything will seem to have a double meaning so that later when you try to hold them accountable for what they said, they didn't mean that, they meant this. You follow that? They didn't mean that, they meant this. So everything kind of has a double meaning. And the result of that is you can't ever pin anything down. You can't ever confront. I would liken it to breaking the mercury out of a thermometer. Have you ever tried to pick mercury up? It goes... You can't ever... Why can't I get this thing? Because it keeps slipping around. Let me read the verse. It sounds so slippery. Here's what the Pharisees say. You, verse 16, blind guides who say, whoever swears by the temple, that is nothing. But if you swear by the gold of the temple, then you're obligated. What are they saying? I'll explain that in a minute. Look at verse 18. And you also say this. Whoever swears by the altar, that's nothing. But if I swore, or whoever swears by the offering upon the altar, then you're obligated. What's going on here? What Jesus is exposing here, and I'll explain this whole concept of swearing in just a minute, but what they were doing was, on one level, they were saying something like this. Oh, you can count on me. Oh, I will follow through. Oh, yes, I care about you. How do I prove that? I swear by the temple. Later on, you find out they didn't care, they didn't follow through. You say, why didn't you follow through? You swore by the temple that you cared that you would follow through. Oh, whoever swears by the temple, that's nothing. But if I would have swore by the gold on the temple, then I would have been obligated. Double talk. Let me explain something about this swearing. To swear, I think you understand, means not to curse or use profane language. It means to affirm an oath that what I say is true. And this is huge. The reason I would use an oath or swear that what I say is true is for what purpose? To get you to what? Believe me. If I can get you to believe me, you're going to put your guard down and I'll be able to sucker you. I say things like this. I swear on the grave of my sainted mother. You can trust me. Cross my heart and hope to die, stick a needle in my eye. You can trust me. In the court of law, we say this. I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So help me God. All my life, I grew up hearing that we weren't supposed to take the Lord's name in vain. Now, my impression of that and what I taught was that you're not supposed to use God's name in a vain way or in a way that was blasphemous. That's true. That's true. Don't do that. That's not what it means to take the Lord's name in vain, though, biblically. biblically what it means to take the Lord's name in vain is to take God's name attach it to a promise lie later and what you did was you use God's name to give power to your lie and you took God's name and use it in vain that's what it means and that's more serious than lousy language don't bring God's name in fact Matthew 5 says something that it's like this weird passage that not many people know there. I didn't even know this until I kind of came through Matthew with this. It says this. Again, verse 33 of Matthew 5. Again, you've heard the ancients were told, you shall not make false vows, but shall fulfill your vows to the Lord. Here's what I'm saying. Jesus is speaking here. I'm saying this. Don't make a vow at all. Don't make vows at all. Either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by earth. I swear by earth. I swear by heaven. Don't do that. This is great. for it is the foot so of the sea or by Jerusalem. I swear by Jerusalem. Don't do that. Nor shall you make an oath by your head. I swear by my head, on my head, by the sainted mother, whatever. For you cannot make one hair white or black. And I don't understand that. Here's what he gets down to. He says, here, don't make all those vows. Don't swear about nothing. Verse 37. Let your statement be yes, yes, and no, no, and anything beyond that is of evil. Talk straight. I love that. Don't you love to hear Jesus talk like that? Talk straight. Just say yes or no and let your yes be yes and let your no be no. Don't do this. I swear. All of that is evil because what you're really trying to do is pull them in to get them to believe you. I swear to God, use God's name now to get them to believe you and now you can just defraud them like crazy. Just say yes, mean yes. Talk straight. A mark of a false system is you'll never get a straight answer. I mean, sometimes it's real subtle. You won't even be able to prove it. You'll feel something in your spirit. I just feel like I never get a straight answer. You're probably not getting one. I kind of considered this, asked myself a question. Why would people lie? Why would people on one hand say, oh, sure, I'll do that. I promise. I swear to God. I swear by the gold. I swear by... Why would they do that? And what happened, and this thought dawned on me, I think because we were just going verse by verse, and so I was kind of saturated with this whole dynamic here. I think lying is an inevitable result of these characteristics. Let me explain that. It's what grows out of this soil. Let's just pick wearing religion. Remember, broadening your phylacteries, lengthening your tassels, looking good. If my whole existence is dependent on looking good, you know what that means? I can never say anything that might cause any tension. I can never say anything that might make you upset with me. I've always, you come to me, will you? Yes, I will. Do you agree? Yes, I agree. You know, I'll end up agreeing when I don't agree. I'll make promises I don't have any intention to keep. Because right there, it'll feel good if we just say yes. Because I've got to look good. I've got to be appearing magnanimous, even if I'm not. So this kind of stuff just breeds lying. I'll always be saying the right thing. Why? Because it's got to look good. I won't say the real thing. Because the real thing looks yucky sometimes. The real thing might get me in trouble. Real thing means we might have some tension in our relationship. We might end up having a relationship, but there might be some tension in it. So I'm always going to say what's right, not what's real, what's expedient, what kind of gets me off the hook at the moment, what sounds good. I will never disagree. Even if I do disagree, I will never admit I'm wrong. Even if I am wrong, I will never say I'm sorry. Forgive me. And I'll end up, what I said a couple weeks ago, defending things that even I think are stupid. And by the way, while we get real big about this, all of us have done that, myself included. But to the degree that these things are pumping through us, where we need to look good, we're going to end up lying. We're going to lie just to make the thing feel good right now. And truthfully, if I'm at a moment where for some reason my value isn't coming from Jesus, it's coming from what you think, yeah, I will never, you know, there will never be, I'm going to lie to deceive, but I will lie, and so will you. It's incredible how much of this comes out of even the basic issues of where we get our value. What makes us okay? Is what makes me okay that you like everything I do? If it is, I'm going to do everything I can to do everything you want me to, but I'm also even going to agree with things I don't. That's a lie, see? And you'll never know where I stand, because I can't ever just tell you the truth where I stand. Now, we've all heard Double Talk, and we've all done it. We've all done it. So let's let that in, that we've all done it, and we've all heard it. And at best, double talk is a major irritation and a frustration because we just can't get anywhere. You know, you just don't... I know you've had confrontations where you brought a confrontation and when you're done, you just feel like, I did, but it's not resolved. Nobody owned anything. Okay, well, there's nowhere to go. So it's frustrating. It's that piece of mercury you can't ever pick up. But sometimes it's more serious than frustrating. It's far more serious than frustrating. Let's just let some be frustrating and not make them worse than they are. but we also need to embrace that some lying is far more serious than frustrating because some lying destroys people. Let me explain. The reason the lying took place here in this text is to gain people's trust. And when I gain your trust, you relax. And if you relax, I can get you to do anything I want you to, and I can get anything I want from you. And you'll even do it because you love me and trust me because I promised, or you promised, and that's how you get something from someone else. and slowly and silently we can suck the life right out of people. And that just becomes another impact and another way to devour people with these kinds of systems. They don't talk straight. I think this is the last one we're going to have time for today. Very important one. And that is this, that in systems like this, spiritual values get inverted. An upside down understanding of what matters and what doesn't. Let's look at the text to pick this up. Verse 23 and 24. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you tithe mint and dill and cumin, but you neglect the weightier matters of the law. See the upside-down piece? You neglect weighty things, you get all upset with seeds like dill and mint and cumin. Those are little seeds. Justice, mercy, and faithfulness, things that matter, you let that stuff slide. You tithe your dill, mint, and cumin. But these are things you should have done without neglecting the others. Then he gives an illustration. You blind guides who strain at gnats and swallow camels. What that's speaking of is simply this. In systems like this, insignificant things become significant. It's one of the ways to spot a false system. Don't wonder if you see it. When you see inverted values, know what kind of system you're in. Truly significant things become insignificant. Irrelevant things become paramount. And trivial things become vital. This illustration of verse 24 is very graphic. Both a camel for a Jew and a gnat or an insect, a little tiny insect, were ceremonially unclean. So they couldn't ingest either one. Now, the thing about a camel is it's hard to swallow a camel and not notice. A gnat, however, you know, a gnat, you can be walking down the road and you just suck one in and you're unclean now. You know, you didn't even know. Well, what he's confronting here is that they were very fastidious about gnats and didn't bother swallowing camels at all. They'd swallow camels left and right. And that was the illustration of tithing, dilimant, and cumin, but mercy, faithfulness, and justice. Ha! Who cares? Literally, this straining at gnats is something that they did. In Palestine at that time, you can imagine refrigeration techniques, not so good. Sanitary techniques, not quite up to snuff. The way they would make their wine, which they drank extensively, would be in presses that were exposed to the air. Do you think any bugs got in there? And they would get mashed and smashed, and it would just kind of add it to the overall humveance. Well, okay, so you've got bugs in there, whether you know there's bugs in there or not, and so your ceremony and your land clean, I don't care what you're doing, and they would filter their wine and filter and filter and filter, but even in the mashing process, they would get bugs in there. But what they would do, well, finally when they drank it, they would sip their wine through their teeth, like, and then they would pick the nets out of their teeth. Question, you ever seen that? I remember as a kid, growing up in the church, being around people who never had wine touch their lips, never played cards, they never danced. I remember in eighth grade, I took this incredible stand for God in my school that I didn't square dance. And, you know, talk about sincerity. I was really sincere. I was doing this for God. I really believe that. But it was part of a neat lesson for me because later on, you start putting these things together, and I noticed something, and that was that people weren't coming to me wondering about this enormous joy and peace and you know i had because they didn't square dance you know there was this come you know i figured there would just be this compelling thing that people would draw on to me because i took the stand about square dancing and it never happened that that you know those kinds of things send you on your quest for truth you know what's wrong with this picture okay we you know they wouldn't have wine touch their lips play cards they wouldn't dance they wouldn't go to movies and they wouldn't smoke but i remember the church i remember what It felt like bitterness, anger, malicious gossip. That was okay. I mean, nobody said that. There were sermons against that, but that was what we had. So we were able to swallow enormous sin, camels like hypocrisy, greed, dishonesty, cruelty to people, gossip and bitterness, and carefully, so carefully sift out things like bowling. We get the bowling out of here and we'll be fine. laughing in church has got to go you know get that mat out of their teeth the length of your hair hallelujah they cut their hair chewing gum happened every christmas in our church her name was eleanor she was our church organist she was wound real tight she was a dear lady but she took herself real serious, playing the organ. Every Christmas, she played the bells. Now, we're talking cowbells, and the incongruity of the picture is that this is a very, this lady who played these cowbells was like high church type. You know what I mean? She played Bach. You know, it was all very horrible, and now she's playing cowbells, but her demeanor is still very silent. This scene of Eleanor playing cowbells on Christmas, every Christmas, to my brother and I was the funniest thing we had ever seen in our life. You know, you've got to be a 10-year-old boy here for a minute, and everybody else is going, oh, that's good, and we're going, and we're going, progressing through every year. I mean, I'm talking through college. My brother and I would come home from college at Christmas break, Look forward like crazy to L's, we call them L's Bell. It was just hysterical. And college, you know, mature guys, and we know how to control ourselves. We would just take everything we had to not absolutely disrupt the whole service. With laughter, and as we were little kids, and we would start to laugh and get a little giggly, noticing how that looked. My mother used to pinch us and draw blood. I mean, she would, don't laugh! The story I want to tell, the application, isn't even about Eleanor. She was harmless. us she really was the little bells were just this little piece of church life that i look back on fondly what i remember it was this one year somewhere around my 10th year after the service there was a lady who sat in front of us and she wasn't in this church very long but i do remember her very well and she sat in the same few all the time and in this particular service she was right in front of us and at the end of the service she turned around and with a face that i can only describe as the wicked witch of the west she probably didn't have that but i remember it that way she looked at my brother and i and said are you saved i was scared to death i was absolutely petrified because i was 10 years old i knew it was because we're laughing and and what what seemed to me to be the message from this very godly woman you know again one of the reasons i even say some of you know the perception of godliness at the time was the pharisees well this was my perception of godliness right here it wasn't for my parents who gave me another picture this was it right here This is godly, and what can put your salvation up for grabs right now is whether you laugh at L's bells or not. That could put the whole thing up for grabs. I hope this isn't irreverent. Have you ever laughed in church? See, I think if Jesus was watching that, I think he'd have laughed too. I do. I tell you, when he was 10 years old, he would have laughed anyway. Later on, maybe he would have gotten more mature, but he would have thought that was a stitch too. And that may be the part that's irreverent, but that helps me. Here's the inverted values piece of this. How come it's okay, and it's not okay, but just kind of play with this. How come it's okay for that lady to stand up and do that number on a 10- and a 7-year-old boy? That was my brother's 7. How come it's okay to be sour and dried up and swallow that kind of camel and at the same time strain at the gnat of childish laughter? You know what? Our laughter was inappropriate. And we got talked to and it didn't help. but it was inappropriate and it was disrespectful and all that stuff, and that needs to be dealt with. But inverted values is when we swallow camels, like mean-spiritedness and childish laughter is the big thing. She was the big one on that day. That's kind of a funny one, I think. There are some that are far more serious than that. I remember when I first taught this course, not the course, it was a sermon, just a sermon, And the concept of inverted values, swallowing camels, straining gnats, was coming clear. I understood what it was. And we have our staff meeting on Wednesdays. And normally on Wednesdays, I don't know where my sermon's going yet. It's just this pile of stuff. But by this Wednesday, I had a handle on this concept. And I remember sharing with the staff what it meant to invert values in straining gnats, swallowing camels. I said, have any of you seen this before? Give me some examples. It was incredible. This is just at the staff, like 10 people in the room. And they started sharing. Bam, bam, bam. band. Can you think of any? I mean, I got some here I'll share with you just to illustrate it, but while I was talking, did you think of any? I'll hear them. Let me give you one, and then I'll ask you again. This was from Dan, who went to a Christian college. He had a music professor. I don't know what capacity he was, and I think at the time this person was the head of the music department. And one of the things that he did was he consistently and constantly decried the evils of contemporary Christian music. Talked about things like sensual vibrato. There's a certain kind of vibrato, and if you use this kind of vibrato, it's evil and it's of Satan, and this kind of vibrato is the kind of vibrato God likes. Dan went on to say that he made a big thing about how you say God. It's God, God. Now, say God. Say God. I don't care how you say God, but to this guy, it was big. That was a big thing. On one hand, I look at that and I go, that's no big deal. If you don't like contemporary music, don't like it. You have a right to not like that. If you don't like certain vibratos, don't like certain vibrato's fine that's it if you want to say god say god but this guy who was real big about contemporary music sensual vibrato and saying god just right was given back rubs to students assistance that eventually turned into sexual abuse and sexual encounters and that's called inverted spiritual values that's called swallowing camels like sexual abuse and straining gnats called sensual vibrato. And don't wonder what you're in if you see that. You are in an abusive system with false spiritual leadership characteristics. Don't wonder. Another example from the staff. There was an elder board in a church that took this real firm stand on people who were going to serve communion. They had to be men, and they had to wear suit and ties. Okay, fine. Okay, let me give you this. if you have some feelings about who serves communion, that they should be men, and that they should wear suits and ties, fine, do that. And I'll even go, okay, that's fine. I'm not going to do that, but that's fine. I can respect that. And if you believe that wearing a suit and tie communicates respect and honoring the event, that's fine. I'm not going to do that, but I'll respect that. Where it becomes kind of weird in a manifestation of inverted values is this. When you begin to realize that this elder board that took a very firm verbal and public stand on who it was and how you had to be dressed to serve communion, the same elder board, when it was discovered that the pastor was sexually exploiting little boys for ten years, knew about it and covered it, what that's called is inverted spiritual values. What that's called is straying out the net of what you wear for communion and swallowing the camel of a pastor who's sexually exploiting little boys. don't wonder what kind of system you're in the very beginning of the series one of the things I said is the frightening aspect of spiritual abuse is that we're almost always shocked when it happens you know it's like I never knew and then in this text Jesus is giving us the characteristics and as we hear them it's like real clear don't wonder when you see this yeah I can remember something before I got saved. And it was a pastor that came up to me. At that point, I don't know if I would accept the Lord, but I really needed the Lord. And he met me on the road I was walking with. And he said, I can see that you're a good Christian woman. I have long hair, and I have long sleep. And when I was in the car, he was a man. But it was something that had stuck with me, you know, seeing that blonde hair and blonde hair, you know, maybe it was good. But to him, that was what communicated that you were okay. He didn't know anything about your heart. Okay. Out of the goodness of your heart, out of the goodness of their heart, your family expects the best for you or wants the best for you. But then if you don't have the best, then you're looked at as a lower form of being, and they don't even care whether or not you're happy or not. Okay, so the inverted value is they don't care about your happiness, which would matter. Right, okay. The college youth director, I mean, he sat down and talked, he sat down and said, I have some concerns about you, Bob. And I said, yeah, what's up? He goes, well, I'm concerned about the way you walk. It shows that you're not very calm. He actually got out and demonstrated how to walk. Wow, that's a good one. Go ahead. I'm sorry, Bob. I felt really violated. Totally. One of the things I used to do a lot is I, when I was really bound out in introspection, I always looked inside, what's wrong with me? When he did that, that made me be introspective about 10,000 times more because I respected him so much. I was looking in the mirror all the time and walking through. probably places to see how I'm walking and stuff. Just totally abused me at the time. And I was like, I can't believe I actually sucked into that at the time. And I kind of laughed when he said it, but I... You got abused. I tried to walk right after that. Sure. And now I'm free up and I walk differently now, but it's not a brick like that. Yeah. You got abused. That's brutal. Did you have one? Okay. We went down for altar call and we prayed through and talked to the times we were okay. When I was about 12 years old, I learned to pretend to talk to tongues. I didn't even carry it outside the church and pretend like you couldn't quit. It wouldn't be okay if you'd have privileges. Absolutely. That's what happens in a system where how it looks is what matters. You'll learn to do the thing that sells. And for you it was speaking in tongues. For me it was going forward. I had a thing where I was the pastor's kid. I got saved a million times. We all probably did. But mine was a little more sinister than that. My dad had this thing. And my, you know, my dad went through this enormous change in his life where God broke him and grace came to our family. I think it's why I'm in the ministry. But early times, it was extremely legalistic. And what my dad would do when I was cutting up in church and he was preaching, I would be getting there goofing around with my brother or some friend, and we'd be laughing or playing with the Sunday school paper or something. And all of a sudden, I wouldn't be looking at him preaching, and he would stop. I wouldn't hear a word. and I'd go, oh no. He's looking at me. And I'd look up and his eyes would just be borne right through me. He didn't say a word. He wouldn't say a word. He would just look at me when I'd look up and he would just go on and he would go on preaching. Invariably, on those Sundays when he would do that, I'd go forward. So, that's a little off the track. It's not quite as, but that's just more about me than anything else. Yeah. When I was about 10, I was standing with my dad in the narthex just after church. You know how everybody mingles. I had this woman come up to me and said, I must have been wearing pants because she said to me, you know, you should really wear a dress or at least a skirt on Sunday. That really left me. You kind of get that feeling anyway going to church, but when somebody would actually say that to me. And the other thing is, I was, you know, I was a swing, so in college I went from Campus Christine down to Daytona. You know, I wasn't really into that stuff, but I thought, well, I'll just kind of try to use my way back into this. Well, I remember all of the group of us women were praying one night, one day in the hotel room, and I was laying on the floor. I felt way back, and there I was laying on the floor, and we were just getting ready to pray. And the waiter turned to me and she said, Juliette, you know, will you please sit up and we pray? You know, and it's like, that just really turned me off. So why can't I burn laying down? Incredible. You know, when you say those, I don't know how you feel when you say it, but it's almost like, I don't know, this is kind of a silly example. That's a great example of abuse. It's incredible when I hear it in what looks like a benign situation. Same thing with the walk. That doesn't even look all that benign. But what looks like concern and care, there's such a powerful message. The message from a spiritual authority who we respect at some degree gives us a message, and the message, even though now we look back at it and go, I'm too sophisticated to buy this. And then we even shame ourselves for having bought it, you know, like an abused child does, by the way, thinking it was my fault for letting them do it somehow. And the message is a message that all of a sudden we're interpreting as being from God. And the message from God is, He doesn't hear you pray unless you sit up. And humility is more about how you act and how you walk than what's going on in here. And both of those examples absolutely obliterate a relationship with God based on the heart. And if there's any message that we know from the Word of God, it's that the only thing that matters is the heart. And I am so sick, he said, of you honoring me, God said in Jeremiah, with your lips. You honor me with your lips, and you even sit up when you pray, but your hearts are far from me. A long time ago when I finally learned about square words, she laid down the laws to what's very acceptable, and that should be reprimanded for it, about which you do not say those words. And there still remains one word after all this time, 28-year-old, that I still cannot say when I go into your house. which unfortunately when I'm in the car sometimes they'll say it was going to cut me off so I'll say it's going to be a habit so we're in this discussion about the dysfunction in our family and I was trying to explain every family a certain element of dysfunction in our family that even though studying it and trying to find out about it in my own life to avoid it in my marriage and that word slay it out as I was saying this is so you know stupid that we do this I know what happened. It's a wonderful example of inverted values. At least in that point. I apologize. I said I was sorry. And I turned into this. The asshole was stupid. Well, what happened, too, is that the inverted value manifestation is that the big confrontation of dysfunction on the family, which is the camel, that's not the big deal. The big deal was what? That she said the word. It reminds me of Kampala's illustration. You've heard that, haven't you? Where he was speaking at some seminary, and he said there are 5 million people starving in the Sudan. I don't know if it was the Sudan. And he said, and most of you don't give a shit. And he said, and you want to know the real tragedy of that? He says, most of you are more upset that I just said shit than that five million people are starving in Sudan or wherever it is. That's what you're upset about right now. And that's inverted values. There's an incredible confrontation. That's what that reminds me of. When I grew up in a family system where everything on the outside mattered, my father was a deacon at a Baptist church. And every Sunday we'd all dress up and get everyone clip-on ties and go to church. And at church, we were such a happy family. And then when we would get home, my father, he never slept with my mother. He never would go out for dinner with the family. We had five kids. And then the minute we went back to church, it was this big show. Everybody was happy. Yep. Inverted values. How things look is what matters. Right out of the book. Yeah. I don't know how this is going to come out. My dad lived by the rule that was in one of the Walt Disney films. you can't say something like you don't say remember that and I hesitate to say this but the reason why Beth and I tried as far as we do to come here to be graced between us is that in another alliance church in order to become a member you have to sign a pledge that you don't drink the smoke and our stand was that why should it be more difficult to join this church in the head of heaven. Good. And that's a view that shuts the door. Yep. Yep. Good. Glad you shared that. So when Dan and I got married, boom, right away we had our first baby. And, of course, my parents, it meant everything in the world this baby had to be baptized. So we got the baby baptized. And we're sitting there. They have this little meal at the house afterwards. and everybody leaves, and my dad looks at Dan, and he says, well, now we'll make you a Christian. Yeah, because I wasn't baptized as a nation. Yeah. You know, we wrestled over that a long time. That kind of stuff goes well still. Yeah. This has been great, and it hasn't been particularly fun, I don't suppose, and maybe some of you are even feeling like, well, why are we even talking about this? Because if you can't say something nice, you shouldn't say anything at all. You know what? Ministers, I mean, I'll give this to you as you close. Jesus is a lot more angry about this than you are. If you're angry about this, you need to know that Jesus is a lot more angry about this stuff than you are. And if you want proof, read Matthew 23 and read Matthew 21. I think when we get angry about this and fight about this and take some stands about this, we're doing, at least in this arena, we're doing stuff he did and we're saying stuff he said. It's not the whole ministry, But it is a significant part of what he did and what he said. And we can't be quiet because it's everywhere. It could creep in here. It could creep in among us. We are all victims and we are all victimizers. We are all perpetrators. Let's pray as we close. Lord, I just again affirm and just sense in my spirit that the truth sets us free. It isn't always comfortable to be set free. Sometimes it feels like we go through a ringer when we get set free, but it does set us free. And when we get set free, we find out about your grace, and we find out about your healing power in your life, in real life, in kingdom life, and not just church life, but kingdom life, the reign of God. And Father, even as we've shared some of these stories, it becomes apparent that we even had to shut it off, the stories, because they flowed and we could go on and on, which means that in this room, these experiences are familiar to us. So, Father, we pray that your healing would be here for us. Some need it to greater degrees than others. And I pray that you would come with your healing for us. And, Father, again, as we've been affirming all through this series, that we are all victims and perpetrators at the same time. And so, Father, some of us need to come before you for forgiveness for what we've done to our kids, for what we've done to other Christians, even sincerely. And I thank you, God, that in both of those arenas there is your grace to heal and to restore. Release it among us in Jesus' name. Amen.
