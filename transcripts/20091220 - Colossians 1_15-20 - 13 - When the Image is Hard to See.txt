In Colossians chapter 1, 15th verse and following, as we studied it last week, and if you were here last week with us, you undoubtedly remember that we started singing too. As the supremacy and centrality of Christ began to come for us clearly into focus, because it's Jesus from beginning to end, And he, that is Jesus, according to Paul in Colossians 1, 15 and following, is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created, both in the heavens and on the earth, things that are visible and things that are invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things have been created by him and for him, and he is before all things. And in him all things hold together, for he is the radiance of God's glory, says the writer of the book of Hebrews, an exact representation of his nature, upholding all things by the word of his power. But in Jesus' day, when these events of the revelation of the image of God through Christ were just beginning to be revealed, to unfold, to become visible for the first time. It was very hard to see, actually, that Jesus was, in fact, the image of the invisible God because at the time, other things and other people were far more convincing and seemed to be in far more control and have far more power and have far more say as to what was actually going on in the world than a little baby being born in a manger. Indeed, the same was true in Paul's day. And for the Colossians, to whom he was writing about Jesus being the image of God, because the image most prominent, quite frankly, in the cities and streets surrounding Colossae wasn't Jesus. It was Caesar. Indeed, the actual, physical, visible image of Caesar and other symbols of Roman rule were literally everywhere in Colossae, in the marketplace. It was everywhere you looked. It was on coins with the face of Caesar being there in the gymnasiums at gladiator events on jewelry and goblets and lamps and paintings, which means, among other things, at least according to a couple of authors who wrote a book that Steve and I are both using as we go through Colossians called Colossians Remix, both of them say that in a world dominated by images of Caesar. Even the word image used by Paul is significant. In a world dominated by images of Caesar, who is taken to be the son of God, they say, a world in which the emperor's preeminence over all things is not only assumed but imposed, sometimes through the capital punishment of crucifixion. This song or poem of Paul's in Colossians 1.15 would be seen and heard at the time as more than a euphoric expression of religious fervor, but as, in fact, subversive, and could be seen, actually, as treasonous, because these words of Paul leave little doubt as to who Paul believes is the sovereign in creation, who Paul believes holds the cosmos together, has reconciled all things to himself, and is the spitting image of this otherwise invisible God, And it isn't Caesar, says Paul. But if you lived in Colossae, if you actually lived there in Paul's day, it sure looked like it was Caesar. Because Caesar was in control. And he was the one who had the power and had the kingdom and seemed to have the kind of kingdom that would be forever and ever. And if you lived in Bethlehem in Jesus' day, particularly the day that Jesus was born, it sure looked like Caesar was the image of the invisible God because Caesar was in control. And he was really big and really scary. His name was Augustus Caesar, actually. And among all of the Caesars who ruled in Rome at one time or another, and there were many Caesars, you kind of know that, there was Julius Caesar and then there was other Caesars, But Augustus Caesar was seen by most historians as being the greatest of them all. Having accomplished what no other Caesar was able to do, he actually managed to bring all of the Roman Empire under himself. So he literally was, in the scheme of things, one sovereign ruler. And no other Caesar had been able to bring this kind of unity to the Roman Empire. His kingdom actually stretched north all the way to England, south to Africa, east to Asia. He literally ruled, it could be said of him, the entire then known world. He ruled the nations. He literally did. He ruled the rulers of nations. He was the king of every king. He was the lord of every lord and of his kingdom. There shall be no end was the obvious assumption of everything you could see. Kind of too big to fail was his kingdom. At the height of his power, Caesar Augustus was worshipped as a god. Temples were built in his name. Prayers and sacrifices were offered in his honor. Songs were written like praise choruses that we sing today toward God and toward Christ were sung toward Augustus Caesar, calling him, and this is actually the words of a particular praise chorus for Augustus Caesar, the savior of peace who has brought a golden age to the world. May it last with increasing splendor from age to age. the same both now and forevermore. And we would say, or they would say, amen. May it be. It was under this Caesar, actually, that the phrase that we've kind of grown used to is in our study of Colossians where people were saying Caesar is Lord. It was under this Caesar that that phrase became popular and this propaganda phrase as well, that salvation is found in no other name than Augustus, For there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby you can be saved but Augustus Caesar. So long before Peter said those words of Jesus in Acts 4.12, those words were said of Augustus Caesar. But as we know, because we've studied this before here at Open Door, what Augustus Caesar meant by being saved and that through his name only you could be saved, what they meant by being saved was allowed to live. because his armies, we've talked about this, would go into villages and towns and cities much like Colossae, and Colossae was one of these towns, and they would say, declare Caesar is Lord, and if you accept Caesar as Lord, you could be saved. And your village or town or city would become the center of emperor worship. And if you didn't accept Caesar as your Lord, you were either enslaved or annihilated, and the Romans had very creative and horribly painful ways of making an example of people who didn't go along with the empire program, all of which creates kind of a new kind of context for us in terms of even understanding the book of Colossians. For Paul's words in Colossians 1, where he declares Jesus, not Caesar, is Lord to be the image indeed of the invisible God. So it's not just, though it is a euphoric expression, it is not just a euphoric expression of religious and spiritual fervor and devotion. That phrase, he is the image, he is the image of the invisible God, is defiant. It is subversive. And it could get you in a whole lot of trouble because it sure looks like Caesar. Everywhere I look, it looks like Caesar is the image, the spitting image of God or a God because it's Caesar's name everywhere I look. It's Caesar's kingdom and Caesar's glory and Caesar's way and Caesar's power. It's all, you see, it's bigger than God. Now, one day, this Caesar, this Augustus Caesar, had an idea, and it was an idea that got recorded in the Gospel of Luke. And Luke chapter 2 is kind of where everybody goes, when they're going to read the Christmas story. Many of you maybe will do it, Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, around with your family, and you'll read the Christmas story. And in Luke chapter 2, verse 1, it says this, for it came about in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, the same Caesar I'm talking about, that a census would be taken and attacks would be gathered from all the inhabited earth. From all the inhabited earth. Why? Because all the inhabited earth was his kingdom. He was the king of every king of all those kingdoms. All the inhabited earth was his kingdom. And he was going to do a census and attacks that would effectively accomplish two things, both of which spoke to him being the king of all these kingdoms. The census would bring back information to him, revealing to him and everyone else how vast his kingdom really was and how widely his name had really been known. So we'll do a census, we'll count the people, and now we'll know how big my kingdom is. And the tax was imposed to provide the necessary resources to not only maintain my kingdom, but to further expand my kingdom. And so this king just speaks a word. He just, if he were on a throne, he just lifts a finger. Yeah, yeah, go over there. Just lifts a finger. And when he does, the whole inhabited earth at the time begins to scramble. Each, it says in Luke 2, verse 3, each going back to his own village. Why? Because Augustus, who is the king of all kings, just told us to move, so we're going. And T. Wright says it this way, that this man, this king, this absolute monarch, Augustus Caesar, simply lifts his little finger in Rome. and 1,500 miles away in an obscure little province, a poverty-stricken young couple begins to undertake a hazardous journey, all at the whim of a king. Pretty clear, pretty clear who's in control. But that's when it kind of gets interesting as another story begins to be told, and it's a story you could easily ignore, especially when it begins because it begins with a little baby. Who's going to notice that? But a baby, a child is born in an obscure little town that Caesar's never heard of, a town that just happens to be mentioned in an obscure and ancient Hebrew text prophecy about a coming king, but a different kind of king, Micah 5, verse 2. Doubt that Caesar ever read this prophecy, but lots of people had. Micah 5, verse 2. For out of you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, Too little, Bethlehem, are you to be even among the clans of Judah because you're so tiny and insignificant. But out of you, Bethlehem, weird place, shall come forth the one who is to be the ruler of Israel, and he will stand and feed his flock in the strength of the Lord and the majesty in the name of Yahweh his God, and he shall be great to the ends of the earth. So get the picture. As these two stories of Caesar and a little baby, something else is going on, begin at first very subtly to collide. Caesar, whose kingdom is vast, whose name is great, whose power and glory is unquestioned, speaks a word, lifts a finger on a whim, and because he does, a young man named Joseph and a young woman named Mary begin a journey, And a little baby named Jesus is born in Bethlehem, not in Nazareth, which is where Jesus would have been born, in Nazareth, because that's where he was from, if Caesar hadn't spoken a word and lifted a finger. But now, a question gets raised, and it's a question that when these things were actually happening, No one was asking this question because it was so obvious in Augustus Caesar's day that Augustus Caesar was in control. The question is this, and it's one we can only wonder about now. The question is this. What king was really at work in this story? Which kingdom is really being established from the ground up kind of and advanced? And whose will is really being done in this story? because it sure looks like Augustus gets whatever he wants, whenever he wants it, whose power, however, is really on display. See, as it turns out, we've talked about this before, the story of the world is actually the story of two kingdoms. Say it this way, two kinds of kingdoms, many kingdoms, but there's fundamentally two kinds of kingdoms, and we can see them kind of embodied in two cities. One is Rome, which we're talking about today, embodied with the power of Caesar, or illustrated in the power of Caesar. It speaks to and symbolizes a kind of kingdom and power and glory that is very real and very impressive. And we see that kind of kingdom all around us. As people are engaged in what sometimes looks like an insane scramble to promote their name, to advance their personal kingdom, to force their particular will. And sometimes all of this kingdom stuff advancement, name enhancement, is big and bold and obvious. Because sometimes this power grab stuff involves nations and wars. But sometimes it's very small and subtle and irritatingly petty, To tell you the truth involving power struggles at work, in a church, and at home, in its family gatherings. But here's the deal. Whatever the case, whether it's involving nations in wars or little family squabbles, it's not very complicated at all because it always comes down to this. My kingdom, my power, my glory, my name, my will, my way. and then there's Bethlehem which speaks to and symbolizes an entirely different kind of kingdom that on the front end looks impotent and small, insignificant, unattractive see Caesar Augustus thought that his throne in Rome was as secure as a throne could be and I suppose that from a human physical standpoint, he was right. But he was wrong. He was absolutely wrong. Indeed, one of the best commentaries that I've ever heard on this is from a book on political science theory by a learned scholar named Dr. Seuss. And the book is entitled, it's my favorite thing, the book's entitled Yertle the Turtle. I love this thing. Yertle the Turtle is a story of a little pond where there were lots of little turtles who were ruled by one king turtle named Yertle. His kingdom was massive to him. As far as his eyes could see, it was all his kingdom. But one day he thought, I wonder what's beyond what I can see. I'm king, he said, of all I see, but I don't see enough. That's the trouble with me. So he began to stack up other little turtles, because that's how you do it when you're building your kingdom. You stack up other little turtles, one on top of the other, to become his throne, upon which he could then sit or stand and see. He lifted his little finger, and the whole pond of turtles scrambled to obey, first dozens, then hundreds. And as they came and were stacked. His throne was built. He sat on it and could see for miles. I'm Yertle the turtle. Oh, marvelous me, for I am the ruler of all that I see. So his throne was as secure as a throne could be till the turtle on the bottom did a plain little thing. He burped. And the burp that he burped shook the throne of the king. So today the great Yertle, that marvelous he, is the king of the mud, because that's all he can see. Okay, child story, and really dumb one too, but the truth is this. All of us, every single one of us have a little bit of yertle the turtle in us, and we don't need a very big pond for him to show up. I go to work, and it just doesn't get any better than when it's my project being worked on, when things are being done my way, and people are doing what I want them to do, when I want them to do it. What does it mean? It means I'm in control. I'm Yertle the Turtle. It's my little kingdom. I go into my kid's room, and it just doesn't get any better than when the beds are made and the clothes are picked up. Their chores are done. When I say jump, they say how high. What does it mean? It means I'm in control. I'm Yertle the Turtle. It's my little kingdom. I come home at the end of the day. It just doesn't get any better than when my slippers are by the recliner. The paper is folded, waiting for me to read, and dinner is in the oven, ready to go. What does it mean? It means I'm in the wrong house. This is not my house. This is somebody else's pond. Truth is, every single one of us have a kingdom problem. Sometimes it's big and bold and obvious involving nations in war, and those are real scary deals. But sometimes it's small and subtle and petty involving power struggles at family gatherings, and those can be pretty scary too. But in either case, it's not very complicated because it's all about my name and my kingdom and my power and my glory and my will and my way. And some of us actually get pretty good at stacking the stones of our throne a little bit higher and a little bit higher. But inevitably, somebody or something burps. Maybe in this life or maybe in the next. And on that day, we learn about what kingdom is ultimately in control. On that day, we learn who it is that lifts a finger and who it is that speaks a word, thus turning the world upside down. We learn on that day who the king really is, and he doesn't live in Rome. It's interesting to me that according to Luke's gospel, Jesus' life was ended the way it began, by a decree from Caesar. Now, it wasn't from Caesar personally. It was from one of his lower-level bureaucrats, but it was done in Caesar's name by Caesar's soldiers to protect Caesar's interests, which clearly were his kingdom and his power, his glory, his name. All rival kings must go. So it is, from a human perspective, it looks like Caesar determined by way of decree where Jesus was born. He lifted a little finger. He spoke a little word. Mary and Joseph went to Bethlehem. And it looks like Caesar determined by way of decree where Jesus would die. Outside of Jerusalem at a place called Calvary. But was it really Caesar determining those things at the end of the day? See, the scripture record says that another king chose Bethlehem and another king chose Calvary. That in point of fact, it went down this way, according at least to Philippians chapter 2, that Jesus being in very nature God, regarded equality with God, a thing not to be grasped, but he emptied himself in order to be born in the likeness of men in a little no account town called Bethlehem. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on the cross, which is a little bit different story than Yertle the turtle who is using all sorts of turtles to build up. He gave himself away, even death on the cross. But here's another weird thing. In the story of this kind of kingdom, the death of the king, which is usually the end of the story, is not the end of the story. Because in Philippians 2, verse 9, it says this, that having been obedient to the point of death, in other words, having not built his throne on the backs of everyone else, laying down their lives for him, he laid down his life for them. God exalted him because of that. To the highest place, Philippians 2, verse 9, And gave to him the name, which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee would bow of those who are in heaven and on the earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, not Caesar, to the glory of the Father. And while that isn't true of everyone today, because every knee is not bowing today, one day God will speak the word, and God will move a finger, and time will be no more, and every knee will bow. Indeed, all humanity will bow from beginning to end, from Adam to the end. People who we know and read about today, who sit on thrones today, some of them good people, whatever their career or beliefs right now, followers of Jesus or not all will bow. Oprah will be on bended knee. So will Bill Gates and Donald Trump and Michael Jordan and Madonna and Lady Gaga, all bow. Knees that didn't do much bending in this life will bend that day. Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Caesar Augustus. Caesar Augustus, ironically, tie this into the story I've just told you. Caesar Augustus one day will wonder how he could have ever thought that his kingdom was the kingdom of which there would be no end and he will bow. King Herod, remember him? He's part of the Christmas story. We tell it every year. Who killed thousands of babies in his attempt to kill a rival King Jesus? We'll find out that death was never really much of a match for the one who really is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation and he will bow. And Pontius Pilate, who didn't really want to do anything wrong, but he was so busy trying to protect his little kingdom that he really didn't have much interest in trying to figure out what was right, he will discover that the day finally does come when you can't wash your hands and look away anymore, and he will bend the knee. Some people who went through their whole lives being bowed to will bow. Some knees will bow under duress. Some knees will bow grudgingly, resentfully, stiffly. But others, beloved, will bow to King Jesus joyfully, eagerly, gladly, easily, because they've been doing it their whole lives. Billy Graham, first person that comes to mind, I don't know why, will bow that way, eagerly, quickly. Mother Teresa will bow that way, and so will Moses and Abraham, and so will Ruth and Esther and Peter and Paul and Mary and Martha and so will you and so will I and we will say and we will sing what we've been singing and saying all along that he is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of all creation for by him all things were created both in the heavens and on the earth things visible and invisible whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities all things have been created by him and for him, and he is before all things, and in him all things hold together. For there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. For God has given to him the name, which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of the Father, let's stand and sing.
