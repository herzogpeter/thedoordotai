So, anyone have a question? Comment. Hi, Greg. Why is it that when we get... Can you give me your name so I can... My name is Mary. Mary. You can get a hundred good messages, like I love you or you're a good person or whatever, but then you get one negative one and it just seems to erase all of those positive ones. When that happens, very good question. It's not a matter of volume. It's not a matter, it's not, the volume, it may be that the volume is simply information. You get the information. You are loved, we appreciate you, yada, yada. That gets registered as information. But as long as you have a concrete, a neural net, a network of dendrites that fire on one another in a certain pattern like you saw up there that get triggered under the right situations, that will, you'll always feel the result of that neural net. And so it takes one look or one comment or whatever, and boom, now you're feeling like you're not loved again. That's because of the power of that representation. What needs to happen is for you to take the positive stuff that you receive, and even more importantly, take the truth that you have from the Word of God, that you're loved with an everlasting love, and incarnate that concretely, see it, hear it, boom, just land it in, make it a virtual reality thing, a holographic thing. You've got to transform the matrix on its own terms, and its terms are concrete. And then ask the question, why would I ever give any credibility to someone who said something different that disagreed with God? Trace that back. And what often happens is you'll find that there is a picture that under the right circumstances or a word, a voice, you are such a worthless whatever. For years I had a thing, a voice that would get activated in my head under the right conditions. That just, that you are repulsive. I got that word. You know, authority in my life had said that. And under the right situations that would be, you know, said. And the voice was said to me when I was about seven years old, and so I experienced it as a seven-year-old. So now I have to take that and I just smash it with the truth of who I am in Jesus Christ and replace it in a concrete way. So now whenever I hear a voice, I don't even hear it anymore, but I hear a word saying, you are repulsive. It's like, no, no, that just reminds me of the truth. And I'm not going to just tell myself the truth. I'm going to see it. Here's what's true. Here's what's true. I am a delight before God. Now I see Jesus delighting over me. I see it in his eyes. And maybe I see him embracing me. And boom, that's installed. And now the feelings follow. You can't see that and not be transformed by it. Good question. Yes. My name's Matt. Where are you, Matt? Right here, in the center, I guess. I'm wondering why you're convinced that there's something beyond the four pounds of noodles in our brain. Why do you think there is something that exists beyond our thoughts and feelings and how it can interact with those thoughts and feelings? Okay, very good. Two reasons. One is that I believe that the Bible is the word of God, and the Bible tells us that. For example, in Hebrews 4.12, it says that the word of God is sharper than any two-edged sword, can divide even to the point of separating soul and spirit, joints and marrow. And what the author is saying there is that our spirit is to us what marrow is to bones. Our soul, our psuche, is what joints are to bones. Joints hold us together. Marrow is what makes the bone a bone. So also, my spirit is what makes me a distinct human being. My psuche, my thoughts and emotions, is what hold me together, my personality. and such. So I believe it because of the Word of God. Plus the fact that the Bible tells us to think certain thoughts, to take captive thoughts, presupposes that we transcend our thoughts. But there's even empirical data on this. I will just highlight one book by a guy named Schwartz. He's not a Christian. He is a neuropsychologist. He wrote a book called, I believe it is Mind and the Brain. And it's a fascinating book because what he basically demonstrates there, he proves, he says he's proving the soul, but he means by that a transcendent part, something that transcends our neurons. And the way he proves it is through empirical data, working with people who have obsessive-compulsive disorder. And he shows that just by their intentionality, in fact, he's a Buddhist, and so he uses the Buddhist concept of mindfulness, being intentional about what you think, how you actually rewire the firings of the neurons just through concentration, by having a choice. Even as something as difficult as obsessive-compulsive disorder, where you think compulsive thoughts, you can curb those just through intentionality. Now it helps to have some other chemical treatments and things like that. But I think there's empirical data on that. The other thing I'd say, one more thing, and that is, if we were nothing more than the neurons firing in our brain, we could never think a true thought. Because chemical reactions on their own can't be true or false. A chemical reaction is just a chemical reaction. No matter how complex it is, it's just a chemical reaction. It's like a thunderclap or a firecracker or a burp. It just sort of happens. If all we are is reducible down to chemical reactions in our brain, then the chemical reactions in our brain can have no more truth value than a burp or a firecrack. You wouldn't say, oh, that's a true chemical explosion. It's just a chemical explosion. And yet our very discussion presupposes that we can know the truth. We can think true thoughts, which I submit to you, suggest that we can't be reducible down to the chemical firings, electromagnetic firings in our brain. Very good question, though. I probably overanswered it. I do that a lot. Yes? Hi, my name is Max. Max. And I have a question that's going back to the Matrix Reloaded. Okay. Do you think the architect was a figure of Satan? Yes. Yeah, I'm quite convinced of that. Because the Matrix is the main problem, right? This artificial intelligence is the main problem. And he's the incarnation of this artificial intelligence. So he represents Satan. I know some people have said, well, he represents God. But that would make God evil. I mean, as I'm seeing it, now maybe I'm reading in my own theology here, and some of you, you know, maybe will take issue with it, but here's my take on it. The way the movie's going, so far as I can see, is it's saying that evil wants to squash individuality and freedom. Goodness wants to recover individuality and freedom. And so this architect sees freedom as this virus, something to get rid of, a nuisance. The batteries don't work well when they have this freedom. I've got to make the equations work out. So he's trying all these different programs to make it work. But I think that's the fight between good and evil, I think. Maybe the movie will do a left turn on me and prove me wrong. That's how I read it. Good. Hi, Greg. My name is John. Hi, John. I'm fascinated by your points here. the last thing that you mentioned, this point about experience, how our experience of the love of God needs to be more than just a thought. It needs to be something that's more emotional, more tangible, more sensory. And I think about the scriptures, there was a group of Ephesian disciples that heard the gospel. When Paul met them, they didn't know about the Holy Spirit. Acts 19, yeah. Yeah. So when he baptized them and laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit fell on them in a tangible manner that allowed them to have an experience of God, and then they knew that they had the Holy Spirit. Right. Ephesians also says that the love of God is poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit. So I think that the Holy Spirit's doing something in us, to us, to program that neural net to give us more than a concept of the love of God, more than a word, but an experience that's tangible, it's real, it's heartfelt, it's emotional. It's something we can hang on to that we can return to in our imagination or our memory that gives us more than just a knowledge, but it's an experiential event. Yeah. And I'm thinking also about recent Holy Spirit manifestations, such as what occurred in Toronto, such as what occurred in a number of places all around the world since 1994, where people are becoming so enraptured with the presence of God, the Holy Spirit is coming and giving them an experience of the glory of His presence. The fullness of His love is filling their heart, and they're finding that not only now do they believe the gospel, but they feel it. They know it, and it transforms and changes their lives. I really believe, and you can comment on this, that God's doing this because the battle's getting more intense, the stakes are higher, and we need to go beyond the post-Calvinist knowledge of the gospel to the experience of God in the Holy Spirit to where we can't be shaken by what the world tells us, but we can overcome it because we have that daily presence and the power inside us. Okay, good. Let me respond to that. I totally agree with one of the shortcomings of much of evangelical theology especially, but you get it in mainline churches as well. But it's just our tendency towards the cerebral, our tendency towards the abstract, and our Christianity stays there. And it can sometimes happen that we so poo-hoo feelings and stuff that people don't expect there to be any experience of reality. Now the trouble is that that means that we surrender all feeling over to whatever is producing the most concrete images in our mind. And so what we do is we create a bifurcated population that believes all of this but experiences all of this. And on just sheer force of determination, they are involved in a Christianity that they believe to be true, But the whole world feels different to them. They feel out of place. They just don't seem to have any ring of truth to it. And that is, I think, really a shortcoming. I think you're absolutely right that God intended us to have an experiential, ongoing relationship with him, something that is to be impactful and tangible. I just don't see this theoretical Christianity being propagated very much at all in the New Testament. Now, having said that, I'll say this, that I would never encourage people to seek after the experience. there should be an experience and feeling and stuff. But if you seek after that in and of itself, you're not likely to get it. Because most, if not all, of your emotions and feelings are the result of representations in your head. And until those change, your feelings are going to continue along with the autopilot that's been programmed into your brain. This is why people can have supernatural, miraculous experiences with God, and yet two weeks later, they're pretty much the same. Not always, but often. It's because until the autopilot is addressed, the feelings that are the result of the autopilot isn't going to be addressed. What I encourage people to do, rather than seeking after, see if you seek after an experience, then sometimes people get involved in flaky stuff. They're just trying to get in kind of shallow emotionalism or whatever. What I encourage people to do is to seek after truth, bringing their brain into congruity with truth, and to really begin to concretely, vividly, imaginatively, and let the Holy Spirit just surrender to the Holy Spirit's creativity in doing this, to see and experience the truth, to know it in a concrete way, and feelings will come as a result of that. For example, there's one student I'm thinking of right now who came to me and she was asking this question, basically what I've just said here. How come it doesn't feel real to me? I never feel passionate. I feel bored with everything. You know, I believe it's true, but I don't feel anything. And what I know, my working assumption, if in fact her spirit relationship is all right, and I had every reason to think that it was, is that she is seeing something, when I say the word God, what gets triggered in her brain is not at all what gets triggered in my brain. Because if what got triggered in her brain was the same as what got triggered in my brain, she'd have the same response that I have. She is seeing a God who, if anyone saw what she saw, no one would, you wouldn't want to be passionate, you wouldn't be on board with that, you wouldn't, you know. And it turns out, as we worked with her a little bit, there was, you know, her real picture of God. She could tell you abstractly all the truth. God's loving, God's gracious, God's omnipresent, God's omni, this, omni, this, you know, whatever, whatever, whatever. But what actually was neurologically triggered when she thought about God was the picture of her dad with his hand cocked back like this. You're going to screw up again, aren't you? I'm just waiting for you to screw up. Now, how do you get joyous and feel passionate love and all of that if that's your real picture of God? I don't care about your theology. What actually happens neurologically when you think about God? And if that's what's going on. And then there's other stuff going on where it says, well, you must not really be a Christian because you're not feeling it. You must not really be a Christian because you're not passionate. Real Christians are like this. They cry during the worship service, and they run down the altar, and they get all joyous. And so she tries to do that, which is faking it, of course. She's being hypocritical. She knows she's being hypocritical. There's no congruity on the inside with any of that, but it's now a behavioral sort of thing, you see? And then she feels guilty about that. So on top of the passionlessness, now she's got guilt. This happens so much. With a person like that, I would say, you know what? Don't worry about the feeling part of it. We got to just know the truth, and the truth will set you free. Now, I really do believe there's supposed to be the experience and the in-breaking of God, and, you know, it's not all supposed to be theoretical. But as long as there are lies in our brain concretely installed on a neurological basis, it will always suppress the experience. It will always be clouded. It will never have a total transforming effect. Okay, very good comment, very good question. Anyone else have anything you want to talk about? Over here. Over here. I have two questions. Yes. My name is Jean Royalty. Jean. Jean. Have you written books other than the one that you just mentioned you are writing? Yeah. You want a mega commercial? I just wondered because I'd like to buy one of your books. But also, are you a psychologist? No. Okay. No. I thought maybe you said you're a teacher. Yes. A teacher and a writer. I'm a pastor. A pastor. We did a pastor. Okay. Then I have a question. It isn't a religious one, but I heard recently that, and I don't remember how many years it takes, but that your brain regrows. You regrow a new brain every so many years. Is that true? No. I don't know. I heard it, and I thought, I don't know about that. Regrow a new brain? Can we put it in our orders now? I don't know where. Renewed, I know, as you mentioned in the scriptures, but I was wondering it. I don't know. I've got lots of money. Actually, I'm not sure what you're referring to, but there is now, in fact, the book that I referred to earlier called The Mind and the Brain by this guy named Schwartz, who is the Buddhist who talks about, who tries to prove the spirit. There's a spirit dimension to us. He is on the cutting edge of a frontier of neuroscience that is discovering that the brain has much more what they're calling plasticity than we used to think. It is much more pliable than we used to think. Up to this point, neuroscience has worked almost exclusively with a deterministic presupposition that we can't really change the brain at all. But they're finding now that actually, even in old age, it's possible with intentionality to reformulate the brain, to reprogram the brain, to reroute how the things fire. The older you get, the harder that is. just because we get more ingrained in how we think and stuff. But there's this thing too, a new discovery, which is good news for those of us who are aging. Some of you aren't, but others of us are. And the good news is this, that there's still controversy about this, but on the whole, they're seeing that the brain, unless there's like a disease, a degenerative disease, there's no reason why the brain should lose hardly any of its power in the ordinary lifespan of a person. In fact, the average brain could outlast two or three bodies. It doesn't decay. It decays a little bit, but percentage-wise, and of course, if you're a heavy drinker and you're doing a lot of drugs, you're burning brain cells, but in the ordinary life of the brain, it doesn't decay. The reason why, the main theory out there is why people lose attentiveness and intellectual ability and agility as they grow older is not because there's an inherent decay of the brain, but because they become disinterested in reality. We get bored with life. We stop thinking. And if you don't use them, you lose them. The dendrites quit firing. We quit creating new dendrites. That's why now they're recommending, the best way to stay mentally agile into old age is to when you're 40, when you're 50, when you're 60, learn a language, pick up a new hobby, Learn a new skill. Decide to tie your shoes with your left hand. Do things differently to keep the brain stimulated. But it's just that we get bored. We stop being interested. And it tends to decay. So it's there to last for a long time. Yes. Over here. Over there. I'm Christian. I'm a Buddhist. I'm only kidding. No, that's my first name. I know it. In that case, I'm Greg. Well, I was just wondering, could you, does this go against the whole culture of victimhood? You know, with we're all products of our environment and, you know, is that kind of what you're talking about here? A little bit, a little bit. And I want to walk a careful path here because on the one hand, I don't want to go with this kind of get over it, get over it. Who sang that song? Don Henley? Yeah. So we're just kind of like, oh, grow up. Okay, we all had a bad childhood, yada, yada, yada. You know, we need to be able to sensitively and compassionately and empathetically and wisely enter into the reality of a person's situation. And to, if we're called to do this, to understand it empathetically from the inside and not to stand in judgment over it like, you know, in other words, turn into sort of a self-help thing. Like pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. Come on, try harder. You can do it. That is absolutely unhelpful. What often happens in the name of not giving in to this culture of victimhood is that we have a new form of behavioralism, where it's just like, come on, get a stiff upper lip, try harder, you can do it. Oh, come on, I'm sorry you were raped, but get over it. That doesn't help at all. On the other hand, I think it's very helpful, having entered into the reality that the person's in, to now help them see that they are representing it in a certain way, Not willingly, but so this should never come across as a blame thing, like it's your own fault that you're representing it this way. But to empower people to see that just because this has been installed in their brain doesn't mean that it has to continue to be installed and that there are things that they can do to get out of that. So to empower people. One of the things that we do in TNT, one of the most distinctive aspects of this, we don't call it counseling even, we just call it applied theology because it's really not a counseling kind of thing. instead of asking the question why are you the way you are which is sort of the traditional psychoanalytic perspective why are you the way you are we ask the question how do you do the way you are if you ask the question why are you the way you are you go on a long speculative search trying to find something or someone to blame oh my dad was this way and that can take years and it can be very expensive why are you the way you are it's not a bad question it's just not a very efficient question. It's hard to get at that. And it doesn't empower you to, you can know why you're the way you are and you're still screwed up. You know, in fact, sometimes, you know, it helps you be screwed up because now you've got someone to blame. And now you're going to live your life in the if-only zone, what I call the if-only zone, and that's a tragic way for a child of God to live. If only he hadn't done this, if only this hadn't happened. You know, the why question often brings about that result. But if you ask the question, how are you the way you are? Now, what I'm looking for here is this. How do you do the representation that is making you so depressed? How do you do the representation that's making you so addicted? Now, often, in other words, what do you see? What do you hear? Let's find the trigger. Someone looks at you this way, or you consider this. Slow the machinery down and find the trigger that puts forth the representation that's causing the feeling. And know that you're the one doing it. This is your computer, and it's your imagination, and you're seeing this. And how I got there, I don't care. How I got there doesn't matter. What matters is right now, you can do something about it. And you can take that thought captive to Jesus Christ. And you can be set free. That's taking the red pill. So, amen. So, you know, I don't want to bulldoze over the victim thing. For a person who's been a victim, it's a very strong reality. And it is sad. And you've got to acknowledge that it's sad. In fact, part of affirming their worth is to say that was terrible and to enter in with them and to go ahead and experience the horror of it. You've got to do that. And get angry and throw things, whatever you've got to do. But that can't be the stopping point. The trouble is that that is the stopping point for them. Now it's like, okay, now how can we get free of this? You don't want to keep on letting that person tell you who you are. It really helps people to see that in being the victim of your father, you keep on empowering your father. He's the Lord of this part of your brain. Do you really want to give him that authority? Especially if you're mad at him. Wouldn't you rather be free? Now you get a person who's motivated, if not for their own sake, because they just don't want to keep on giving him any more do. Okay, good. Hi, Greg. Yes. How do you... What is your name? Keith. Keith. Yeah. What would you, how would you comment on the area of lust in our culture? seeing the TV and seeing images and going through checkout counter and magazine racks and dealing with that whole issue, particularly for men. Sure. How do you address that when it comes to reprogramming your mind to view people? Okay, oh, good. I'm glad you asked that. The way that, if I can continue to be a little bit autobiographical here, the way that Al and I actually got together was because of a lot of the strategies I was using were ones that he was really discovering with neuroscience. And the main one that I was using had to do with lust and pornography. Because it turns out that it really fits this paradigm. I'm going to shorten a testimony here significantly, but I'll just tell you this. From the age of 12, maybe 11 on, I was involved in pornography. I had it anytime I wanted. It was available at my house. My dad didn't care if I saw it. I knew where stacks were. He didn't try to hide it. Hardcore stuff. I get saved when I'm 17. I got five years of this stuff in my brain. And all the church I was going to, the only thing they could tell you was, first of all, they didn't talk about this. You know, I remember bringing up the issue to my pastor, asking a question about masturbation. He went, what? He couldn't even say the word. It was so they didn't deal with this. They were too holy to even ask the question. So that's already a bad thing because now you're all alone. But what happened with me To make a long story short What got me free For two years I struggled with this thing Just addressing the behavior Like I will Out of sheer willpower Not look at this stuff I'm living in the house Where there's Penthouse And Mr. Hustler And other magazines all around And by sheer willpower A 17 year old kid Who's a hormone waiting to pop Is going to just try not to look Try not to look Now you know 80% of the guys in this room If you walk across the table And there's an open penthouse there it's going to be tough for you to not look and indulge in that. And if you're 17 and you have five years where you're used to that, it's like, and I could go a day, sometimes a couple days, one time three weeks, man. But invariably, it's... And then you go on the sin binge thing where since it's in my brain, this church says that to lust in your brain is as bad as doing it in reality. And as long as I'm going to hell anyways, might as well, you know. That's the danger of not gradation sins. You know, it's true that all sin is equal in terms of separating us from God, but in every other respect, sins are different. They have different damaging effects. And so anyways, God did this with me, showed me this picture. As long as I'm representing pornography as a good thing, positive thing, male-affirming thing, an empowering thing, as long as the picture of the pornographic nude in my brain has that quality, to it, concretely, very vividly, sometimes with sound. I'm thinking with all five senses, no one does pornography by thinking about information. If that was true, we wouldn't look at it because we'd say, this is bad for you. But see, if everything in your brain is saying, this is good, this is wonderful, well, what's going to win? Obviously, the pornographic picture. And see, part of the problem with pornography, what makes it so hard is that it is good. It is the sexuality. We're wired for that. That's a good thing. It's often a first encounter at a young age reinforced with masturbation, which really, you know, locks in a positive experience. So you got this very, very, very good thing going on in your brain. The church just comes along and says, that's bad for you. Stop it. And here's the information. Well, the information can't fight the concrete stuff. You need to change the representation. Freedom is not being able to not do something you want to do. It's good if, I don't care what you're thinking, it's good not to look at that. Do whatever you've got to take to cut off the flow. Quit polluting your brain. That's the first step in getting free from it. So that's good not to do what you want to do. But freedom is no longer wanting to do it. And the way to no longer want to do it is to change the way you think about it. See it for what it really is. What is it really? Here's what it really is. And here's the picture that I got. Picture two, lesbian girls going at it, which would be a stimulating thing for most guys, and you're gravitating towards it. The picture that I got as a kid in a penthouse or some magazine, that's positive, gravitate towards it. My man, whatever I'm thinking. But now I see how God sees it. Here's how God sees it. Those two sensuous women are surrounded by manure. See that manure. Smell that manure. The worst vile manure you've ever set eyes on or set nose on. It's all over them, and they think it's sexy. Oh, they're just like, they got this manure, excrement. And there's puke. They puke on each other. They're vomiting each other. Graphic, vivid. You can see it. Chunky, grotesque stuff. And there's pus. Pus. You know, fungus, crabs, maggots. You getting the picture here? And they think it's sexy. And then in the background, in the background, there's a little girl screaming. Because see, no sin is isolated. When you buy in, you give spiritual energy to this or money to this, you're paying tithes to the kingdom that kidnaps and rapes little girls. And now if that's your representation, you know what? I'm not so turned on anymore. You see? It's like, and see, am I just brainwashing myself? Yes, in a sense I am. But I'm brainwashing it according to truth because that's what it really is. The lie is that that's a positive thing. The lie is that that's good. That that's a, your identity, your masculinity, that's there. That's a lie. But as long as you believe in a lie, you're going to be gravitating towards it. And you'll have limited success probably in resisting it. But if you become disciplined, take that thought captive to Jesus Christ, not just informationally but concretely, incarnate the junk, make it as vile as possible. Now you're empowered to say, I don't need that. I'm better than that. That's manure stuff. I'm a king's kid. And maybe you want to surround it with another representation about you before Jesus Christ and him delighting in you and who you really are. And now when I go to, see that stuff, those neural nets run so deep and the triggers are still there. When I go to an airport, I always know where the magazine rack is. The guys are always hovering over there. And if I need to, if I need to, and you got to catch it right off that, if I need to, I will just superimpose that picture. I was in London last year and they're more pornographic than we are. I was shopping in this card store with my wife. I look up and there is a pornographic magazine with a woman right in my face. There's a charge that happens in you. That's a natural thing. You see that? Now is the point of decision. Am I going to give in to that or am I going to see it for what it really is? Do I want to go along with the Matrix? Do I want to be a frog that's just sticking out his tongue for a fly? Or am I going to do truth here? And I decide to do truth. And now I superimpose all that crap. You know what? I can walk away from that. That is just, and you feel compassion for the poor suckers that are getting sucked into it. You see? Now, when it comes to appropriate sexuality, if I'm thinking about sex with my wife, none of that's there. All right? No, no, no. That's where you turn on the other mechanism, all right? But, because that's, I want to see that as positive and as good and as wonderful and as fun as I possibly can. And there are guys, maybe in this auditorium, who need to practice that as well. So you think the good sexual stuff with your partner, and maybe women as well, where you collapse pictures of sex being ugly. But for people struggling with pornography, it's all between the ears. And it's taking the red pill. You get free. Good. Hello, Greg. My name is Bill. Hi, Bill. And it's going to be tough to follow that answer, but I know that you can get truth and wisdom and knowledge from non-Christian sources or sources that have other stuff, the matrix and the brain and the mind book and so on. How do you discern the good stuff and reject the junk? How do you recognize and not get sucked in? Well, that's, I guess, a pretty complex question. In principle, I would just say this, that the criteria is always the word of God as you understand it. I mean, that's the basic criteria. Is this something that is consistent with the word or not? Is this an idea that is consistent or not? Now, on top of that, there's also a spiritual discernment. You can ask God for spiritual discernment and pray that he'll lead you to detect spiritual influences and involve in stuff. But in terms of the objective criteria, for me, it's just the word. Is this something that's compatible or incompatible with it? Yeah, just be on your guard. we got six more minutes okay I think this will be short I'm Bill from Open Door visitor of your church sometimes we like it appreciate it thanks for coming out let's see the response of our behavior is being a result of something deeper not that we necessarily want to put our focus on what that deeper thing is because we have to address the behaviors that aren't healthy, behaviors, habits, fears, and so forth. So sometimes those are hard to pinpoint what the triggers might be from childhood or what have you that trigger those responses. So how do we come to the point of recognizing those childhood issues or fears? Well, in general, Bill, I'd say this, that I wouldn't go searching for the childhood stuff. Like, you know, because now you're involved in abstract speculation. What happened to me in childhood that makes me addicted to this? You know, I wouldn't go there. The thing that matters is right now you are addicted, and you are a spirit being in control of your, or who should be in control of your computer, and for whatever reasons, your computer is, you know, getting you into this. and so to get free from that I would address the behavior until the behavior until the behavior is stopped you're going to keep on feeding it so like with pornography even before a person gets good at representing it wrong I would still tell them you know what you get some friends involved here get accountability thing here get off the internet if you can't take it it's not worth it collapse it and you take those concrete measures to stop the behavior otherwise you keep on reinforcing it My only point is that having addressed the behavior, don't think that you've solved the problem because the issue is more an internal one. This is good to stop the behavior, but the real solution is to be transformed by the renewing of your mind. The way to find out, I would just do this, to find out how do you do addiction? Let's say to pornography, how do you do that? Ask yourself the question. The way the brain works is really like these thoughts that we have are kind of like subliminal messages on a movie screen. You know, the lady who is afraid of bugs, at 1,000-3,000th of a second, her brain flashes before her, the experience, the neural net of being this little girl covered by bugs. The way to find those, and sometimes it takes counseling, but the way that if you're going to find it, the way to find it is by slowing it down and asking the question, what am I doing? Become a detective of your skull, a detective of your brain. what do I do in the process of looking at this? What am I seeing? What am I hearing? How do I do that? I am doing it. How am I doing that? And then to now ask the question, is this strategy that I use? If you think about it, a person who's addicted is an expert. They are an expert at doing this. You know, they manage to have a couple joints every day. You know how hard that is to pull off when you got a job? How do you manage to get dope in? You're an expert at that. A person who has got a fear, they're an expert at that. What I do when I'm trying to help them is I say, well, you teach me how to be an expert at what you're doing. If I wanted to be addicted to porn, you tell me how I would do that. Get inside the brain. But what you need to do is kind of like look at your brain. You are a spirit being. Step outside, look at it. It almost says a curious thing. How am I so good at smoking? Or how am I so good at anger? How is it that I am an expert? I always manage to find a way to feed that habit. And look at it. And I'm looking. Slow down the computer. What are you seeing? What are you hearing? What are you sensing? And then ask the Lord to say, if this is not compatible with who you are in Christ, ask the Lord to now, Holy Spirit, creatively give me a picture of what is true. What would you look like being free from that? What would you look like? What would it sound like? How would you act? What would you see? Instead of what you see now, what would you see? Like, for example, what I would see is how God sees pornography rather than how I, as a 13-year-old sex-charged kid, saw it. You see? You objectify your own brain. You have way more power over your brain than you think. And if you have power over your brain, you have power over your emotions. Think about this, for example. Here's something I've discovered. Many people's mood, the mood that you are in is often, for a certain percentage of people, higher than you suspect, is at least influenced by the song you're singing in your head. The music that's going on in your head. We do life as a musical. Not everybody, but a lot of people do. Now, we think that the song represents sort of how we feel. And that's somewhat true. But what's also true is the song is determining how you feel. And one way to pick yourself up is to find the music that makes you happy, and you control this thing here, put the soundtrack on and turn the volume way up. All right? And if there's a scene that's associated with it, play that scene. I find if I'm in the doldrums for no good reason, if I put on Tower of Power in my head, you know, I put on some Tower of Power or I put on some average white band, you know, pick up the pieces or some funky music, play that funk and me. And I turn the volume way up. And I see myself just really kind of getting into it. automatically that changes. Music is a powerful mood-setting thing. You have more control over that. Turn the world into a musical. And you're the conductor. What music do you want today? And there are all the things where I want to get reflective. I put on some Claude Debussy. Or some other kind of mellow thing. In my head. And you can control. Are you brainwashing yourself? Absolutely. And why shouldn't you? It's your brain. Got time for one more and then we'll have to call it quits. All right. Hi, Greg. I'm Casey. Casey. What about our children? Are there things that, how young can you be to start doing, you know, cognitively or whatever, can start working with this? Or maybe there's some things that we can do image-wise with our children as far as, you know, their faith walk and things like that that can kind of help at a younger age? Yes. Oh, I see, With kids, and this is a whole area that needs to be developed. We need people to develop this. Because this is a potential. Kids, they haven't yet learned that imagination, that it's just your imagination, that imagination, they live in imagination. They live in concrete fantasy stuff. And that is a positive thing, not a negative thing. And so I would encourage, it's very simple. Instead of just telling your kids true stuff, help them play in it. Play in it. And it's really like, let's pretend. Let's pretend like Jesus is in the room, because that's what we'd call. Whenever you are thinking a new thought, it feels like you're pretending. Like if I picture, some people say, if I picture Jesus in front of me, and he's got these beautiful eyes, and he's looking at me, and he's saying, I love you, It feels like I'm pretending. Well, the reason it feels like you're pretending is because you're not used to it. Anything you do that's new is going to feel like pretend. You're just so convinced that Jesus is not like that. Neurologically, you're convinced he's not like that. It's the cognitive dissonance between the new neuron and the old neuron that causes the pretend. So I say, well, pretend like it was true. What if this was true? What would Jesus look like? Let's just pretend. Well, kids, they're always pretending. So I would tell them to, like, picture Jesus. Talk to Jesus. and just, you know, kind of just let that play itself out. About how much he loves you. Can you just picture Jesus holding you and, you know, saying I love you? And they did a naughty, it's like, well, let's just climb up on Jesus' lap. I mean, just keep on making it concrete. Now, they're probably doing that anyways, you know, to a certain degree. They haven't learned not to do that. But we can just be intentional at directing them in that creativity and making the stuff of God very concrete. On the other hand, collapsing stuff that's not true, bad stuff that they have. They just collapse it. That's not a true thing. And so you're in their own way that's appropriate to them, taking every thought captive to Christ. Well, anyway, hey, listen, thanks for coming out. I really respect a church and a body and a people that are willing to take the arts seriously and to explore the theological significance of something like the Matrix. Let me just close in prayer. Father, I pray in Jesus' name that you would help us take the red pill and be set free. We are just sick and tired of the enemy jerking us around neurologically by lies that have made our stepmother or our mischievous brother or some random event Lord of our life rather than you. We pray that you, Holy Spirit, would be reminding us at all times that we do not need to be defined from the outside in and the bottom up, but Lord, that you want to define us from the top down and then we define our brains from the inside out, Lord. God, help us to do that. We want to be disciples first and foremost of the mind. Lord, disciples of you who take every thought captive to Jesus Christ, help us to do it. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you guys. Thanks for coming. Thank you. Thank you.
