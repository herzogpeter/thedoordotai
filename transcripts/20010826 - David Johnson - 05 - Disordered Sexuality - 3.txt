Let's pray as we go to the Word. Father, I pray that by the power of Your Spirit, once again in this third service, You would breathe life into this Word so that arenas of our lives that are dead or dying would be brought to life. I pray it in Your name. Amen. As most of you know, if you've been with us this summer, we've been using the first three chapters of the book of Joshua. as a biblical picture or paradigm of where we believe we are in our journey of faith as a church. For much like the people of Israel on the shores of the Jordan River about to enter the promised land, we see ourselves like them, as being on the threshold of and about to enter into an entirely new era of life and ministry as a church. An era that we believe will be full of incredible opportunities for success in the best possible kingdom sense of that word. But dangers as well. Very real dangers. So the word we have embraced as being for us during this time of transition and waiting. Is the same word God gave to the people of Israel in their time of transition and waiting. Before they crossed over. The word was this. Number one, prepare yourselves, chapter 1, verse 11, and consecrate yourselves, chapter 3, verse 5. In other words, examine yourselves, church, in three vitally important arenas of life that we have identified as being money, sex, and power. The question is, why did we identify those three? Well, it's because, as most of you know, when the spies went out to view the land in Joshua 2, verse 1, they came back with this report, that the God these people serve in the land to which we are going is the God called Baal. And the worship of Baal is marked primarily by a disordered relationship with those three things, money, sex, and power. Therefore, prepare yourselves, consecrate, and examine yourselves. Well, the first area that we have chosen to examine of those three is the area of sexuality, and in particular, the lies we have come to believe about sexuality that cause us great pain and contribute greatly to a disordered relationship with and experience of our sexuality. The lie we dealt with last week was this, that sex is a biological urge over which I have no control. Now, the lie of that statement I indicated last week is not that sex is a biological urge. That is a true thing. Sex is a biological urge. The lie we tried to confront was this, believing that because sex is a biological urge, I can't be expected to exercise control. Because sex is a biological urge, I'm not responsible. It's not my fault. God made me this way. It's biological. That, I believe, is a lie. And I believe it is a lie perpetrated in our culture more and more. The people in general, and men in particular, are biologically incapable of things like chastity or fidelity. It just isn't natural, says the culture in which we live. Unless you think I'm overstating that as being a strongly embraced and widely promoted belief in our culture, consider this. Early this last Thursday morning in my office, I was downstairs in my office studying when my wife called downstairs and said, Dave, turn on channel 11. Well, I did and immediately heard Matt Lauer on the Today Show Thursday morning interviewing a couple. They were an elderly couple, looked like somebody's grandma and grandpa, nice people I'm sure, who had just co-authored a book entitled, interestingly, The Monogamy Myth. Well, that got my attention. Obviously, had gotten Bonnie, she called me, I looked. The premise of the book, as they explained it, was built, interestingly, entirely on the lie I had exposed, or thought I had exposed, just a few days earlier in this pulpit. Their premise was this, that sex is a biological urge over which we have no control. To prove their point, they made reference to, among other things, the animal world. The animal kingdom is driven biologically by sex, and so are you. That was the implication they were making. And they were pointing out that animals aren't monogamous. And the reason they're not monogamous, it's because it's biological. And the reason monogamy among people is a myth is because it's biological. In fact, they went on to point out, to kind of press their issue, that even some animals that we thought were monogamous aren't. Like geese. This is very troubling to me. See, geese do indeed, and they admit it. Geese, there are animals in the animal kingdom that we kind of get maybe romantic about, but geese have always been known, at least, well, always, but kind of known for mating for life. And these two authors said, yes, they do mate for life, but according to their research, they fool around. Turns out Mrs. Goose is the problem. Slipping off in the grass in the middle of the night for midnight rendezvous with Garfield Goose. and you may laugh you know but but this is it was all very disillusioning to me because we have geese in our backyard i'm not kidding and i've had this wonderful view of them every spring three sets of geese we have a pond in our backyard every single spring these three sets of geese all married i thought they We're Christians. Come back to our pan and they have their goslings. I think they've had some problems with their raising of these little things. But basically we've kind of seen them as a model of wonderful parenting and things. I think where they lose control is when they bring their geese onto my lawn and they poop all over it. I've had some trouble with that. But I'm now coming to discover they're loose in other ways. that was worth it this is true this is true this this these two authors were going on to talk about how these goslings are fathered actually by other geese now you see the mother and the father and you see him every year but actually those geese are probably fathered by other geese so the goslings are growing up not knowing for sure who their real father is. It's a scandal threatening to unravel the very fabric of goose culture and family structure as we know it. But the good news, according to these authors, is that at least this goose behavior helps us understand our own behavior. See, we're like them. Into which I want to say, no, we're not. For obvious reasons. But chief among them is this, The geese in my backyard do not possess a soul. The geese in my backyard were not created in the image of God, which means it might not be the best idea on the planet to take our clues from what rightly ordered sexuality looks like from animals, particularly the geese in my backyard. See, what our culture either fails to see or refuses to see because their eyes have been darkened, professing to be wise, they have in fact become fools, is that unlike the geese in my backyard, you and I possess a soul. You and I are more than biological entities. We are spiritual creations made in the very image of God, which means, among other things, this, that when you and I, human beings, express our sexuality in a physical way, it's not at all like the geese in my backyard. Much more is involved. Much more is at stake. Something beyond the physical is involved. Our sexuality, when physically expressed, touches our spirit. It involves our soul, which once again explains why things like adultery are so hurtful. Premarital sex is so inappropriate. Things like rape and incest are so horrific because more is involved than skin to skin. something deeper and far more profound than a body part is being touched when a body part is being touched, which, by the way, also explains the other end of the spectrum. It also explains why it is that rightly ordered sex can be amazingly exhilarating and wonderfully fulfilling. Why? Because more is involved than skin to skin, because something far deeper and more profound is being touched than a body part. When a body part is being touched, your souls are connecting, your spirits are mingling. When we're dealing with rightly ordered sex, I'm here to tell you that it's better than you thought, precisely because more is involved than a physical expression. Now, we're going to get to rightly ordered sex in a couple of weeks. Today, I want to sit a little bit longer on a question I touched on last week that may be closer to home than most of us would like to think. The question was this, Dave, what about when the reality for me around my sexuality seems to be that sex really is a biological urge over which I have no control and I don't know how to stop? What about when your knowing the behavior is wrong and hating the behavior doesn't keep you from doing the behavior? What about when hating yourself and promising never to do it again doesn't keep you from doing it again? What about when throwing away your pornography or because of great waves of shame, you click off that website you found of a sexual nature? doesn't keep you from in a day or two or a week or two going out and buying more pornography or logging back onto that website? Is there any hope for a person like you? And are you in this struggle alone? In other words, are you the only person on the planet? Are you the only person in this church who struggles to this degree, not just with sexual things, but with anything. Well, to answer that question about whether you're alone and you're the only one in the planet or the only one in the church who might struggle to this level with anything, I want to read to you a letter that I read this week from a man whose name, if I said it, you would recognize immediately. The letter was not written directly to me, but I'm going to read it that way. indeed to conceal his identity a bit, though I do have permission to read this letter. I'm going to paraphrase it, and we will call this letter One Man's Not-So-Secret Struggle. Dear Dave, I'm battling with some things right now, and I think I need some help. Without getting too specific, here is my struggle. Behaviors I find myself doing, I do not understand. I fight with the fact that sometimes the things I really want to do in my heart, I don't do. Worse than that, sometimes I actually find myself doing things that in truth I hate. Did you hear that, Dave? I can't believe I actually said that. It sounds crazy, doesn't it? Would anybody believe that? Schizophrenic is what it sounds like. But the truth is this, that sometimes the good I say I want to do, I don't do. And the evil things I say I don't want to do, I do. I need a sanity check. You probably won't believe me after all of this, but the truth in my heart is that I joyfully say yes to the law of God in my heart, yet in my body I see a different law. And it's as if it wages war against my mind and heart, making me a prisoner. That's it. I feel like a prisoner, a slave to this thing. Oh, wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from this body of sin and death? Is there hope for a person like me? Now, before I tell you who wrote that letter, though many of you know, let me tell you who it wasn't. And this is very important as we prepare ourselves and even wonder as a church how we are going to respond to different kinds of people as they deal with the sin in their life. That letter was not written by a Romans chapter 1 verse 32 person. Let me tell you about a Romans chapter 1 verse 32 person. Romans chapter 1 verse 32 reveals that there are some people who do not struggle with sin. But the reason they don't struggle with sin isn't because they have broken free from it and now are living in the full-orbed reality of the grace of God and sanctification is part of their life. They are living free from the struggle of sin because they have embraced their sin. They are living free because now they love their sin, they give hearty approval to their sin, and they try to recruit other people into their sin as well, all the while calling their experience freedom. But the freedom they're experiencing is because they're not struggling anymore with sin. But know this, as is obvious, the freedom they have found is not freedom from sin. The freedom they have found is freedom to sin. They have turned themselves over to it. They have embraced it. They have redefined sin as being not sin at all, but indeed a normal thing, a natural thing, maybe even a virtuous thing. And now they give hearty approval to those who do the same. And now they preach this thing. And what they preach is this. And their pulpits are everywhere. Sometimes on the Today Show, on Thursday morning. Here's what they preach. Monogamy is a myth. It's just a biological thing. We're like the geese. Promiscuity and infidelity are natural. Pornography is art. Transvestites are funny. Strip joints are harmless. Homosexuality is viable. Pedophilia can actually be a nurturing thing, and we're going to get to that in a couple of weeks, actually, where that's still illegal in our culture, but there's a growing amount of material that is pressing into our culture that is pressing people to consider that. And bestiality, who's to say? And in the land to which we are going, beloved, and in the culture in which we live, those messages are growing louder and louder and louder. And they are being preached, as you know, in the name of freedom, tolerance, and love. By the way, just so you know, as we prepare ourselves, church, Romans 1 also indicates how it is that otherwise very intelligent people have come to believe these things about that which is sin. For long before the embracing of sin was being preached in our culture as normative and healthy, as the avenue to freedom, the Bible says that something happened long before in the minds and the hearts of these people. Chapter 1 of Romans, verse 25, here's what happened. Long time ago, there was an exchange. They exchanged the truth of God for a lie. Verse 22, for though they knew God, they did not honor him as God, but became futile in their thinking, darkened in their heart, professing to be wise, they became fools. Verse 28, and just as they made it clear that they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer in any of the dealings of their lives, God gave them what they wanted and turned them over to a depraved mind and to degrading passions. In other words, God gave them over to what they wanted. And what they wanted was to embrace sin and to in that embrace find their freedom from sin. And in their freedom from sin, they were set free from the struggle with sin because now sin's okay. Now, the obvious, at least to me, fatal flaw in this kind of thinking is this, that freedom born of embracing sin isn't freedom, it's bondage. It isn't life, it's death. The Bible says there is a way that seemeth right unto a man. It feels right, it looks right, but the end thereof is the way of death. Death is a very strong word. It's stark. It gets my attention. Now, put all this together, coming back to this letter of this person in struggle, the ironic good news for that person who wrote that letter I read just a moment ago, And for those of you who might have found yourself identifying with the helplessness, actually, of his struggle, is this. That the very fact that he was still struggling with his sin and feeling the pain of the struggle was indeed a sign of life. Here's the deal. Dead people don't feel pain. It's one of the very real benefits of death. one of the downsides of death is your death really hard time relating to this you know you don't feel any pain and that's the upside when you're dealing with anyone who's younger but if you've ever had experienced the death of an elderly person someone that you loved and was suffering badly they come to the end of their life and they die and there's a sense of relief and their suffering is over and they don't feel anything and that's the benefit and there are benefits we got to talk straight there are definite benefits to people being spiritually dead you know what they are? you don't feel anything you won't have any struggle but there's a downside you're dead see people have found and by the way when I say people like it's out there somewhere I suppose if we looked really hard we'd find them this is the spirit of the age and it is growing it is growing, it is overwhelming, sometimes it is frightening. We talked last week about how overwhelmed we are. People who have found a kind of freedom from their struggle with sin, by embracing their sin, loving and promoting the sin, aren't free, they're dead. They aren't free from sin, they are dead in sin. By the way, that is why salvation is spoken of so often in scripture as being a kind of resurrection. Men and women who go from death to what? Life. Once I was blind, now I see. Once I was numb, now I feel. And the very fact that you can feel the struggle is a sign of life for you. Back to the letter. And his alive to God struggle with sin. Most of you know who wrote it. You're familiar with Scripture enough to know that it's the Apostle Paul. And I read an excerpt, what that was. It was Romans chapter 7 with my paraphrase around that. And an obvious or appropriate question of my paraphrase would be this. Dave, are you saying that the sin Paul struggled with was sexual? I need to make it real clear. I'm not saying that. The fact is, we don't know what particular kind of sin it was he struggled with. What we do know is this. where we can put our feet is this, and find some comfort is this, that the real life, flesh and blood, Apostle Paul knew what it felt like in some arena of his life to feel out of control, to have lost his no, to have lost his ability to say yes, to have lost his ability to choose what he says in his own heart. He wanted to choose, verse 19, the good I wish to do, I do not do, I practice the very evil I hate. Does it stun you at all that as he speaks this way, the very obvious contemporary word around that dynamic is addiction? He is describing that of himself. The biblical word around that dynamic is slavery. Paul used that word himself, of himself. And right at the core of that struggle is shame. Oh, wretched man that I am, verse 24. And if your particular struggle is in the sexual arena, I've tried to make it clear that we can struggle these ways in a number of arenas, but if it's in the sexual arena, it is quite likely that your struggle not only feels shaming, it feels unspeakable. In fact, one of the interesting responses I've had to this series over these weeks is kind of people saying, thank you for talking about this, and I've never heard anybody talk about sex in church before. Which tells me, it'd be kind of a scary place to have a struggle with sex, wouldn't it? Where nobody talks about it. Which is a sin. So hidden in silence, shrouded in shame. You know how people feel? helpless and hopeless. In conditions like that where it's silence and shameful, you know what people want to do? People want to die. In fact, the pain is so acute that they might even exchange the truth of God for a lie because at least that will bring some relief. Death always does. Now, because I believe that's true, I also believe that for some of you, the things we are speaking of here today are, in fact, a matter of life and death. Because you're right in the middle of struggle right now. And in reaching out to you the way I am in this talk this morning, the first thing I want you to know, if you are struggling this way with anything, is this. The first thing I want you to know is that you are not alone. That you are not the only one. And if you believe you're the only one, it's part of what's keeping you silent. And if you believe you're the only one, you're believing a lie. for indeed a person of no less stature than the apostle Paul himself is saying in his Romans 7 disclosure about his out of control struggle with sin you're not the only one who's ever struggled with this how is he saying that? by the very fact that he wrote it he's saying that but you have to break the silence says Paul where is he saying that? in the very fact that he wrote it he's saying that and here's the hard news in all of this invitation out into the light if you don't bring out into the light what you hide in the dark then there is no hope because no one can help you we can't reach you not even the amazing grace of God can reach you David said it this way in Psalm 32 when I kept silent about my sin when I hid my iniquity, my body wasted away because I lived in silence. Okay. Just kind of let that sit and percolate for a bit in your spirit. I want to look at this for a few moments from a different direction. Just kind of come at it in an entirely different way. Contrary to popular belief, even among some Christians, sex is not a need. It is an urge. It's a desire, even a strong one, one given to us by God. It's a good thing, but it is not a need. In other words, you can live without it. In the category of need, I would put things like food, water, and air. Those are things that have a hard time functioning for very long without food, water, air. You'd die without that stuff. Sex is not in that category. Now, in addition to those physical needs we can't live without, food, water, air, I believe there are some emotional needs that we can't live without. Now, this is a little bit trickier because physically I could stay alive without certain emotional needs being met, but I cannot, and I could still be breathing, I could still be eating and going through some semblance of life. But I don't think I need to argue very long for the fact that there are people that you know in the world maybe in your church, in our families, who are emotionally, and the only word you can come up with is dead. Because there are certain needs that every human being has, and if these needs aren't met at some level, people die. They don't just want their needs. I want to identify three. Number one, I believe we need to know that we are loved. It's not a want, that's a need. If you don't know that at some level, if you can't find that in some place, you are inside, you die. Need number two. We need to know that we're valuable. And in case you think this sounds like some kind of humanistic cycle babble, hear the word of the Lord as it addresses the core needs of the human heart all through scripture. But we just land in one place, Ephesians 1, 4. Hear the word of the Lord. Before God made the world, he did something more important than making the world. He chose you to be found in him. Meaning this, he chose you first. Before he made the world, he chose you first. He called your name to himself before he made the world. You ever been chosen first? You know how that feels? Maybe you've never been chosen first. Have you ever fantasized about being chosen first? Do you ever fantasize about what that would feel like to be chosen first for anything, well, I'll tell you what you'd feel like. You'd feel like the MVP, the most valuable person. You ever been chosen last? You know what that feels like? Well, when you're chosen last, you feel like digging a hole because you feel like the least valuable person. And something inside you, when you have no sense of your own value and no one else around you does. Something inside you dies. Ephesians 1, 4 says, but God chose us in him before the foundation of the world. He chose us to be in him so we could be holy and blameless before him. In love, he called us out. Before he made the world, he called you out to be adopted as his sons and daughters through Christ, according to the kind intention of his will, to the praise and glory of his grace which he freely bestowed on us who believe we need to know that we are loved and that we are valuable and the third core need is this we need to know that we are not alone and those three core needs are are part of why i have the energy i have to preach the gospel of amazing grace because the gospel of amazing grace comes right down the pike of the three core needs that men and women have including the last that we are not alone god you mean i do mean god but I mean a community of faith who have entered in to the love of God and are shedding that love of God abroad in a community of faith that can work together to convince people and do it over and over again in word and deed that we are loved and we are valuable and we are not alone. But what if you don't know that? What if for whatever reason you do not know or do not believe that those things are true of you? Well, here's the deal about that. If you don't know that you're loved, valuable, and that you're not alone, then you have some pretty significant unmet needs. Not once, I'm talking needs. And unmet needs create things in you. Among them are these, they make you hungry, thirsty, and they make you hurt. I tapped just a little bit of that hurt when I asked you if you knew what it felt like to feel last, to be chosen last. They make you hurt. Creating in me another need. See, if I have that need, now I need to feed the hunger. And I need to find something that will quench the thirst. And I need to find something, anything that will medicate the pain. What might do that? Well, God through Christ says this. I am, beloved, the only adequate source of life, love, meaning, and value. I am the only place you're ever going to find that fully satisfying you. Indeed, I am the bread to satisfy your hunger. I am the water to satisfy your thirst. I am the healer to satisfy the woundedness of your human heart. But what if you don't believe that? Well, now there's a hard word. If you don't believe that, now you're on your own. And you're going to have to find for yourself your sense of value, and you're going to have to prove for yourself your lovability. Jeremiah 2.13 speaks to this reality when God through the prophet Jeremiah says I have, you my people have committed two sins God says. Number one you have forsaken me the fountain of living water and number two you have dug for yourselves after forsaking me as your source of water. Now you've dug for yourselves your own cisterns and your own wells, tried to get your life and your sense of value and your source of love from something you've created for yourself, the problem is all the cisterns you dig leak. And when I talk about cisterns that we carve out to try to satisfy the hunger and quench the thirst of our soul, I think you're aware of the fact that the cisterns we build for ourselves to satisfy our hungers go way beyond the issue of sexuality. For there are many, many, countless numbers of ways we abandon God as our source and find other sources that don't satisfy. But if you don't believe that he's the bread, the water, or the healer, you are then sentenced to a lifelong search for something other than God because you've decided it's not him. Now you have to find something other than God that might meet the needs of your human heart, very real, legitimate needs, needs that can only be met by God. And one of the things, among many others, that people turn to to feed their hunger, satisfy their thirst, and medicate their pain is sex. Why? Because at least in the short term, it works. Much like alcohol or drugs, sex has the power on the short term to alter your mood and medicate your pain. The problem is, much like alcohol and drugs. You take the hit of sex or drugs or alcohol, and it makes you feel better. And then when that wears off, you feel bad for having done that. And now you feel lousy. I don't know what would make me feel better. Get me out of this lousy feeling. Maybe another hit. And now, however, it takes a little more than it did last time, and you feel a little lousier, and you get tired of feeling lousy, and so you take another one. And that's the cycle I said that even throwing away the pornography, you go back and buy some more because that's at least what gives you a drink of water, even though it's making you die. In fact, a therapist friend of mine once said, quite frankly, Dave, the allure of sex as some people's drug of choice is that it's more reliable than people when it comes to relieving emotional pain. In fact, you don't even need people. You can do solo sex. So you pull out your pornography, You log on to the website. You go to the strip joint. And maybe words like this are floating in your mind as I describe a person caught in this kind of thing. Like evil, vile, dirty. Okay. Just as long as you add words like this. Hungry, thirsty, empty, starving. Patrick Carnes, secular psychiatrist, who I think is indeed a Christian. In his landmark book, Out of the Shadows, that deals with sexual addiction, has some very interesting things to say in light of what we're saying about what he identifies as the four core beliefs of people who are sexually out of control. Now, his book is written from a purely clinical perspective, having dealt with thousands and thousands of men and women whose sexuality is out of control. And in his dealings with these people, four core beliefs have emerged as being constant among people who are struggling with these things. Four core beliefs are these. Number one, I'm a bad, unworthy person. Isn't that an interesting thing? When I identified a minute ago that the two core needs of people is to know that they're loved and that they're valuable. The core belief of someone who's caught in this addictive cycle is that I'm not loved, I'm not valuable. The core belief is I'm a bad, unworthy person. And by the way, this view of self, according to Carnes, was cemented long before the addiction came. The addiction simply confirms their assessment of themselves. I guess I really am an unworthy person. Look at this disgusting addiction I have. That's proof. Second core belief is this among these people. Is that if people knew this thing about me, they would despise and reject me. Thus leading to a life of what? What would you guess? Obviously, it leads to a life of fiercely, fiercely guarded secrets, elaborate lies, defended behavior, which, beloved, is precisely why, and I say this as gently as I can, but just cannot yield on this point, it is precisely because of that, that these secrets that you may be hiding desperately need to be exposed if freedom is to ever come. But the exposure, as you can imagine, is terrifying. Especially, I mean, just imagine this, especially if one of your core beliefs is that people would despise me if they knew this thing about me. Would you be terrified to tell the truth if that was your core belief? I have therapist friends who tell me that people dealing with these things will come into their office ready to break their secrets and begin to evidence extreme physical reactions, sweating profusely, shaking uncontrollably. Why? Because they are violating every instinct they have of survival, every instinct they have to hide and conceal. And they preface everything they say with things like this. I know you're going to hate me when I tell you this. I know you're going to despise me, Lose all respect for me. And then they begin to break their silence. And then they begin to confess their sin. And then they begin to repent of their sin. And then they get a taste of the rest of Psalm 32. If they have a skillful, compassionate healer of the soul that they're revealing this to, they get a taste of the rest of Psalm 32. And the rest of the Psalm 32 is this. David began by saying, I kept silent about my sin, and when I hid my iniquity, my body wasted away. But when I brought out into the light what I was hiding in the dark, when I confessed my sin, you forgave my sin, and I got a chance to start again. All of which, beloved, speaks to the church as we talk about a time of preparation. What kind of people are we going to be as we live in this culture that is swimming in sin, that is preaching from every pulpit that's available, that the way to get free is to embrace your sin, and we oppose that. Where are we going to be? Where are we going to land? What do we need to be aware of? What will we respect? What will we value? What will we hate and despise? Will we hate to sin? Absolutely. And part of the reason we will hate to sin is because we know what sin does. It steals and kills and destroys. Well, we respect and value. How about respecting and valuing the courage that it takes to reveal the secrets, to break the silence and to repent of sin so that when men and women come to you and me saying, I've never told what I'm about to tell you to anyone, but I really struggle with and then they begin to tell you. And I want to be free and I need to repent. That when they do things like that, in this kingdom context, their stock goes up, not down. They get embraced, not despised. They get comforted, not condemned. Consistent with the second beatitude, Matthew chapter 5, when Jesus said, blessed are those who mourn. And remember, mourn doesn't mean blessed are those who walk around sad. The Greek word for mourn means to get out here, what's going on in here. Blessed are those who get out here in the light, what they've been hiding in the dark, for they're the ones who get the kingdom of God. Third core belief of people caught in this kind of cycle, whether it be sexual or anything else, of sin is this, I can't trust anyone to meet my needs, including God. You need to know these people who believe this as a core belief are often very competent. They could be successful in their work. They could have a family of their own. But in terms of how they live their life, they have a core, unspoken core belief. I am entirely on my own. And they could have gotten that message in a number of ways. I mean, the stories are told over and over again. And they've been told and experienced over and over again in this church of little kids, 5 years old, 11 years old, a little boy, a little girl who needs a mom and a dad and it's not there and whatever left with just such a hole in the heart. And the truth was they were on their own. They live a life now of virtual isolation, the kind of isolation that a community of faith, that a kingdom community of faith, when operating under the amazing grace of God, can gently but relentlessly call people out. their isolation fourth core need of these people is that sex is the greatest need they have it's the only thing you trust it's become the God you serve but if that's where you are you have a very serious problem and it's not just that you're a bad person doing bad things it's more serious than that the reason it's more serious is because the real problem you have is that if sex is your most important need, if sex is the only thing you trust, if sex has become the God you serve, the bad news is that sex has absolutely no power to satisfy your hunger. It has absolutely no power to quench your thirst and no power to heal your broken heart. Indeed, if you're using it for that purpose, you probably already know that all it really does is make you more hungry and more thirsty and more wounded. So hear the word of the Lord. Maybe in a way you've never heard it before, not because words are different, but because the Spirit of God is moving in strong ways among us. Hear the word of the Lord. Come unto me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you the kind of rest that can restore you, and I will give to you the kind of food that can satisfy you, and I will give to you the kind of water that will quench you, and I will bring to you the kind of healing that touches the deepest wounds of the human heart. But it starts with something that at least for a few moments can be terrifying. It starts when you break the silence. It starts when you reveal the sin. It starts when you bring into the light what you're hiding in the dark, to use the language of 1 John 1. And what on earth might give a man or a woman the courage to do that? Well, I'm hoping this morning that what might have the power to give you the courage to break silences that you need to break is amazing grace. Psalm 32, verse 3, When I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away. But when I acknowledged my sin and my iniquity I did not hide, you forgave my sin and cleansed my heart so I could start again, so I could live again, so I could even love again in a rightly ordered way. But you need to break the silence. Bring into the light what you hide in the dark. and there's a number of ways you can do that this morning the altar team will be here in a few moments and for some that could be incredibly intimidating I know these people to be safe kingdom people and they are here for you to come to if you need to break a silence it could be a trusted friend it could be a family member that you feel safe with it could be a therapist it could be one of the ministry groups that I would direct your attention to like I did last Sunday in the fourth page of our bulletin because these issues as they get stirred up require follow up and you can't be going through this alone so there's ministry things that you can tap into but I just would close with this today if you hear the voice of God don't harden your heart don't walk away without bringing into the light what you hide in the dark. Because in the light there is healing and health and hope and amazing grace. Let's stand and be dismissed. Father, all three services, our prayer and my prayer has been that you would just in the context of this truth being proclaimed that you would just fill this room with amazing grace because quite honestly I don't know anything that has more power to call people out of the dark or call people out or up from the dead with amazing grace I just don't believe that you can talk people into this so I pray that in this context of your grace being outpoured that people would have the courage to come and get a taste of Psalm 32 and get a taste of amazing grace and get an experience of the light and begin to come alive again in Jesus name, amen the altar team
