...presentation of Peter. As Paul continues with these words addressed basically to Peter, but also to the Christians and to the Judaizers of that Galatian church, we are Jews by nature, Paul says, and not sinners from among the Gentiles. Nevertheless, knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but through faith in or into Christ Jesus, even we have believed into Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, since by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have been found sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? May it never be. For if I rebuild what I have once destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor then. For though the law I died for, through the law, I died to the law, that I might live to God. And then a powerful verse, I have been crucified with Christ. And it's no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. The life which I now live by the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and delivered himself up for me. No, I do not nullify the grace of God. For if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ did what he did in vain. Christ died needlessly. I want to pray, but every week as we come to this point and we begin to delve into the text and I'm about to pray, I feel very much the same thing. And this morning, I kind of put my finger on it. It's a sense of desperation. It's a sense of desperation in my heart that human tongue does not have the ability to express the depth and the glory of God's grace. the Holy Spirit of God has got to communicate if anything is going to be communicated of power and glory and change in your life and mine and so again as I do every Sunday morning I covet you I covet your prayers not for me but for us that we would hear from God this morning through his word let's pray I thank you Father for how you've ministered to my heart already in a way I feel real broken just through the music. And there's one request I have that there would even be composure as I speak because my heart is full. But I pray, Father, by your Spirit for the ability to communicate the riches and the truth of your grace and your life-changing power as is being expressed in this particular text. May the frailty of human communication be overlooked, more than overlooked, overpowered by the power of your Spirit in this place through these words. In Jesus' name, amen. Our generation has been asking in one way the same question that Bill Dadd asked thousands and thousands of years ago in Job chapter 25, verse 4, when he said, and he said it with a sense of desperation because he was running out of answers. He thought he had the answer, but it wasn't as clear as it used to be. The question was simply this, how then can man be righteous before a holy God? And whether you believe in God or not, and whether you believe in Jesus Christ or not, and whether you believe in salvation and heaven and hell or not. It may be that if you don't believe in God or Christ, the ultimate question for you is not, how can a man be righteous before God? But I'll tell you this, there is a universal truth. And the universal truth for all men, whether you believe in God and Christ and salvation and heaven and hell or not, is this, that man has got a problem with guilt. Man has got a problem with a sense of shame. Man has got a problem with a sense of feeling alone, a sense of meaningless. And much of man's endeavor to live his life is a search for meaning, a search for community, a search for belonging, a search for something in my life that can quell the raging beast within me that tells me I have no value, I'm guilty. And the question for all men, whether they would be, quote, religious men or not, is this. How can I be free from that? How can I be free from a sense of shame and meaninglessness. The answers are myriad. Primitive man comes up with answers such as this, through religious rites. He possibly would stick three sticks in the ground pointing to a river, bow down every day, possibly bow down to a tree, possibly worship the sun, possibly worship clouds that pass by in the sky, possibly because his sense of guilt is so pervasive. He would sacrifice a son, sacrifice a daughter, sacrifice a mother, thinking that somehow if I appease the gods, this thing that rages in me will be appeased, will be put finally to rest. A screaming conscience moves people to do things that from our perspective look bizarre. Cultured man would never do things quite that bizarre. But I want to tell you something, cultured man, whether it be an aborigine or a university professor, they deal with the same problem and that is that same problem of guilt. We have better ways of dealing with it, that's all. More cultured, far more socially accepted. Positive thinking, self-confidence, psychoanalysis, career advancement, self-awareness. But the thing again is this, that both of those approaches shout simply this, the primitive approach and the culture approach, shout this loudly, something is wrong with me. Something is wrong with me. Fundamentally, I feel it in my soul. I'm not okay And I need somehow to be fixed And maybe if I can get a better job I'll be fixed And maybe if I can find a different wife I'll be fixed Or a different husband Or a different neighborhood Or a different church I'll be fixed Something is wrong with me I feel defective If only I could And we begin to strive And we begin to try to find those things That would fill the emptiness Inside of us And many times What we find is what people throughout the centuries have found, simply this, that no matter what you do and no matter how hard you try, it's never, never, never enough. And very often having chosen the avenue of trying to establish a righteousness of your own, having spent time and effort trying to make myself feel okay, There comes that point in that person's life, maybe after attaining a level of success in the world, in the church, and still not feeling okay with himself, he throws up his hands in the air and says simply this, it's all vanity, nothing works. And moves into a lifestyle that we would call simply this, depravity, where there is no sense of shame. The way I deal with my guilt is say nothing is wrong, everything I do is okay. And then have the gall to call that freedom, I just decide that everything I do is right. no matter what I think or no matter how promiscuous I might be, it's okay, and that is freedom. How, then, can a man be righteous before a holy God? That's the question we're going to be addressing this morning, and that is the question that this text addresses. And we're going to find that there are two answers being offered. One answer is the answer of the Judaizers, and that answer is simply this. How can a man be justified before a holy God? Simply this. Hard work. Hard work. You keep the law. You work hard at keeping the law. You follow the form. You learn the language. You go to church. You carry your Bible. You memorize the verses. You play the part and you do it well. And you work and you work and you work. And maybe then you'll be okay. I want to say something about that approach. Some of us are on that approach and don't even know it. But you know what? There are two results of that kind of approach to our righteousness before God. The first result is this, absolute fear. Never feeling okay. If I choose that particular avenue to justify myself before God, being hard work, fear is often the result. And the reason fear is the result is this, that no matter what I do, again I've said that, no matter how hard I try, it's never enough. In fact, I could look in the Word of God and see the things that are being laid at my feet to be accomplishing that would prove I'm okay, And I would do them and do them and do them, and I would constantly have the sense that nothing is really quite meshing. It would even talk about loving the Lord with all your heart and soul and mind. And I would even have this sense in my spirit that even my love for God isn't enough. I don't even love Him enough, and it's never enough. Never enough. Constantly on a treadmill of trying to do more. The second response to this approach is, ironically, exactly the opposite. In one group of people, we have them striving and trying and never feeling rest, never feeling confidence in what God has done for them. But the second response is really quite different, and that is that people end up with a false sense of security. Because of their trying and because of all these little behaviors that we have set up that we need to be performing, people end up with believing that because they grew up in church, because they don't smoke and don't chew and don't go with girls who do, and they smile a lot and they cut their hair a certain way and they know certain Bible verses, that they have surrounded themselves with certain kinds of external behaviors that convince others and convince themselves that some kind of life is going on inside of them and there is no life. And the characteristic of this person usually is a shallow commitment to Christ, is a superficial commitment to Christ that fundamentally involves nothing but externals. They go to church and they play the part. Many people call this person the easy believer. Easy believism, the biggest problem in the church. I believe that easy believism is a big problem in the church. I believe it's caused by legalism. Legalism that would focus on the external behavior rather than an internal change, the internal life of God that produces a holy behavior. and these people begin to do what paul warned about in romans chapter 10 verse 3 and not knowing about god's righteousness that which comes through faith in christ they sought to establish their own external but there's another answer to this problem and it's offered by paul and it is quite different it is found in verse 16 nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by his works by his trying but through faith in Christ Jesus. Faith in Christ Jesus. Faith in Christ Jesus. Three times he says it in that verse. We ought to get the point. And I hear echoing as I read that verse down through the ages from Acts 15.11 and ironically enough, Acts 15.11 is coming from the voice of Peter, the very person that Paul is confronting at this point. And he says this, we believe that man is saved by grace, by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ alone. And I hear also the Apostle Paul saying in Ephesians 2, 8 and 9, for by grace you've been saved through faith. And even that is not of yourself. It's not of works. Lest any man should be puffed up like the self-righteous legalist who, thinking because he does the external behavior, has somehow found merit with God. He has not. Paul became known as the Apostle of Grace. We know that. He became known for his message of freedom, he became known for his message of liberty in Jesus. And I want you to know something. Because that message was so powerful, because that message had so much potential to absolutely revolutionize people's lives, because we were no longer talking about an external piety, some sort of phony baloney on the outside. He was coming and talking about the life of God in an individual that transforms his life. I want to tell you something. When you come with a message like that, Satan's going to do everything he can to stop it and nullify that message. The primary workers we have discovered in our study in the book of Galatians to try to shut that message up were people who were called the Judaizers, who in the guise of spiritual concern attempted every place Paul went and spread his gospel of grace to come right by with a plow of legalism right behind and tear up everything Paul had done. They did it basically two ways. The first way was that they attacked his person. They said the guy's a phony. He's on an ego trip. We talked about it as being character assassination at its very best. And you know what? It worked. It worked. Paul was constantly being bombarded and constantly being hounded by these legalists who would come in after him and confuse people with a works, grace, mixed message. But they did something else to try to muddle the message. Not only did they attack his person, but they did everything they could, whether by intention or just because of who they were. They did everything they could to create misunderstanding about the message. The misunderstanding they sought to present was this. Paul, in setting people free from the law, is advocating lawlessness. Paul, in setting people free from the law, is advocating sinfulness. I want to ask you a question, the Judaizer would say as he came into the Galatian church. If you are set free from the law, if we set people free from the law, what is it that's going to be restraining their behavior? They're just going to go off and be worse than the Gentiles. This is crazy. And these Judaizers would come in with a message that sounded real good because they'd say things like this. We need to get back to the basics. We need to keep the law and try hard. And you know what? One of the ministries that the Apostle Paul had was this. He was constantly having to clarify his message. He was constantly having to go over it again and say, I don't mean that. Chapter 5, verse 13 of the book of Galatians, Paul makes that clarification. He says, for you were called to freedom, brethren. But listen, let me clarify. You don't use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh. You don't do that. That's a misunderstanding. His clarification was always this, holy living is a result of what God is doing in you. It is not a result of what you are doing for God. If God is alive in you, you're going to be living holy. Now, I say all that to say this. As we approach this text, there's more than one focus here. There's more than one thing going on, and we need to be aware of that if we're going to catch the depth of what's being taught here. Several things are happening at once. The first thing that's happening, and if you're taking notes, I want you to get this because it's important. The first thing that is happening is this. There are two questions being asked, not just one. I introduced one question already, and that was this. How is man justified before a holy God? The answer is in verse 16. By faith, not through the law. But there's another question that is here, and it isn't apparent on the surface. It is there nevertheless. It is this question. If we set people free from the law, what is going to constrain behavior? What is going to keep people living a holy life? That answer is found in verse 20. I've been crucified with Christ. It's no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. We're going to explain that later. But there's another thing going on, and this is also something we need to be aware of. First, two questions are being asked, not just one. Second, we need to remember as we go into this text that this text is still part of Paul's confrontation of Peter. To really grasp, I believe, and deal honestly with this text, we need to hang on to it in the realm of the context. It would be very easy for me to preach a sermon about the topic of justification. I am going to opt, rather, to have the structure that we use to study the text be the entire context. The context for us begins in last week's sermon, verse 11, all the way to 21. That context there is Paul's confrontation of Peter. It breaks down into two parts. Part one we had last week, and that was Peter's deviation. Peter's deviation. You remember that started in verse 11. When Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face. The confrontation was there. The clash was there. And I did it in the presence of all. We gleaned all sorts of principles from that last week. The cause of that clash was that Peter had become a hypocrite. He had listened to the ears. He had listened to the voice of the legalists and had become, in terms of his behavior, legalistic himself. And the consequences were appalling. In verse 13, following Peter's lead, the rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy with the result that even Barnabas, the pastor of the church, was carried away by their hypocrisy. Our hypocrisy has an impact on the body of Christ. But today we get to the second part. The first part of this context is Peter's deviation. The second part is Paul's doctrine. Paul does not look at Peter and say, Peter, you're wrong, and then just leave it. He says, Peter, you're wrong, and I'm going to show you why. This is what we're going to deal with today. Paul's doctrine itself breaks down into two parts, and that's what we're going to have this morning. The statement of Paul's doctrine in verse 15 and 16, and the defense of his doctrine in verses 17 through 21. Let's start with verse 15. Roman numeral 1, the statement of his doctrine. Verse 15. We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles. What does that mean? What does that mean? First of all, I want you to know that Paul is being facetious here. There's all sorts of Greek things I could go into here, and I don't want to confuse you. I just want to kind of give you the basic meaning. He is being facetious. He is setting them up. It's as if he is saying, we Jews, and he is speaking to Peter and all those Jewish Christians that were in Galatia. We are Jews by nature. We, in other words, have the law. We are not like the Gentiles who have no law. Sinners. The word sinners is almost synonymous with a Gentile. He's saying we're not like the dirty, grubby, ornery Gentiles. We are much better than that. We have had the law, and we have kept the law, and we have worked hard at keeping the law. And we have done that well. Nevertheless, again, he is setting them up for what he is going to say. Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that we are Jews, had the law, did everything we could to keep the law, not at all like those dirty, rotten Gentiles, nevertheless, I'll tell you what we Jews who had the law discovered. We discovered this, that knowing, we nevertheless, knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we, what does that mean? Even we Jews who had the law, tried like crazy to keep the law, Even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by faith, not by keeping the law. He's saying simply this. We had the law. We obeyed the law. We did it right. We are law experts. We are law experts. And do you know what the law taught us? Do you know what we learned by keeping the law? We learned this. We learned that it doesn't work to bring me into a right relationship with God. That's what I learned. In fact, what we learned was that the law's purpose in my life was to do exactly the opposite. The law was nothing that I was supposed to be pursuing to make myself righteous. The law's function in my life was to condemn me. The law's function in my life was to open my eyes to the fact that I could never keep the law. To convince me that no matter how hard I tried, it would never be enough because another law would be staring me right in the face. Soon as I thought I had the law down, soon as I thought I was obeying just the way I was supposed to, just soon as I had the discipline I thought I needed, there'd be another law there that I wasn't keeping, and it'd be time after time after time, the law would be staring me in the face, convincing me I could never make it that way. Romans 3, verses 19 and 20 says this, By the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight. Why is that? Because through the law comes the knowledge of sin, not justification. Through the law comes the knowledge of sin. Illustration. Illustrations are always faulty. Illustrations always have some place where they break down, but they help. A good way to look at the law would be to consider the law like a mirror. A mirror doesn't fix me. It just tells me what I got. You got that? I walk into the bathroom in the morning, and it's a very discouraging experience, let me tell you. It's very discouraging. I walked in there this morning, I don't walk in, I crawl in. You know, and your hair is just all over the place and your eyes are all puffy and, oh, it's just a mess. And the mirror's there and I go, fix me. It can't do it. It has no power to do that. Its job is not to do that. Its job is to tell me the condition I'm in. That's how it helps me. It tells me, David, you're a mess. You need to do something with your face. And I try like crazy and this is all I could do. There are places where that illustration breaks down, but I hope it helps a little bit. The function of the law is the law cannot fix me. The law cannot make me just before God. The law stands like a mirror in front of me, mirroring to me the fact that I need Christ because I can't keep the law. I haven't kept the law. And it's not the mirror's fault. The mirror's doing its job. The law is perfect. The law is good. Its job is to focus me right to Christ. You know, Jesus dealt with this in the Sermon on the Mount. The Jews and the Pharisees had embraced this attitude that the way to get to God was to work hard. And you know what? Their approach to the law was simply this. They had become those kinds of people who, embracing the law, kind of get an idea that they're doing pretty well. The Pharisees did. We keep the law. We know the law. We teach the law. Man, oh, man, we're really on our way. We tell other people how to do it. And Jesus was talking to these people, and he said, oh, as they were basking in their law keeping, You guys are doing well. Very, very good. Jesus looked and said things like this. You haven't killed anyone. Good for you. You haven't committed adultery. Not me, not me. You know what Jesus said? He said this, I say unto you, if you have ever lusted after a woman in your heart, you've committed adultery. If you have ever hated your brother, you have been deemed by me, by the law of God, to be a murderer. what was the point of that what was the point of that by taking the law another step by by driving it even deeper than it had been before was jesus saying so you pharisees ought to try even harder you pharisees haven't murdered anybody but sometimes you lust you ought to try even not to lust that was not the purpose the purpose was to drive them into a place where they knew they weren't keeping the law and they needed something besides their law keeping to have a right standing before God. You know what Jesus did on the Sermon on the Mount? Far from being the thing that we are supposed to live up to to have a right relationship with God, he destroyed legalism on the Sermon on the Mount. He destroyed legalism and your hard work forever as being a way for you to get to God. But I want to tell you something. The irony in this is this, that when the life of God takes his residence in a person's life, you know what happens? God alive in me begins to fulfill the Sermon on the Mount. Not by my trying, but by the life of God in me. Luke 18, verse 10 through 13, illustrates this very well. You know the story, I'm sure. It's where the Pharisee is standing in the temple, and he's going, oh, I thank God that I'm a Pharisee. I thank God that I'm doing so well. And he looked over at that publican and says, oh my, I thank God I'm not like him. And I tithe, and I go to church and I do all the right things. Oh, my goodness. You know what that Pharisee who was embracing the law and thinking, I'm a good law keeper, didn't understand? He didn't understand the first thing about the law. Because if he had, you know, if he would have really understood the purpose of the law, you know what he would have done? He wouldn't have stood there before God saying, Oh, Lord, I'm really doing well, aren't I? He would have crawled in a corner like a bug and asked for forgiveness and mercy. And you know what? that's exactly what the publican in that same text did. You see the contrast of the Pharisee who thought he was doing so well, external piety, bragging and strutting his stuff before God. And over here you see a publican who is saying simply this, God, I have seen your glory and I have seen your law and I have seen my sin. And one thing I finally see is this, my only hope is you. Galatians 4, I'm sorry, Galatians 3, 24 tells us the purpose of the law. Therefore, the law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be justified by faith. The purpose of the law is to keep convincing me that I can't go that way. I can't go that way. I had it described to me this way, that it's almost like you're in a great big room and there's all these doors. And all my self-righteousness, I open a door and I go, I'll try this good work. No, I can't go that way. No, I can't go that way. No, this one condemns me. This one condemns me. All the way down the line. It just funnels me right to Christ till I finally give up and say, my only hope is you. You know what? I don't know if there's in the entire word of God a stronger statement on the doctrine of salvation in verse 16 of Galatians 2. Three times he says, not by works of the law, but by faith in Christ. In fact, if I were to break it down, I could do it for you, and I'd like you to see it. If you're taking notes, there's three things he does here. One is a general statement, And that is when he starts, a man, a man is not justified by the works of the law. Just kind of general. Secondly, he makes it more personal. Even we, even we have realized this. And then the third statement, he says he makes it universal. Since by the works of the law shall no flesh, nobody, anywhere, anytime. Okay, folks, that's the statement. I hope it's very clear. and now he comes behind it and defends his doctrine. Again, he is talking to Peter. Verse 17 and 18. This is tough. It may not look that tough to you, but when you get into the Greek, Lightfoot, one of the commentators I was using, called this particular section a shipwreck of Greek grammar. It's real hard to deal with. Excuse me. And there are several interpretations. I'm going to give you mine and trust that it will make sense to you. Paul goes on in defending his doctrine after he's given it. But if while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have also been found sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? May it never be. Let's stop right there. The Judaizers' claim was this. If you accept a justification that is based on faith alone, you are going to end up in sinfulness. You are going to, in fact, end up as a sinner just like the Gentiles. In fact, I've got the word sinners in verse 17 and the word sinners in verse 15 underlined because they kind of connect. Paul is answering that. If you go by this justification thing, you're going to end up in sin. Paul says, if that's what you believe, fine. But listen to me, you better know what you're saying when you say that. If you're saying this, that while we are preaching justification by Christ, we were sinning? Is Christ then the minister of sin? In other words, this is a rhetorical question. If while seeking to be justified by faith and faith alone, apart from my own striving, does that lead people to sin? If that's true, then Christ is the one who orchestrates that whole thing. Is Christ a minister of sin? Would his influence in my life be more sin, may it never be. He goes on in verse 18 and says, but I'll tell you what would be sin. I'll tell you what would be sin. This would be sin. If I rebuild what I have once destroyed, then I'd prove myself a sinner. Then I'd prove myself a transgressor. After having torn down all of the props of external piety and funnel people right to Christ, realizing that that is their only hope, after having done that, then build up again the external props and giving people the opportunity to have confidence again in externals, that's what the sin would be. And Peter, that's what you stand accused of. You have gone back and begun to rebuild what has been destroyed. Confidence in your stand before God cannot be in your performance. It can only be in the grace of God. And again, I've said this so many times, but I think it bears repeating. The danger of the props, the danger of working at the law for my standing before God, is that we begin to live like the Pharisee who actually believes he's doing a good job. And what the law really needs to do in his life is demonstrate to him that he is absolutely lost. And all of his trying is worthless. Paul says, I am not going to rebuild. what was once destroyed, and there's two reasons. I am not going to be rebuilding what was once destroyed, and there's two reasons. One is because of my deepest conviction, verse 19. For through the law I died to the law that I might live to God. For through the law I died to the law. What does that mean? This concept that we're approaching here in verse 19 and 20 is so big that all I'm going to be able to do today is touch on it. I think this is so profound, I really feel we need to spend next Sunday on this as well, to really tear this apart and give you the theology, because it's, I think, one of the cardinal truths of spirit-filled living, even. But one of the things he's saying, again, just superficially, to kind of even lead us into next week, for through the law I died to the law, he is saying simply this, folks, I want you to know that the law accomplished its purpose in me. That purpose was this, that I realized that through the law, I could never make it. You remember in Philippians chapter 3? I want you to turn to it. We've read this term, we've read this many, many times. Read it again in this light. For through the law I died to the law. For through the law, the law did its purpose on me. It accomplished its work in me. That which it was supposed to do. He is giving his testimony here. Do you remember? Verse 4, although I might have confidence in the flesh, if anyone else has a mind to have confidence in the flesh, I far more. I performed well I kept the law circumcised the eighth day the nation of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin the Hebrew of Hebrews an evangelical of evangelicals as to the law a Pharisee as to zeal a persecutor of the church as to righteousness which is found in the law blameless I did it all but I want to tell you this the law did its purpose in me I realized no matter how well I did even though I did better than everyone else it wasn't enough and now here's how I think about that whatever things were gained to me then I count them as loss for the sake of Christ. More than that, more than that I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but what? Rubbish. Rubbish. The reason I'm not going to rebuild what was once destroyed is because of my deepest conviction. The law did its work in me and that was it taught me that Christ was the only way I was ever going to have a real righteousness. And when I died to the law, when I really finally realized that my working at doing it right wasn't making me any more right before God, you know what I did? I realized that in faith. I accepted the gift. And you know what happened? I not only died to the law, but I came alive to God. That person that looked so spiritual before, but wasn't, finally really was the life of God in me. that's verse 20 but there's a second reason I wanted to give you here I said there were two reasons why I'm not going to rebuild what I once destroyed one was because of my deepest conviction verse 19 and verse 21 if I rebuild what I once destroyed I nullify the grace of God and I'm not going to do that but now I want to get into verse 20 and just close with this you see the second question that was lingering I gave you this at the beginning of the sermon there were two questions. One was how is a man justified before a holy God? He's told us by faith, not by works. But the second question that was raging here and Paul was always having to confront was simply this. If you set people free that way, Paul, won't that freedom lead to lawlessness? Won't that freedom lead to sinfulness? You know, I just wonder, I don't want to read a lot of things in here, but I think when that accusation came to the Apostle Paul, it broke his heart. I really do. Because what it meant when people would make that kind of assumption and draw that kind of conclusion, it meant that they did not understand what he was saying. Won't freedom just result in lawlessness? Not a chance. Not a chance. Not if you catch verse 20. Not if you're really converted. Not if you really are a believer in Christ. If you're a pretender. If you're a pretender and you're set free, you're going to move into lawlessness. If the life of Christ is in you, you're not going to move into lawlessness. That's absurd. That's absurd. Verse 20. Paul says this, I have been crucified with Christ, and it's no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. In the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and delivered himself up for me. I was crucified with Christ. That sounds weird, doesn't it? What does he mean by that? 2,000 years ago I was crucified with Christ. It doesn't make any sense. I can help you by doing some comparative studies very quickly. Romans 6.23 You know the verse very well. Every person here probably does. For the wages of sin is what? Death. Okay. You know what it says right in the next chapter? Romans 7.1 Keep that in mind. The wages of sin the price tag of sin is death. Romans 7.1 right behind that says this. For don't you know that law the law has jurisdiction or power over you as long as you live. As long as you live, the power of the law has jurisdiction over your life. But you know what? When you die, the law no longer has that power over you. Well, how do you die? There are several ways to die. We're talking in spiritual sense here. One way to die is to die eternally. One way to die is to try to pay the debt yourself. Do your best. Try hard. Go to church. Assume that all that good, prying heart is getting you some sort of merit before God. And you're going to die physically, but you know what you're going to do? You're going to spend the rest of eternity dying. And in that you'll be free from the law, but it'll never be done. You'll never pay the debt. The other thing is you can find that death in Christ. I have been crucified with Christ. When he died, he paid the penalty for me. I believe in that. I place my trust in that, not in my working anymore. And when you die, the law has no more claim. But something wonderful happens here. He doesn't leave you dead, beloved. For I've been crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, the King James Version says, I live. When you die, the law has no more claim. If I committed six murders, okay, and the law did its work in me, the state law, what would happen is I would die. But I wouldn't die six times. I'd just die once. That's all it takes. If I die, and they only can kill me once, and they put me in the ground, and they cover me with dirt, and I rise from the dead, it's the law of tough luck. They don't have anything on me anymore. Great. You've got a good scheme. You want to try it? Murder six people, die, and then rise from the dead. It's easy. The law has no more claim on you. Guess what? In Christ, I was crucified with Christ. The old man died. nevertheless I live and this is where it's going to get important yet not I but Christ lives in me when I came to Christ if indeed and I hope you get that if indeed I really did come to Christ in belief some incredible things happened, one, I died the old man died you know what else happened that's incredible i still live the law has no claim on me anymore if indeed i really came to him something else happened too but it isn't me who lives anymore it's christ alive in me christ alive in me they're peter they're judaizers they're anyone else who doesn't understand there is your control there is your constraint do you believe do you honestly believe that one who has the life of God in them, the resurrected power of Christ in the life, could possibly live a lifestyle of sin that the result of Christ in your life would be lawlessness, sinfulness? May it never be. I'll say it different. It couldn't be. It couldn't be. Romans 6.2, Paul says this, How shall we who died to sin still live in it? And he's saying that this way, I don't get it. Those of you who say you've died to sin were crucified with Christ, risen from the dead in a spiritual sense, and Christ lives in you, and you're still living in sin constantly, acting like you don't care about that. Your commitment is shallow and superficial. You're not growing at all. No hunger and thirst for God. No hunger and thirst for righteousness. I don't get it how can you still be doing that my answer is this you can't the life of Christ in you is going to change you you died you're raised a new creature no change I don't believe it can't happen we look at those characteristics though and because our hearts would desire holy living and those who have been born of God desire holy living they do and we look at a church and we look at the people who claim to be God's people and we say the word of God says we are to hunger and thirst after righteousness and we are to grow and we are to desire these things and we see people who claim to be Christians who don't desire to grow and don't have any hunger and thirst and we go, oh man, I don't understand that. What should we do? We should lay down the law. We should totally get in shape. I will not nullify the grace of God, Paul says. I am not going to rebuild what was once destroyed even if the desire, even if my motive behind it is good. I want holy living. What are you saying? I'm saying this, that if you see consistent, absolute, total lack of growth, lack of concern, lack of commitment, I don't believe that the life of Christ is in you. I don't see how it can be. May it never be. I don't get it. Jesus said this, If you love me, you'll do what I say. He didn't say, You better do what I say. He said, If you love me, if you're really my sheep, you'll hear my voice. He doesn't say, If you're really my sheep, you better hear my voice. He says, if you're my sheep, you will. 1 John 2, 4. The one who says, I have come to know him and does not keep his commandments and does not love his brother. Real gentle here. He says he's a liar. He's a liar. The life of God is not in him. The life of God cannot live in you and not make a difference. I don't believe him. When we see that kind of thing demonstrated by people, that kind of, again, shallow, that's what I'm talking about. Shallow commitment. lawlessness, sinfulness, not caring, no hunger and thirst for righteousness. What do we do? I think we need to ask a question. This isn't always the case. Listen, beloved, I don't want to sound harsher than I really want to be. People stumble. People make mistakes. I do, you do. But I'm talking about a pattern for living and you know what I'm talking about, I think. I think when we see that in people's lives, we have to ask a deeper question. I don't think the question is. You need to be more committed. I think we need to ask another question. Is the life of Christ in you? Because if he is, you know what I know about people who have the life of Christ in them? You don't have to tell them to hunger and thirst. They do. They do. They make mistakes. They stumble and bumble. We have fights and disagree. But you know what? Every person I know, who I know has the life of God in them, hunger and thirst for righteousness. It's there. Their deepest desire is to obey, not because they think they're earning something, but because they love. They have been reborn. They have been born of a righteous seed. And something changed. And it isn't external. It's internal. I want to close with this thought. And I almost feel like I need to step out of the pulpit and to just kind of make a change here so that you hear everything I'm saying is from a pastor's heart, but much of this is dealing with the text. I need to share something from my heart. Real quick, it's like a side note. It has to do with our understanding of freedom in Christ. It even is born from the fact that Paul very often was misunderstood when he preached freedom. And I fear that as we go through this book that I could be misunderstood as well. and I want to clarify just in closing in a few moments some things that I think need to be clarified. Every once in a while someone comes up to me and they say, Dave, I just want to thank you so much for preaching the gospel of freedom. For the first time in my life I feel free. I feel liberated. And I go, oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. It's worth it. It's worth it. But then you know that same person, it could be the same person, keeps talking and then all of a sudden I start getting a twinge in my heart and I start thinking something isn't right here. because what they begin to say is it's great because now that I'm free, it's wonderful. I don't have any more, I don't really need to study the Word anymore and I don't pray anymore and I'm not committed anymore like I used to be and going to church doesn't matter and being with the body and ministering my gift doesn't matter. I'm free to do whatever I want to do and I just want to thank you. And by this time the tears are welling up in my eyes because I think you don't understand. You don't understand. Beloved, I want to say this. With all the love I can muster and yet all the confrontive power of the Holy Spirit that I can muster, I want to say this. If your freedom, if your freedom has resulted in less commitment, in less service, in less discipline, in less love, in less caring, if your freedom has resulted in less prayer and in less Bible study and in less ministry to the body of Christ here or somewhere else, I don't care if it's here or not, then I want to tell you something. If it's resulted in less, then I don't think you've been set free. Hear me. Jesus did not die and shed his precious blood and he did not break the bonds of sin so that David Johnson could be free to himself to do whatever he wanted. Jesus Christ shed his precious blood and broke the bonds of sin so that David Johnson would, for the first time in his life, be free from himself to serve and to give and to care and to love like he never did before. The result of freedom, beloved, is the laying down of your life. I urge you, therefore, brethren, present your bodies a living sacrifice to those born of God they say this you got it Thank you.
