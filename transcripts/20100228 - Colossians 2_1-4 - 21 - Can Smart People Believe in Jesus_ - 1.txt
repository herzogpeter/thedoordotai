Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Let's pray as we go to the ministry of the word. for hearts open wide for hearts that are easily accessible and tender I pray and for minds that are aware and alert and fully engaged give us capacity Father by your spirit through the word to experience your presence but also to think about truth for a spirit of wisdom and knowledge, I pray. In Jesus' name, amen. Well, if you have your Bibles, open them to the book of Colossians, where we've been for quite a while now, picking our study up in the second verse, where Paul is continuing to explain his desire, indeed his passion for the Colossians and for those who live in Laodicea, to have their hearts be encouraged. Colossians 2, verse 2, that your hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together in love, and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in the true knowledge, the true knowledge knowing of God's mystery, that is Christ himself, in whom, by the way, are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. And I say this, verse 4, in order that no one may delude you with persuasive arguments to the contrary, Because in Christ, and this is his main point, are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. The word treasure speaks to something obviously of great value, so get a picture of that in your mind. That it's hidden, that this treasure is hidden implies that you may need to search for it in order to find it. You may need to dig a bit to discover it, but it's there, says Paul. in Christ, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge to which some people might skeptically say, really, all wisdom and all knowledge and really. And the skepticism wouldn't necessarily be about Jesus himself because Jesus is actually kind of popular today. It would maybe be a little bit more about the followers of Jesus, those who say they believe in him, who are perceived by some, and I think you know this is true, who are perceived by some as being, well, not all that wise, and sometimes not all that smart, and short of calling people who believe in God and choose to follow Christ stupid, we wouldn't go that far, at least some people wouldn't. They might consider them gullible, maybe a little naive, certainly, and this is the perception of some unable, these people who believe in God and follow Jesus, a little unable for whatever reason to deal with the harsh realities of real life. So the perception of some is that people use faith, belief in God and following Jesus as a kind of escape into a world that they call belief because it makes them feel better and safer, in some cases superior, but not necessarily very bright. Okay. Past anything, we were talking about this at Message Team as it relates to this text and just some of the thoughts that were going through my mind. And Stephan told me about a blog that is on the Internet, and that's where blogs are, evidently. Who knew? And this blog was set up by a pastor here in town, a pastor in St. Paul. His name is Brad Kindle. He's a pastor of a covenant church. He's been in the ministry for about 18 years, and he was taking a course at Bethel Seminary in his PhD or something like that, going on with some of his education. And the course was in apologetics. And apologetics is a fancy word for just kind of defenses of the faith or reasons why we believe. And part of his course had this particular assignment, and it was that at some point he needed to have some meaningful conversations with people who weren't of faith. They weren't Christians. They did not believe for whatever reason. And the point was to meet with these people and simply listen. Don't try to win them over. Just create some sort of environment where you can hear their point of view and to inquire about their unbelief, about their disregard for things of faith or God or Christ, and maybe even inquire about their hostility towards some of those things. Because I think you You know, some people are not just disregarding it, they're kind of hostile towards this stuff. The problem, however, in this assignment is, number one, how does a pastor like this guy meet people like that? And number two, how do you get them to talk honestly about their stuff? Because I'm, and as soon as I read the blog describing it, unless I dialed into that, because I'm a pastor, and one of the things that happens to me often when I meet people who aren't people of faith, or I don't know if they are or not, but they find out I'm a pastor, all of a sudden they change how they talk. They quit swearing. You know, it's all this stuff is, okay. So how do I, this is the guy's dilemma. How do I get a meaningful conversation? Well, people will talk honestly in an unguarded way. So he came up with a plan that I think was ingenious. He went to a bar. At 10.30 at night, I told his wife, I got to go. The paper was actually due pretty soon. So he needed to get on this. And actually, he was going to go to think about this. And on his way to Applebee's is where he was actually going. And he was going to sit in the bar. this thought came to him, this idea, and what he did was he put up a sign in the bar at Applebee's, and the sign said this. Look at it. Free beer if you hate church. Okay. Actually, I went to church, there was a picture of beer on the screen. I don't believe it's church. This is a weird place. Well, as he tells the story, it took about five seconds for somebody to go, I hate church. Okay, and off they went. Now, as you can imagine, And this blog is full of all these people's responses. The responses were fascinating. Some of them were troubling. But the one that got my attention, and because it connected to what I'm wanting to talk about this morning, and it's why Stephan told me about the blog, because he knew what we were discussing, was from a guy who said that one of his primary problems with the church in general, and with faith in particular, was this. I feel like I kind of need to check my brain at the door when I go to church. To believe in God or to be a follower of Jesus, there's this sense I have, right or wrong, that I kind of need to put my brain in neutral, that it's all about feeling something. And he didn't say it exactly this way, but he did kind of explain that there was kind of a faith experience, a church experience in his background, and there were people in his life that he dearly loved and really respected who were people of faith. But his sense of that, having stepped back a little bit was it was all about feeling things that he couldn't get as euphoric as they were about, and it was about believing things that in his mind weren't verifiably true. So you can't think was his impression of going to church. If you go to church, you can't think. You can't wonder about stuff. You can't ask questions. What you do when you go to church, this was his impression, was you just give your answers, or you're given answers actually, and you need to accept the answers without question. And the primary reason for the answers that you're given and cannot question is because the Bible says this, or it says that about this, or that. So his impression was that you kind of had to put your brain in neutral to believe in God, to be a follower of Christ. You know anybody who thinks like that? There's lots of people who think like that. But all that reminds me of a great story, actually. One of my favorite church stories about a little kid in Sunday school whose teacher asked this question. A little, you know, seven, eight-year-old kid. The question is this. What's brown and furry and has a long, bushy tail? The kid thinks, which you shouldn't do in church, and raises his hand and says, well, I know the answer is Jesus. Mm-hmm. You know? Because you can't think in Sunday school, Jesus. But it sure sounds like a squirrel to me. All of which raises this question. Around which we're going to center our thoughts this morning. The question is this, is it possible, and this is going to sound like an offensive question, but is it possible to be an intelligent, thinking person and a follower of Christ? Again, that may be an offensive question to you, but lots of people ask that question. Can smart people believe in God? Well, I'm smart. Just let the question sit there. But given this claim by the apostle Paul, in Colossians chapter two, verse three, and the claim is this, in Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Given that claim, do I have to throw my brains out the window to believe that? Can smart people believe in God? Well, as you ponder that, a little quick word about smart people, as we kind of think they're the ideal, just to keep this thing in perspective, because sometimes, you know, this is true as well, even smart people can do really stupid things, a fact that's illustrated best, I think, with a story about four guys on a plane. So four guys get on a plane. This is a story my brother told me years ago, and it's actually a joke, and I changed it a little bit so I could actually tell it here. First guy, four guys on the plane. First guy on the plane is this world-renowned religious guy with a ministry to thousands of people, hundreds of thousands of people actually around the world. Second guy on the plane is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. Third guy on the plane was an elderly man, a grandfather. And the fourth was actually a little kid, a boy scout. And with these four people on the plane, at some point in the flight, the pilot comes over the intercom. Actually, he busts into the area of the plane where these four guys were and announces the plane is going down. You are all on your own. He grabs the parachute and jumps out to save his own life. The only problem is now there's four guys in three parachutes. So the famous ministry guy says, you know, I'm a really important ministry guy. Hundreds of thousands of people are depending on me. I can't go down with this plane. So he grabs one of the parachutes and jumps out of the plane. the Nobel Prize winning physicist says, I am the smartest man in the whole world and the world needs smart people. I can't go down with this plane. So he grabs the parachute and jumps out of the plane. Then the grandfather looks at the little boy and says, oh man, you know, I don't want to die, but you are a young, young boy and I am an old man and I have lived along in a full life and here's the deal. You take the parachute. I'll just go down with the plane. To which the Boy Scout says, Hey, you don't have to worry, Grandpa, because the smartest man in the world just jumped out of the airplane with my backpack. He's brilliant. So now I'm going to exegete this joke for you. Because actually, that joke illustrates a number of things. One being this, that it is possible to be really smart, even brilliant in certain areas of your life, and really stupid in other areas of your life. It is possible to really believe something. But if what you believe is not rooted in reality and what is actually true, you will pay a price for that. You will have pain for that. I like how it said, pain is what happens when your belief about reality and reality meet. See, the Nobel Prize winning publicist who jumped out of the plane with the kid's bad backpack really believed it was a parachute. But he was wrong. He didn't know. So let's talk about that a little bit. I want to talk about knowing. Let's talk about knowledge, about the value of knowledge, because we all value it. We do. I mean, we do. Let me kind of break it down this way. If my car breaks down and I bring it to a mechanic, there's two things I want to know about the mechanic. Number one, is he honest? That's the hardest one. And number two, does he know about cars? Does he know how to fix cars? When I'm bringing my car to a mechanic, I don't want opinions. I don't want preferences. I don't want someone who's lucky at fixing cars. Can you imagine a sign like that? We're lucky. We get it right most of the time. Some of the time. I want someone who has knowledge about cars because here's the deal. When you know, then you're able to deal with what's real. It's the value of knowing. If I was going to have surgery, let's say it's a real serious surgery, like brain surgery or something like that. I wouldn't want a surgeon who said, well, you know, we all have our ideas about what's inside people's heads, and no one idea is really any better than another, so let me just open up your head and kind of move in on there a little bit and look around. No, because at that point, I want someone who has what? Knowledge. I want someone who actually knows, and it just keeps going like that. If I need an accountant, or I'm to hire a coach or a plumber. I don't want preferences or opinion. I don't want someone who's lucky at math if he's my accountant. I want someone who knows because we all value knowledge. But what about life? Not fixing cars or doing math. And what about what most of us, even irreligious people, would maybe consider to be some of the most important things in life does anybody know about that does anyone have knowledge about life and how best to live it and i'm talking about big questions relative to life like what is human nature what happens to you when you die does anybody know and that's where we go no okay is there meaning intrinsic it to the universe or is it just a big cosmic accident? Does evil exist? And if it does, what is its nature? Can suffering be redemptive? Or does it just happen to you? Is there, this is a big one, is there a moral standard before which we will one day be accountable? And if there is, can we come to know it? And are some accounts of it, this is a big one, of moral knowledge, are some accounts of it better and truer than other accounts of it? Is there a God? What is he like? Do human beings have worth? Why? Where does justice come from? What is justice really? At which point we start asking questions like that, what's interesting, and it's just real. We start talking differently because we start saying things like this. Well, who's to say? I mean, we all have our ideas about these things, and no one idea is any better than another, which means that in some of the most important arenas of our life, we opt for opinion and preference, what our friends think, what our culture thinks, what the church thinks, what the pastor thinks. It's interesting about that little run there. If you're a parent, you're going, Don't you just be thinking what your friends think. You want you to think what I think. We opt for what my parents think or for what my parents believe or sometimes we opt for what I've always believed. Do you ever hear anybody say that? I hear that every once in a while. Be in a discussion and they'll just kind of be bringing their thing to the table and they'll just kind of get this just kind of dreamy-eyed look in their face and they'll say, you know what? what I've always believed. As if believing what you believe for a really long time makes it true. Because I've always believed this. How old are you? 17. For 17 years. Anyway, good. But what if, and this is a scary question, and it's an unsettling question, what if what you've always believed isn't true? What if it isn't rooted in reality in how life actually works. Well, at that point, what you need is knowledge, not belief. But here's the problem. Does anybody know about life? Dallas Willard, a fascinating new book that I've been reading for the last couple of weeks, a book that has really informed some of the things I'm thinking about today and talking about. There's a book entitled Knowing Christ Today, the operative word there being knowing. And what he's doing is talking about how we can, in his opinion, trust spiritual knowledge. Says this about knowledge, that we have knowledge of something when we are responding, when we are representing it, when we are thinking about it, speaking of it, and treating it as it actually is. Let me say that again. We have knowledge of something when we are interacting with it, speaking of it, thinking of it, and treating it as it actually is. Belief, by contrast, has no necessary tie to truth. Stop right there and think about that. Belief, because when I first read that, what, what, what, has no necessary tie to truth, good method, or evidence, which is why belief without knowledge is really dangerous, because belief, says Willard, brings with it a tendency to act, involving the will in a way that knowledge does not. Belief brings with it a tendency to act, which is why the smartest man in the world jumped out on an airplane with a backpack because he believed it was a parachute. Belief has a tendency to act in ways that knowledge doesn't. Let me explain it a different way, just a different illustration. If I believe I'm low on gas, I'm driving to my car, I boo believe I'm low on gas. The little thing here isn't telling me what's going on, but I believe I'm low on gas. I will act in ways that are consistent with that belief. I will have an eye out for the next gas station where I can pull over when it seems right and fill up with gas. If I believe, however, that I have plenty of gas, my thoughts, feelings, tendencies, and behaviors will be characteristically different. But, of course, I could be wrong either way and still believe. And when I run my mind, when that thing runs through my mind a little bit, it gets a little scary. Because I've been in a lot of religious environments, and maybe you have too, where the highest virtue is believe. And we encourage people to take leaps of faith. And in fact, I kind of, in my mind, I believe, I believe. And like a really good church service is where we got everybody worked up through a ladder of, I believe, I believe. But what you believe and what you're about to do isn't rooted in reality. What you need there isn't belief, it's knowledge. tragic story I mean I'm sure these stories are in the paper all the time but I'm thinking about this stuff so I just happen to notice things like this this week Christianity Today that magazine came to my house and I was flipping through it about halfway through I see this story of a 16 year old boy who died because his parents believed that he would be healed so they got no treatment for a curable, easily curable treatable disease. And actually, they were being tried. They were going on trial for involuntary manslaughter. The whole story is a mess and a tragedy, but their belief was sincere, and they acted on it. It just wasn't rooted in reality. And this is weird, especially if you kind of go up in an I believe context. What they needed was not more belief. what they needed was not more faith what they needed was more knowledge upon which to base their belief and faith some parts of the world right now there are AIDS infected men who believe that sexual intercourse with a virgin will cure them they believe it and so some young girls are paying very high price for that and we just, I mean, you hear this stuff, and you just go, ah! Well, the prophet Hosea did the same thing. Made the same noise, I think, actually. Prophet Hosea laments things like that by saying, my people perish for lack of what? Knowledge. They perish for either their inability to or unwillingness to live in reality of how life actually works, of how God actually is. So can I dial it back into this knowledge thing? The value of knowledge, be it spiritual knowledge or physical knowledge, mathematical knowledge, the value of it is that it puts us in a position where we can actually interact with things as they actually are, not with how we believe them to be or wish they were, which brings us back to the text. Because Jesus' understanding of how things actually are, how life actually works, and this is kind of a fact, his understanding of those things has influenced the human race like no other influence, like no other force in the world. And that's why Paul, I think, is so confident in his assertion that in Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, but like any treasure that's hidden, you might have to dig a bit to find it, you might have to search a bit to discover it, you might have to wonder you might have to think. Indeed, you have to think. So here's my answer to the person who thinks they've got to put their brain in neutral if you come into church. Far from putting your brain in neutral or leaving it at the door, it is time to bring all your questions, lots and lots of questions and think. And by the way, this word is not just for the skeptic who's not real sure and thinks anybody of faith is an idiot. I want them to think, but I want us to think. I just believe. Why? What is it rooted in? Well, with that in mind, this call for questioning, I want to give you four questions that just might get you started in your digging and in your wondering, regardless of where you are and your journey, and for these questions, I am indebted entirely to Dallas Willard, And this book I have been reading, entitled again, Knowing Christ Today. Because in this book, Dallas says, among other things, and just a side note on Dallas. If you're at Open Door, we mention Dallas a lot. And I've obviously been influenced by him to a significant level. But we kind of know him as a Christian author and speaker. He is known in the world as the head of the philosophy department at USC in California. He is a brilliant man. Known mostly as a philosopher who is in touch with the great questions of the universe, if you will. He says this, there are four great questions that every human being must adopt an answer for in order to live. And these are worldview questions. Every philosophy, every religion, every system, every secularism must answer these questions. In fact, they do answer these questions in one way or another. whether they know it or not, everybody's got a worldview. So my intent here, by the way, as I kind of raise these questions, is to do that. I'm not going to answer all these questions in full, though I will, in part, unpack them a bit. But what I really want to do is raise them so that we can continue to be engaged in them. First question is this, what is real? What is reality? Because mistakes about reality will lead to brutal encounters with reality. Boom! I thought you were wrong. Didn't know. Now, in much of our culture today, the idea is this. That what is real is only what can be seen, touched, and measured. So secularism, or materialism, or naturalism. So in those things, the word spiritual may be used. But most often the assumption is that academia or science have shown us that only physical matter is real. That idea is reflected in our language, by the way. People often say things like this. Don't impose your values on me. Okay, I get it. Don't impose your beliefs on me. And I do get that, and I won't, okay? But you've never heard anybody say, I've never heard anybody say, don't impose your mathematics on me. Don't impose your chemistry on me. Why? Here's why. Because we assume that science and math are connected to reality. Okay? And they are. But what if there's more? You have to think. Jesus in Luke 12 told a story about a rich guy who had more than he knew what to do with, and with all of the bounty he had, even though there was poverty everywhere, and there were some really clear places he could have brought his wealth to do some good. He had a philosophy of life. He hadn't thought it through, but he had a philosophy of life. It was carpe diem, seize the day. Eat, drink, and be merry. This is all for me. That was his philosophy. That's what he thought. That was his reality. So he built bigger barns, keeping all of this stuff for himself, saying thus to himself in Luke chapter 12, Take your ease. You have more than enough for the rest of your life. Eat, drink, and be merry. And that, again, was his reality, his philosophy. He was a believer in that. But God said, you fool. Interesting, he didn't say, you immoral, corrupt person. He said, no, you idiot. No, he said a fool. For tomorrow you die. And when he died, he discovered that his reality was what? It was an illusion. And an illusion is a mistake about reality. and mistakes about reality lead to brutal encounters with it. So think about reality and where you're getting your information about it. Second question, who has it made? Who has the good life? What is desirable in life and how do I get it? It's an interesting question. People, whether you know it or not, we're always wondering about that question, and we're being told a lot about where all that comes from. I was thumbing through a magazine. Again, you know, and I'm thinking about this stuff. I notice stuff I don't normally notice, and I was thinking about it through a magazine. I was on an airplane recently, and the magazine seemed to know the answer to that question about the good life. And as best I could summarize, as I thumbed through the magazine, it seemed to be saying that the good life is mainly pursued through fine dining and weight loss? How do I do both? Truth is, we're obsessed with this question. Indeed, it's part of why we're obsessed with celebrities. I mean, you get sick of it, don't you? I mean, we're all kind of, it's really funny, but the reason we're obsessed with celebrities is because there's this assumption, we all kind of go, that's a bunch of bologna, that they have it. The good life. But here's the deal. Just like mistakes or illusions about reality lead to pain, mistakes or illusions about what the good life is, what a really good life, full life is, we'll do the same. Because if you get this wrong, you're going to end up spending a lot of time and a lot of money and a lot of energy. In fact, you could spend your whole life pursuing things that you think embody the good life, but if they don't, you're going to have some pain because pain is what happens when your perception of reality and reality meet. It didn't fill me. In fact, it made me full of anxiety and covetousness and anger and discontent. so how you answer this question matters a lot third question who is a good person who is worth looking up to who is worth admiring now this one's interesting because even though we may claim in our culture that there's no such thing as moral knowledge even though we might claim that all there is is relativity preferences and opinions we can't get away from this question who is a good person. Maybe you don't walk around going, who's a good person? How about this one? Who's a jerk? I mean, that's the kind of stuff people talk about around the water cooler. And who's a jerk? And here's the deal. You know. You have knowledge about, he's a jerk. Because we all think we know and we care about it more than we let on. Dallas, again, here, suggests that there is an education on this point. I love this. In reading obituaries, because obituaries rarely say things like, she had a great figure, fine teeth, and a full head of hair. That might have been what she pursued her whole life, but it's not what anybody cared about at the end of the day. Because death has this weird way of exposing the illusion of the things that we thought mattered. All of a sudden, they don't. to watch reality. These are huge questions. Fourth question, how do we become a genuinely good person? And by good here, this is important, I don't mean perfectionistic. I don't mean being a good doer. I don't know, good doer. A do-gooder. Because we have all kinds of language for goodness that's gone wrong. It's just kind of some prissy, kind of sappy word. I'm talking about a person. How do you become a person of substance and character? Paul said it this way, full of love and joy and peace. Wouldn't that be nice? See, I know people who claim to know Jesus who have no love or joy or peace. How? So here's the question. It's still, you think you know for sure. Wow, how? No, no, no. How do you become a person full of love and joy and peace and patience and kindness and goodness. Such a sappy word. Well, bottom line is this. No one has ever answered these questions quite like Jesus. Leading people like the Apostle Paul, who was considered by many in his day to be a pretty smart guy, to conclude things like this, that in him, this Jesus. Now picture Paul. I know he's in the Bible, so it's Paul, and we have this perception. You gotta go back 2,000 years and be Paul. The Pharisee of the Pharisees thought this Jesus movement was the worst thing that ever happened in the world, and he was given his life to eradicate it, and something happened, and the lights came on, and he got introduced to reality to such a level where he determined that in this Jesus who one day I, at one time in my life, I resisted everything I have. I have come to believe that in him is hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge about life and how to do life, about what is a good life, what are the realities of life that I need to be connected to in order to do life well, because to Jesus, reality, at the heart of reality, was a person, a person of unimaginable goodness and competence, God, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. And when Jesus talked about God, the Father, it didn't sound like his preference or opinion though he had a preference and an opinion when he talked about God it sounded like he knew God and in fact he'd come to reveal God so we could know God too so here's a suggestion and this is a suggestion to everybody person of faith, skeptical, not of faith here's my suggestion. Become a little more curious about him. And ask lots of questions. Lots of, like, church is not the place you turn your brain off and leave your questions. Don't stop asking questions, because what if in him really is hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge of everything your soul has ever longed for? And who is well off? Well, Jesus' word for that was blessed. And it's interesting, one of these major questions of all philosophy, Jesus hits that question right off the bat at the beginning of his ministry in the Sermon on the Mount where he says, blessed are the poor in spirit. And blessed are those who mourn and blessed are those who meek, and blessed are the meek, which sounds so weird, which sounds on the front end of things entirely disconnected from reality. But what he meant by that, among other things, was this. But you have to think to get this. What he meant by that was it's not just the rich, and it's not just the attractive, and the winners in the genetic lottery, blessed is anyone who's interactively engaged with God, who's living in God's reality, in God's presence, in God's power, and God's love. Blessed are you. Even if you look like you're shut off from the good life in this war, Blessed are you if you have now entered into this kingdom, this reality. In Jesus' language for this reality, the Bible's language is the language of knowing, of knowledge. There is again knowledge. And this, says the apostle, says Jesus in John 17, 3, This is eternal life, that they may know you, God. the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. It's intimate knowing, not just information about. And who is a good person? Well, no one has ever described goodness quite like Jesus because the Jesus, the good person, was the one who was pervaded by love. John, again, in 1 John 4, 7 says this, everyone who loves is born of God and loves God. Whoever does not love does not know God. They may know about God and all sorts of Bible verses about God, but whoever doesn't love doesn't know God. How could they? Because God is love. So it's really very simple. At least it's very clear. Which leads to the final question. How do I become that kind of person? How do I enter into that reality, to God's reality? And once again, the answer is simple. At least it's clear. Here's how. By putting your confidence, Sometimes people use the word faith. Putting your confidence in Jesus and becoming his apprentice. And maybe that all begins by coming to believe that in him really is all the treasure of wisdom and knowledge. But if you don't believe that, that's okay. I mean, I'm not gonna yell at you. But I want you to think. I want you to think. I want you to really think. Because you can't put your brain in neutral on this one. You cannot leave it at the door. So think about who it is that you will replace him with. Whose answers, seriously, think about this. Whose answers about reality and life and what is the good life are better than his? simply and even humbly clearly as I can I would give you Jesus consider him that maybe in him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge about life about how to do life about the good life. So open wide your heart and fully engage your mind and then begin to follow his way. And if you do, he will lead you into reality. And he will bring you into life, into the fullness of life, into an eternal kind of life in the kingdom of God. And so we pray, Holy Spirit, come. Let's pray as we close. Open wide our hearts. Holy Spirit, come. Open wide our hearts that we can be receptive and tender, accessible, but Father, by your Spirit, help us to fully engage our minds and to think about what we think and to wonder about what our belief is rooted in about life and reality. I pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
