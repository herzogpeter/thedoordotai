Ephesians 4, Ephesians 4, verse 3, Ephesians 4, verse 3, being diligent to preserve the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, in light of the things that I have on my heart this morning, I feel real weak. And I just pray for a very special anointing of your spirit. For control. For your spirit to do its work in all our hearts. Including mine. Amen. be diligent to preserve the unity it's an interesting phrase specifically the word that comes to my mind is the word diligent diligent speaks of urgency that's what i pick up urgency there's a sense in which it means that i'm supposed to do it now be at it right now be preserving the unity and be at it right now do it all the time also one of the things that the word kind of communicates is that be hard at work at it. This is something we're to be doing all the time and we're to be making it a priority and it's hard work. And also do whatever it takes to preserve the unity. Whatever it takes to preserve the unity, do it and do it now. Why? One of the things we've been discovering in the book of Ephesians is this, that a loving, caring, united fellowship is the life blood, the essential quality needed to accurately, as a church, manifest Christ in the world. Without that unity and without that love and without that fellowship, we're going to be limping along and people in perceiving who we are are not going to pick up a supernatural flavor unless there's unity of the Spirit. Because it is such a high priority and because it is so ingrained and woven into the fabric of everything Christ wants the church to be, then we can be guaranteed because of that of one thing for sure, that Satan and all his forces are going to be doing everything they can to destroy the unity of the spirit. So what do we do? Then we're supposed to be diligent because we're in a war and everything's going to be happening. People are going to be coming and attitudes are going to be allowed to come in and sometimes they're going to be subtle, but sometimes they're going to be bold, and all of them are going to be designed to destroy the unity that we are called to be diligent to preserve. Be diligent to preserve the unity. Last week, we were talking about the characteristics that produce this unity of the Spirit. In verse 2, humility, patience, gentleness, patience, showing forbearance to one another in love. And last week, we talked about that third quality, patience. We defined it as endurance. One of the characteristics of the worthy walk is endurance, and one of the attributes working together that helps us to preserve the unity is all those things working together, endurance. If there's going to be unity, there needs to be endurance, patience. And as we considered that word and our need for implementing it into our lives as a characteristic, we considered the great men of faith who did endure. And it was really stirring, and we saw the Abrahams and the Isaiahs and the Jeremiahs who spoke the word of the Lord and didn't waver and didn't change, and they did what they were told to do, and they were faithful. And we were stirred. And then we looked at the characteristics that helped them endure and helped them be those kind of patient people that enabled them to do the things God called them to do, regardless of the circumstances. And we listed them, and they were important, and they were needful, and we needed to implement them. But one of the things I closed my sermon with last Sunday, and as I look at it in retrospect, I realize that it was really kind of a throwaway. It was something the Lord kind of laid on my heart as being simply not something drawn from the text, but rather a reflection of a need in my own heart, and it was this. If I'm going to endure, I need to have all those characteristics, humility and gentleness. They need to be there, and I need to be that godly man. And if I am, then I'll endure. But as I reflected on the reality of my own heart's condition, I realize the fact that with all that strength that I'm supposed to have, it dawns on me that there's no way I'm going to endure without you. Without the body. We need each other. I need to feel loved. You need to feel loved. I need to feel embraced. And you need to feel embraced. And I need to feel included. And you need to feel included. And if you don't, if that fellowship isn't there, it's going to be very hard for us, no matter how strong we feel, to endure. It's going to be very tough. We've learned these past few months, as we have been studying the book of Ephesians, that it is a book that is teaching us what the body of Christ really is, how the body of Christ is supposed to really function, and what it means to be part of that body. We've learned that there's a wholeness that exists between us, that like it or not, there is a oneness that exists between you and me, that you and I are one in Christ, that all the barriers have been broken down, that there is a sense of belonging to each other. There is this supernatural unity that God did when Christ died, bringing us together, a marvelous bond that binds us together. Wonderful truth. But the problem is this, That every once in a while, you and I get this sick feeling somewhere in the pit of our stomach. And sometimes we get that feeling and we don't even want to recognize it. And we don't always know what to do with it. And so we don't even like to admit it. But sometimes we get this feeling that I don't feel that wholeness. And it's true and it's right and it's there and yeah, I believe it. But I don't feel that wholeness. And there's times when I don't feel that oneness and I don't feel like I belong. and I don't feel like I'm being embraced and I don't feel like I'm being included. In fact, a lot of times, but then we don't say that, do we? See, as soon as I start dealing with some of those feelings I have of all the body is so wonderful and we're all embraced and we're all included, and then I start dealing with how I feel, but then I put my hand over my mouth and say, well, you're not supposed to feel like that. You shouldn't feel like that. And all these big shoulds come and I say, okay, I don't feel like that. But I do. feel like that. And I start feeling when we feel like that, we start thinking I'm being selfish. I'm not being spiritual. If I'm going to adore, we're supposed to serve and keep on serving, like Pastor Dave says. But there's times I feel like that. Maybe I'm just expecting too much. You know, these things we're talking about in terms of the body is really high and lofty, and they're really the ideal. And for me to feel that warmth and that embrace of the whole body around me, supporting me and lifting me. It's really, you know, maybe I'm expecting too much. And when I begin to think I'm expecting too much, I just kind of go back and settle back into a subtle kind of mediocrity. But there's a problem with all that. There's a problem with all that. It's simply this, that we've been learning what the body really is. And we've been learning from the book of Ephesians how the body is really supposed to function and what it means to really be a part of it. How? If it is to function as it ought, we need to be more honest. And if it is to function as it ought, we need to be more open. And if it is to function as it ought, I need to be more caring than I've ever been before. To realize that you and I are really one and we can't isolate ourselves from each other, even subtly. You see the problem with teaching things like that and letting the word of god ephesians specifically say things like that to us is that we when we've finally been exposed to that kind of truth teaching on what the body really is it raises my expectations of what i can expect from the body and then something kind of negative happens at least as i first see it it looks negative it's simply this that as my expectations of what the body of christ is to be rises i can sometimes look at myself and see myself at level a let's look at it this way as an illustration. I can look at myself at level A. Let's say we can even look at ourselves as a church at level A. And if we're sitting at level A, it's fine. I mean, we've been at level A for years, right? It's fine. I'm used to it. It's fine. No problem. And all of a sudden, the Word of God begins to come to us and begins to hit our hearts. And all of a sudden, the Word of God, speaking of the body and all that, is talking about something different. It's talking about a level C. It's talking about something deeper and something more and something more all-inclusive. And when that happens, something negative happens. It's this. I'm not satisfied with level A. I want to be everything God wants us to be. I want our church to be all that it could be. Let me be real direct. You know, that's one of my weak points, beating around the bush. I'm not sure what the catalyst has been for me. If it has been the book of Ephesians, I don't know that for sure. If it's been our prayer meeting, our prayer meeting time has grown very intimate and people sharing and praying together about intimate, deep kinds of things. Maybe it's just that we've been together a while and we're hearing each other better. All I know is this. I've been hearing a lot of pain lately. That's normal. You're the pastor. you know people come to you with their pain i think that's normal and i want you to always do that but there's two specific things about this pain that that have caught my attention the first thing about this pain that i have heard is that i've been hearing it over and over again i've been hearing it a lot from one person after another and basically the pain i've been hearing is no, I'm leaving the faith, or anything like that. It's real simple and subtle, and people don't even want to say it. It's this. And sometimes, even added on at the end of the conversation, and I find out that's what they really wanted to talk about the whole time, it's this. Dave, I feel lonely. I don't feel included. I don't feel embraced. I don't feel loved. Pastor, I don't have any friends here. i don't have any friends here second thing affected me about that pain that i was hearing was that it wasn't just coming from people on the fringe you know when i hear about that on people who are on the fringe and are new i think oh my heart hurts and i think yours does too oh you know we've got to do something to include them but you know really it just it takes time to do that and and we've just got it you know you got to get involved and you got to get in there the thing that caught my attention was that this wasn't just coming from people on the fringe. It wasn't just coming from new people, and it wasn't just coming from people who are unfamiliar or uninvolved, but some of it was coming from people who are at significant levels of ministry and involvement, people who have invested a lot of time and much of their lives into the work. And that kind of stopped me, you know. I'm not going to preach to you this morning. I want to talk to you. And I really want you to hear my heart. And the reason I want you to hear my heart is because I'm not real sure I'm going to say this right. We talk about people who don't feel loved and don't feel embraced and that kind of thing. And I want to just, before I even get into it, what I really want to share, the meat of this, I want to kind of tap into maybe some of your reactions, because I feel like that's like a dumpster load right now. I mean, I could stop and go, whoa, you have something to think about all day. But someone might be saying in response to that, and maybe this is what I would say if I heard that, I'd say, well, Dave, you know, you're reading me wrong, because I really love a lot. I have some friends, and it's not even just that feeling. You know, you've told us that love is not a feeling, it's an activity. It's something I do. I get involved and I care. I'm not caring, feeling warm, but doing something. And I do. I can point to these three people. I'm just pouring myself, and I don't feel like that applies to me. Could I say something to you if that's where you're at? It's something that Paul said to the church in Philippi, and he said the same thing to the church in Thessalonica. He said this, you know, I've heard about your love. Church of Thessalonica, he said, you know, I know that God has told you to love because I never told you to love. And all I've heard from you is how you love. To the church in Thessalonica, he said, but I urge you to do it more. To do it more. So if you're sitting and you're thinking, I love, then to you I say, do it more. Do it more. Same thing to the church in Philippi. philippians 1 9 he says after congratulating them and patting them on the back for their fellowship for their love for their caring he says this he says i pray for you and you know what his prayer was he says i pray for you and it's this that your love may abound still more and more and so if you're here this morning and you're one of those who's giving and caring and loving do it more and let this whole thing that i want to share from my heart apply to you to stretch even further but i also know that there's times when we hear something like this and we think well well who is it that doesn't feel embraced and who who is that you know it must be their fault i mean they must be doing something wrong and let me just say this to that kind of possible reaction and it would simply be this that there is no way if anything we've learned about the body is true there's no way that i could ever say ever that with someone in the body who's hurting that I could say, what's their problem? That's just ludicrous to even approach that. It would be as if my hand was hurt and my foot would say to my hand, what's the matter with you? Get with the program. It's part of the body. It's part of the body and the foot, the whole body is involved and it's bad and it's negative, but it's involved and what the foot's going to do is walk that hand to the doctor to help it get better. We're involved. We need each other, right? We need each other. Let me begin. Genesis 2.8 God is looking around the universe that he had created in a magnificent passage of scripture and everything he created he stopped and he looked at it and he said it was good it was good it was good and you know what in all the things that he created there was only one thing that he said wasn't good you know what that was he said it isn't good to be alone it isn't good to be alone why? it isn't good that's why it isn't good It isn't productive, and it isn't profitable to live in isolation. You know something? That need in your heart to be embraced, and that need in your heart to be loved, is not something that is unique to you. God placed in your heart, into the human being, the need. God designed us to need fellowship. And without that fellowship, there's no way I'm going to be complete. There's no way I'm going to be fulfilled. There's no way I'm going to be happy. None. Fellowship. Fellowship. The Greek word for fellowship is koinonia. Koinonia. It's an interesting word. It's one that you've probably heard a million times. It's probably one that you've heard too many times. You've heard it over and over and over again. It's become kind of a pop word. It's become almost in some of our minds a little fad. Something that we, you know, koinonia. There's a koinonia fellowship and there's a koinonia Sunday school class. You know, all these koinonia things going on. In fact, last year it was granted official sanction as a cliché. It's got an official cliché status. It's been overdone And we do perceive it very often Because I do I perceive You know, koinonia Whenever I hear that Something goes off in me I go, oh I don't want to hear anymore Koinonia Fellowship The problem is Is that God designed us To need fellowship God designed us to need To be embraced The word means communion In the noun form It means partner It means to have a partner to be a partner, to have a common bond with someone, to have fellowship with someone, to have a partner that I can be with and share with and that whole kind of thing. And as a human being, it's a basic need. So, as I consider the need that every human being in the whole world has for fellowship, for a partner, for someone to share with, for a body to share with, I all of a sudden get excited. I'm thinking, hey, this is great. In the heart of every believer, in the heart of every person, not even believer, but every person, beats this need for fellowship, for oneness, for wholeness, for belonging to something and feeling included. And then I think, well, that's great, because herein lies the genius of the church, right? We've been talking about the body. You and I are one. You and I are whole. There's no way I can live in isolation from you. And that's wonderful. We are partners. There is fellowship. And by the way, whether or not that fellowship is actually happening, that is God's design for the church. That is God's design. That is God's design to meet your need. Your need was designed by God to be met within the church, the body of Christ. The problem is this, that because it is so basic to my needs, and because it is something I need so desperately, that if I can't get it in the church, and if I can't get it within the parameters that God designed for me to get it, what I'm going to do is go where I can. I came across a book a little while ago that was kind of pointed in this direction. It was called A Drink at Joel's Place, written by a guy named Jess Moody. And he says something like this. In fact, he says exactly this. I quote, The neighborhood bar is probably the best counterfeit that there is to the fellowship that Christ wants to give the church. The bar, however, is an imitation. It's a cheap imitation, dispensing liquor instead of grace, and escape rather than reality. But it is accepting and open, and it is an all-inclusive kind of fellowship. Anybody can come. It is unshockable. It is democratic. You can tell people secrets, and they usually don't spread it. or even feel the urge to spread it. The bar flourishes not because most people are alcoholics but because God has placed into the hearts of every human being the desire to know and to be known, the desire to love and to be loved. And if they can't get it in the church, they'll go where they can. The secret of successful evangelism is for the word to leak out that spiritual blisters are healed at the church house. A veritable army of sinners would batter down the door if church became the house where love lives. The publicans and sinners didn't give a hoot about the unity of the scribes and Pharisees, but they thronged to the road and raised the roof to get near Jesus. The one fact that secularists seem to understand is the crucial difference between talking about love and being love. So what do we do? So what do we do? Well, we could sit here and feel bad. No. No. That isn't the answer. That isn't even an appropriate response. What we do is begin to realize that maybe us believers, that we believers need to be stretched in this area like we've never been stretched before. And maybe we need to understand that fellowship is not a fad and it is not a cliche, that it is the fire of the church, that my being embraced and my being included is the thing that gives life to the church, that it is the thing that brings the enthusiasm to the church. It's the joy. It's the joy. Realizing that fellowship is not a fad or a cliche, that it's a biblical mandate, and that its presence is basic, and it's a basic indicator of the fact that we have been redeemed. First John 1, 3 and 4 says this, the things that we have seen and heard, proclaim we unto you. What were the things they saw and heard? It was the gospel that Jesus saves from sin. Those are the things we proclaim to you. Why did we do that? So that you also may have fellowship with us. So that you also may be one with us. And indeed, our fellowship is with the Father and his Son. Okay, that's the base of unity. The fact that you and I are in Christ. And these things we write to you that your joy, the joy, may be made complete. How came the joy? The joy came through fellowship. The joy came through feeling included and being embraced. That's the spark. That's the spark. Far more than the ability to dispense a dogma or a theology is our need to be a unity, to be all inclusive. I guess that I'm saying or have said all those things so that I can say this. I want to teach some things about fellowship. I want to teach some things about what it means to be accountable to each other. There's three basic things this morning. First of all, we would talk about the theology of fellowship. Very interesting, you know. The theology of fellowship, that God in Christ has made us one. Now, we've talked about that so much, I don't really feel a need to do that. It's good, it's important some other time. The second thing I'd like to talk about, however, is the nature of fellowship. What is it? How does it act itself out? Acts chapter 2, I want you to turn with me real quick. We're not going to spend a lot of time here. Acts chapter 2. What it really means to say we're one. And Acts chapter 2 is like being one step removed from the theology that says Jew and Gentile have been made one in Christ. That's theology. What we see in chapter 2 is one step removed from that. The working out of our commonality. You see, it's saying this. What it really means to be one is that now I'm going to share everything I have and everything I am with you. That's what it means. It's not a definition that says, what it means to be one in Christ is that Christ died on the cross and theologically, positionally made now. It means that you and I are going to be involved in each other's lives. That's what it means. Verse 44 says this, and all those who had believed were together and had all things in common. In other words, they were saying things like this, if you have, if I have what you need, it's yours if I have what you need it's yours if you have what I need it's mine isn't that wonderful by the way I need some in this kind of body there was no isolation there was no moving into my little group where I feel comfortable and where I feel good there was no isolation there was a sensitivity to each other and if I have what you need it's yours there was no possessiveness they were holding on to things very, very loosely. Things don't matter. People matter. And fellowship is the lifeblood of the church. Our problem in swallowing this kind of commonality, this kind of perceiving needs and using what I have to meet your need, right now without even biting an eyelash, the problem we have in swallowing that, the problem I have in swallowing that, is my materialism. My possessiveness of what I have. It's mine. That's all our... It's mine. And we say that a lot, don't we? It's mine. My kids say it a lot. I hear them playing all the time, and all I ever hear is, It's mine! It's mine! It's mine! It's mine! It's mine! There's no way it's going to be yours. They held their things very, very loosely. Verse 45 is a very interesting verse in this understanding of the nature of fellowship, the acting out of the theology. It says this, And they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing with all as anyone might have need. Now, this is a very misunderstood passage, And I think it's worth spending just a moment to explain what it really means, because when I understand what it really means, it has a lot of impact, and it's something I can apply to me right now. Some people, in wanting to promote a mentality like communism or communal living, will kind of come to a verse like this and say, this is exactly what the early church did. They sold everything they had, they put it in a pot, and dispersed everything equally. That is not what they did. Again, well, see, this is even one way I've heard this explained by Bible teachers, evangelicals, is saying, well, yeah, that's what they did then, but they had certain circumstances that led them to do it that way, and that's why they did it. But we shouldn't do it today. The problem is it doesn't even mean that. You see, and to give you a Greek lesson, I don't want to do that, but that word, the verb there is not the aorist. The aorist would lead me to believe that they sold everything they had and gave it. It's an imperfect. And what that means is simply this. What that bears upon the text is this, that they began selling their property and possessions and we're sharing them with all. When? As anyone would have a need. As anyone would have a need. And so what that means is basically this. Very simple. If I have two and you have none, you'll get one. Because I'm going to sell what I have and I'm going to give it to you because I've seen a need and I'm going to share what I have with you. If I've got two and you've got none, you get one. That's all. There was that commonality. There was that perception and dealing and sensitivity to each other's needs. And even the mentality went this far. If I have two, God gave me two so I could give you one. Exciting concepts. You see, if it was communal living, it would rob me from the joy of giving anymore. It would rob me from the joy, because I'd just be in the same place you are, and we wouldn't have to give anymore. That's not the pattern. The pattern is God's going to give me some things. The reason he does is so I can share them with you, so I can share them with those who don't have those things. The kind of sharing, the kind of giving, the kind of fellowship that eliminates the need. I love this kind of fellowship that they had. The limits were none. They shared their homes. They shared their food. They shared their clothes. They shared. Think about it just for a minute. If someone in our church had a need, now I think we're pretty sensitive to that kind of thing, but think about it. If someone in our church had a need, and we were exposed to that need, one of the first things I know every one of us would think would be, oh, boy, I'd like to meet that need. Again, you know, that full heart. I'm a loving person. I have a full heart. Again, the love is not full heart. It's doing something. I see a need, and I think, boy, I'd like to help with that need. I'm just, I'll tell you, but I just don't have the resources right now. The money's kind of tight, and I just don't have the resources right now to deal with that. So I'll pray about that need, and I'll pray earnestly. And I'm not saying, you know, just... No, I'll be on my knees and I might even cry. And then I'll go home and park my third car in the driveway. Nobody here has three cars? Anybody here? No. No, I won't do that. Oh, I'm getting in trouble. You know what? I hope we're getting to the point. I hope we're getting to the point where we're beginning to see that when we even have requests come at prayer meeting, that I, you know, the Lord stopped me this on Wednesday when we were praying, and the Lord stopped me right when I was about to pray for somebody like I've prayed before, and he said, David, don't pray for that person unless you're willing to go to that person. Get involved. That's fellowship. Fellowship. Kids taught me that, my kids. Not long ago, we saw this TV program about something in East Africa where kids were starving. And it was hard to watch, and it affected me deeply. And our kids watched it with us, and they saw kids their size walking around with no clothes and no food. And we talked about that when I put them to bed, and we were going to pray together, and my Drea said, they don't even have spaghetti. And that's her favorite. And they didn't have ice cream. And we talked about how our kids can have ice cream every night, and they don't even know what that is. And Drea started to cry, you know, and Erica did too, because Drea was crying. And then we thought, well, let's pray. Let's pray for those kids. And then I thought, what am I teaching my kids? And as we were praying, you know, I was done praying, I said to Drea and Erica, I said, you know, maybe when we pray, God is telling us that we should do something, that when we pray, we come to him and we say, to help those kids, but use me to help those kids. And so we get our money and we send it to those kids. Fellowship. Fellowship. Getting involved. There's a legitimate fear when we develop that kind of mentality, if we all just kind of moved into that, seeing needs, and I have too, here you go. There's a real fear in that, and I think it's legitimate. It's one that I have. It's this, that if I start living like that, who's going to take care of me? I hope the answer is obvious. It's the body. Because if the whole body is acting like that, then there's not going to be any need. And if you have a need, they're going to see that. The body is going to perceive that, be sensitive to it, and meet it. It's going to be okay. But scripturally, there's all sorts of things that would encourage me to continue to do that and not worry about what's going to happen to me. Paul wrote to the church in Macedonia, and he was thankful for their giving, in excess their giving. And this was a church that did not give, you remember them, the church in Philippi. This was not a church that gave out of their wealth. It wasn't like they said, hey, you know, here's the need and look at our budget. Hey, we got a lot of money. We got a little extra this month. Let's kind of filter it over to them. It wasn't that at all. Here were a people who cared about the body. And they saw Paul in need and they said, we don't have nothing. But he has a need and God has moved in us to meet that need and we're going to do it. And what are we going to do when we do that? God's going to supply our need. And Paul wrote to him and says, you know what? You're right. God's going to supply your need according to the riches of his glory. My God shall supply all your needs. By the way, that's the context where that verse comes from. They had given out of their poverty. Jesus said in the book of Luke, Give, and it shall be given unto you. How? I love this. Press down, shaken together, and running over. Just the opposite of your Wheaties box. You ever get Wheaties? That ain't press down, shaken together, or running over. Neither one. It's all fluffy, isn't it? If you press it down, you'd get that much, right? You ever rake leaves? You ever rake leaves? I hate that. You rake leaves and all fluffy, you put them in this bag that's supposed to, you know, jumbo bag. You get one load in there because it's all up. You know what they do? You got to press it down. You shake it together. That's what he does. He says, when you give, it's going to be given unto you. How? Press down. All the way down. Shaken together. Running over. I'm going to take care of you. What a way to live. Verse 46 and 47. And day by day, continuing with one mind in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together. with gladness and sincerity of heart. They were eating together. They were just, hey, come on over for dinner. Praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved. Sharing meals, sharing their homes, the kind of sharing that had no limits, but the limitation of need. That was the only one. It was an intimate, non-exclusive, I would circle that, non-exclusive, anybody could get in, wide open sharing, of what I have and who I am with you. You know what? And again, I just believe that our hearts are saying, yeah, that's our desire. I want to have that intimate, non-exclusive, wide-open sharing of what I am and who I am with everyone here. And I'm just going to assume that every one of us as believers have that desire. There's something about us who have the Holy Spirit living within, there's something rings there. The question I have is how? How do I develop that kind of lifestyle? Catch this. Please catch this. You see, I don't believe that Acts chapter 2 tells us how. I don't believe that it does. You see, Acts chapter 2, in my opinion, is simply a result of a condition that's not even seen here. We don't go to Acts chapter 2 and say, this is what we should do. That's just a result of something deeper that's already taking place, and all these things were simply results of something that was going on in the hearts of believers at that time that produced something very magnificent. but see we have a real tendency and I'm including me in this because I have a tendency I've gone to Acts 2 before and said man alive look at that they're devoting themselves to teaching we need more teaching they're devoting themselves to breaking of bread we need more breaking of bread we need more prayer we need more this and that we need more sense of awe yeah let's have awe a little bit of awe come on we have a tendency to look at the external to look at the form and say aha what was their form I want to discover their form and do what they did and then we'll have what they had baloney we come around we say what we need is more fellowship what we need is more banquets that's what we mean by fellowship by the way i have little you know the tile floor the shuffleboard on the floor the pink lemonade or the no it was red kool-aid and uh cookies and things like that that was fellowship we need more banquets we need more socials what we need to do i'll tell you what will make the fellowship good let's change the time okay let's change the time let's change the order of service if we change yours even what i said this morning about changing the format a little bit. I'm already stuck in that whole thing. Change the way we do it. It'll make it happen. Change, okay, Sunday school teacher. I'll change the arrangements of the chairs. That'll do it. Yeah, I got it better. We'll change the pastors. I get this. We need large groups. We need small groups. We need medium groups. We need prayer groups. We need fellowship groups. What we need is teaching groups. What we really need is prayer. What we really need is fellowship. No, somebody else comes. What we really need is teaching. Maybe what we really need is a change of heart. And realize that none of those external things are ever going to produce the spontaneous caring that we see in Acts chapter 2. Something was happening inside them to promote all of that. And the thought occurs to me, and it's obvious to you too, that you can go to church and not worship. So having worship, so what? So what we're here? I can be here and nothing happen. I can be here and not learn. I can teach. And you can be taught and not change. And we can pray. We can go to prayer meeting and not pray. And we can go to a small group and not share. And we can go to a large group and not get involved. And we can see a need and not care. You see, the form isn't what we have to shoot for. The form isn't even what we need to concern ourselves with. Who cares? See, if our hearts are moving in the right direction, the form doesn't even matter. It'll just define itself and it'll happen. And whatever form we have will be something that will simply facilitate a heart yearning that's already there to love and include and incorporate everybody. That brings me to the third thing I want to share with you, the nature of fellowship, the theology of fellowship, the nature of fellowship, and now simply this quickly, the foundation of fellowship. What is the catalyst? of real fellowship, real fellowship. For me, the key word is a simple word in the Greek. It's allelon, one another, one another. And all through the New Testament, one of the things we hear throughout the Gospels and throughout the epistles is this, one another, one another, one another. And after a while, as I read these one another's, how I'm supposed to treat you and how you're supposed to treat me, do this to one another, do this to one another. I get the idea after a while that it's important how I treat. you and it's important how we treat one another over a hundred of them in the new testament alone just a couple of them today and we might even flip this in the next week a little bit but just a couple of them today the most common and the most needful the one that's mentioned the most in the new testament is a real simple one you've heard it too many times to even have impact it's like fellowship it's gotten cliche-ish it's simply this love one another okay love one another no program can do that there is no sermon that can do that there is no there's nothing that can break down the walls between people there is nothing that can break through the tension that some people maybe even hear feel for somebody who's right across the aisle no not saying love one another doesn't do that you see if I if I let that thing sink into my heart love one another love one another what that's going to elicit in me is the need because I know it's going to cause me to stand up and walk over and embrace that person and let the wall break down and tell them I love them and tell them I'm sorry love one another but since I don't want to do that I say this you want fellowship? you want oneness? you want love? let's change the format no No, just love one another. Simple. Colossians 3.14 has listed all the graces that are to be characteristic of the life of the believer. Humility. The same things we talked about in Ephesians. And then it finally says in the 14th verse, Above all. All those things said and done, above all, put on love. Because love is the perfect bond of unity. Love is a cement. Love is a cement that holds us together. 1 Corinthians 1.10 says, Let no division come between you. What's supposed to come between us? Love. That's the cement. Philippians 2 says, Love each other with the same love. You know what that means? Love each other with the same love? It means simply this. No preferences. No fixed favorites. No fixed favorites. Anybody wins? Ooh. No fixed favorites. I'm talking about clicks. That's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about us four no more shut the door. And you know what? I have to admit, because I'm a human being just like you, and there are people that I like to be around just like you. There are people that you like to be around. Lord, it's so much fun to grow, to be stretched, to let that fervent attitude begin to just saturate me as I learn to stretch and include. And Lord, may that just infect us all. I'm even thinking now of our agape time later tonight. May we stretch tonight to each other. Thank you for your word. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
