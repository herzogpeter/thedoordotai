The very first Christmas revolved around an unexpected invitation that Mary received from God to carry the Savior of the world, the Messiah, inside of her, in her womb. And even though I'm sure she felt totally unprepared for that task and utterly incapable of it, her remarkable response was, may it be. May it be to me just as you said. And last week we looked at what it would take to become the kind of people who respond that way to God's unexpected invitations. And I submitted to you that in order to respond that way, we would have to change our question, our fundamental question, from how can I handle this? How can I manage and control these unexpected things? We'd have to change it from how can I handle this to how can I receive it. Because how can I handle it really is all about managing and controlling our circumstances, even protecting ourselves from the unexpected life that God might want to implant within us. Last week, we called that a kind of spiritual birth control. Protecting ourselves from the life that God might want to implant within us. Because it's simply not true that God won't give us more than we can handle. That's a Christian myth that belongs more on a bumper sticker than on the theology that carves into our hearts. Of course God will give us more than we can handle. God has been doing that since time began. It's all throughout the pages of Scripture, and it's all throughout the pages of our lives together. How can I receive it? is about agreeing to faithfully carry the life of God that has been implanted within you to term. And in Mary's case, saying yes to God's invitation did not magically take away all the risks or all of the pain. In fact, her pain was great. Remember the prayer that was prayed over her and the dedication of her son Jesus at the temple. For a sword will pierce your soul as well, Mary. God does not assure us that we are capable of the tasks to which God invites us Or that we can't handle them or that they will be without pain God's assurance to us is the same as Mary's Greetings you who are highly favored God is with you God is with you now between last week and this week several questions came up in conversations with friends and i don't know how aware you are of that but when we uh get done with the weekend services in particular about the message a group of us get together and we talk and we say what questions have risen up as a result of the talk or what do you want to hear more about how can we dive deeper into it. And several people have a voice into that. Among them, Vicki Degner, Jen Linwall, Keith Meyer, Dave Johnson, Stephan, Joel. In this case, my wife was extremely helpful. So three questions came up that I'd like to structure the talk this morning around. And the first question is this. In 2008, nowadays, does God still give invitations like the one He gave Mary to normal people like me and like you? Does God still do that? Number two, what if you say no to an invitation that God gives you? What happens then? And number three, what does the journey look like from no to yes? So let's pray as we dive in. Jesus, it is a privilege. And it is with gratitude that we are invited to partner with you in bringing the restoration of all things and making all things new and building your kingdom. And it is with a great amount of kind of fear and humility that when we say yes, we say yes. But it is our desire as a church, as a group of people that are made up of little groups of friends, to say yes to you and to your kingdom, coming right here on earth, right here, right now. Amen? Okay, first question. Does God still give invitations to normal people like you and like me, like the one that he gave, that God gave to Mary? Well, the answer, in short, I believe is yes. But I believe there are different kinds of invitations that God brings. And one of the kinds of invitations that God brings is sort of a larger-than-life calling that happens to us maybe just a few times in our lives. And I would put Mary's invitation into that category. A sort of larger-than-life, a few times in our lives, calling. They're huge in scope, and receiving them alters our life forever. You heard Stephan speak a couple of weeks ago about the next generation. And if you weren't there, I really encourage you to get the CD or download the podcast or watch it online. You need to listen to it because I think some of the things that Stephan talked about will be things that mark us for years to come. What you'll hear is someone, Stephan, who has been invited by God into a lifelong way of living, a calling that one generation of followers of Jesus would be with and mentor another generation, that they would share their lives with them and believing that that is what will bring the kingdom and that is what will change the world. I have seen Stephan live this out for years. It is deep within him. It burns inside of him. I believe that King David shared the same kind of life calling and invitation that Stephan has been given. And it's interesting that a few years ago, Stephan, a friend, said to him that he had the spirit of David on him. In Psalm 71, verses 17 and 18, we read this. David's journal entry, we imagine him writing passionately these words. Since my youth, you have taught me. I think David saw God as his mentor. And to this day I declare your marvelous deeds. And even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, my God. It's like this thing where David is saying, don't let me off the hook of doing this. And don't uninvite me into doing that which I love. Do not forsake me until I declare your power to the next generation, your mighty acts to all who are to come. Stephan has this in him, and so do some of you, maybe many of you. Because some invitations are lifelong callings that burn inside of you, that won't go away. People will confirm these in you if they are true about you. And you'll feel as though you'll die if you don't do something about them. And in this way, they sort of choose you. So pay attention to the things that burn inside of you, the things that won't go away. Ask your friends about them and ask God about them. But equally as important, I think, as these lifelong callings are what I would call small nudges, Little invitations from God that happens many times throughout the day, and they're usually concerning the routine details of your life, the down-and-dirty, nitty-gritty life that we all live. This last week, I was running from one meeting to another, and I hadn't had lunch yet, so I drove up to this subway up here connected to Walmart, and as I got in line, I found myself right behind this very young couple, teenagers, and they had about a one-year-old in their arms. and immediately I started thinking, wow, I mean, life has got to be crazy for these two. And what does life look like heading into Christmas for them? And so as they were ordering their food, as I was ordering my food, right as we were approaching the cashier's station and the young man was pulling out his money, I think I received an invitation from God to pay for their lunch. And my immediate thought was, no. Not because I felt like I didn't necessarily have the money, because I didn't want to embarrass them. That's what kind of rose up in me. But, and this is all happening in a split second. My heart starts beating fast, and it was like, no, do it, do it. And so I kind of nervously placed my hand on this young man's shoulder, and I said, listen, I would love to buy your lunch if you would let me. And he and this woman kind of looked at me. Like I was offering them a million dollars. And they said, that would be awesome. Thank you. And you know, and then I said something kind of stupid because I was feeling very awkward at this moment. Well, I have a one-year-old too, and I see a kid. Made it more awkward than it needed to be. But as I was walking out to the parking lot, out to my car, clutching my little sub sandwich in my hand, I felt like I had just gotten invited to something huge. Huge. This tiny little thing that I could say yes or no to. But by saying yes, something in me expanded. And I believe the kingdom was built. A couple weeks ago, I felt an invitation to invite someone else to press into something that I knew was going to be hard for them. And it was going to be hard for me to do that with them. And I almost pushed it away. Not because I felt like they were going to be embarrassed, but because I was just afraid to say it. But I pressed into it, and I said it. You know what? It didn't feel great. Not thinking about it, not saying it. I didn't have some magical, majestic feeling after I did that one. But I think, I think I grew in my ability to receive invitations from God, even though I felt like I couldn't handle it, was enlarged. A couple weeks ago during Stephen's talk, he talked about how his daughter Mimi ran away from him when he was trying to put her coat on. It was a winter day. And how he got a little angry about that. But then how later on he spent a few moments reflecting on that and he received an invitation from God that perhaps his little daughter Mimi needed in those moments to understand that a father pursues. That when she ran away squealing with laughter that maybe he shouldn't. give in to his frustrated feelings. Maybe instead he should run into her room and laugh with her. And so that is what he did the next time. And I'd like to believe that his ability to hear invitations from God grew. And that Mimi's did too. So there are lifelong callings and there are small nudges. I think God is always inviting us into new opportunities to learn and to grow. The question for all of us is, how do we learn to hear them? How do we learn to pay attention to them? Well, I think you can cultivate your ability to hear these little nudges by committing to small practices in your normal life that help you to pay attention. We can learn to pay attention to these things. Now, I had a 10th grade English teacher. His name was Mr. Tobin. And he had us read a lot of books. and every week he would have a test on these books. And the tests, remember the first time we sat down to these tests, to one of these tests. Because one of the questions were things like this. What color was the coat that Mrs. Haversham was wearing when Pip first met her? And you're like, she was wearing a coat? And there was not multiple choice, it was just a line. You know, so, I don't know, gray? I mean, it was kind of... We all failed the first test, but after several tests, you know what happened? We learned how to read differently. We learned how to pay attention to details so that the way that Mr. Tobin did these tests made us read differently. He was brilliant. And I think hearing God in many ways is very similar to things like that. It's very similar to hearing a close friend or a spouse. To hear a close friend or a spouse, to hear what they're really saying, you need to pay attention to what they're saying and how they're saying it. And this is what prayer is. Prayer is simply learning to pay attention to God, and we can learn to do it better and better. I think most of us think that some people are just naturally better at prayer than others. That some people sort of have this magical pipeline to God, and God always talks to them, and they always talk to God, and they're just magically better at it. And I think that is just not true. I think God is talking to all of us at all times, because if it is true that God is madly in love with you and I, then it would make sense that God would want to be with us and God would talk to us. So what we need to do is to learn to pay attention. Psalm 131, 1 and 2 is a lesson in learning to pay attention to God. And my friend Keith, this is one of the sets of verses that he memorizes. And so, you know, you'll hear him recite this from time to time. We read this, My heart is not proud, O God. My eyes are not haughty. I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me. And the reason why you would journal something like that is if you were struggling with that. You know? David is not just saying, here are two great things that I don't do. He's saying, here are some things that I need help with, God. And saying it over and over to you will help me. And here's the learning. but I have stilled and quieted my soul like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me. Can you imagine the kind of freedom that you would have if that could be said about you? I have stilled and quieted my soul. Now one of the things I notice about that is this speaks to something that can be learned. the example of a child who has weaned from his mother's milk is an example of someone who has gone through a process where they have learned now to eat real solid food other than milk he has learned to be around his mother without constantly crying for milk and it was a process to get him there was it not we can learn to quiet our soul as well We can learn to pay attention to God. Now, one of the spiritual directors in my life that has helped me is a man named John Ackerman. And he's developed an exercise called Stop, Look, and Listen. And this can be applied to almost any area of your life. It's designed to help you to learn to pay attention to God. So stopping involves taking time away from your busyness, even five seconds, to declare to God that you are open to receiving God's invitations. God I am open to receiving what you have for me there's several ways to do this one way is you might begin your day by praying through everything that is on your schedule declaring to God that you are open to receiving God's invitations for each of those tasks and relationships another way is you might end your day by reflecting on what you think you received from God in the way of invitations and what you did about it, whether you received it or whether you didn't. In other ways, you might stop for a moment during the day when you feel especially confused or anxious. Anytime you're facing a situation that has you feeling anxiety, then you might simply say, God, in this anxious moment where I don't know what to do, I am open to receiving an invitation from you. That's stopping. It's intentional. It's a way of saying the world of my life does not have to tell me what to do. I can stop and declare my intention to be open to God's invitations. Looking involves seeing your life through the lens of the following question. At every moment, what is God doing around me and what might God be inviting me into? Every moment of the day, what might God be doing around me and what might God be inviting me into? When my kid is losing it. When I am losing it. When my boss asks me to do something more than I think I can do. When my wife's birthday is coming up. When my son asks me to read him that story again for the seventh time and I am exhausted and he is not. When I have a difficult problem to solve and I don't know what to do. when I have a difficult person to deal with and I don't know how to deal with them, what might God be doing around me? And what might God be inviting me into? Be a great question at the dinner table. Be a great question with you and your roommates or you and your spouse. We can learn to frame our lives around this question, what might God be doing around me and what might God be inviting me into? And this will change the way you think about your life, just like Mr. Tobin's tests changed the way that we read. Listening involves trying to hear God's answers to those questions. What is God doing around me, and what is God inviting me into? And you'll find that the more you do it, the better and better you'll get at paying attention to God. If you're not sure that you're hearing from God, and we never totally are, Check with a trusted friend or with the scriptures. Over time, as you submit to these disciplines, as Jesus did, you'll learn to hear God more and more clearly. So the second question is a little more complicated. What if you say no to these invitations that God gives? What if you say no? What happens? Well, another character in Mary's story is a guy named Zechariah. He's the father of John the Baptist, who, just like Mary, also received an unexpected invitation from God through the angel Gabriel. Zechariah was a priest who'd been unable to have children with his wife Elizabeth up until this point, and they were very old. Zechariah's response to God's invitation was very different from Mary's. So we pick up the story in Luke 1, verse 13, with the words that the angel Gabriel told Zechariah. He said, don't be afraid, Zechariah. Your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John. And he will be a joy and delight to you. And many will rejoice because of his birth, for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. And he is never to take wine or other fermented drink. And he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even before he is born. And many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God. And he will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the parents to their children. To turn the hearts of the parents to their children. And the disobedience of the wisdom of the righteous to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. Wow. Can you imagine if that was said about your coming child? There might be a gulp. Zechariah asked the angel, how can I be sure of this? Because I am an old man and my wife is well along in years. See, Zechariah is told that something impossible will happen to him. Something that we can assume he has prayed for for years, but maybe has given up on. Something completely unexpected is about to happen to he and his wife. They're about to have a son. And instead of asking, how can I receive this? Zechariah asks, how can I handle this? I am old. My wife is old. How can I be sure of this? And before we get too hard on Zechariah, I think I get his response. He's doing the math. He's saying, Gabriel, this is a little delicate, but I mean, like, my wife and I, we don't even sleep in the same bedrooms anymore. You know what I mean? So this might be complicated. And I've got a small problem, Gabe, with the name John. People are gonna wonder. That's not my name. There's no one in our family named John. So I'm gonna need a little proof that this is actually from God. in essence Zechariah says no to the invitation can you say no to God of course you can I think I do it every single day I don't think it's a great idea but I think that we say no to God every day let me give you an example a few weeks ago I gave a talk here on fasting What a marathon taught me about fasting And on Friday The day before I was supposed to speak on Saturday I had this kind of terrible anxiety That my message was terrible That there was nothing good in it There was no life in it And I became very worried about it On Friday afternoon In the middle of my worry I got the impression that I was being invited to fast from food until I was done speaking on Sunday. And I said, no. No. I mean, I will be hungry. And I can't, I don't think I can stand up there and do what I do if I'm really hungry. I just have to be honest. And you know what? Here's the weird thing. I think the talk went fine. I didn't feel some huge rift in my relationship with God, and I don't think I was in the penalty box. But here's the deal. On Sunday night, I was reflecting on this invitation, and I didn't tell anyone about it. And what I had the impression of on Sunday night is not that God was so disappointed in me. It was that I had missed an opportunity to learn that God can supply what I need when I need it better than I can. And I felt sad about that because I chose to trust myself instead of trust God. Now, I believe the work that I have to do when I say no to God is to get to the reason why I say no. Because I do say no. I think I say no to God when I don't trust God. And there's a difference between saying, oh, I trust in God for my life and for my salvation, and oh, I trust in God for the everyday details of my life. These are the crazy, weird, authentic, actual conversations that a real person has with God. No, I don't trust you to get me through that. I trust myself much better than that because I think I have a better handle on my life, God, than you do. And we don't say those kinds of things out loud usually. But the truth is, we don't trust God because we don't know God. We don't know God's character. That God is steadfast and true. How I generally know that I'm not trusting God is when I notice that I'm focusing on this question, how can I handle it? When I start to get really intense about controlling it and managing it so that I will experience the least amount of pain is generally when I know that I am not trusting God. And Jesus uses a very brilliant, typical rabbinical paradox when he gives a teaching on this issue in Matthew 10, 39. He says this, whoever finds their life will lose it. And whoever loses their life for my sake will find it. And I can see the disciples in my mind hearing that teaching and kind of furrowing their brow and going, hmm. That's what you say when you have no idea what someone just said. Hmm. Hmm. and then turning to each other and going, what is he talking about? Finding your life is asking, how can I handle it? Finding your life is finding a way to manage your way around the circumstances of your life so that you remain safe. That's finding your life. How can I handle it is putting your life in your hands. How can I receive it is putting your life in God's hands, is allowing God to invite you into things that you are totally unprepared for and utterly incapable of. Allowing God to move you into risks that you are not sure that you can do. We say no to God. I think we do it all the time, and we do it because we have not learned yet that God can be trusted. because this only happens through experience. When you say little yeses to God, to God's even small invitations, you learn more and more that God actually can be trusted, not to keep you necessarily safe, but that God wants to bring the restoration of all things, all people to the world. And he wants to invite you to do that with God. So on to the third question. Leads us right into it. What does the journey from no to yes look like in our lives, in our normal lives? How do you learn to trust that God is good? Well, we see what happened with Zechariah in Luke 1, verse 19. This is after Zechariah responds, how can I handle it? And this is, I'm going to read this, how I kind of see this, at least in my mind, this happening, this response from Gabriel to Zechariah. Zechariah, I'm Gabriel. And you might not know this, but this is sort of my job description. I stand in the presence of God, and I hear what God has to say, and then I go speak to people like you. And my job is to give you good news. That's my job. From God to you, so you can trust it. But here's the deal. You didn't. And so now, Zechariah, I hate this for you, but you're going to be silent from now until the time that your son is born. Because your son will be born. because God said that your son would be born. Now this is interesting. How God responded to Zechariah's no is absolutely fascinating because I think God wanted Zechariah to have a yes. I think God wanted to teach Zechariah that God could be trusted. And so God gave Zechariah a gift, not a punishment, a gift. When Zechariah needed to learn to stop, to shut up and listen, God made him unable to speak. It's very practical and very brilliant. Can you imagine the kinds of things that Zechariah learned to pay attention to when he could not speak? Unbelievable how God cares about the very small details of our lives. This was not a punishment. It was a gift. And the great news is, Zechariah came around. When his son was born, when I read this this week, it just moved me in a new way because when his son was born, he asked for a tablet because everyone looked to him because the father names the son. John asked for a tablet. He wrote these four words. His name is John. may it be to me and may it be to my son just as you said because God you can be trusted you trust with my life and my son's life and then he launches into this sort of song maybe Joel can write a rock song out of it though I'm not sure the end of which is very interesting because he's talking in this very wee language about prophecy coming true and about Israel coming back to God. But at the end of it, I think there's a little more autobiographical information when he says this in Luke 1, 78. Because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven, think of the angel Gabriel, to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet in the path of peace because Zechariah had been guided. He realized it wasn't just those crazy Gentiles that live in the darkness. It was me too. And I needed, I needed the light of heaven to shine on me so that I could see it. Zechariah took the journey from no to yes. He learned to pay attention. The journey from no to yes is, I believe, is about making room inside of you, agreeing with God that you need to be expanded so that you can carry the life of God into the world. You think about a pregnant woman who has a life growing in her, how the ligaments are stretching, and how there is less and less room inside of her to breathe, and how she's getting kicked, and all these things. And you realize this is a great metaphor for what God does in us. You make room when you stop to announce that you are open to God's invitations. You make room when you look around to see what God is doing in your everyday life, and how God is inviting you into partnering with God in the restoration of all things. You make room when you listen for the invitations that God has always given you. Making room in you so that you can be expanded to carry the life of God in you to the world. When you do that, it enables you to trust God, that God is good, and to say yes more and more. But this is an experiential learning. Just like Zechariah, you will need to move into a way of doing this, not just hearing about it. So how can you, in your everyday normal life, learn to trust God enough to say yes to the unexpected invitations that God brings? How can you incorporate the practices of stopping and looking and listening into the moments of your everyday life? This would be a great conversation to have with some friends. Encourage you this week to look at the message tool. in a few months my wife is going to give birth to twins it's incredible which means that we're going to have yeah we're going to have three kids under the age of three now that's really exciting to me i mean there's a part of this that i just can't wait we learned that there are going to be two more boys so we're going to have three sons i just heard an oh my goodness I would be lying if I said that there wasn't a healthy an unhealthy amount of how can I handle this going through my mind well the truth is and all of our friends are telling us the great thing is Steve you can't you can't handle this I know you but into this kind of fear we're sensing an invitation from God to trust that God will be with us in it we're sensing that God is expanding our ability to carry God's life we're starting to believe that in the chaos that we'll be doing it, our capacity to carry the life of God in the world is going to be enlarged. That these three little ones just might be God's mercy to us. The rising sun is coming to us from heaven to guide us into the path of peace through these three little teachers. That is our invitation, at least one of them. The question for you and your little group of friends and family is, what is yours? And how will you learn to authentically say yes so that you can carry the life of God into the world? That's your work. Let's pray. Let's pray. Jesus, help us to receive the difficult invitations that you have for us sometimes. Help us by putting people around us that really love us, that help us move away from how can I handle it into how can I receive it. God, we say to that, may it be. Amen. Amen.
