The 6th chapter, the 18th verse, and you aren't going to believe this, but it's the last time I'm going to ask you to open to the book of Ephesians for a long, long time. We are going to finish today. We made a promise that I'm not even going to use this in cross-referencing anything. Nothing out of Ephesians. Paul is ending his letter to the church in Ephesus, and he ends with these words, with all prayer and petition, believers pray at all times in the Spirit. And with this in view, I want you, when you pray, to be on the alert. And I want you to pray with all perseverance and petition. And who I want you to pray for is all the saints. And I want you to pray for me, too, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel for which I am an ambassador in chains, that in proclaiming it, I may speak boldly as I ought to speak. Let's pray as we begin. Father, I am feeling overwhelmed this morning with my inadequacy in dealing with this powerful topic. I'm also overwhelmed, Father, this morning with the fact that I would guess the majority of us struggle with this dimension of our Christian lives, our praying. And so often, though we preach it and we believe it and we talk about it, the praying in power is something that for so many of us is missing. I pray, Father, by your Spirit that you would teach us and open our eyes and open our hearts and change our living in this regard. I ask this in your name. Amen. The book of Ephesians is something I'm leaving with some strange feelings of sentiment. I feel like I'm leaving an old friend and I want to say goodbye and we should have a party or something. I don't know. But I really believe that in many ways, maybe in ways that we won't be able to tell for a while, that the book of Ephesians has shaped our first year together. We have learned in this book that maybe more in the book of Ephesians than in any other book in the entire Bible that I'm very aware of, that we have delineated for us in this book, cataloged for us in this book, the resources that are ours as believers. First of all, I want you to remember, if you forget everything else about the book of Ephesians, I want you to remember that God in Christ, if you are a believer, has done a supernatural work in you. Chapters 1 through 3 was dealing with that supernatural work. Because I am in Christ, I am able right now as I stand before you to also stand before God, holy and blameless, without spot. In Christ I am redeemed, I am adopted as a son, I am a recipient of his grace, I am forgiven of my sin, sealed for eternity by the power of his Holy Spirit. He took a spiritual zombie, a spiritual death walker, remember chapter 2, and brought me and made me alive together with Christ and raised me up with him. And even now I am sitting spiritually with him in the heavenlies. That is absolutely secure. Chapter 2, verses 12 through 18, we found out that the war was over, the enmity, the alienation between me and God and you and God. He came to bring unity. You who were far off have been brought near. And he came preaching peace to those who were far away. And he came preaching peace and brought them near. Chapter 3, verses 14 through 19, finally says this. For this reason, because of all the resources that are ours, Paul says this, I bow my knees before the Father from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, that he would grant you believers according to the riches of his glory, that you be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner man, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, really settle down and be at home, and that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend everything that I've given to you in terms of who you are. You need to know who you are. And we as believers need to bathe ourselves in our identity as believers. God has done a supernatural work in me. God alive in me. I've gone from death to life. I've gone from darkness into light. But we learn something else, and it's not enough just to stop there. We worship because of that, and we would praise, and we would sing our songs. and we would fall on our knees because of that kind of thing. But that is not complete because chapters 4 through 6, responding to the position and the resources that God in Christ has given to us, he has also called us to a supernatural kind of life. Not only has he done a supernatural work in us, but he is calling us to supernatural living. Get on the outside of your life what God has already done on the inside. Therefore, I, the prisoner of the Lord, entreat you believers who have these resources to walk in a manner that is commensurate with your position. Get on the outside what God has already done on the inside. And that was the whole dimension of our chapters 4 through 6. As we began to move through the book of Ephesians, seeing the call of God on our lives. And the simple fact is this, that God has called us as believers to a supernatural kind of life. And what Paul is doing as he ends this book, and I want you to catch this. I feel like the words I'm coming up with are so inadequate to catch the spirit I believe that Paul had when he wrote these final words in Ephesians. It's simply this, with all of these supernatural resources given to you, and all of these supernatural calls that God has placed upon your life, and the fullness of God, and the filling of the Spirit, and exceeding abundance beyond everything you could ask or think. And so, beloved, I want you to pray all the time, in every different way. And I want you to pray in the Spirit, and I want you to do it with alertness, and I want you to do it with perseverance, because it is prayer, believer, that for you, in terms of your experience, is going to unlock the door for this supernatural kind of living. if you expect to walk as he walked to be filled with all the fullness of God to see exceeding abundantly beyond all you could ask or think if you really expect to be able to defeat the enemy we have spent weeks on delineating the armor that is the believers and how that is such a walk of faith but if you expect to be able to turn the ignition on for that thing it's going to take more than you understanding what those pieces of armor do and how to put them on and what they mean. It's going to take more. I want you to pray. I want you to pray all the time. I want to address something that is, maybe it's, God is dealing with me about some things right now concerning this, not only in my personal life, but in our life as a church. But I believe that we are living in a day that as believers we can get so smug concerning our walk with God. that we live in a day when everything can be. It isn't always done, but we live in a day when everything can be reduced to the how-tos, the methods, the programs, the seminars. And if I know enough and if I understand enough and if I have enough knowledge, I can kind of find the program and find the method, and the method is what works. And everything can be reduced to that. And I can walk around with my college degree confident that that's what's going to equip me. I can walk around with my seminary degree confident that that's what's going to equip me for service. My Ph.D. and my knowledge of the Word and what I know about Ephesians. And we can walk around feeling so capable. And we can have our committees. And we can form our groups. And we can have our ministries going all through our church. And listen, beloved, we are growing. And God is calling us to significant things. And I believe we need to be fully trained. And we need to go to school. And we need to have our seminars and our committees. But there was a fine line that we cross. And I think we cross it all too often. I cross it all too often. And that is very subtly somewhere along the line. I begin to lose that fierce dependence on God through prayer on my knees. Because nothing is going to get done here of eternal value. because I've got a college degree, or I go to seminary, or you do any of those things, it's going to be as God unleashes his power among us. How do I know when I've crossed the line? You know how I know? I know when I've crossed the line and moved into a position where I am subtly trusting in those external qualifications as the vehicle that I really believe is going to get the job done around here. Maybe the reason I'm struggling with this right now is that we're without a youth pastor. that bothers me a lot there's a lot of things right now in our church that aren't going to get done because we don't have that resource and it's bothering me and my strival meter just goes nuts you know at times like that I want to do it all and get involved in everything and you see the answer to anything we've got going wrong here right now is we get that guy in here and everything will be alright you know how I know when I've crossed the line I see it in my praying I see it in my praying I've got to be real honest with myself and with you I don't think you get people to pray By telling them they ought to pray I think maybe we get people to pray And I know I get myself moving into a lifestyle of prayer When I begin to see God and God alone As the sole source For everything that is going to happen here of value That's when I get on my knees A sermon about prayer that says men ought always to pray Isn't going to get me down there when I begin to see God as the soul source the energizer the dispenser of power here in my life the dispenser of grace the dispenser of endowment then I will be on my knees and that's how I know when I've crossed that line because when I'm not on my knees it's because I'm functioning really believing that I can do it and he isn't the soul source I am the sole source. Or you're the sole source. Or somebody else is who's really going great guns. And I feel real confident and real at ease because you're here. And you're doing such a great job. Or I'm here and I'm doing it. And all these things. Subtle, isn't it? It doesn't happen to bad people. It happens to us. People who care. We pray. But so often the fire and the zeal has been quenched. because somewhere in our gut we have lost the idea that God is the sole source of anything that's going to happen here of value. We need to hear this. Sunday school teachers, I think you need to hear that. Awana leaders, moms, dads, I think you need to hear that in your home. Husbands and wives, Pastor Dave, I think we need to hear that you and I do not have what it takes to perform, to move into the things that God is calling us to in the flesh. You don't have what it takes, and neither do I. We have been given, we have been called of God to do a supernatural work. He has also given us the resource to do that work. That is the Holy Spirit of God. And then he says to you and to me at the end of Ephesians, what I want you to do, beloved, is ask for it. I want you to pray. call unto me and I will answer thee and I will show you great and mighty things which you don't even know about now but you better call on me and you better see me as the sole source of everything that's going to happen if my people famous familiar verse who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray I will hear and dispense to you but you've got to see me as the sole source of everything all through scripture we see the value of prayer especially in the book of the acts because maybe the book of the acts is is living illustrations of people who were doing things and then we saw results doing things that were bad and then we saw results doing things that were positive and then we saw results we saw those people in that book praying and we see all through that book that prayer was the energizer again for god's work we see it as the key for unity in acts chapter 2. Remember, I just mentioned a little while ago that when they came together, they came together for the purpose of the apostles' teaching, for fellowship, for the breaking of bread, and for the purpose of prayer. That's why they came together, and they focused on that. And in that very same chapter, chapter 2, verse 46, the result of that kind of a mentality was this. We were of one mind in the temple, and gladness and sincerity of heart. Praising God was their characteristic, and they were having favor with all the people. Chapter 4, verse 32 was coming right after a verse that said they had come together. They were all in one place and they were praying. And the result of this was this. And the congregation of those who believed were of one heart, united together. And not one of them claimed that anything belonged to him. Prayer does that. Sermons on that don't do that. Sermons on prayer don't do that. Sermons on saying we need to be less selfish don't do that. coming together as God's people for the purpose of prayer, because we see Him as the sole source of everything that's happening here, does that. I could go on and on and on, and it would really be basically redundant, because we are not ignorant of God's promises and His illustrations in the Word of God concerning His working through prayer. We know that. We are well-versed in the power that is connected with prayer. what we have a problem with is doing it I want to back off and back up just for a minute this morning is one of those mornings that as well as preaching I'm sharing with you my personal struggle with this and some of the dimensions that I had to have answered in my mind concerning prayer I'm sharing with you this morning but I want to take I talk to enough people during the week to realize that prayer is for many of you a real enigma it's a real frustration in your Christian living we understand it we see that we're supposed to and many times the only reason we do is because we're supposed to and it becomes a big should and then we feel guilty if we don't and I know I don't want that to be my motivator and yuck it just seems like something I sometimes we just put it in the back of our mind and try to ignore the fact that prayer is so incredibly absent in our lives and hope the pastor doesn't talk about it. And I, as pastor, if I'm struggling with hope, I don't have to preach about it because I'll have to go through what I went through this week. But I want to briefly set something straight in terms of a bit of teaching concerning the nature of prayer that helped me this week, and I trust it will help you, and maybe for some of you, revolutionize your approach to prayer. And maybe if that can be changed, at the very beginning, we can begin to move into some areas in terms of your personal prayer life that can change some things. The first thing I want you to see, and this is really very, very basic, but I want you to see it, and if you're taking notes, I want you to write it down. I believe that we need to know that prayer at its very base, at its very foundation, when we are talking about the purpose of prayer, why it was given to us, its fundamental purpose is this, that prayer is not for you, prayer is for God. Got that? That may not make much sense right now, but I want you to hang on to it, because I'm going to explain. Fundamentally, prayer is not for you, prayer fundamentally, at its core, is for God. The focus of effectual prayer is first and foremost God. Its aim, its purpose, is that by my praying, the majesty of God will be put on display. John 14, 13 says this. If you ask anything in my name, I will hear it. In order that, now there's the key right there. In order that, a hena purpose clause, in order that you'll get everything you want. In order that you'll feel good. Doesn't say that. If you ask, I will hear, in order that God may be glorified in all of that. The purpose of prayer is to bring glory to God. You got that? Again, in terms of our practice, that may not sink in yet, but I want you to hang with me. The purpose of his working through my prayer when I come to him is that he would get glory. Not so that I would get everything I want. The problem is that for most of us, we have turned that around. We have turned that around very subtly, and often we do not even understand or see the motives that we have got going behind that, but we've turned it around. I go to prayer, and what I do when I have... Oh, by the way, usually when I go to prayer, it's the last-ditch effort, right? It's the thing, it's like a parachute. I hope I don't have to use it, but it's nice to have it there so that in case there's an emergency, I can go to prayer. and kind of come to God and immediately, if that's my perception of what prayer is, then immediately, the only thing I do when I come to God is I come with this great big long list and desperate kinds of things. Lord, get me out of this. And I have this idea that I have to pray as earnestly as I can and I kind of figure that he owes me something and I try like crazy to use words that are going to line him up with what I want and kind of try to convince him that what I want has value and it's valid and all this kind of thing. There's some teaching going around these days that would lead you to believe. Now, it's not like they would say this, but it would lead you to believe that fundamentally when I come into prayer, if you really want your prayer to be effectual, what you need to do is really impress God with yourself. Here I am, Lord, and I'm here to tell you that I believe in you and I have faith in you and I'm going to name it and claim it and it's going to be mine and I just kind of go into prayer and I impress him with how much faith I have and how much confidence I have and hey, isn't this great Lord, I'm really here and I just kind of wow him, you know? He couldn't possibly resist me. I want you to know something at the very core of prayer, at the very foundation of prayer is this, that I come into the presence of God so that he can impress me with who he is. I don't go into prayer thinking, here I am Lord and I've got all these petitions and boy, I'll tell you, I just believe and you're going to be moved and you can't even hardly not answer this because it's just so great. I go into prayer with one fundamental focus and that is to come into His presence and see Him for who He is, exactly who He is. And I see His power and I see His glory and I see His majesty and I see His sovereignty and I say, Lord, in my life, I put You in Your rightful place as sovereign King of my life. and I bow my knee before you in submission. I need, the first thing I need to do when I come into prayer is I need to see God for who He is. An old saint put it this way, true prayer brings my mind to the immediate awareness of God's glory. You got that? It brings my mind, true prayer brings my mind to the immediate awareness of God's glory and then it holds it there until my soul has been properly impressed. Prayer at the very core, the focus of prayer is to overwhelm you, first of all, with who God is. Genesis 28, verse 20, we see Jacob. Perfect illustration of someone who didn't do that. Who came to God making all sorts of demands and kind of bargaining with him. a real demonstration of someone who didn't come into God's presence with a sense of awe and respect and getting a perspective of who God really was before he started rattling off all his little deals. He came to God in verse 20 of Genesis 28 and says this. He made a vow. He says, God, I'll make a vow with you, and it's this. If God, if you will be with me on my journey, and if you will give me food to eat, and if you will give me clothes to wear, and return me safely to my father's home, then, God, you will be my God. What a neat deal. Isn't that nice of Jacob to make a deal like that? In other words, God, if you do it my way, if you do what I want, if you give me every little thing I want, I'll believe all this stuff about prayer. I'll believe all this stuff about the Spirit. I'll believe all this stuff about God. I'll make you a deal. You do what I want, and I'll kind of come along and give you a little tip of my hat. Something's been twisted around. Something's gone backwards there. We act so infantile. We come to God like Jacob comes to God, and then we don't see the power in our prayer, and we don't see God working through our prayer, and we come away just kind of feeling gypped. We feel, oh, he didn't answer my prayer, and I don't see any value, and I don't see any purpose. I never get what I want. I think many of us need to grow up. in terms of what it means to pray and how it is that we come to God. The purpose is not to come to God with every little whim and want that I have on the tip of my tongue just flowing toward Him. The purpose of prayer fundamentally at the focus is to come into His presence and realizing that I am coming to the throne of grace and I am in the presence of the angels and the archangel and the cherubim and the seraphim and the... And I think as believers we need to be overwhelmed sometimes with who our God is. And you know what? When I see God for who he is, my response is much like Isaiah's. I put my hand on my mouth. I am a man of unclean lips. And it just makes all those little demands I put on God look so defiled. I need to see God for who he is first. And when I see God for who he is, it changes my prayer. It changes my prayer. It changes my praying. It leads me to confession. It leads me to repentance. I bow my knee before the Father, having put him in his rightful place, but I want to tell you something. I can't leave you there. I can't leave you just sitting there with this sense of overwhelming awe that he is the creator and I have unclean lips and all that kind of thing. For if I left you there, you'd never come with a request, would you? You'd be too afraid. What could I possibly do to move upon his power to grant the desire of my heart? Step two in prayer. And the point here is that what I'm trying to pull you into is that we need to get the priority right. The first thing I need to do is come and recognize His majesty. The second thing is this, though. Once I have seen His majesty, recognized His power and His glory, that He is sovereign, the second thing that hits me like a ton of bricks is this, that this one who is all power and is all glory and is all majesty has said to me, Come unto me, all ye that labor, and I'll give you rest. You come into my presence, and you're welcome, and you belong in this throne room. And I have said that you can come, and I want you to come on this basis, crying, Abba, Father, Daddy, you belong here, Dave. And when I come into that throne room and I see his power, I also am overwhelmed with the fact that it's okay to be there. And that changes how I pray, too. And I am not demanding any more, but there is a confidence that is building up in me that says this, this one who is power and glory has said it's okay to be there, and he has the resource, and his greatest desire is to bless his children. Our Father, having all the resources of heaven to dispense to his children, and that is his desire, develops tremendous confidence in my praying. all through the Old Testament we see this pattern over and over again with David with Daniel with Jeremiah Isaiah Jonah when he was in the fish they had these terrible problems insurmountable things that were going to just consume their lives and they didn't just go running into God's presence with all their demands get this all fixed the first thing they would do would begin to praise God for who he was for his majesty and his power one of the neatest places to see that as Jeremiah 32, in deep dismay because his ministry didn't seem to be moving the way he wanted, and people weren't responding. And in chapter 32, he begins this long doxology of praise to God, and he's going on and on concerning his attributes and concerning his power. And finally, after he goes on and says, you have made the heavens and the earth, his conclusion is just finally this, nothing is too difficult for thee, coming away with tremendous confidence in terms of his request. and he gets real specific. Yes, I come to God with a realization that the focus is him, and I need to be overwhelmed by who he is. But that results in the realization that the one who is on that throne is also my father, and his greatest desire is to dispense to his children every good gift. And so it is that Paul says at the end of Ephesians, with all these resources, believer, I want you to pray. Always. Three things, real quickly, that I want to touch on in this text. Very, very quickly. We're just going to brush over them. The frequency of prayer, the variety of prayer, and the manner of prayer. First of all, the frequency. That's real easy. All prayer, all petition, in the Spirit, all fervency. Four all's in there, all the time. Prayer is to be the all-encompassing dimension of the believer's life. The main point I want you to catch here is this, that though, yes, there needs to be times in my life when I close that closet door and I am alone with God and I am on my knees and I am verbalizing my prayer, and yes, there needs to be times when we as a congregation come together and bring our requests and our hearts and our praise to God as a group, there also needs to be times, no, I'm saying that wrong, There also needs to be a dimension of my life that is always a prayer, that is constantly involved in what Paul is talking about here, all prayer. Prayer is more than just kneeling down. Prayer is more than doing what we did before. Prayer is fundamentally, in this particular text, a lifestyle, a way of life. How different that is from the prayer that we are so familiar with, where it's prescribed and the words are set and we read it from a book or it's involved in all sorts of ceremony and involved in all sorts of ritual and I've got to wear a shawl or I've got to read it out of a book or I've got to play with some beads or something like that. After a while when I begin to see the lifestyle of this kind of prayer, those things look, again, nothing short of sinful. And I want you to catch something here too. I don't have time to go real deeply into this, But this kind of praying that is basically a lifestyle of prayer that is constantly letting everything in my life go through the grid of being offered to God as a prayer is absolutely parallel to the filling of the Spirit. There are three constants in the believer's life. The one constant is this, be being continually filled with the Spirit, be being continually letting the Word of Christ dwell in you richly, the Word of God, and this, pray always. everything I do everything I think everything I feel is going through the grid of his majesty one his majesty and two his ability to meet that need his ability to to move me out of that temptation temptation comes what do I do? two things one I get a picture of his power and his majesty and his glory and he is the king and the second thing I do is that he is able to give me the strength to resist and I go into prayer and I bring that to him. And my pain, I bring it to him right now. Be praying at all times. The frequency of prayer, the variety of prayer. Second thing. With all prayer and all petition. That's at the very beginning of the verse. I like this one. The key here again is that word all. All prayer. All petition. It simply means this. All different kinds. That's all it means. If you're doing a study here, that's all it means. It just means with all different kinds of prayer, with all different styles of prayer, with all different methods of prayer, you pray. All different ways, all the time. Variety. I think this is real important that you understand this. There are some new believers with us. There are some believers who have been here for many, many years. And you need to understand that there is no right way or wrong way to pray. I want to take that back. There is a wrong way to pray. The wrong way to pray is believing that there's a right way to pray. Okay, tried. The wrong way to pray is really believing that there is some sort of format, that there is some sort of structure. And I want to tell you something else. There's an awful lot of people that I run into that are real intimidated by prayer because of this very thing. They think that there is some sort of form, there are some sort of words that I need to be able to say, and until I learn how to do it, I'm never going to do it. Certainly not in public. I think we need to understand what prayer is. Prayer is not a matter of making a speech, beloved. You pray at all times, and you pray all different ways. Sometimes you pray in private, and sometimes you pray in public. And sometimes you pray out loud, and sometimes you pray silently. And sometimes you're going to pray with a loud cry, and sometimes it's going to be a soft whisper. Sometimes it's going to be a request. Other times it's going to be thanksgiving. Sometimes it's going to be confession. Other times it's going to be kneeling. Sometimes standing. One account in the Word of God. The guy had his head between his knees and he was praying. Pounding his chest, lying down, riding in a car, sitting by a stove, jogging on your jogging path, doing what you're doing. Pray all the time, all different ways. This kind of praying is simply this. If I could put it in the simplest terms, it's simply practicing the presence of Christ every moment of the day. praying at all times all different ways practicing the presence of Christ every single moment of the day and every time I move into something I open up the car door on my car everything I do is going through the grid of his presence with me and his majesty and his ability and desire to give me the strength to do what he's called me to do today, tomorrow, and the next day I want to say this even as a warning don't you dare ever think that for one moment that in anything that you are doing whether it's right now or later on this afternoon that there is anything that you are doing that you are not dependent on the power of God to do in terms of developing something supernatural out of your life the Bible says men ought always to pray and not to faint and I think those are two options you have Because if you don't pray, you will faint. If you're not seeing your source of power and direction and enablement to do the supernatural that God's called you to do, you will faint. A lot of talk is going around about people who burn out. Christianity Today had a feature article on that. I believe the greatest source of people burning out is just that. And I'm talking about my own heart, too, in this. That I sense myself just going nuts and absolutely frayed at my wits end when I'm functioning on a level that is dependent on my ability to hold everything together. Because I can't, and neither can you. So Paul says, I want you to pray all the time, and I want you to pray all different ways all day long. Final thing is this, the manner in which to pray. The manner is simply this. Pray in this way or with this in view, in this manner, on the alert, with all perseverance. Be aware. Be alert when you pray. I have a problem sometimes. Sometimes even this kind of thing happens at prayer meeting where we have a big long list of requests. And what happens? You get into a little group or we pray as a group. And somebody just reads down the list, you know, like that. I don't, maybe you're really interacting with it. I don't know. I can't do that. My impression is that when you read down a list and just say it the way it is, that I'm not being alert, and I'm not interacting with that person's pain, and I'm not giving myself to that. When you pray, pray alert. Be aware. I also think that means get specific. You know, when you pray with a little kid, or I pray with my little ones when they go to bed, they have a tendency to say things like, God, I just want you to bless the whole world. And we pray that way too. God bless the missionaries. God bless our church. God bless the pastor. God bless my friend. What does that mean? What do you expect to happen when you pray that way? It's like when my kid prays for the whole wide world to be blessed. It's like a magic wand goes over the whole world and they feel good for a little while. Zap! Pastor, I prayed that he'd be blessed. He feels good right now. What does that mean? I need to get specific. That's what it means to be alert when I pray. But what if you don't know? What if I don't know? Let's say the Lord puts somebody here on my heart to pray for you, or the Lord here puts me on one of your hearts to pray for, or a friend of yours to pray for, and you really don't know how to pray, because you don't really know what the specific thing is. Two things I'd like to suggest to you. One is this. When you go to prayer and you don't know what the specific thing is, at least acknowledge before the Lord that you don't know the specific thing. And I know that may sound real silly, but I think that's part of being alert when you pray. It's not just thoughtlessly offering a prayer and just mouthing words. You're coming to God and saying, Lord, this person is on my heart, and I don't know the struggle they're going through right now. They may be 500 miles away right now, but they have come to my mind and I want to pray for them alertly. But I've got another suggestion for you. If somebody comes to your mind and you want to pray for them, and you don't know why it's coming into your mind, and you want to pray for them, call them up and ask them. God has put you on my heart, friend, and I want to pray for you, but I want to know what's kicking the slats out of your life. And they might not know anything, that's fine. But you do that, and you see how that develops in the body. How do you feel when you know someone's praying for you every day by name? Some of you have come to me and told me that. That means a world to me. That needs to be a body thing. And that happens, doesn't it? Doesn't that happen to you during the course of a week? Somebody's name comes into your mind. Pray for that person. And then call that person. And say, I'm praying for you. And if you can't give me something specific, I'm going to pray anyway. But I want to know if there's something that I can just really zero in on for you, that God would give you strength. When you pray, pray alert. And when you start, keep it up. Perseverance. Be alert and persevere when you do it. Paul said this to the church in Thessalonica, I pray for you night and day with tears. I don't think he was on his knees all day long. And he wasn't on his knees all night long. He had a lifestyle that was continually facing everything he did, and it was going through the grid of offering that to God. And every time it came to his mind, he brought him to the throne. one last thing I want you to get past when we pray let's as a church and I just want to put my arms around you here as a congregation as your pastor let as a church let's get past the physical let's get past the physical please hear me the physical is important and Jesus Christ is the healer and he meets my physical needs there is no doubt about it but it's about like what I said before It's about priority, and it's about focus. The real issue, believer, is not just my physical need. The real issue is that David Johnson would have victory in the spiritual battle that he's involved in, and you the same thing. The real issue is the warfare. The real issue is the battle. What's killing us, I see us in prayer meeting as we bring our requests, what's killing us as individuals isn't my stubbed toe. It's the fact that my heart is not at rest. And I can't get along with my wife. And I can't get along with my husband. And my kids are driving me nuts. And we never pray for that. Yes, we do. We need to do more. We need to do more. People, let us pray. Let us pray for the advance of the kingdom in people's lives. Let us pray that families would be healed. Hearts would be broken before their Lord. That hearts would be mended before their Lord. That people would come to know Christ. That revival would come. Pray always. All different kinds of ways. Alert and all the time. Persevere when you pray. Verse 19, Paul said this. Pray for me. On my behalf. And what I want you to pray for is this. Since I'm in prison and it looks like I'm about to die and his chain is rubbing my leg raw so the bugs are all over it and it's bleeding all the time, I want you to pray that everything gets better that way. He didn't say that. He said, I want you to pray for my spiritual need. And that is this. I want you to pray that utterance may be given to me, that I may speak with boldness as I ought to speak. And I want you to know that he prayed for the physical too. In the 21st verse he says this. I also want you to know that I'm sending Tychicus along with the message, and he's going to give you all my circumstances. So you pray for those other things, but the priority that I want you to pray for me is that I would win in the warfare. And that's what we need to pray for each other about. You know what? With all this exhortation to pray that is laid at the feet of every believer, at mine, at yours, that is an individual thing, God has called you to pray always, all the time, all different ways, alertly with perseverance. There's one other thing that I've got to give you, and that's this. You can't do it alone. You can't do it alone. I can't win the war alone, and neither can you. And that's why Paul says, when you pray, you pray for the saints, and I want you to pray for me. and I stand before you this morning with that same request that Paul has. I want you to pray for me and I will pray for you and you pray for each other. And I believe just as I close that right now as we sit here, even as I have been sharing these things, that names have been going through your mind. And God has put a name on your heart, a friend, maybe a loved one, maybe an elder in our church, maybe someone that you, maybe for some strange reason a name has come into your heart and into your mind of somebody you don't even see hardly ever. Would you do something right now? Either remember it or right now when you sit there, write that name down. Would you do that right now? Write that name down. Remember it in your mind. And now get specific, and that means this afternoon if that person's name is on your mind, I want you to call them. and find out what it is that's kicking the slats out of his life and pray for him. And then when you call him and find out what it is, with all prayer and petition at all times in the Spirit, in this manner be on the alert, with all perseverance and petition for all the saints, I want you to pray. I want to just close this study just exactly the way Paul did without anything added. peace be to the brethren and love with faith from God the Father and Lord Jesus Christ grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with a love incorruptible and thus we end the book of Ephesians let's pray Lord Jesus we don't learn to pray by hearing a sermon on prayer Father move in our hearts to do that which will unlock and enable us to perform the supernatural lifestyle that you have called us to. I ask these things in your name. Amen. Amen.
