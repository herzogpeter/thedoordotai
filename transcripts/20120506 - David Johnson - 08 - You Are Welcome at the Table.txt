Lord, even as I say that, prepare ourselves for the table, I'm just aware we're just coming from stuff, coming from life. Something that's good and energetic, a lot of it's connected to you, a lot of it's not. And so we just bring that to you and ask you to help us dial in. Be in a place where we can receive and hear and see and come to your table. And for the kind of life that can only be generated by your Spirit, we pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, as most of you know, if you've been part of Open Door for a while. On the last weekend, or the first weekend of every month, we change the order of things. We change kind of the rhythm of things to come around and to focus on, as best we can, the table that is the Lord's, because it's the Lord's table, to which we come, to which we've been invited, at which we are welcome, which actually is a theme that I think it's important to return to from time to time, to simply remind ourselves as we come to the table, that this is a table to which we can come, to which we've been invited, at which we are welcome. And in light of what we began to talk about last week with respect to women and men, not just in marriage, but in ministry, and how for centuries, particularly in Jesus' day, women had been excluded, effectively marginalized, not just from ministry, but literally kind of marginalized in life. I thought it might be fitting to return to this theme today as a way to prepare ourselves for the table that is the Lord's table. Because women, particularly in Jesus' day, as we began to unpack last week, knew what it felt like to not be included, to not be invited, to not be welcome. Indeed, that got communicated to women in Jesus' day in a variety of ways, and it kind of consistently came at them from a variety of directions. And among the most obvious, particularly in Jesus' day, was how women were treated, even in the context of marriage. Because men in Jesus' day were allowed to divorce their wives for pretty much any cause at all. And because they were allowed to divorce their wives for pretty much any cause at all, they did for pretty much any cause at all, which is precisely what the showdown that we talked about a few weeks ago in Matthew 19 between Jesus and the Pharisees was really all about when he calls them to account and not just with anger, but with grief. Because as he was seeing how men were treating their wives and how religious systems were even supporting that, his grief was simply this, that from the beginning it's not been this way, but at a very practical level. One of the reasons Jesus reacted to the Pharisees who were kind of promoting this divorce your wife for any cause was because he knew in that culture for a woman to be discarded by a man was in many cases a death sentence with no way to support herself living in the streets, some resorting therefore to prostitution, not because they'd like that, but that was the only way they could stay alive, which sounds maybe bizarre to us, but actually it reminds me of the young girls I told you about last week, some of whom I met in Haiti a few weeks ago, who had been pretty much discarded themselves, living in the street, discarded for, I don't know, any cause at all. So living on the street and starving, this is not 2,000 years ago, this is right now, they'd be offered a dollar and a quarter for sex, and they would take it so they could eat, but they'd still be starving. A desperate situation, particularly in Jesus' day and ours for women. But there were many other things in Jesus' day that communicated in a variety of ways that women weren't included, weren't invited, were not welcome. In a court of law, they weren't welcome. Woman couldn't be a witness because she wasn't considered reliable. She wasn't considered trustworthy. In the temple, women weren't welcome, not permitted to study the Torah were women. Even the structure of the temple itself kind of communicated this subtle but, wow, pretty obvious message at the same time. we've talked about the structure of the temple, kind of a circular thing. And on the outside is what's called the courtyard of the Gentiles. And in the courtyard of the Gentiles, everyone could mingle, Jews and Gentiles, men and women, young and old, slave and free. But one courtyard in, not so many people welcome, just Jews. And one courtyard in from there, even fewer people welcome, now just men and Jewish men, no women there, which sends this message. You're not included. You're not invited. You're not welcome, at least not here. And it just kind of makes you wonder. At least it makes me wonder. What did it do to the psyche? What did it do to the spirit of a young Jewish girl who loved the Lord her God with all her heart and with all her soul and with all her mind, but was told in a variety of ways? You're not included. You're not invited. You're not welcome, at least not here. But here's the kicker. as I was thinking about this this week and even coming to the table, because women weren't the only ones who were getting messages of exclusion, who got this feeling of being out. Because in Jesus' day, Gentiles were out, and children were out, and anyone deemed to be unclean was out. And because there were so many ways in Jesus' day by the religious system to be considered unclean seemed like pretty much everyone was out. Not included, not invited, not welcomed to the table. And all of that is at least part of why. What I want to talk about today as we this morning come to the table that is the Lord's, is this question, who's included and who's not, who's been invited and who's not, who's welcome and who's not. Which as it turns out is a pretty significant question in Jesus' day that lots of people were asking, and they were asking it all the time, particularly of Jesus, in part because Jesus talked a lot about the kingdom of God. And the primary picture that most people in Jesus' day had about the kingdom of God, of what it would be like when the kingdom would fully come, was of among other things, and they had many pictures of it, but one of the primary pictures of the kingdom of God was that it was like a banquet, a great feast, very specifically, a messianic feast. But always the question around the feast, this meal, this table, was this. Who's included and who's not? Who's been invited and who's not? Who is welcome here and who is not? And while they asked Jesus that question, who's in and who's out a lot, they didn't always like his answer a lot because his answer seemed to be. And when they heard it, they'd start poking at it, kind of upset with it, because his answer seemed to be anyone. Anyone, that is, and this is the one caveat, anyone, that is, who wanted to come could. Jew or Greek, slave or free, barbarian or Scythian, circumcised or uncircumcised, clean or unclean, men or women, anyone who wanted to sit at the table and follow his way of living and loving could. It sounds pretty inclusive, but as it turns out, not everybody wanted to come to his party, sit at his table, follow his way. The fact that Jesus makes clear in a number of places, but the one we're going to look at today is a parable that he tells in Luke 14. If you have your Bibles, you can open to that, but you'll see it on the screen as well. It's going to be the text for the morning. Luke 14, beginning in verse 1, which sets the scene with these words, that it came about when he, that is Jesus, went into the house of the Pharisees on the Sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him closely. But while they were watching him, he was watching them, and not particularly liking what he saw and what he sensed in their spirit. He began to tell a story, which is a parable, that will reveal some things, expose some things about a certain man. He says in verse 16, Luke 14, verse 16, tells the story of a certain man who was giving a big dinner, and he invited many. And then at the dinner hour, he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, time for dinner, come, for everything is ready now. But they all alike began to make excuses. Why? Because they didn't want to sit at this table. They didn't want to come to this party. They didn't want to make his way their way, and their excuses were lame. Obviously designed to embarrass the host because we kind of have better things to do, more important things to do. This party isn't cool enough for us. I'm kind of an A-list person, you see, and I'm not sure this party is an A-list party. So I'm afraid I can't come because I just bought some land, it says in verse 18, and I need to see it. Well, there's a good excuse. I got to go look at the land I just bought, and I just bought some oxen, and I need to try them, and I just took a wife. Need I say more? She wants me home, and anyway, I'm going to leave all that alone. Kind of, you know how it is. I would love to come. You know, big smile. No, you wouldn't. You don't want to come to this party, and your excuses are lame. I'd love to be there. Got to do my hair. Got to wash my car. There's a ball game on this afternoon. Otherwise, you and me, I'd be there. Which, by the way, is a fascinating thing. Telling the story, the telling of the story is a fascinating way for Jesus to answer this question, who's included, who's invited, who belongs, who is welcome, because everybody is. Anybody is. Jew, Greek, slave, free, rich, poor, men, women, clean, unclean, but you have to want to be there. And clearly, in the parable, what determines whether you want to be there or not is how you feel about the guy who's throwing the party, which means this story is brilliantly simple. It's part of what made Jesus this brilliant teacher because to understand this deep kingdom truth that's being revealed here, you don't need a degree in theology to figure it out because if you love and respect, have high regard for the person who invited you to this party, you're going to the party. I mean, if you have plans, you're changing the plans if you care about the guy who's throwing the party. It's pretty simple. I think you get it. Even I get this. I have this dream. I've talked about it in different contexts before because I have this disease that I will never recover from. It's called being a fan of the Chicago Cubs. It's like, I can't get over this. And with that disease comes this dream. And the dream is this, that one day in my lifetime, they will show up in the seventh game of the World Series. Dream on. but here's where that dream becomes like this bizarre fantasy because here here's my real fantasy that that they're showing up in the seventh game of the world series and it's going to be the next day and the day before the day before the game i get this phone call from from the star player of the team now in my dream i don't even know who that star player would be because they don't have any of those and and at least now so it's so it's probably in my dream it's it's probably some kid who's not been born yet. I'll be 80 when this happens. Forget the star player. It's the manager. But even better than the manager calling me, like the owner of the Chicago Cubs calls me the day before the seventh game of the World Series. And what he says is this, Dave, want to sit at my table? I know you love the Cubs. Wrigley Field's kind of a deal for you. So you'll want to come to this party. Oh, I got to wash my car. I think I'm changing my plans to come to. You get this, don't you? See, in this parable, Jesus is changing the question, actually, from who belongs at this table, who's included, who's invited, who is welcome, to who actually wants to be there. That's the critical question. And that depends entirely on how you feel about the guy who's throwing the party, who set the table, which raises a pretty good question. It might be good to ask. How do you feel about the one who set this table? How do you feel about this one who's throwing the party? Kind of ho-hum. Oh, I don't know. No big deal. Interesting response. And it's an acceptable response, but it's actually kind of what the host in the parable that Jesus is telling is saying. When he says, in effect, that since the people I want at my table, the criteria here is not at all what you think. The people I want at my table are only the ones who want to be at my table. well, let's go find some people who want to be at my table, who might actually be grateful for some bread and for some wine, at least the kind of bread and wine that I have to give. So he says to his servants, as the parable, the story continues to unfold in Luke 14, 21, go out at once. These guys, party's not cool enough for them, so they're not coming. So go out at once to the streets and the lanes of that city and bring in here the poor and the crippled and the blind and the lame, Because maybe they'll want to come. I don't know. Maybe they'll be grateful. Maybe they'll be eager to come because the only people I want at this party are the people who want to be at the party. But there's more going on here than that. Because whoever the poor and crippled and blind and lame actually are, to the Pharisees who are listening to the story, remember them in verse 1, they're watching Jesus. The poor, crippled, blind, and lame were the wrong kind of people, along with Gentiles, slaves, pagans, children, and women, the wrong kind of people, people who would never be welcome at their table. Indeed, not only did they not include, invite, or welcome those kind of people, they kind of tried to prove their spirituality by how far they stayed away from those kind of people. So Jesus, knowing all of this, presses the issue in this story. When he says this in verse 23. Don't just invite these people. I want you to compel them. Go out into the highways and the hedges and compel them. Convince them that they really are invited. Why? Here's why. Actually, there's a number of reasons why, but here's one reason why. Because the Pharisees weren't the only people who thought that the poor, crippled, blind, and lame were the wrong kind of people, because the poor, crippled, blind, and lame thought that of themselves. They'd heard it all their lives. Not included, not invited, not welcome, not here. But it wasn't just the poor and crippled, blind, and lame who heard that, because the Gentiles heard that, and slaves heard that, and some women heard that, so compel them. He says, go out of your way to convince them, because when you invite them, some of them won't believe you at first, that they're really welcome, that they're really invited. They won't think you're serious, because to a lot of people in Jesus' day, but also to a lot of people in our day, the host of this party, in their mind, is kind of like a king who lives up in a castle and you've caught glimpses of him up there. You've seen some activity up there from a distance. You've heard rumors of him. You've even met some people who say they know him, but they were jerks. So you've never really had much of an interest in going to this party and going to that church. But what if they were wrong about the king? And And what if because the people who said they knew the king were wrong about the king and told you about the king, false things about the king, what if what you think about the king is wrong too? Like what if the king really is good? And what if this party really is rich? And what if he really does want you there? Even with some of your not knowing. Even with some of your not sure. if I could just get you to taste what is at this table. Oh, taste and see that God is good, but, you know, as someone, I'm sitting at this table, I'm at this table, and I want everybody to come to the table, but here's what I know about me, and this is what we kind of know about each other. I can't make you come. I can't make people want this. I can only hope that you'd get a taste of this, because if you do, you'll want more. All we can do is invite people So try to convince people Do everything you can And way beyond sermons like this With how we live and maybe even how we treat people And how we invite people into our lives Try to convince them that this king is good And he wants you at his table So let's ask this question One more time Who's included? Who's invited? who's welcome. Jesus' answer is anyone. But you really have to want to come, and not everybody does. And if you really don't want to come for whatever the reason, then maybe you shouldn't come. Actually, there's two kinds of people who maybe shouldn't come. One would be those who really don't care that much for the host who's throwing the party, who really don't care all that much for the guy who's invited them to the table. In other words, if when this rabbi named Jesus says, come, you say, whatever, then maybe stay away from this. But even to you, you know what I want to say? Do you know you've been invited? You'd be included. you would be welcome. Second kind of person who maybe shouldn't come to this table is a person who, like the Pharisees, actually doesn't like and maybe even resents the kind of people that the host of this party has invited. You know? Like poor people and crippled people and blind and lame people, and there's physically poor and crippled and blind and lame people, and there's emotionally and spiritually crippled, poor, blind, and lame people, And for some people, they're the wrong kind of people. So two questions as I close. Number one, good question to ask as you come to the table. How do you feel about the guy who set the table? How do you feel about the host? Are you grateful at all? And then maybe just a little blown away that someone like him would want someone like you at his table. that's kind of where you're at then come and eat and come and drink second question is this how do you feel about all these other losers who he invited to the table to you know the poor the crippled, the blind and the lame like the person sitting next to you or the person who's talking to you, are you glad that they're here too, with you? Because if you are, then come and eat, and come and drink. Welcome to the party. Let's go to the table. Thank you.
