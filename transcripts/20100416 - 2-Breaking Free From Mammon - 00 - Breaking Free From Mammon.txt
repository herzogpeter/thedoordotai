Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Be a people who are willing to live in the light, to let people dig in your dirt. And we just talk about that all the time in a variety of ways, and it's intriguing to have that applied to what we're going to talk about today. Father, come by the power of your Spirit and give life to this Word for eyes that are open, hearts that are open, and eager to follow. I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, born of our study in the book of Colossians that most of you know we've been in since around September, particularly in the second chapter of late where Paul proclaims Jesus to be, among other things, the one in whom is hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, wisdom and knowledge about life and how to live it, about what the good life really is. We began last week to wonder how that wisdom and knowledge can be applied to or found in the very practical and tangible arena of our finances, of our money. And if you were here last week, you may recall that I concluded the talk with what, for some of you, might have sounded a bit surprising, maybe even a little strange when I said, quite matter-of-factly, that Jesus talked more about money than any other single thing. More than heaven or hell, more than love or forgiveness, anger or pride, lust or salvation. Jesus talked about drachmas and shekels and talents and gold, which actually does surprise a lot of people because a lot of people don't necessarily associate Jesus or his teaching with things so practical. So, everyday earthy as money. Many times in our minds, his teaching is kind of reserved for more ethereal things, more spiritual things, more kind of heaven when you die kind of things. all important things, but not everyday practical things like money. But he did. And it wasn't because he was in constant fundraising mode. In fact, Jesus was pretty much homeless. He had his needs met in a variety of ways, but there was no home he owned. His ministry had no set location or buildings to support like ours. None of his disciples were on salary. He paid taxes by pulling coins out of fish mouths, which was nice. I wish I could do that. And his entire finance department consisted of Judas, which I'm glad we don't have. And it wasn't because of the culture he lived in. You know this. We've talked about this a lot. Or the people he spoke to were affluent. It wasn't because of that. Constantly being bombarded with and overwhelmed by appeals to consumerism and materialism. No, we know the vast majority of the people that Jesus lived with and interacted with, spoke to, were peasants. So he didn't talk about money to confront them for their materialism or their consumerism. Indeed, here's why he did it. This is the bottom line. Because Jesus knew what we're coming to know, and that is this, that regardless of what people had or don't have, few things have more power on earth to capture the human heart, to reveal things about the heart, to deceive the heart like money, which is where Paul's warning in Colossians 2, verse 8, which is our text last week and this week both, where he says, See to it that no one takes you captive to the empty deception of the traditional thinking of man. That's kind of my paraphrase of that. And the elementary principles of the world rather than according to Christ. because money, among other things, lies, promising things that it cannot provide, but it lies so convincingly that some would say that it's actually become the number one rival to God for the human heart. Because if you feel vulnerable, for instance, money promises it's a lie, but money promises to make you feel secure. So it's a source of security, which means if it is, it has God-like characteristics and power. And while we say we believe in God and we do and sing of trusting him because we do, money is what helps me sleep at night if I have it and keeps me up at night if I don't and helps me face my future with either confidence or fear. So don't be messing, not just with my money, Be with my source of security. Don't be. Just stay away. That kind of almost angry stay-away energy, when talk of money begins to stir, explains, at least in part, why it is so hard, in fact, to talk about money sometimes. Because, quite frankly, it's none of your business. So just stay away. It's interesting, this last week at Message Team, which meets every week and we just talk about where we're going in the text or whatever theme we happen to be on and as we talked about this it was interesting as we were talking and reflecting on how in recent years particularly among men I mean women do this too but there's kind of been this real shift among men I remember years ago talking to men because you never talk and you never reveal but in recent years and all the guys at the door men and women at the message team but we're talking about how in recent years people have become more and more open about talking particularly with people that they really trust, about intimate details of their life, but would sooner talk about intimate details of their life, like even talking about sex and struggles with sex and addictions that they might be battling, would much sooner talk about those things very freely, kind of a new thing for a lot of us, much freer to talk about that than talk about our money. There's something that just kind of comes up, how you get it, how you use it, or lose it or hoard it or give it, just stay awake. A strong hesitance. But Jesus didn't hesitate. Indeed, there's a fascinating story in Mark chapter 12 where Jesus is sitting in front of the treasury at the temple with his disciples doing something that would be kind of rude. He's watching people give, put their offerings in, their tithes, their offerings into the treasure. He's watching what their giving, and he didn't glance away embarrassed as if it was none of his business. No, he watched, and he discerned, and then he said out loud, this is really bad, that what they gave and how they gave meant something. It revealed something about who they were and what they loved and who they served. The point is this, that how we handle the resources of our lives, particularly our financial resources means something relative to our life in the kingdom of God, which leads to the first thing I want to kind of touch on and use to set the stage, actually to kind of reestablish as a starting point in our discussion this morning, because we've talked about this before, but if we're going to get into this, I want to reestablish this as a starting point, because it's all about our life in the kingdom of God. It's this, that this issue of how we spend the resources of our lives is not a peripheral issue, but central to the gospel that we preach, to the mission and the message of Christ, and to the story of God, a story into which we have been invited as players, as participants, in partnership with him, in seeing this story, this kingdom story, be unveiled, come kind of through us, actually, to the world. And the story, as you know, begins with God, particularly as it relates to his resources. Because though he was rich, 2 Corinthians 8 verse 9, possessing as it were all the resources that belonged to him as God, all the resources of heaven, if you will, he did not store those resources, grasp them, hold onto them, stay in heaven with them, but freely gave them. Because though he was rich, says 2 Corinthians 8 verse 9, if for our sakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might become rich. Not so that we could become storers and hoarders ourselves to just keep it for ourselves, but rather to enter into the story of God. The question is always a kingdom question. How do we enter into the story? How do we enter into this pattern that God has set for us as participants with him in the unfolding purposes of his kingdom, entering into the very same pattern of taking the resources we have and giving them away and putting them into play. This pattern, this pattern is precisely why. Among other reasons, my contention is this, that this issue of how we spend the resources of our lives is not peripheral, but absolutely central to the gospel that we preach, to the message and the mission of Christ, to the story of God. But here's the deal. As I was thinking about that this week, and I was kind of writing that and kind of reestablishing, I want to say this thing again and kind of bring us back to this bottom line truth. What dawned on me was this, and I may be wrong about this, but I don't think I am. I'm actually pretty sure that a significant number of people here at Open Door, in this room right now, maybe most of you already believe what I just said. You really do. There's no argument at all. you're quite convinced that this thing, how we handle the resources, it really is. You've heard us talk about this before. You're convinced of it, and you want to live like that. But we don't always, or we can't. Sometimes because, as I said last week, we've already been deceived and taken captive by, again, what Paul calls in Colossians chapter 2, the tradition of men and the elementary principles of the world relative to money. Indeed, in ways we can't always see, because we do get deceived sometimes, we end up bowing down to mammon. And when we bow down to mammon, we become its slave. Mammon. Talked about that last week. I want to just kind of bring that up again. Mammon, just so you remember, is not a reference to money. Jesus, in Matthew 6, 24, and other places, says, you cannot serve God and mammon. Some of your Bibles say money, but it isn't money. Mammon isn't money. Mammon is a spirit behind money, if you will, whose job it is to get you and me to believe that money is not just a resource, but a source of life and hope and joy and peace and security. And if we believe that, that money is not just a resource, but it's a source of life and joy and peace, then you will pursue it as if it had the power to give you life. And you will grasp it and hoard it and store it. You might even steal it, ultimately becoming a slave to it, having been taken captive. Back to the text. By the elementary, by the empty deception and the traditional thinking, if you will, of men and the elementary principles of this world empowered by a spiritual force in the world called mammon. All of which brings us to the question of the day. The work I want to do today. And the question is this. Given the fact that we have been deceived in a variety of ways and ways we don't even know and that to varying degrees we have all been taken captive. Here's the question. How do we break free from the grip of mammon? Ways in which we're not even aware we're in the grip. Ways we may be very painfully aware of the grip. How do we break free? How do we walk out of what I described last week as this kind of Egypt where we have lived as slaves. Well, before I answer that directly, let me just say this, that for some of us, this journey out of Egypt could be a very long journey and not without some pain. So if you're looking for a quick fix and a painless solution, you may have to look somewhere else. But as you might find resistance coming up in you, just keep this in mind that maybe it was looking for quick fixes and painless solutions that got some of us into the trouble we're in right now to begin with that dug for us, the holes that some of us are in right now. So let's begin together as a community to take some steps in a different direction, a direction that might just lead us eventually out of this Egypt place where we have lived as slaves. Step number one is actually a pretty significant step, but you might even call it a baby steps. Step number one is this. Tell yourself the truth. Tell yourself the truth. We have to break the silence. I love that phrase, and it has echoes of history here at Open Door. I remember in the early days at Open Door, everything was about breaking the silence. Anybody here from Open Door at the early days? Break the silence. I mean, we wrote books about breaking the silence on all sorts of stuff, and we were stumbling on a fundamental spiritual reality. The things you can't talk about, the things you hide in the dark are the things that enslave you. And in those early days, we were talking about breaking the silence about our addictions, about alcohol, about sexual abuse, about sexual addiction. And it was incredible. And people were getting freaked because we were finally talking about what none of us knew how to talk about. And out of bringing it into the light and finding grace for those things, there was incredible healing. But all of that stuff, we know so well. and the roots of breaking the silence and breaking the no-talk rule and seeing how that sets people free needs to be applied to this as well. So tell yourself the truth about where you are on this, about how you really live and how you really give and what you really waste. Because the number one problem generally in this arena of life, like other arenas of life where we've become enslaved, is denial. Particularly if the problem is debt or what you actually spend on this or that. And the best way to stay in denial is to simply not know or pretend you don't, to not look, to just keep it in the dark. I've got to tell you, I feel a little weird talking about this, but I just can't not say this. It's got to be one of my wife's biggest pet peeves about this wonderful person you're listening to. And honestly, early in our marriage, and I'm setting you up there to lie, because when I say early in our marriage, I don't have a problem now. No, it was bigger early in our marriage. This thing still pops up again from time to time. And the thing I remember her saying, around our money, it's like she would sit down every once in a while, and sometimes with tears, it's like you just don't want to know. And one of the reasons I'm free to say that, I've shared that with a few people, and I found out I'm not the only person like that. It's like, Dave, you are not like this in any other arena of your life. There's like a fierce desire on your part to pull things out into the light and tell most people more than they want to know. But Dave, around this, it's like you just don't want to know. and then I get all it's really by the way if you're being confronted by your wife on stuff like this don't get all spiritual it's well honey you know the Bible says oh she punches me when I say the Bible says every time anyway our God will supply all our need as a pretext for being so unbelievably irresponsible I'll never forget first time that this was several years ago but she actually started tracking and we were in on that together what we spent where we got to do this and it wasn't like she was doing it with me resisting we were all in that together yeah we got to do that we got to get a grip on this so she started tracking several years ago everything where everything went and she came and said so Dave do you know how much we spend on you know going out to dinner how much we spend on caribou coffee whatever it is and And you know what I said? I'm just kind of giving you clues on what not to do, guys, especially. Here was my brilliant answer. Not that much. What, you idiot? Truth is, I had no clue. Here's the deal. Here's the deal. We need to treat this arena of our lives like we would any other arena of our life. To be a people who live in the light of what is true about our sin. I mean, this just applies across the world about our anger, about our pride, and our lust, and our money. 1 John 1, 5, God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all. So if we say we have fellowship with God who is light, but we live in the dark, we lie about having fellowship with God. Because you can't be in fellowship with God and hide at the same time. So here's the question. Do you even know? Are you telling yourself the truth about how you use it, how you lose it, how you give it? Second point or question, are you telling anyone else the truth? I think we need to be accountable. And again, I see the value of this in other arenas of life. If someone was struggling with sexual addiction, and you know this is true, or alcohol, huge issue. Be accountable. Tell somebody else, have someone else know about your stuff, if you will. But here, again, is where this obsessive secrecy manifests again, where sometimes, as I said a moment ago, even people who can share intimate details of, for instance, things about their sex life or struggle with addiction can't share this one around money as easily. So here's the question. Does anybody know that you're in trouble? Are you accountable? Several years ago, I was just getting to know Steve Weins and Stephan Van Voorst. And one of the things that drew me to them, or many things actually, but one of the things that drew me to them was how they did relationship with each other. But also, they talked about this group of guys that they were in. And they didn't just talk about it as a group of guys that they liked and hung with, but it was a covenant group. And they'd been together for years. And in this covenant, they kind of came into it as some guys who really did like each other and respect each other. And so they felt very safe with each other. Some baseline things you need there. But they made some decisions. We are going to make some promises to each other about how we do relationship together. It was a covenant. And one of them was we're going to be accountable to each other about every arena of our life. There can't be any secrets. And the other thing was we're going to submit to each other. And I remember, you know, the covenant was cool. the accountability, I get it. And then they talked about, you know, so if I bring some major issue in my life to my covenant group, and they just go, man, Steve or Stephan, this isn't wise. I'm going to submit to them. And I kind of remember just kind of felt like, that's beautiful. I'm thinking, whoa, that's weird. And then what happened? Steve needed a car. Steve weans. And he found one that he liked, kind of got the numbers and picked the model. But before he signed the deal, true to his word, he's in this group, he brought this whole idea and the car possibility to this group. But there was a problem. See, the car that he kind of got his eye on was a nice car. It was kind of a fast car. It was not just a Honda Civic. It was a Honda Civic SI. Six-speed transmission, 18-inch wheels, cool car. Actually, I told him I was going to tell this story, and I said, your car's a Honda, I've ridden in the car, it's cool, Honda S, and he goes, S-I, so he knows, and so he brought this idea, this car that was kind of cool to this group, and the group listening to him said, yes, Steve, we think, we think, if they would have said no, he would not have bought the car, but they said yes, man, that's a good idea, this all adds up, it makes sense for you, go ahead and do it with our blessing, all of which, by the way, brings another lesson, and I'm just trying to help you here, especially the guys, but there's other applications for women, I'm sure, that if you're going to be in an accountability group like this, and you do like cars, make sure the people in it like cars, because you can get some, anyway, I had a woman came up to me after, and she loved that, and said, you know, I'm in a group, and they all like shoes, go figure. i will submit to you no i don't think you spend too much anyway yeah you know busted we're all busted but seriously now this is serious um does anyone speak to in in does anyone speak into your life on this? Would you let anyone? I mean, that's really a new thing for a lot of us. We could see it maybe in what we're watching and sexual things and alcohol things. But what about here? Third thing, to get free from this and begin to step one step at a time out of Egypt and stop and think about how you think. Stop and think about how you think and get a grip on how you live. See, Every once in a while, every one of us need a dose of reality, just kind of a shot from the outside that kind of reminds us of some actually real obvious truth about money that is obvious, but we won't look at it if we don't think about it. Like if you spend more than you have, over time, you'll sink the ship. Indeed, you'll put yourself in a kind of financial bondage that requires no demon. It requires no work of mammon, like, oh, this is the devil. to secure. We pierce ourselves. Paul says in 1 Timothy 6 verse 10, we pierce ourselves with many a pang. Lots of us lose our grip early with credit card debt and stuff we thought we had to have. In fact, another thing in the message team we talked about was that it was, it's not just money, it's the stuff. We don't, I want more, I don't have any money because it's the stuff. I'm wasting it on. Dave Ramsey, a guy who is teaching we are likely going to use in some weeks to come that we're going to offer around finances and things like that, says this. I quote a whole bunch of us. Got all this stuff that we don't really need with money we really didn't have to impress people we really didn't like. So stop and think. It's a huge thing. Little tiny, stop and think about how you think and get a grip on how you live and begin to wonder, what has begun to sound like wisdom to me? What stupid things, I don't want to sound disrespectful here, but what stupid things have I come to believe that if I would stop and think, I really don't believe because if you'd stop and think, they would look as stupid as they are. Terry Steinmeier this week told me about a website called The Big Lie. And The Big Lie, according to this website, is if you look at statistics, it says that the average credit card debt by most Americans, average American credit card debt is like $9,000. So that's across the board. And this person's saying that's a big lie. And that the fact is, according to this website, 55% of Americans have no credit card debt at all. They've really learned how to manage this thing. And the reason she was trying to expose all this was because, and the reason the average is so high, she said it's like going out to dinner and there's four people there and one of them is Bill Gates. So the average income is huge. And the reason, the thing she was confronting was the fact that if people kind of go, the average is 9,000, if my credit card is there, I just kind of feel like I'm just like this with everybody else. No, not everybody else is in that. And you gotta stop and think about what's gotten you into this hole and some people have figured out how not to do it. And you can too. so stop and think and then this presses to another one stop and think uh number four here when is enough enough and and because if you don't stop and think about that you will without thinking slide right into the tradition of men and the elementary principles of the world because conventional wisdom says if you can afford more buy more and here's something i would like you to stop and think about just because you can afford it doesn't mean you have to buy it whoa you know this um but let's say you do buy it so you buy a house and and it meets your needs and that's great and this is this pattern a lot of us get into um so you get a raise and that's wonderful and now you can afford a bigger house and maybe you even need a bigger house but but let's just not talk about need right now let's just talk about you can afford a bigger house uh so you buy a bigger house and you really can't afford it so i mean well of course you would buy a bigger house. Why? Of course you would. It would almost be stupid not to. Who wouldn't do that? So you do buy a bigger house, but now you need new furniture because you have more rooms, so you got to fill those rooms. And then what's really bad is the new furniture you brought in for the new rooms makes the old furniture look really bad. And now I'm in a new neighborhood, and so the old car I'm driving, I just can't even drive that thing in this neighborhood. And on and on and on. You know how it goes. And I'm not saying it's a bad user. Never buy this, but stop and think. What would happen if we stopped to think? When is enough? Enough. It's a great question. How do we want to live? Stop, stop, stop, stop. How do we want to live as kingdom people? And all of a sudden, we're maybe getting something we didn't expect. More money than we thought we ever would have. I know that's not a problem for everybody, but it actually is. I know a couple in our church I have a very high regard for who do quite well, but you'd never know it. You just wouldn't. because a long time ago they said, very quietly, enough. It's enough. It's enough. Right here is enough. Live in a nice home, but it's modest. And because they chose that. And they didn't choose it just to avoid the crippling effects of debt, though they did. But truly, they did that from a kingdom perspective. It isn't all ours. It's not all ours. And God's given us more than, this is enough right here. and has freed them up in ways that we don't know about, to be generous in ways they couldn't be, to give the ways they want to give, sometimes to their kids, sometimes to workings, and all of that's part of the kingdom of God. But all of that, really, I mean, I want to give this gently, but I want to poke all of us with this, myself included. It's a whole different way of thinking, a different kind of wisdom, because conventional wisdom says, well, if you can afford it, you buy it, of course. Stop and think. Just slow down. Number five, stop and think. About the difference between wants and needs. These are all kind of connected, aren't they? Because if you don't stop and think and do the work that helps you distinguish between your wants and your needs, you're gonna do it again. Just like I do. Slide right into conventional wisdom. Tradition of men and the elementary principles of the world related to this. Friend of mine once told me that when he was growing up in his house, he'd tell his dad, and he learned not to ask this question. He said, Dad, I need a new bike. I need a baseball glove. I need a new video game. I need some new jeans. And my dad invariably would say, well, let's sit down and talk about what you need because you need air and food and water and shelter, and you need love, forgiveness, and grace, and you're going to get all of that that you can handle, but pretty much everything else is a wants, and you may get some wants, And we can even talk about your wants. As long as you know that's what they are, and we might even wonder together how you might get some of your wants. But if you confuse your wants, son, with your needs, this conversation is over. We will talk again when you know the difference. I love the story of the kid who comes to his dad and says, Dad, I need ten bucks. And his dad says, Five bucks? What do you need two bucks for? needs and wants but here's the deal i'm not to see i'm not telling you anything you don't know not one this is nothing new here but you have to stop and think and when we do we figure out little side note here getting good at this distinguishing our wants from our needs will actually help us enjoy the wants that we do get because when you get a want and you see it not as a need but boy it'd be nice when you do get it if you get it it feels like a gift and you end up being grateful but if you got it and you thought it was a need how many of you seen this i mean some of it drives you crazy with some of your kids it's some of these battles you're having in your own own family because they're so great they're so ungrateful why because they think it's a need and there's maybe a little wrestling match you have to be willing to do and it starts with this really hard word. No! You don't have to say it like that. No. I don't know. No sounds firmer. Think about your thinking. When is enough? Enough. Think through the difference between wants and needs. Number six, you need perspective. In order actually to distinguish between needs and wants, you need to get some perspective. Now, perspective obviously has to do with your point of view, what it is you're looking at. So if you live in an affluent suburb and all your friends drive late model Mercedes, you might feel a little embarrassed to drive a 10-year-old Honda with some rust on it or a rusty old pickup. But it's weird because this is about perspective. If you live in the country, if you live in rural Minnesota and all your friends drive rusty old pickups and you drive a late model Mercedes, you might be embarrassed about that. It's all about perspective. Richard Swenson, in his book entitled Margins, suggests that one of the ways you get perspective is by looking down the ladder. Most of us, he says, look up the ladder and gaze longingly at people who have more, more money, more success, more stuff, more ability, more whatever. This, of course, he says, deals a fatal blow to one's contentment and capacity to distinguish between wants and needs, if instead we reversed our gaze and looked down the ladder, he says, our gratitude would thrive and our capacity to discern between wants and needs would greatly increase. As I think of that, I think of how that perspective thing happens on a regular basis when we take people on mission trips. It's happened to some of you. I've never had any of our young people go on a mission trip, but when they don't come back, they have an entirely new perspective on what they thought they had to have to be happy and content. It's all about perspective. And it really is. Again, the way we get deceived without knowing it is when we live around and everybody's got one and all of a sudden you want what you, it wouldn't be on your radar screen looking down the ladder, looking up the ladder. that's why in our mentoring program with the next generation we do these service learnings and bring our young people into into the often into the inner city and and have them interact with people who are in entirely different context of life and it gives them among other things an entirely different perspective an entirely different reality that's why actually some of the people in our church, choose to live in the city, and even in some pretty difficult parts of the city, poorer parts of the city. And part of the reason is because it's easier to keep perspective when you're there relative to what you think you have to have. I'm always fascinated when I hear Stephan talk about homeless people. And one of the reasons he talks about that and opens my eyes to things about them is because he's around them all the time. He sees them almost every day because of where he lives. And it changes his perspective about what he thinks he has to have. Number seven, get some help. Get some help. If for whatever reason you've dug a hole you can't get out of, you've maybe been deceived and taken captive, or, and this is true for many too, through no fault of your own. Some of you are in real dire straits relative to finances, and it's not your fault at all. You haven't been deceived. You haven't been taken captive. You lost your job, and you may be losing your home. You need to get some help, and we want to be around you. Indeed, we do want to be part of this. Next week, we're going to have some details on this in terms of some options that we're going to have for our people. I mentioned Dave Ramsey. There's a course that we're looking into right now on that and some other resources. People in our own church are gonna very possibly teach some classes and give people some steps to take that really can pull you out of the hole. And there's a number of things we can do, but don't be afraid to ask. It's part of getting that out into the lights. Last thing, you need to learn to give. And I mean before all your money problems are solved, you need to learn to give. It's really a profound kingdom principle. I think Richard Swenson again says it this way, that there is one act par excellence that has the power to break the grip of mammon by going directly against the law of mammon or money, an act for which money is not made. That act is giving. Indeed, he says when we give money away, we not only neutralize its power over us, but we also bring it under the authority or the domain of the kingdom of God, God is honored and his right to rule in our lives is reconfirmed. And we are gonna pick it up right there next week. Let's pray as we close. Would you stand with me as we close? Father, what dawns on me as I close is, again, that while we're talking about money here, what we're really talking about is your right to rule in our lives as kingdom people. And so we just tell you, we may not all be there, but it's what we want. It is. It's just what we want. To be people who are living under the rule and reign of God in every arena of our life. And Lord, as I even reflect on our journey as a church, this courageous willingness in other arenas of our sexuality and our addictions and all sorts of stuff, the courage that your people in this place have had to bring stuff out into the light. Give us courage here. Give us courage here so we, as individuals and as a community, together can walk out of a kind of Egypt that many of us have been living in as slaves. And we just pray and help give us a vision for a new and spacious land of freedom under your rule and under your reign. And all God's people said, Amen.
