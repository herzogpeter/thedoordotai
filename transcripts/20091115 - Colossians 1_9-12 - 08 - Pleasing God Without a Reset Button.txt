Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. All right, well, we are these days examining this letter, this little letter that Paul and Timothy wrote to a community of people who were following Jesus in Colossae in the first century. And we've understood that they were living in a larger story of being under the all-pervasive shadow of the Roman Empire, where it was Caesar who was called Lord and Savior, and Caesar who was called the Son of God who could forgive the sins of the world. They were promised that if they pledged their allegiance to Rome and to Caesar That they could be invited into lifelong peace and prosperity And so Paul is writing this letter from prison to a group of people that he had never met before He just knew through Epaphras This servant that we learned of a few weeks ago And like a coach at halftime who is sort of encouraging and inspiring his team against insurmountable odds. Paul is inspiring them and encouraging them to live in the even larger story of being in Christ even while they're in Colossae. So being in Christ in pain or in Christ in prison, in Christ in persecution. That's what the book of Colossians is all about. So open your Bibles to Colossians chapter one, starting in verse nine. For this reason, since the day we heard about you, Paul and Timothy write, we have not stopped praying for you. We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives, so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way, bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might, so that you might have great endurance and patience, And giving joyful thanks to the Father who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of his people in the kingdom of light. The phrase that we're going to camp on this morning is this. So that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way. In every way. I want you to think all the way back to last night. Okay? Think about what you did last night. Did it please God in every way? yeah you should gulp right there right so forget about last night just think about this morning as the way you related to your family maybe on the way to church here or your roommates before you came to church right pleasing to god in every way yeah yep liar well is this intimidating to anybody because it is to me when i read that paul wants the colossians to live their life in a way that's worthy of jesus and pleasing him in every way i freak out a little bit to be totally honest well it makes me want to do over most days so i grew up with an atari 2600 do you guys remember this anyone remember the atari 2600 remember that yes oh we are an aging crowd aren't we well the great thing about the atari 2600 in addition to the fact that it just has the one little button on the joystick, right? I mean, now they got 15,000 buttons that you have to all press at the same time. It's crazy. They just had the one orange button in the joystick. Amazing. But anyway, if you weren't doing well at Space Invaders or Defender maybe or Combat or Pitfall, my personal favorite, if you weren't doing well, you could simply reach over on the right-hand side right over there and pull down on that silver button that was called the yes the reset button right i love the reset button you can just start over well here's the deal about my life and i know it's true about your life as well that there is no reset button in my life so when i hear paul's encouragement to the colossian people that they would live a life worthy of the Lord and pleasing Him in every way, I really do freak out because I know that my life doesn't, and it's not even close. And to make matters even more confusing, Paul seems to say in another letter that no one can. He writes this in Romans 3, verse 10. He's actually quoting a psalm when he writes this. There is no one righteous, not even one, and there is no one who understands. There is no one who seeks God. Kind of a pessimist here, right? All have turned away. They have together become worthless. There is no one who does good, not even one. So if there's no one righteous, no one who seeks God, and no one who does good, seriously, how is someone supposed to live a life worthy of the one who never sinned? How is someone supposed to please God in every way? Well, I think how you respond to this, because I think there are those of us who want to do that, actually, whose desire it is to please God in every way. I think how you respond to this depends partly on your personality and partly on your picture of God. Let me explain. A few of you are what I would call the go-getter type. And you would never admit this to yourself or to anyone else, but the truth is that you think you'll be the exception to that Romans 3.10 rule. You hear pleasing God in every way, and you look around at the competition, the people around you, and you say, well, I could probably do better than these losers. I think I'm going to give this thing a shot. And you say this because you've hardly failed at anything in your life. You know who you are if you're a go-getter. You got 1,400 on your SATs. Or you lost the baby weight shortly before you left the hospital. And come April Fool's Day, you're still going great on your New Year's resolutions, right? Well, here's my question to you go-getters out there. I wonder, I just wonder about go-getters. I wonder if it's important for you to please God in every way, not because of your extravagant love for God, though I think you probably do love God. I wonder if what's driving you is your fear of failing. Because there are those of us who hate to fail. It doesn't matter what the context. We hate to fail. I want you to think Monica Geller here. You know Monica Geller of Friends fame? Well, I think Paul also might have been this kind of guy, especially before his experience with Jesus on that road to Damascus. He writes in Philippians 3, we've read this a bunch of times here, that he had lots of reasons to put confidence in his success stories. It seems like he never failed. I think it was really important to him not to fail. I think that was just built in him. So it makes me wonder what kind of picture of God that Paul had, especially before he met Jesus on that road to Damascus that day. Because I think your picture of God, not the picture that you think God should be, but the actual picture of God that you have that motivates almost everything that you do, I think that picture is the primary factor in how you will respond to this call in pleasing God in every way. Now, to be honest, this is where I struggle. I don't think anyone likes to fail. I think failing, no one likes that. But I really, I hate to fail, and it doesn't matter what the context. And I have some internal coach in my mind that is constantly pushing me, which is sometimes helpful, but other times it's detrimental to me, and especially the people around me. This coach, she whispers to me, sometimes yelling at me. to do better, get better. And when that is the voice that you hear primarily, it makes it tough on the people that are around you. I once had this leadership consultant ask me this question after talking to me for a while. He said, you don't suffer fools much, do you? I'm like, ouch! It's not very fun to live with someone who doesn't suffer fools. Now, if you're the go-getter type, here's a good question for you. What's driving you? What's driving you to succeed? And can you begin to get your mind around the fact that you might have a faulty picture of God that's driving you? Because here's the deal, go-getters. God's primary concern for you is not that you don't fail. God's primary concern for you is not that you don't fail. That might be your dad's primary concern for you, or your mom's primary concern for you, or your coach's primary concern for you, but it's not God's. Paul writes this in Romans 5, 6-8, according to the message translation, which I think is amazing in this context especially. Paul writes, Christ arrives, and I love this little three-word phrase, right on time. right on time to make this happen. That is saving us. He didn't and doesn't wait for us to get ready. He presented himself for the sacrificial death when we were far too weak and rebellious to do anything to get ourselves ready to which go-getters respond, What? I'm not weak. And I certainly pride myself on being ready. Even if we hadn't been so weak, we wouldn't have known what to do anyway. Now, we can understand someone dying for a person worth dying for, and we can even understand how someone good and noble could inspire us to do selfless sacrifice. But here's the deal. God put his love on the line for us by offering his son in sacrificial death while we were of no use whatsoever to him. That is what God does. go-getters. Beyond your successes and your failures, God showed up when you had no idea. Here's the deal. It's not your success that God loves. It's the you hidden underneath your success that God loves and knows. The truth is this, and this may sound weird, but the you that is built up on successes and lack of failure is not really you. It's what Brandon Manning calls the imposter. It's a construct of you. It's a sort of version of you that you've created in order to get people to love you and like you. And because that person is not real, God does not know that person. God knows the you that's hidden underneath that, the you that you don't even really know. and God looks at that person, the real you, beyond your successes and in spite of your failures and right on time, God loves that person. So the question for us go-getters is this, are you willing to let go of your need to succeed in order to get to know God? because if you don't, you're going to be operating as the imposter and as the imposter, you can't get to know God. Are you willing to strip away your need to not fail in order to find the God who is your success? If not, you're always going to be driven to get better and better and be better than the next guy. And that's a really lonely life. But not all of us are go-getters. In fact, I think maybe most of us aren't. Some of us have experienced disappointment and failure enough to wonder why you would even try to please God in the first place. I think there are those of us who want to please God. But a lifetime of failing at that has made you kind of give up hope. And you're just trying to put one foot in front of another, making it through one 24-hour period after another. And you even hear the call to follow the rabbi into his way of living and loving, his third way of loving your enemies. And honestly, I think, I know people like this, people I've talked to have said this, that you don't have a rebellious no that rises up in you when you hear that call to follow that rabbi. You have a more helpless kind of how. it seems so hard. I've tried and I can't. Well, Thoreau wrote a poem from this place of disappointment and failure, and it starts like this. I want to read it to you. It's going to come up on the screens as well. I love this. It's such a great picture. He wrote this, I am a parcel of vain strivings, tied by a chance bond together, dangling this way and that. Their lengths were made so loose and wide, me thinks, for milder weather. I want to read it to you again. See if you can catch this metaphor. I am a parcel of vain strivings tied by a chance bond together. Dangling this way and that, this bond is. Their lengths were made so loose and wide, me thinks, for milder weather. I'm a package of vain strivings means this. I am trying so hard, but nothing is working. And what's holding me together, this chance bond that's tied together so loosely that it will fall apart. At the first sign of bad weather, which is what I'm in right now. And some of you are feeling that way. That you're wondering how it is that you're held together at all. And you're wondering if maybe you were constructed for milder weather than what you're currently going through. and the strings, this chance bond that's supposed to be holding you together tight, is God. But it feels very loose, and it feels like you're about to fall apart altogether. And that feeling makes you feel incredibly alone and vulnerable. Now, I wonder if that's how Adam and Eve might have felt in the garden after they realized their sin. after they sinned they realized they were naked they had been naked the whole time together but when they sinned this incredible uh thing happened they looked at each other and for the first time they saw each other they saw each other's imperfections they saw each other's faults and failures and so what did they do they did what you and i would do if all of a sudden you found out you were naked in front of someone else and you didn't know it. Right? You would cover up. And that's what they did. We read that they sowed fig leaves together. Fig leaves. I wonder, even if as they were doing that, I wonder if they realized that these fig leaves were made for mild weather. Not the hailstorm that's about to come ever since we sinned against God and are now banished from the garden. Where childbirth will be tough and work and labor will be tough. And I wonder if the picture of God that they had from then, at that moment anyway, was God is abandoning us. God is leaving us to our own devices. God is leaving us to make our own coverings. and I wonder if that's how you're feeling right now, some of you. God has left me to my own devices. I still believe in God. I still even love God and whatever that means. But I feel, if I'm totally honest, that God has left me alone and vulnerable and unclothed. Listen to what God did for Adam and Eve in Genesis 3.21. Amazing. Some of you need to hear this as a word for you. The Lord made what? Garments of skin. The Lord made garments of skin for Adam and his wife, and God clothed them. God said, listen, your life will be hard. You can read all about it in the verses that follow verse 21 in Genesis 3. But God wanted to know that they were not going to be left to their own devices, that those little fig leaves that they sewed together on their own were made for milder weather, and they weren't going to last for the hard weather that was going to come. And so God said, listen, I'm going to clothe you as a way of telling you that you are not alone, even though you sinned against me. God says this, I have not left you to be held together by your vain strivings. So today's question is this. What does it mean for a human being like me or like you, whether you're a go-getter or someone who's tired of relying on their own vain strivings, with no reset button, what does it mean to live a life worthy of the Lord and to please Him in every way? What does that mean? Well, a few weeks ago, if you were here, you heard Stephan share an unforgettable story with us about what he called his spiritual director, his three-year-old daughter, Mimi. She was going to the apple orchard one day with her school. So Stephan asked her to get an apple and bring it back for him. And so she did that. On the bus on the way back, she saw her mom, and Stephan was still at work, and she held up the apple. Woo-hoo! And Meredith was excited. And then later on in the day when Stephan got home from work, he saw Mimi, and Mimi's eyes lit up. And she goes, Daddy, I got something for you. She went inside and got the apple and gave it to him. Her eyes were lit up. And Stephan took that apple and he looked at it. And it was half eaten. And all brown and mushy. And Stephan said, how ridiculous would it have been if he would have looked at that apple and said, Mimi, you are so selfish. How is it that you could have eaten half the, I mean, I asked you to get me a whole, did I ask you to get me a half an apple? No. No, he took that apple and he took Mimi in his arms and ate that thing and it was the best apple he had ever had in his whole life, he said. Now here's the question. Why do you think Mimi even remembered to give her daddy that apple? that's a lot for a three-year-old to remember well i think the answer is because she wanted to please her daddy not because she was afraid of him punishing her if he didn't if she was afraid of him punishing her that apple would have been polished it would have been like you know spit shined and it would have been presented on an on a little tray of silver no the very fact that it was presented to him half eaten was proof that she wanted to please him because she loved him and she loved him because he loves her. And the half-eaten apple is not what pleases him. It's the fact that she thought of him in the first place. Now, what if you knew a God like that? Now, I think Stephan is a great dad, but he's probably not even the best dad in the world, right? I mean, there might be a few other dads that are a little better. So even if you can't get your arms around a God who is an amazing parent, just say this to yourself. Think of the best father you know. God is at least as good as that. And you know he's way better. But just so you can get your arms around it, God is at least as good as the best father you've ever known or heard of. And if you want to live a life worthy of the Lord and please God in every way, I think the first and most critical ingredient that you have to have is that you need to know that kind of God. That kind of God. And I think if you did know that kind of God, you'd want to please God. Even if all you could give God was half an apple. Dave talked about knowing God two weeks ago in a deep down in your bones way, this Greek word epigenosis. Knowing someone like that changes you. It affects you. When you know that someone loves you with a love that won't let go and likes you, likes being around you, it makes you want to please them. And again, not in a weird way. It just makes you want to respond. So here's the word to you, Church of the Open Door. don't try hard to please God what? don't get to know God this kind of God the God that clothes you the God that doesn't know you based on your successes the God that knows the you that's hidden beneath your successes the God that loves you despite your failures the God that says to you you do have vain strivings but I am a God who will hold you together in spite of it. Get to know that kind of God. If you're going to get to know that kind of God one of the first things you need to do is get an accurate picture of what your picture of God is. And if it's faulty you need to exchange it for a correct picture of God. So I want to give you a picture of God that I think is amazing. It comes right from the Scriptures. It comes from an Old Testament book called Hosea. Many of you were reading it this morning, I know. I mean, I'll give you $10 if anyone can find Hosea right now. Hosea was an Old Testament prophet to whom God gave a very interesting challenge. And we find it in Hosea 1, verse 2. This is amazing. It's right in the Scriptures. We don't do this in Sunday school a whole lot, this story. God says to Hosea, go. I want you to marry a promiscuous woman and have children with her. For like an adulterous wife, this land is guilty of unfaithfulness to the Lord. So what did Hosea do? Okay. He married Gomer, daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son. What do you think that marriage was like? Well, we read, it's an interesting thing, that Gomer didn't stop being promiscuous after they got married. And listen to what God told Hosea to do in Hosea 3, verse 1. This is incredible. Go and show your love to your wife again. Though she is loved by another and is an adulteress, love her as the Lord loved the Israelites, though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes, which we just can't go any further in the story without examining the sacred raisin cakes. I saw this in here and I said, there's got to be something there. The sacred raisin cakes. And all I found was it was maybe this offering that people would offer to false gods, these delectable kind of treats. So I Googled it, and I also found out that there's a band out there named the Sacred Raisin Cakes, right? And I mean, I thought, that is the greatest band name that I have ever heard in my life. I want to be in the Sacred Raisin Cakes. What do you do? I'm the lead singer of the Sacred Raisin Cakes. That's awesome. And a tangent. So let's get back to the story of Hosea who married Gomer, who was promiscuous. And Hosea loved Gomer. See, God wanted to use a tangible story to show his children how much he still loves them, even though at best they present him with half an apple, and at worst they give that apple to another. In Hosea 2 verses 14 and 15, God reveals the kind of God that God is. We read it this way, Therefore, I am now going to allure her, God says his children, Israel. I will lead her into the wilderness and speak tenderly to her. There I will give her back her vineyards and will make the valley of Achor a door of hope. Now, Achor, you need to know, means trouble. It means trouble. So God is the one who calls you out of the valley of trouble and turns that trouble into hope because of God's unrelenting, unchanging love for you, God's stance toward you, even when you offer your half an apple to someone else, is that God will allure you and take you out into the wilderness to speak tenderly to you, to restore to you what has been lost. I want you to think about that. Your valley of acor, your trouble, the things that have been maybe even taken from you. God's stance toward you, this is the kind of God that God is. I will restore to you. I will restore to you what you've lost or what's been taken from you. I will heal you. That is the kind of God that when you get to know, you say, there is nothing I wouldn't do for that kind of God. so what if you knew that kind of God what if you could know that kind of God what if you could exchange your faulty picture of God for that picture of God well that's the God represented by Jesus of Nazareth a few verses later in Colossians I think in verse 15 if we ever get there we're going to read that Jesus is the image of the invisible God And this word image is a Greek word called icon, and it means the exact representation. If, like, the image of Caesar was embossed on coins, that was the icon of Caesar was right on the coin. So someone would say it and go, yep, that's Caesar. If Paul were writing in our time, see, we understand icons differently. How we understand an icon is it's that thing on your desktop, on your computer, that when you click on it, it opens up the application that you think it's going to open up, right? So I think Paul in Timothy would write it this way. When you click on Jesus, I'm dead serious, the application you open up is God every single time. Because Jesus is the exact representation of God in a time where people had all kinds of crazy pictures of who God was. God said, it is time for me to give you a flesh and blood picture of who God is so that there will be no more argument. I am pouring myself into this person. His name is Jesus. When a human being realizes that he or she is loved with that kind of love that would send his son down to us to know us and then die for us, when you know that kind of love, you respond. One of my favorite stories about Jesus is this time when a woman, who we read in the scriptures in Luke, had led a sinful life. I think a lot about Gomer, this person that Hosea married, this promiscuous woman. There's a lot of parallels here, I think, as you even hear the story, see the parallels. But this woman who had led a sinful life broke into this dinner party where Jesus was eating with a bunch of go-getter Pharisees. Picture this scene in your mind. It's crazy because she kind of barges her way in. Everyone would have known who she was and the kind of life that she led because it says that they knew. And she couldn't even face Jesus. She was so taken by him, she was weeping behind him. And his feet got wet with her tears, so she took her hair and wiped his feet and then took perfume and anointed his feet. Couldn't stop crying. And the reaction that she got from the go-getter Pharisees we read in Luke 7.39. When the Pharisee who invited Jesus saw this, this spectacle in his mind, he said to himself, if this man were a prophet, Jesus, He would know who was touching him and what kind of a woman that she is, that she is a sinner. I mean, you can just see that, you can hear and taste the despise in his voice. Now, what kind of picture of God do you think this go-getter Pharisee has? I think it's the picture of a God that you better not fail, ever. So Jesus, got to love Jesus, he takes this guy to task. He challenges him. about his picture of God. In Luke 7, 45-47, we read this. Looks at him right in the face and he says, Listen, you didn't give me a kiss, but this woman from the time I entered hasn't stopped kissing my feet. You didn't put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. Therefore, I tell you, her many sins, her failures, have been forgiven. They've been wiped away. It's as if she never did them. As her great love to me has shown, but here's the bad news for you. Whoever has been forgiven little loves little. Now, that doesn't mean whoever has little to forgive. It means whoever understands their need for forgiveness little loves little. That's just the truth. So what if this go-getter Pharisee, staying in his go-getter mind, said this, okay, every time Jesus enters my house, I'm going to kiss him twice as much as this sinful woman did. and I'm going to go to Costco and get a huge vat of perfume and I'm going to pour twice as much perfume on his feet so that no one could argue that I love him more. You ever done that? I mean, maybe I'm not buying a big vat of perfume, but you ever been tempted to respond to God that way? Out of a rule? You have. So have I. We do that responding according to a rule when we don't know the God that forgives us so much. We respond with a rule when we aren't aware of our need for forgiveness. But when we are aware, like Gomer was and this woman was finally Gomer, we respond with take all of me. All of me. So the question that's left on the table is this. When you get to know that kind of God you've heard about this morning, what's your response? How do you respond to that kind of God? See, this is the God who loves the you that is hidden beneath your success. The you that is not trampled over by your failures. This is the God who clothes you when you feel like your vain strivings are not enough. This is the God that allures you and takes you away out into the wilderness to restore to you what has been lost, even though you've given yourself away to other lovers. This is the picture of God that is revealed in Jesus, and this is the God that loves you. So what is your response to that kind of God? maybe if you're a go-getter maybe it's to invite God in to the you that's hidden beneath your successes the you that you don't even know and say God know this me the real me not the imposter but the real me I invite you in to know that person maybe that's your response maybe it's to ask God to clothe you because you feel as though your vain strivings have left you tired and alone and very vulnerable so maybe your invitation to God your response to this kind of God is God clothe me cover me because I feel out there and alone and nothing's going to hold me together if you don't maybe it's to fall on your face and ask for forgiveness for giving yourself away to another lover so we're going to take 30 seconds or so for you just to in silence respond to God whatever honest way that you have in your spirit to this God so let's just take 30 seconds Amen. And into that response, hear these words from Colossians 1. For this reason, since the day we have heard about you, we haven't stopped praying for you. We continually ask God to fill you with the epigenosis of his will, deep down in your bones, through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives, so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord, pleasing him in every way. bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God and being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience and giving joyful thanks to the Father who has qualified you, qualified you to share in the inheritance of his people in the kingdom of light. Who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of God? Has your successes qualified you? Has your failures disqualified you? Have your vain strivings qualified you to share in the inheritance? The answer is no. You've been qualified by God to share in his inheritance, which is him. That is your inheritance. God himself. So get filled up, as Dave said a couple weeks ago, deep down in your bones with the knowledge of that kind of God, a picture of that kind of God. And when you do that, that will begin to stir up a desire in you to want to please God in every way because your desire to know God is what pleases God. Amen? Amen. Let's stand for the benediction. a person on staff this week that I respect a whole lot said you know I think you should end this talk this way by praying as a benediction this prayer found in Colossians 1 9 through 12 over these people as a way of letting you know this really is our prayer for you this actually is you know those of us who think about you and are the shepherds of this church this is our prayer for you this is what we pray for us together so receive this we continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the spirit gives so that you really may live a life worthy of the Lord pleasing him in every way bearing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of God so that you can be strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience in these hard times and giving joyful thanks to the Father who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of his people in the kingdom of light. Live as if God was doing that in you because God is. Amen? Amen. Have a great week, everybody. Thank you.
