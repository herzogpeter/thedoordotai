Oh, you own me Yes, you own me now These chains, they hold me in But they don't hold me down I've been passed around by fools Who didn't treat me very well I served the lust and greed Became a slave to it myself After giving in to every whim in my own private hell You said, come serve me And I'll set you free I could have fought you And said I'm more than this And held my head real high As I clenched my fists Because serving you looks so small Compared to where I've been People knew my name in the position I've been in. And now all of my authority might seem paper thin, but you showed me how this would set me free from the shame I carried for so many years. Oh, I'm free From the way I needed things to appear Now I'm bound to you my master But not bound to you by fear guitar solo What other choice have I? In bondage to you, Lord, my heart's come alive. And if it means that soon my name fades like the ending of a song, then let it be, for I was dead until you came along. Oh, I'd gladly bear these chains if it means that I might see one day the whole world. One day the whole world would be set free. Would be set free. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Thanks, man. Don't you love Joel? What a story. Yeah. You know, and it's fun because he so shared his story with us and his journey, and it's just a great story and a great journey. Joel is the real deal. I like being around that, don't you? It's just good. It's just a little scary, though. I mean, you've got to be careful when you talk to Joel. He might just write a song about what you say. It's a little freaky. Good stuff. Come to the concert. He's just good stuff. I just think it would be a fun family thing to do together. Be here or don't be. Let's pray. Let's pray. Father, as we enter into this word this morning, I pray that the spirit that was in this incredible man named Paul, that that spirit in him would be in us. And that it would be in me. Even as I speak these words and try to paint these pictures and describe these realities, I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Open your Bibles with me, if you have them, to the book of Colossians, first chapter, first verse, where the writer of the epistle introduces himself simply as Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God. And last week we discovered, after hearing a little bit of Paul's story, which we're going to add to some today, that his being an apostle was also by the grace of God. It was by the will of God, but it was also by the grace of God. For he said, I am the least of the apostles, actually. In 1 Corinthians 15, 9, he said that, who am not fit to be called an apostle because of my former life. He battled with issues of his former life when I persecuted the church. In fact, it was vividly illustrated. And we talked about it last week in Acts chapter 6, where he enthusiastically participated in the stoning execution of Stephen. But he says, by the grace of God, I am what I am. And I am an apostle by the will of God. But I'm so intensely aware that it's also by the amazing grace of God. And his grace toward me has not proved to be in vain. In other words, it hasn't been wasted on me because it's kind of resulted in me working even harder. Not to get God's favor, but just to continue to do the work. I labor far more than even all of them, but it wasn't just me doing this labor. The text says, yet not I. It was this grace of God that's come to me, that moves in me to serve and to give and to labor and to care. And care, he did. In a Roman prison when he wrote this letter to the Colossians, he'd never met them face to face. It's incredible that he cared so much about people he had never met. His first words to them are these in verse 3. We give thanks. We being Timothy and I. To God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. And I want you to know, even though I've never met you, I'm praying always for you all the time. You're always on my mind ever since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love with which you have for all the saints. The next verse, it's not on the screen, but it talks about that faith and love being rooted in your hope for eternity with God's people. And God, indeed, verse 9, he says, I haven't ceased to pray for you. I just can't get you off of my mind and ask as we pray that you, Colossians, would be filled with all the knowledge of his will and all spiritual wisdom and understanding. Indeed, I want you to know, he says in chapter 2, verse 1, how great a struggle I have on your behalf. In other words, what he's saying, I want you to know how much I care about you. and for those who are at Laodicea he says in that verse and for all those who have not personally seen my face so these people again are people that he has never met for whom he greatly struggles and he does it verse 2 and I love this this is why he does what he does and struggles in order that your hearts might be encouraged so I care about having already been knit together in love because we heard about that from Epaphras about you back in chapter 1. My goal for you, and this is why I struggle, is that you might attain to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, thus resulting in your lives of true knowledge of God's mystery that is Christ himself. And for all of that, on your behalf, I gladly struggle greatly to help you enter into these realities and authentically experience the fullness of who Christ is, but beyond even a great struggle, he says, in chapter 1 of Colossians, it evolved for Paul a kind of suffering, actually. A suffering, however, of which he says, in Colossians 124, I rejoice in, it's okay for your sakes, because it means that in even the suffering stuff, your hearts might just be encouraged. All of which, I suppose, is simply the stuff you do when you're called to be an apostle by the will of God. It's all kind of right there, I guess, in the job description. Apostle, suffering. You know, you struggle, and you pray, and you suffer, and you carry people who you have never even met in your heart, and you think about them all the time. Paul carried whole churches in his heart. In 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians 11, he talks about kind of the cost of his ministry. He talks about being beaten at times and shipwrecked at times. But then near the end, he talks about sleepless nights and this daily concern for the churches. I carry in my heart because he cared. But caring isn't something you do because it's in a job description. I said a second ago, it's all there, it's possible, you care, but that's not why you care, is it? Well, part of why I'm saying all this is because part of what I noticed several weeks ago when we began our study in the book of Colossians was that most of the commentaries I read when reflecting on Paul's introduction of himself in the beginning, the very first phrase of the book, as an apostle, when he introduces himself as an apostle, Most of the commentaries I read interpreted that as being Paul's attempt to establish, to assert, and to affirm his authority. In other words, he is saying, I'm an apostle on the front end, to establish and affirm his right, as it were, to speak into their lives, and their obligation, as it were, to listen to his words and to obey. The reason you need to obey what I'm about to tell you in this letter is because I am Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, so I don't want any arguments. It's kind of what you get. Indeed, he introduced a number of his epistles that exact same way. And in all of them, they were kind of the spiritual equivalent when he says, I am Paul the apostle. He's kind of the spiritual equivalent of him in the beginning, kind of showing them his credentials. This is the thought around this, or kind of flashing your badge so we know you're really a cop. You're really an apostle, so okay, I'll listen to you. But, while there is an element of him kind of establishing his authority and kind of affirming that, in several other of his epistles, notably Romans, Philemon, Philippians, to just name a few, he introduces himself not as Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, but he introduces himself as Paul, a prisoner. of Jesus Christ as Paul, a bondservant of Jesus Christ as Paul, a slave. I'm just a slave. That's why I do what I do. I'm a slave of this Jesus who's called the Christ. And when you call yourself or refer to yourself or see yourself as a servant, a prisoner, a slave, it doesn't speak so much to authority and power or the persona of one who needs to be obeyed. Much more, it speaks to the posture and the persona of one who himself will obey anything. It's kind of the way a prisoner would do it or a servant might do it or maybe a slave. All of which brings me to what I want us to know about Paul, about his heart. As we continue to just kind of wade into this epistle, the Colossians, and this is what I want you to know. That Paul's authority as an apostle of Jesus Christ, and that is a phrase of authority. But his authority as an apostle emanated from and was inextricably linked to the fact that he saw himself first. First. I hate that. I just lost all my authority. It emanated, this authority that he had emanated from the fact that he saw himself first as a servant, as a prisoner in chains to God as a slave. Which, by the way, helps me understand at least a little bit why he didn't get all indignant and get all offended when he was thrown in prison or misunderstood or why he had the willingness to struggle greatly or even to suffer greatly. I mean, imagine Paul, if he was wearing his other persona. We talked about Paul last week when there was a time in his life when what he wore was, I'm a Hebrew of Hebrews, as to the law of Pharisee. And I'm telling you, when you're wearing that persona, you wouldn't take anything. Indignant. I mean, Richard Rohr talks about the fact that you can tell how formed people are in God by how easily offended they are. thrown in prison, mistreated, people don't get it, don't like me. Okay. Do you know who I am? I'm an apostle. No, well, you know what, really? I'm a slave. I'm a slave by the will of God. And a slave is not above his master. And one of the things I noticed about Jesus was that he suffered. Okay, me too. So I will obey him. And I will do whatever he says. And I will go wherever he tells me to go. Which does sound like an apostle. But it sounds also like a slave. Now, before you get all misty-eyed about that, too late for me, I already am. You know about how, oh, it's so wonderful. Paul is so humble. Or maybe, before you get, you know, like how weird that is. It's just a slavery. It's this mealy mouth. It's just a little old me. I'm a slave. What I'd really like us to see today is how radically subversive that is. How counter-cultural what Paul is talking about here when he identifies himself this way. How kingdom of God like that is. But to kind of help you get into that and see that, I need to give you some history. Which you're kind of used to around here. We do this all the time. I need to tell you the story that's bigger than just the story of Colossae. and it provides the context within which Paul lived this way as an apostle who was also a slave. So let me kind of get into that. We've already established over the last couple of weeks the fact that to live in Colossae was to live in the shadow of Rome. Rome being the most powerful and oppressive empire in all of human history, but that shadow was cast on far more people than just those who lived in Colossae. Indeed, at just about the same time, Paul wrote this letter to the Colossians. He had written a similar letter to the people who lived in Philippi. In fact, the dates are about the same. So while he was in prison, he wrote a letter to the Colossians. He wrote another letter to Philippi at about the same time. And while the circumstances of these two cities, these little places, colonies of Rome, were different, one thing was the same for both Philippi and Colossae, and that was this pervasive presence of Rome. And the influence that Rome, just the Roman culture, had in both Colossae and Philippi on how the people thought, on what the people desired, on how they lived, and what they feared. Like Colossae, for instance, Philippi was a center of emperor worship. In fact, most historians believe that emperor worship originated in Philippi when Caesar Augustus won a battle there in Philippi over the armies of Brutus and Cassius, declaring himself at the end of that battle to be more than a great warrior or more than even a king. he declared himself at that battle, which was a battle over control of the Roman Empire, he declared himself to be a god, which is something you might do when you've conquered the world. How much higher can I go? I don't know. I'm a god. Such that, and this became so much a part of Roman culture and thinking, that as early as 9 B.C., that's figure, this is nine years before the birth of Christ, there were inscriptions, often found engraved on coins, both in Philippi and Colossae, declaring Caesar as Lord. That Augustus was the savior of the world. And that the birthday of Augustus, both in Colossae and in places like Philippi, this is a quote, that the birth of Augustus was seen as the beginning for the world of glad tidings. Glad tidings is from the Greek word euangelion. Steve introduced this just a couple of weeks ago in the introduction that he brought to the book of Colossians. And this euangelion literally means, as Steve indicated, good news. So they would celebrate in Philippi and Colossae the birthday of Augustus, and this is weird, but they would celebrate the way we celebrate Christmas. And they would actually have songs that they would sing, singing songs like this. Unto us a child was born, unto us a son was given, and he shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Caesar is Lord, Prince of Peace. but remember what we've already learned about the Caesars they did bring peace they were the prince of peace but it was the Pax Romana was the peace of Rome and the way peace was procured by the Caesars was simply crushing, annihilating everyone who disagreed with them and so when we killed you there was no more resistance we have peace, he's the prince of peace and his name shall be called Caesar Augustus Now, the point of all of that, I'm telling you, is that Philippi and Colossae had some things in common. One was they were both centers for emperor worship, but also Colossae and Philippi were Roman colonies. They both experienced that, which means, among other things, that certain people in both cities could become Roman citizens, which means, among other things, that these people who were in Philippi and Colossae, able to attain this Roman citizenship, had certain rights and privileges that other people didn't have, but it also brought a responsibility to establish and maintain, it's very important, the Roman way of life, and the social order of life in both Colossae and Philippi that was consistent with this Roman thing. And this social order, wherever it expressed itself, whether Philippi or Colossae, was always arranged vertically in the form of hierarchy. Indeed, there's this fascinating book I ran into recently entitled Reconstructing Honor in Rome. It actually began, I caught this thing, and it kind of began to form and become the basis of a lot of stuff I wanted to talk about today. And the thesis of this book basically is this, that all of Roman culture, wherever it manifested itself, was preoccupied with the pursuit of status, recognition, and power. All under this single word, honor. Thus the title of the book, Reconstructing Honor in Rome. So everybody's after honor in the social hierarchy, and everybody knows where they are in the hierarchy. Let me explain this, a little teaching here. At the very top of this kind of hierarchy, in both Colossae and Philippi, this would have been true, was the Senate. initially this was made up of about 600 men no women would be in the senate and they called the shots it's nice to be the person who calls the shots because because it means that you are going to be the person that people bow down to they they were the people that everybody served everyone obeyed they were obeyed and quite frankly if you're in this very elite top echelon you'd have a kind of a vested interest in making sure this structure where you have all the power is maintained Just kind of keep that in mind. Second group was a group called the equestrians. Equestrians, weird word. And if when you hear that word, you think of horses, equestrian, well, you're right about that. Because these were the guys who actually had enough money to provide a horse for themselves in battle. Now, they obviously had enough money for other things as well, but this horse thing in Roman culture became kind of a symbol for their success, their wealth, and their social standing, which, if you think about it in terms of how we live, I mean, it's just so bizarre, so very weird that people would attach status to a mode of transportation. Just bizarre. Thank you. You know, I mean, these people are so bizarre, backward. Anyway, anyway. Well, right underneath that was another group called the Decurians. Weird, weird word. And in every Roman city or colony, like Colossae or Philippi, there would be at least a few of these Decurians. and these were the elite. Indeed, if you see these top three categories here, these three categories together made up what you would call in any kind of Roman context, Roman colony, the elite. And what's weird about it, among other things, is that these three groups made up about 2% of the entire population. So 98% of the people aren't ever gonna get into this thing, but this is where the power is and this is where the glory is and this is where the honor is. Right beneath them are Roman citizens. who by virtue of their citizenship were afforded certain rights and privileges. And as I said a moment ago, if you were in Colossae, if you're a colony of Rome, you could apply for it and some could attain this particular category. You were able to vote. You were afforded due process of law. Paul, we discovered last week, was a citizen of Rome and was therefore afforded due process of law. And that comes up later in his story. Beneath them was a group called the freedmen who had liberty, but they didn't have the rights of a citizen, so they were lower than them. And then at the very bottom, there were slaves. And nobody, as you can guess, would want to be a slave. Think about a slave. If you were in this culture really gifted as a slave, you had some capacities and you were bright and served in your honored household well, your conditions as a slave might actually be okay. You'd have a bed to sleep in, some food to eat, and you'd be fairly well taken care of. But as a slave, even in the best of conditions, You had absolutely no rights. Masters could dispose of you however they chose. Slaves obeyed. That's what slaves did. It wasn't that they wanted to. This is just what you do. This is your place. And nobody in those top three categories of the elite ever talked about their behavior in the terms of obedience. In other words, the top three categories, the people with the power, this idea that they would ever obey, Again, there's not even language for that they were obeyed. Slaves obey. This is the order. Everybody gets it. So this was the social order in places like Colossae and in places like Philippi, and it even had a name. Cursus honorum. Cursus honorum. And what it means is the race for honors. Think about that. The race for honors. how backward the race for status the race for position and power and everybody was into it even the slaves even if you were in a lower group because even within the group uh there would be a hierarchy so you see that thing and there's all these groups going up to the very top but whatever group you were in you probably weren't going to be able to go higher although it was all about getting higher within the group there would be rankings and there'd be a hierarchy of slaves so among slaves there would be slaves who were kind of in control and other slaves who were just kind of really slaves and so you would find in the race for honors this this thing was just happening everywhere it was in the fabric the dna of all roman culture maybe it's in the dna of all of our humanity i don't know and everything in their culture was about about reinforcing this race for honors and getting people to almost kind of keep playing the game in a variety of ways some of these things were subtle. Some of them were obvious. I think most of them were like our experience that we kind of get in the race for honors, and it's just this way of life, and we don't even know we're doing it. It's just kind of how you do your life. An example of that, togas. You might remember togas. You've heard, you know, they have toga parties. I don't know if they have toga parties, but I've heard of those things. And, you know, you've seen these old movies of Romans, and they're wearing a toga, and you're not really sure what it is. But here's the deal about a toga. In Paul's day, under Roman influence, togas were only worn by people of a certain rank. You had to at least be a Roman citizen or above. Anybody below, like a freed man or a slave, wasn't allowed to wear a toga. But what's weird about the togas is this. Ironically, they weren't comfortable, and they were not convenient. Your left arm, if you wore a toga, would be bound. Only your right arm would be free. They were drafty in the winter. They were hot in the summer. But in the race for honors, you wore a toga. Why? Because it tells you where you are in the race. And it tells you who you are in the race. It tells you if you're a slave. Everybody knows. It tells you if you're a freed man. It tells you if you're a decurian or an equestrian or in the senate, you see a toga, ah, he must be, ugh. No toga, ooh, he must be, ooh. All of which is just so weird, isn't it? And foreign to us. But it isn't, and you know it. Because we're still wearing togas. Because it's still about being the biggest and the brightest and the best and the fastest and the smartest and the prettiest. And it's just in our DNA. It creeps into church. It's just part of, we're kind of Romanized ourselves. You know, and as you can imagine, in a system like this, the greatest fear that anyone would have, and there would be lots of fear around this, but one of the greatest fears would be to lose your status, having procured it some way and found, okay, this is who I am, this is where I am. But to lose that position, to lose your place in the race. Whoa. But it happened, just like it happens today, when someone would lose their job, or they would lose their title, or their office as a senator, or maybe they would lose their wealth. And when it did happen, in Roman culture, they actually had a phrase. It was called being humbled. You were being humbled. And if I saw someone kind of, if the whole thing is about the race for honors, everything is going up, even a slave in the context is going up. But if someone, oh, they slipped, they fell down, I would go, oh, poor him. Glad I'm not him. But he was humbled. And that's a potentiality to be avoided at all costs. Just whatever you do, don't let that happen. Which means that the idea of humbling yourself. Honestly, in Roman culture, that idea of humbling yourself was unthinkable. Indeed, they literally had no language for that. It simply didn't exist. Which raises this question relative to this whole kind of structure. What on earth would change a structure like that? What would it take for a slave to move into a better place? become free. Just become free. What would it take in a culture like this? It feels like somebody would have to help them some way, but nobody would. And so slaves wanting to be free, they had some solutions to how they could kind of do this upward thing, and many slaves would revolt. There would be slave revolts. In fact, one of the common things relative to Roman occupation was that they were constantly occupied, if you will, with putting down slave revolts. Because slaves were going, we want a piece of this, and they would just have this revolt, which was pretty consistent with the race for honors. We want more, and they would crush them. What was weird, every once in a while, a slave revolt would happen, and they would win, but what was weird was even when they would win and they would get to power, they would become as oppressive as the oppressor. So what I'm saying is that nothing ever really changed the system. Nothing ever really made a difference. It's almost like if this system is going to change, put it up on the board again. If this structure was going to change, it would almost, because the slaves are stuck, let's just use them as the embodiment of the worst, and the Senate is the embodiment of the top. It's almost like somebody in the Senate would have to go down and go, I want to do something with you down here. I'm going to say, but, you know, who's going to do that? Especially if you're in the race for honors. If you're at the top, you're going to use your power and authority to keep this system the way it is. Because you're God. Caesar is Lord. Enter now into all of that stuff I just gave you, into that kind of system, into that kind of thinking and living, the gospel of the kingdom. The euangelion. The good news that Caesar isn't Lord, that Jesus is Lord. Now, just to hear that phrase in the culture that I just described to you says among others, I don't even know anything about this Jesus thing, but until now, Caesar's been our only alternative, so I'm just going to sit here and shut up so I can live, but you're telling me there's another kind of kingdom, and another kind of life, and another kind of Lord, and this good news that we are used to hearing, and these people were just beginning to hear, is the good news that there's a different way to live than this race for honors. There's a different path to power and authority than the race for honors. Authority and power still matter. Getting back to Paul being called an apostle, just dial into this, Paul had authority. He was an apostle by the will of God. And Jesus had authority too, and power too. Indeed, according to Paul, he was given a name. That is Jesus, who was given a name above every name. I love this, and it's weird to hear these verses now in light of the culture stuff I just gave you. Jesus was given the name above every name, that at the name of Jesus, every knee would bow. And that would include the senators and the equestrians and the decarrians. He has been given a name bigger than Caesar's name, that at the name of Jesus, every knee would bow and tongue confess that Jesus Christ, not Caesar, is Lord, which speaks to a lot of power and a lot of authority. But here's the difference, the path to, and the basis of the kind of power and authority that Jesus has, that Paul had, is a very strange path. It's not the Caesar path. It's an unfamiliar path that actually, on the surface, doesn't look powerful at all, but it's embodied in Jesus, who although he existed in the form of God, according to Paul in Philippians 2 verse 6. Now again, take this language and put it on the culture stuff I just gave you. Here's the Senate. That's the top. Well, kind of above that is Caesar, who's God. And now we've got to decide, okay, who's God? And Paul's making this claim. You don't get it, you guys. This Jesus, who though he existed in the form of God, here's the difference. Did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, to be held on to. He decided he wasn't going to use his power to keep this system the way it is. And all of you down there, he decided to do different thing, this unthinkable thing, that in Roman culture, the race for honors, what idiot would do this? He emptied himself. What idiot would do this? He emptied himself, taking on the form of a what? A bondservant. Of a slave. And if you're watching this actually happen, I mean, if this was actually happening to, Caesar was doing this. Everybody around him would be yelling, you're going the wrong direction! This will never work. It goes against every instinct. To go down would be suicide. Caesar, I guarantee, would never do this. And he would, in fact, mock anyone who did. But who knew? Who knew? I mean, this is so bizarre. Who knew that the actual way to conquer a heart and get people who were loyal wasn't by keeping them down with your power, but it was really by giving yourself away for them. Who knew? but then Jesus who was God went even further being found in the appearance of a man he went further he humbled himself by becoming obedient I've heard that verse all my life but now I put it in the context of this thing we're talking about in the race for honors because in the race for honors you want to be in a place where you're not obeying you're obeyed but Jesus went the other direction by becoming obedient. How obedient? To the point of death. Even death on a cross. And again, it's a verse we've all heard, I think, but the death on the cross in the context of this race for honors and slaves and the senators and all that, the death on a cross was reserved for the lowest of the low. You know that a Roman citizen couldn't be crucified, so anybody above the status of a Roman citizen couldn't be crucified. They could be beheaded. They could be tortured, you know what, which is nice. But couldn't be crucified. That was reserved for the lowest of the law, freedmen and slaves. And being formed in the form of God, he humbled himself, took on the form of a slave. So Jesus died a dishonored slave. Want to follow that? This is craziness. All of which means if this is true, the story is true. If Jesus really is who he say is, if he really was God, he is God, and took this journey, what it means is someone from up here finally did come down here to say, there's only one way to change this, and that is when people start giving away what they have. And all of which, by the way, puts a whole new spin in my mind on the words of Paul in Galatians 4.28, because you stick it in the cultural thing I just gave you, because Paul in Galatians 4.28 says, now in Christ, because of what Christ has done. There is no slave nor what? Free. What else could have done this? There is no Jew nor Greek. That's all gone. No male nor female. A whole new community. All are one in Christ. Nothing but what Jesus did could have done that because I am changing the order of things. And I am changing the hierarchy of things. Caesar is Lord. He is the Prince of Peace. But I've already told you the way he brought peace was the Pac-Sermano, the peace of Rome. And the way he kept peace was by killing you. Now he got peace because he'll shut up finally. Jesus was the prince of peace. Pick, pick your Lord, okay? But he brought peace not by taking your life. He brought peace by giving his. What kind of God is this? This is idiocy. This is why some of it was called the folly of the cross. Are you kidding? He's sitting there naked. He's a loser. He lost. We won. Caesar would exercise his power to keep the hierarchy intact, which is what many of us do. That's still going on. And you do that, so you're still on top. Jesus dove right to the bottom, emptied himself, taking on the form of a slave. But just get this. When he did that, God highly exalted him. That was when he gave him a name above every name. That at the name of Jesus, every knee would bow and tongue confess. So there's your authority. But how do you come to it? By descending, not ascending. Paul, an apostle, he wasn't bragging. That was true. He had authority. Now he got it by being a slave. To a slave. That slave Jesus, I'm his slave. And then it got really weird. It got really weird because his followers, Jesus' followers, started doing this too. This pattern that Jesus started, who, though being God, he descended, they started, his followers, in all these little outposts, in places like Colossae and places like Philippi, they started having this attitude that Jesus had, they started having this attitude in them. I love that. Have this attitude. Paul says, remember, have this attitude in you, which was also in Christ. You ever meet anybody with an attitude? We know it, they're just kind of, yeah, they got an attitude. It's kind of like, I got an attitude for you. How about we find some people who would begin to have this attitude in them that was also in Christ? And that attitude of descending to serve, it rocked the world. and it's why Paul says in Colossians 1-3 I started with this where Paul says I thank the God of our Father and Lord Jesus Christ that I hear because I'm hearing of your faith in Christ and love for the brethren and hope you when he says I thank God for the faith I hear that's in you the faith, I'm so glad that there's a Bible study in Colossae there might have been a Bible study there and there's nothing wrong with the Bible study but while he was just juiced about while he was in prison the fact that he heard that there were people who were believing in Jesus, which meant, among other things, they were believing that the Jesus way was the way. And we're going to live that way. And the fact that they believed in the Jesus way was manifested in their love. I thank God that I hear of your faith and your love. So their faith in Jesus way was manifested in their love, and that was rooted in hope. And I'm just so glad because it means there's a bunch of lunatics in Colossae who are giving their life away, and this could change the world. people were doing it, Paul did it there's a story in Acts 16 where he goes with Silas to Philippi actually and he comes into the town and he says well you know I know everybody here worships Caesar in the race for honors but we're here to say Caesar isn't Lord, there's a whole different way and there's a whole different God and this is a real God and he's risen from the dead and Caesar's dead but God's alive through Christ but Jesus is Lord and they got real mad at him because people were actually beginning to believe that way might work, and slaves in particular were getting upset, so they became a threat. Can you see that? So they brought him in, beat him with rods, mercilessly. Romans knew how to punish people, and Paul and Silas were punished horribly, thrown into the middle of the prison in this Roman colony, put in stocks, brought out a day or so later, and stood before the magistrate who just wanted to get rid of them, and Paul then brings up, and this was all kind of brought up in this book I read. fascinating. Then at the end, after he was beaten, like you would beat a slave, because Roman citizens, you know, they don't get that kind of treatment. He says, oh, by the way, I'm a Roman citizen. And here's the question the book asks. Why do you wait till after he was beaten? Why do you say, well, are you going to beat me? I'm a Roman citizen. You can't do this. I need due process. He didn't ask for that. Well, why? Why? I don't know for sure. I think one reason, though, maybe, because he thought, you know, if this is going to change, somebody needs to give up their rights. And they need to see it. And, you know, one place I saw this happen, Paul says, was when Jesus did it, so I'm just, I'm not going to demand my rights here. This is nuts. This is nuts. Why would you do this, Paul? You're an apostle. You're a Hebrew of Hebrews. You're a Roman citizen. No, I'm a slave. I am a slave of a dishonored slave. That's who I am. And beloved, that was the basis of his authority as an apostle. And all of that is why this guy would say things honestly like this. I've never met you, But I never cease to pray for you. I think about you all the time. And I greatly struggle on your behalf. And I even suffer. And I'm just so thrilled when I hear of your faith and your love and your hope. Why would you care? Because I'm a slave. And I love this phrase. It's like Paul would answer the question, you or me, in that context. would be like, yeah, you see that slave? Yeah, yeah, the Jesus guy. Yeah, the one you crucified. Yeah, the loser guy. I'm his slave. And I will do anything. He says. And I will go anywhere, he says. Because he did it first, and I'm following him. My prayer is as we continue through this epistle of Colossians. And we're pretty deep into it already, even though we're not out of the first verse yet. No. My prayer for us, you guys, is that the Spirit, among other things, we're gonna do so many other things in Colossians, but one of them, it's why I'm sitting on this Paul guy for a while, it's that the Spirit of this man, it's that the Spirit that is in this man would be in us, affecting us and infecting us, that we actually begin to see ourselves, no, no, no, no, all indignant. You know what the deal is? I'm a slave. That slave, Jesus, I'm his slave. Because that spirit attitude can change the world. Amen? Amen. Let's pray. as we close. Father, I pray by your spirit, the spirit that was in Paul and so affected him and these believers in these little colonies like Colossae and Philippi to turn the world upside down with this unearthly love and sacrifice and humility that brought real authority. I pray that be real among us more and more and more. And we pray these things in Jesus' name. All God's people said, amen. Amen. God bless you as you leave.
