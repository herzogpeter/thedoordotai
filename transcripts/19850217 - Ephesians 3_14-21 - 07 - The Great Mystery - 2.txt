I went with me to the book of Ephesians. It should be easy to find. I know my Bible is getting worn out there. Ephesians chapter 3, still in verse 1. Verses 1 through 13. Ephesians chapter 3, starting in verse 1. Let's pray as we begin. Lord I thank you so much for your word for your precious word that's able to pierce and divide and to move us and to teach us Lord we ask in Jesus name that that you would be our teacher this morning open our hearts to your truth that we may not just hear it and understand it but change in accordance with it in your name, amen the apostle Paul in Acts chapter 20 we discovered a couple of weeks ago was standing before the elders at the church of Ephesus, and he was about to leave, and he gave this charge, take care of the church which Jesus Christ has purchased with his own blood. And it's one thing to hear him say the words, it's another thing for us to feel his heart. Paul was a man who loved the church that Jesus Christ purchased with his own blood. He loved the church, and so he prayed for it, and he wept over it, and sometimes he rebuked it, and he exhorted it, and sometimes he encouraged it, but he always wanted people to understand it. What is the church? Two weeks ago, in chapter 3, verse 1 and following, we saw on Paul's part almost his impatient, burning desire for us to know what it means to be part of the body of Christ. You remember back in chapter 2, he began to talk about the doctrine of salvation. He began to talk about the basic problems of man, And the basic problems of men is not that they're out of touch with their environment or they can't keep relationships going. Those are symptoms. The basic problem with man is that spiritually he is dead. He is a spiritual zombie, a death walker. He thinks he's alive, he's moving, he's walking, he can see, he can talk, but spiritually he's dead. Christ's solution to that is that he made us alive from death to life. And then some results of that is that at one time, because of that death, we were far off, we were cut off, but because of salvation we've been brought near. We were alienated, and he brought us near. And the last problem of man is that man is at war, and he came preaching peace. And it was all summed up, that second chapter in verse 19, when he says this, So then, or therefore, to conclude, to wrap it up, listen, I want you to understand that you are no longer strangers and aliens, believers, but you are fellow citizens. Together you are united with the saints and are of God's household, all of you having been built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole building being fitted together is growing into a holy temple in the Lord. And now in chapter 3, Paul begins to do something that he liked to do as part of his style. He would explain to these people who they were in Christ. He would explain to them some very deep doctrine. and then as if the Holy Spirit of God told him his own limitations, he would back off of that teaching and say, you know something, my ability to communicate this is extremely limited. I can tell you the truth, but I've got to back off here and just pray as he did in chapter 1 that the eyes of your heart may be illumined, that they may be enlightened so that you may really know what is the hope of your calling in Christ Jesus. And so he does the same thing here. He did it in chapter 1, he explained doctrine and then he prayed that they would understand it. In chapter 2 he explained doctrine And now in chapter 3, he's praying again that they'll understand it. And he begins to pray in verse 1, For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus, for the sake of you Gentiles, blank. And something happened to Paul, and we discovered it two weeks ago, that something interrupted his prayer. He was going to pray, and then in his mind, under the inspiration of God, I firmly believe that he stopped and said, Wait a minute, I want to pray that they understand it, but you know, there's something in my heart that tells me maybe they just don't understand it completely. I'm going to stop praying. He picks up his prayer in the 14th verse. You can see that. Again, he starts over with that same wording. For this reason, I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name. Verse 18. My prayer is that you may be able to comprehend, again, understand with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know yourself, the love of Christ, which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God. That's his prayer, but something interrupts it. Something interrupts it. And again, it's that urge on his part for them to understand what it means to be part of the body of Christ. Let's read verse 2, his interruption. If indeed, I'm not going to pray, because unless you understand this, it's worthless. If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace, which was given to me for you, that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. The mystery we discovered two weeks ago was what? That is the body of Christ, the church, this new age, this new dispensation, if you will. This new way of dealing God with man. The mystery is a mystery in the sense that no one up to that point had ever seen anything like this. Jew and Gentile would be one and we would all be one and there would be no distinctions. And there were many metaphors that would describe people of God. But the body of Christ was unique. It was a body. And he goes on. And by referring to this when you read, you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ. which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to the holy apostles and the prophets in the Spirit. To be specific, he's talking about the mystery, the church, okay? But to be specific, what he really wanted them to get, and what he was afraid maybe they didn't understand, was verse 6. To be specific, the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body. that's the real mystery the real mystery is this that there's no distinction between you and me that there is no longer a distinction between Greek and barbarian there is no longer a distinction between men and women Jew and Greek they are all one in Christ that's a great mystery it's something you can't understand and I'm afraid if I just mention it once to you as he did in chapter 2 because that's our question he already talked about this in chapter 2 does he think they're ignorant or something they're really thick in their head so they can't pick up on this It isn't that at all. It's just so important. He wants them to see that this unity that we talk about in the body of Christ is not, dear friends, like being a member of a social club. It's not like being a member of some sort of organization. It's not even like being a member of a local church. I am a member. You are a member. We're kind of members. And I don't have to like anybody, but we're just kind of members. That is not what we're talking about when we talk about being members of the body of Christ. God did not design the body this concept of unity to be thought of as a truce between you and me it is not to be thought of as an alliance between you and me it is not to be thought of as a friendly agreement between you and me a nice handshake and kind of say okay we'll kind of forget our differences and try to get along that's not the concept at all the concept of the body is simply this what God designed to happen between you and me is a fusion the two become one flesh literally, that's the body of Christ, the church. The church is more than a group of people who believe the same things. The church is Christ's body in the world. And when in the church we find discord and bitterness and strife, at that point the body is disconnected, the body is maimed, and the fact that our theology and our doctrine is correct is of little consequence then, Because the Christ that the world sees through the church is maimed and disconnected and looks very weak and ends up being very ineffective. Christ looks like a cripple. And he's very simple. It's very easy to ignore him. Very little power. The church of Christ, the great mystery, is so important that we grasp it. I think you know by now when we're talking about the body of Christ, we're not talking about any building. We're not talking about any denomination. We are talking about the body of believers that have been bought by the precious blood of Christ. and it's precious in the mind of God, the church. It is central to everything that we are, and that is why all through the New Testament we have teaching on the church, what it is. That is why the Apostle Paul goes to such great lengths explaining to us theologically what the church is, what the body of Christ is, and what our part in it is. And that is why we are taking as a church, this time, these weeks, in this study of the church, using this text to kind of pull out of it, back off of it a little bit and look at this concept that Paul had so deeply ingrained on his heart and wanted so terribly to communicate to his people. The concept of the church, Christ's body in the world. What is it? What are we? How are we to function? What is our structure to be? What are the biblical priorities of the church? What is the function and the responsibility of its leadership and its congregation? We need to know those things if we are going to function as the body. And so we teach and we talk. The first thing we talked about a couple weeks ago was the importance of the church of Christ in the mind of God. We established that very firmly in Ephesians 5. We looked at that beautiful passage that was paralleling the love of a man and a wife to the love that Christ has for the church. And we hear that he loved the church and he gave himself for the church. And he wants to protect the church and present it blameless, holy and blameless to God. And he wants to nourish it and protect it. He's having a love affair with the church. We also saw in Matthew 16, 18, that Jesus says these words, I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not be able to prevail against it. It's his church. He bought it with his own blood, and then he built it by himself, on himself, for himself. It's his, and thus it's sacred. But we had to go on from there. That established, we went on and discussed the history of the church, how the church was formed, and we discovered that in Jerusalem, On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came and filled those who believed, and at that moment the body was formed. And what a church that was. 3,000 people the first day, and then they began to disperse and go their own way, but that church continued to grow. They were a growing church, a productive church, dynamic, evangelizing, a Holy Spirit church, a God-blessed church is what they were. And we discovered the fact that there was no need in that church for any human attraction. There was no need for gimmicks and games and balloons and popcorn and peanuts. The reason there wasn't a need for that, because here was the people who were excited about Jesus. And they went everywhere telling everyone that Jesus is the Christ. The program, real complicated. Acts chapter 2 verse 42 tells us what their program was. It was this. They devoted themselves continually to sound doctrine, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer. real complicated. That was it. Those four things were what made up the program of that early church. And the result of all of that was that they went everywhere telling everyone that Jesus is the Christ. And when you're excited about that, there really isn't a whole lot of need for a lot of the gimmicks. But if our hearts aren't really tuned into the Lord and we're not really fired up concerning him, then we need to bring on the gimmicks. Bring on the clowns. It would be a necessity. What else would we have to get us going? That wasn't their focus. What a fellowship they had. What a caring group they were. I want you to know something, even as I go into this little dimension of this teaching this morning, that they had an incredible thirst for sound teaching. They devoted themselves to the apostles' doctrine. But they also had a strange habit of taking the doctrine that they were learning and not letting it sit there and nod their heads and going, ah, that is a deep truth. Ah, yes, that is truth and I appreciate the truth and I'll go like this and agree with it. They had a strange habit of taking the doctrine that they were hearing and learning and incorporating it into their lives and it affected their church and it affected how they lived and how they acted. You know what? Our witness to the world, our witness to the world is not what we say we are. I want you to get this. Our witness to the world is not what we say we are. Our witness to the world is what we are. I think we can grow here. Hebrews 10, 24 says, Let us consider or let us spend some time thinking up ways that we can stimulate one another to love and good deeds. We need to spend some time doing that. I think that as a church, we are in a very enviable position. We are in a position right now where we all sense the Spirit of God in our midst and we all sense that we are growing and moving into some exciting days. But we are also, I want to tell you this, we are in a very enviable size right now. and it's the kind of size where we can just about do anything we want in terms of ministry. If we want to start something, we can start it. We have the people to minister. We have the people who are excited to do it. We're also small enough that we can really have intimacy with one another. But you know what? We're growing. And I have a fear, and I want to share it with you from the pastor's heart, that as we grow, and even the size we are now, it makes no difference. We could be as cold to each other as can be. In a small church, you can do that. But I believe that we're in a position now that now is the time that we begin as a congregation, as leadership, to pray and to develop caring groups, sharing groups where you and I together can open ourselves up to each other, can build the body, can pray together, can share together on a level that just is not possible in this kind of thing. And even maybe in terms of any kind of ministry we're having moving right now in our church isn't possible anywhere in our church. We need to pray about a solution to that. Would you do that with me? I really covet your prayers concerning that. That's something we need to consider about. They had fellowship. And it was important. Okay, that's the history. We see the model of that Jerusalem church. The question is, I can look at the model, I can see the example, but what I need to know, here we are in 1981, the church of the open door, how do we develop those necessary characteristics? I can look at the characteristics and go, aha, those are the characteristics we want. How do we develop them? Is there a form? Is there a biblical instruction concerning this? Is there a guideline, a form to follow? Yes, there is. And we're going to do some teaching this morning concerning that. I want to introduce you to Timothy and Titus. Timothy and Titus, New Testament apostles. You know of them very well, I'm sure. They were evangelists. Now, an evangelist in the New Testament is not the kind of thing that we think of as an evangelist. Today, an evangelist is someone who comes into our church for a week of meetings and does his thing and then he leaves. And the Billy Graham type where he does his crusades and his whole thing is evangelistic and that's great. I'm not negating that ministry. What I'm saying is that it was different then. An evangelist in those days was someone who was a church planter. And what Timothy and Titus were called of God to do was to go into a church, go into an area where Christ was not named, win some of those people to Christ, establish congregations in those areas. And what they would do is they would stay from one to three years in that area. And what their ministry would be during that time was to be establishing leadership. And when mature leadership would emerge, he would ordain them as elders. They would ordain them as elders and he would move on. A church would be established. But Timothy and Titus, at this particular time, when they're moving into this ministry, are facing the same question that we do when we look at this church in Jerusalem. How? How? What kind of form should we follow? I can look at that church in Jerusalem, Timothy and Titus could say, and I can see the model. I came from it. That's wonderful. But how do I establish that? What should my ministry be? Is there a method? Is there a priority? What should our ministry focus on if it's going to be healthy and produce the kinds of qualities that we want to have? So Paul writes 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, and he says, Yes, Timothy and Titus, there is a focus. And I am going to give you the basis of what the church is to be, what your ministry is to be, and it's just as clear and lucid as could be. I want you to turn to 1 Timothy 3. We're going to be jumping around today, and you're going to need your Bibles. 1 Timothy 3, verse 14. Paul says this. It's all going to be in 1 Timothy and Titus, 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, so you'll be in the area. Verse 14, Paul says, I'm writing these things to you, Timothy, hoping to come to you before long, but in the case that I'm delayed, I write so that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God. There is a form. There are some things we need to know about building a church. And they are very clear. This sermon is really one great big long thing that's lasting two or three weeks. And if you're trying to keep notes, it may be kind of tough. I don't give you three little triads anymore where they all rhyme, you know, save, sanctified, and surrendered or something like that. And it's all really nice and you can remember it. These are kind of coming over three weeks. And if you're trying to hang on here, The three things we've covered so far are the importance of the church, the history of the church, and now, three, the ministry of the church. What's the basic task of the ministry? The answer is this. Very simply, very clearly, without beating around the bush or anything, the priority of the church of Jesus Christ is this. To teach sound doctrine. That's it. And you may say, well, that's the focus. Yes, that is the focus. That is the priority. What about fellowship? You just mentioned the importance of fellowship. I believe firmly, and the Word of God is going to verify this over and over again, that good fellowship and good ministry and all those other ministries that are so important to the life of a church flow from the teaching of sound doctrine. That's the priority, sound doctrine. Not my opinion, not your opinion. I think this, who cares? Not playing on people's emotions, that's not what we need. not to be a fundraiser, not to provide entertainment for the kids, not to provide short little spiritual thoughts, weekly devotionals, sermonettes for Christianettes, sound doctrine. And I believe that with that as the priority and the mandate, and with that happening effectively, again, all the other ministries of the church are going to develop as God's people respond to the truth with obedience. Titus 2, verse 1, says this, But speak thou, Titus, the things which become what? Sound doctrine. That's it. That's the priority. Timothy and Titus, if you want to know where to start, if you want to know what to focus on, focus on that. And all the other things are going to take place. 1 Timothy 1, verse 3. 1 Timothy 1, verse 3. Paul is speaking again. To Timothy, as he says, I urge you upon my departure from Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus in order that you may instruct certain men not to teach, what? Strange doctrines, nor pay attention to myths and endless genealogies which give rise to mere speculation rather than furthering the administration of God which is by faith. I want to tell you something. Paul is saying this. Timothy, if they're not getting sound doctrine, what they're going to do, that church is going to be a sucker for every con game and every false teacher that comes down the pike. I guarantee it. They're going to get into endless genealogies and give rise to mere speculation. There won't be any integrity. There won't be any firmness. They won't know which direction to go. And they'll just follow every little thing. Verse 5. But the goal, here we go again, this is neat. The goal of our instruction is not so that you will just all know. The goal is something active. The goal of our instruction is love. Here comes the ministry. The goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere heart. Not that everybody would just sit here and go like this. The goal is activity. A change in life. For some men, verse 6, straying from these things have turned aside to fruitless discussion. King James calls it vain jangle. Wanting to be teachers of the law, even though they do not understand, but wanting to be teachers, okay, this is important too, this verse. They have a desire to teach. They have a desire to sound some sort of authoritative word. But they're not getting sound doctrine. And so what they do is they grab anything that comes along and they teach it. It could be mush. It could be shallow. It doesn't matter. What they have is a desire to teach. So they teach what they have. They need sound doctrine. Then they'll be effective. But these people, wanting to be teachers of the law, even though they don't understand, either by what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions. They talk authoritatively, but they don't know the word. The priority of the church is to teach sound doctrine. verse 10, and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching. The word sound there in the Greek is where we get our word hygienic or healthy, healthy, hygienic. That's what builds the body, healthy teaching. We're not going to grow on mush. We can't. We can't do it. First Timothy chapter 4, verses 1 and 2. Paul is giving Timothy a very stern warning here. And he says, Timothy, as a minister, as one who's entrusted with this ministry, you need to know that the Spirit explicitly says that in the later days, the latter days, some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons by means of hypocrisy of liars, seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron. The question is this. Okay, Timothy just got a warning. So what's he supposed to do? Okay, I'll be worried about these people, these deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons. My question is this. To Paul, Paul, as Timothy, how do I do that? How do I protect the church of Christ against deceitful scheming, deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons? The answer is simple. It's in verse 6 and 7. Very, very clear, verse 6 and 7. In pointing out these things in the King James Version, I like the way it says it a little better. Timothy, if you put them in remembrance of these things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, constantly nourished on the words of faith and of sound doctrine which you have been following, but have nothing to do with worldly fables fit only for old women. Sorry, ladies. On the other hand, discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness. That's to be our commitment. That's to be our commitment. Look again at 1 Timothy 4, verse 13. He even tells us the pattern for preaching. I want you to teach it and here's how to do it. I like this. It gives us everything. He's giving a real seminar here to Timothy and Titus as to what the priority of the church is to be. Tells them how to do it. Until I come, Paul says. Now I want you to get the full force of what he's saying here. What he's saying is, Timothy, till I come, preach this way. But that's not the full force because there's something behind that and I think we can read into this text what he really means and I think it's this. Till I come, preach this way. And when I come, I'm going to preach this way. And when I leave, preach this way. Until he comes, preach this way. How? Listen. Give attention to public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, and to teaching. That's the pattern. What did he say? He said, first, read it publicly, preaching. Secondly, teach it. That means explain it. Thirdly, exhort it. Apply it. That's what it means. So we're supposed to read it, we're supposed to explain it, and then we apply it, and then you leave it up to the people whether they're going to obey it or not, but that's your task. That's the pattern. You know what? What that basically is, is nothing more fancy than simple, plain, expository preaching. And I'm going to tell you something. This is my opinion. I'm going to qualify it with my opinion, but I'm going to say it with a firmness that I want you to catch, that I believe with all my heart that this expository preaching, this reading it, explaining it, teaching it, and then applying it is the foundation for any biblical ministry. I believe that that's the biblical pattern for the church. Not sermonettes for Christianettes. Not little devotional things. Not little topical things here and there, just disconnected all over the place. A little warm you up a little bit every Sunday. No! Not salvation sermons every Sunday. Not for the believer. That's not what's going to protect the flock. 2 Timothy 3.16 It says, I don't need to read that one. Yes, I do. I know it, but my mind just went blank. Okay, how much are you supposed to preach? All scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching and reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness. Why preach it? So that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work. Do it. Do it. That's our commitment. And how long do you do it? Till I come. We need to hear it. We need to learn it. We need to be challenged by it. We need to apply it. And then we need to do it. Till I come. But there's more. Verse 15 and 16. Same verse. He's instructing Timothy. He says, Timothy, take great pains with these things. Take great pains with these things. Because there's going to be all sorts of distractions to do other things, but do this. Be absorbed in them so that your progress may be evident to all. 16. Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching. Persevere in these things. Don't be distracted from them. For as you do this, as you do this, you maintain this priority, you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you, your church, your flock. The concentration of leadership is to be absorbed in the Word. And that's why the apostles in Acts chapter 6 appointed deacons. The apostles for the early church were the elders of the church. The elders kind of replaced them. The apostles came along, planted churches. They were the leadership. When you have a bunch of new Christians, who is supposed to be the leadership? God in his wisdom gave the apostles to do that. and then when maturity came elders were appointed and they were supposed to be absorbed in the word in Acts chapter 6 the apostles got to the point where they were doing every other thing in the world but being absorbed in the word and they said this is crazy we've got to have somebody take care of this so they appointed deacons to carry out the physical dimensions of the ministry important ministry but the apostles were supposed to be doing something else Dr. Criswell a famous preacher I don't know if you know of him but in the Chicago area his name is very well known went to candidate at a very large, a fairly large, about 500 people at the time when he went. A church in Dallas, Texas. And they asked him what his style of preaching would be and he said simply this, well, I'll start in Genesis and I'll preach through Genesis and then I'll go through and when I'll get done somewhere around Revelation and then when I'm done with Revelation I'll go back to Genesis and begin all over again. And they said, why? And they said simply this, I'm accountable to God if I don't. Teach sound doctrine. That's the priority. And if that takes a back seat in the church, and if that becomes boring, and if that becomes mushy, and if that becomes insipid, I don't care what kind of program we have. The church is in trouble. 2 Timothy 4, 1 and 2. Look that up. Paul's great charge to Timothy. Timothy, I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is the judge of the living and the dead, and by his appearing in his kingdom, do this. Preach the word. Be ready in season and out of season. Reprove, rebuke, exhort with great patience and instruction. Timothy and Titus, that's your responsibility. That's the ministry of the church. And the only way to build the saints is to do that. And the only way to please the Spirit of God is if our ministry is maintaining the standard of sound words. But that leads me to the next point. And this is the last one I'm going to give you today. We've only got time for two. The first is the ministry of the church today. And now, the leadership of the church. This is extremely important, and it flows very naturally from the ministry of the church because it is the call of God upon the leadership of our church to carry out the priority. I hope you're following that. It's the call of God upon the leadership in our church to carry out God's mandate, His priority, to teach and to apply the doctrine. Real quick, in the Word of God there are only two categories of leadership in the church. One is elders, the other is deacons. There are none other. First of all, let's look at the elders. The first thing I want you to know about elders is this, that by divine arrangement, God has designed into the fabric and into the work of the church of Christ a plurality of elders. Extremely important concept and one that isn't always, we might, yeah, yeah, yeah, but we don't always understand that in terms of how we're living. Got to get it. A plurality of elders simply means there's more than one. More than two. No one man is to be the head honcho in the church. No way. There is no head elder, there's no such thing. There is no one person or even two people who have more power or authority than someone else. You might look and say, well, what about the pastor? You know, that's it. You kind of look at the head man. No, no. I am nothing more than an elder. I'm an elder. I happen to be, call of God, to be the teaching elder of this church, I believe. And the way I know that, it's not some big arrogant thing. You've confirmed that to me. You've confirmed that. In fact, that's how the elders are chosen. You see, the congregation, in discerning its own people, and its own needs and its own leadership potential discerns those who have had the hand of God placed upon them. And we have made those calls of those men. I'm an elder. I'm a teaching elder. I'm no more authority, though, than any other elder in our church. I am not reverend anybody. I am not father anybody. I'm Dave. It's really important that we grasp this. The life of the church, listen, belongs not to one or two or three, the life of the church in terms of leadership belongs to the collective leadership of its elders who are under the direction of the Spirit of God. God designed it that way. The requirements are clear. Let's look at 1 Timothy, starting in chapter 3. 1 Timothy 3, verse 1. I love this first verse. It's a trustworthy statement. If any man aspires to the office of overseer, it's a fine work he desires to do. And as I begin that verse, I would like to appeal to you men. I would like to appeal to you young people that this is a fine work that you aspire to do. That if this... You know, we have ambitions, don't we? We have all sorts of things. I would like to appeal to your heart to have one of the ambitions, the burning drives in your heart that one day God would place upon your life this call to fine work that anyone would desire to do. Let's look at the qualifications. An overseer, then. That's an elder. By the way, an elder is his title. Bishop is his duty. Bishop means overseer. So elder is his title, overseer is his responsibility, to oversee the flock of God. An overseer, then, must be above reproach. It doesn't mean he's perfect. It means that he doesn't have any big splotch on his life that would cause himself, his life, his family to be a stumbling block to the rest of the church and keep him from doing the leadership responsibility that he has in the church. He must be the husband of his one and only wife. He must be temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable. He must have a house that is open to other people. and by the way that ties in very well with keeping his home in order an elder has to have his home in order why? well one of the things if he's ever going to be hospitable he can't be bringing people into a house in an uproar okay? okay able to teach I need to do some teaching on this too this does not mean that every elder is a teacher in the church I'm going to give you some scripture in just a couple of seconds I don't want to say later too much you'll freak you out they don't all have to be teachers they don't all have to be teachers what this means basically is that by their life, they are able to communicate their faith, though. They should be able to do that. It doesn't mean that they're all teaching a class. Also found in that exhortation there is a flexibility, a teachableness. Okay? Not only is he apt to teach, but he's teachable. He's flexible. He's not rigid. You can teach him things. He's growing. He's a growing person, so he's not a perfect, you know, he's constantly flexing and learning and growing and willingly obeying and changing. Okay? He's teachable. not addicted to wine it means simply this he doesn't sit at the table long with his wine by the way in the New Testament all they had to drink was wine they didn't have water the water couldn't be drunk and so all they could drink was wine and the instruction for the elder is don't be sitting by too long and if you do you're going to be disqualified in this area repugnacious that means you have to punch somebody out wouldn't do but gentle uncontentious free from the love of money you can't be always manipulating and trying to get ahead with your money and that kind of thing He must be one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity. But if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God? Not a new convert, important lest he become conceited and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil. And he must have a good reputation even with those outside the church, so that he may not fall into the reproach of the devil or the snare of the devil. It doesn't mean he's perfect. It doesn't mean he's perfect. and I even fear reading some of these things because I can just see our elders going, oh no, mass resignation. Oh, I don't fit in it. It doesn't mean he's perfect, but the pattern is clear. The pattern is clear and I think I can say with great confidence that I thank God for the elders that God has placed his hand upon in our church and the leadership that they exhibit through their lives. But there's more. His position, the elders' position is one that's God-appointed. Again, it needs to be understood. It is the call of God that makes an elder an elder. But along with that call of God, God uses the congregation to make that call secure. It is the responsibility of the apostles, first of all, then other elders, then the congregation, to look among its church, to look among its people, and discern those men who God has placed his hand upon, who God has marked out. It is our responsibility as a church to keep a handle on who is in our church, who is coming up, who is exhibiting these qualifications, and it's our job. See, I believe that we have elders in our church, but I also believe that in our congregation sitting here right now, our elders already, we haven't singled you out. It's our job to do that. It's our job to identify you and put you into that place where you can function with all the authority that you need. But how do we choose them? First, we consider the qualifications. Acts chapter 14, verse 21 through 23. You don't have time to look it up. But basically it says when they were ordaining elders, They fasted and they prayed together concerning so that they would have discernment in this matter. 1 Timothy 5.22 gives us another instruction in choosing elders. It says, don't lay your hands on anyone quickly. This is a time thing. It needs time. A lot of discernment, a lot of prayer. Looking at the qualifications. Listen, an elder is never, ever, ever chosen because of his business experience, his business savvy. He has never any leadership position, deacon, elder, anything. He has never chosen because he can handle money well. He has never chosen because of his tenure, because he's been around a long time and was one of the guys who built the church. So what? That is not the characteristic or one of the qualifications for being an elder. It has nothing to do because he's older. That's one thing that we always think. An elder is older. Not necessarily. Very often that's true because there needs to be spiritual maturity exhibited. But Paul said to Timothy, who is struggling with the same thing. Timothy, let no man despise thy youth. If God has placed his hand upon you to function in this way, then you do it. And we need to be open to that kind of thing. He's chosen because God has laid his hand on his life to lead the church. And through prayer and fasting and observing a life, we discern and then we ordain. And after he has chosen, what do we do? We commend him to God. Why do we do that? After he's chosen, we commend him to God. And the reason we do that is because it is to God that our elders are answerable. Now please get me on this. This is going to sound like I'm making some big distinction and, you know, the elders are the bosses of the church. There is a way in which that's true. There is a way in which our whole congregation makes decisions, and that's true. But our elders are accountable to God. Listen here. They are not answerable to the congregation. Yes, they are, but they aren't. Okay, I want you to hear me on this. I want you to feel what I'm saying. They are answerable to the congregation, but far more important than that, They're answerable to God for every decision they make. They are not answerable to any board, to any committee, to any denomination. You see, if our elders are to lead, to rule the flock, they are going to have to be free from any pull, from this group, or that group, or this feeling, or my wife's feelings, or my husband's feelings, or anything like that. If our leadership is going to be strong and effective, we need to realize that our accountability is to God. And we have to face Him with the decisions we make. And that's why when we decide, we do two things. We pray and we search the scriptures, and on the basis of those two things, we decide. And I have a feeling if you knew your elders were functioning in that way, you wouldn't have any problem with the decisions they make. The elders are not a board. They are not a committee. They are a fellowship of God-ordained, God-qualified, God-gifted, spirit-filled men given to the local church to teach, to protect, to lead, and to rule that church. And that leads me to the last dimension of an elder's function, and that's 1 Timothy 5.17, where it says this, Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching. This is the text that indicates to us very clearly that not all elders did teach. It says give double honor to those who rule, those elders, and also to those who teach. So not all did. One of the things I want to focus your mind on right here is this. Let the elders who rule, rule. That's the word I want you to understand. It means to govern. It means to administrate the church. I believe with all my heart, and I feel like I can say this without fear of any successful contradiction, that in a biblically ordered church, the elders are the decision makers of that church. They have been called of God to rule the church. I also believe that when that is not the structure within which the elders are functioning when the flow of leadership and when the flow of the decision making process is not coming from our elders to the congregation when that is not the flow the result is going to be frustration sometimes confusion and you know what the frustration here is this that our elders could qualify totally to function in their roles they could be tremendous leaders But if the structure within which they're functioning is not allowing them to rule, to do what God's called them to do, there's going to be frustration and there's going to be confusion and they're going to look like they don't have the power they need to have. Deacons, what is the role of the deacons? It's not to be the major decision makers in the church. The deacons originally were called to carry out the physical ministries. The elders directed it through the scripture, the reading of scripture and through prayer, and then on the basis of that, they decided. What about the congregation? Well, we all know the congregation's job, their job is to sit and snipe at the elders. Goofy elders, nothing. We're going to talk about that a little next week. We're going to talk about that a little next week as we go to the table. We're going to consider as a body what our responsibility as a congregation is to the leadership in the church and how we've all functioned together as a body. Hebrews 13, 17 says, here's your responsibility, obey, and submit. For they, the elders, the leadership, keep watch over your souls because they are accountable to God if they don't. Therefore, congregation, let them do this with joy and don't give them grief. That's what it says. And not with grief, for their word, for they, for this, would not be profitable for you. There's two things that can ruin a church. One is lousy leadership. It can destroy it. The other is rebellious, hard-hearted people. I've got to stop here. I've got to stop here, but you know something? Just like I did before, two weeks ago when we were in the same text, I've got to do what the Apostle Paul did with all this teaching. I'm overwhelmed with the fact that we can have all of these things working in fine tune. Our elders can be elding, and our deacons can be deacons, and our pastor can be pastoring, and our congregation can be congregating. You know, just wonderful. But it all comes back to the heart of Paul in Ephesians 3, when he says, before I tell the elders what they're supposed to do and before I tell the pastor what he's supposed to do in the congregation, there needs to be something else that motivates us to do that. And to me, it's so clear that that's the mystery. That's the mystery. Before I pray that you understand any of this, before I exhort you to do any of this, I pray that we would understand the mystery of the church and that is this, that you and I are one. We are fused together. That's the body. And you know something? I don't know how that hits your heart, but it hits mine this way. When I consider the fusion that I have with you and you with me, that we are Christ's body in the world, everything in my body wants to say, Lord, what do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? I feel like the congregation when we understand that will say, Lord, how do you want us to respond? What kind of ministries do you want to lead us into? We're in this together. There's no other way that we can function, and that is the foundation from which all of the power and all the authority and all the glory in the church is the flow. Let's pray. Lord, this has been a lot of teaching. And yet, Lord, I sensed in my heart that it's been good and it's been needed. Father, I just pray that you would continue to bring in our church that glory. Oh, Lord, we can know so much. But, Father, our hearts need to be seared and our hearts need to be touched and tender to your spirit as you're moving through us to just be obedient and tender to one another. Father, continue to do that work in our hearts. In your name, amen.
