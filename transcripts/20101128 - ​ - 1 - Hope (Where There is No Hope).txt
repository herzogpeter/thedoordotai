Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. My name is Kimberly, and I've been coming to Open Door for about 10 years, and this is my story. I wasn't one of the lucky ones. I didn't grow up in a Christian home. I guess you could say I really didn't grow up in a home at all. In all the ways that are significant, I was abandoned by my parents. It was a slow, confusing, and very painful process. They were both drug addicts who first withdrew emotionally and then physically. until one day at 12 years old, I found myself living in our apartment with only an occasional parents from one of them. I was essentially left to fend for myself. Like every child, I longed for acceptance and unconditional love, but I never felt a lasting sense of either. Although I always had a roof over my head, I never felt protected and safe, and I certainly never felt wanted or needed. Emotionally, I had become the equivalent of an orphan. The word God was never uttered in our home unless it was used as a profanity. My only fleeting introductions to him were through friends, either a visit to their church because I had spent the night, or through a prayer before a meal. It became one more thing that separated me from everyone else in the world, because our family didn't know this God. The summer after I graduated from high school, I found out I was pregnant, and the reality of how alone I was took on a whole new meaning. My parents wanted nothing to do with another kid, so I was told to either terminate the pregnancy or get out. It was the final and ultimate act of abandonment. I was terrified. Feeling alone in a place you call home is one thing. Having no home is another thing entirely. Twice my mother drove me to a clinic to terminate my pregnancy, and both times some deeper knowing inside of me spoke to me and pleaded with me to believe that there was another way. During the second visit, I sat in the exam room, and silent tears streamed down my face, And I remember wondering if this God I'd heard about was real, and if he was, where was he? The nurse came in and sat with me for a few minutes. I remember her pause several times, and she quietly said, you know that you do have another option. I remember opening my eyes and sort of taking a slow breath and staring at her. It was exactly what I needed to hear. It was as if in that moment I was given permission to say yes to this life that was growing inside of me. I was pretty numb as I packed my bags to leave. Waves of panic and fear were overwhelming, and I sank to my knees next to my bed and finally pleaded with God to help me. How could I do this all on my own? If you are there, God, I need you to help me. I need you to love me and to walk through this with me. I cried myself into an exhausted sleep. When I woke, I remember feeling an unfamiliar sense of something. I know now that it was peace, but when you are a child who has never experienced peace, you have no words to attach to it. I gathered my things and asked the neighbor to drive me to the Greyhound bus station. I've heard of this place in St. Cloud called New Beginnings. It was for girls just like me. I needed a new beginning, so it seemed the logical place to start. As I arrived at New Beginnings, a nun who lived there, Sister Therese, greeted me at the door. She took my face into her hands and silked into my eyes and said, I have been waiting for you, my child. I spent the weeks that followed close to her side listening to stories of God's love, mercy, and grace. And she shared the gospel with me and prayed prayers of healing over me. That is where I met God in his full glory. That is where I experienced for the first time in my life the kind of love and acceptance that every child should have. That is where peace became my familiar friend. I gave birth to my daughter, Bethany, on October 3, 1990. what an amazing gift becoming a mother is. Being able to pour into my child all of the love, compassion, and nurturing that was withheld from me was a defining moment that redefined how I viewed myself and the world around me. Barriers that I had built around my heart to protect myself were no longer necessary. It's impossible to find the right words to do it justice. All that I can tell you is that in the months and eventually years that followed her arrival into my life, the holes that existed began to fill up and the deep ache from my family wounds began to fade. As a mother, I learned how to give and receive unconditional love through the gift of my daughter's life. For the first time ever, I was able to fully understand God's truth that not only is my Bethany his beloved, but I am as well. my life's journey from childhood to now has included some of the darkest experiences a child or young woman can walk through though now in the light of God's love and embrace I can see that it was part of the plan who better to minister to the lost in the least than one of their own when I step in and lovingly tell a woman or a child that I understand her pain and suffering my empathy is authentic. Since 2006 I have poured my heart and soul into building a safe place for women and children to come and seek refuge. A place where they can have space to sort things out and have their needs met. A place to find hope for their future. In my time there it has become abundantly clear to me that it is God's calling on my life to impact the lives of the lost and the broken. regardless of their story, their age, or their gender. I want to help transform their broken beginnings into triumphant endings, all the while letting them be the author of their own story. Today, I'm the executive director of a ministry called Southside in South Minneapolis, which is where my story began. Simply put, our mission is to serve women and children in crisis, to offer them hope, to nurture, equip, and love those who come to us in their utter brokenness, looking for someone to walk alongside them. I want my legacy to be that I changed lives. I want to be God's servant in all areas of my life and have his love be felt with every word and every action that comes through me. Whether I'm ministering to a single mom struggling to find hope and care for her child, or helping a young woman struggling to choose life for her unborn baby, or making a child feel loved and safe and show them they have value and potential, I want to do it all. And the Holy Spirit living inside of me says that I can. Hey everybody. Well, good morning. Yes. Well, hope isn't hope. The bright light of hope is not hope unless it shines into the darkest corners of our broken, tired, weary lives. Amen. And I want to thank my friend Kim for sharing her story. I heard that story through email about a year ago where she emailed me. And then I met her daughter, Bethany, a couple weeks ago. beautiful young woman who just got married here at Open Door. And it's just a beautiful story of redemption and hope and life. So thank you, Kim. Why don't we pray? Yeah, thank you, Kim. Totally embarrassing her. I'll embarrass her further before the service. She has a cold, and so her voice is very raspy. But then she said, but at least I have the Demi Moore vibe going on, which I thought was cool. Why don't we pray? and then we'll dive into the talk. God, I want to pray specifically for the people for whom this word hope is almost like a mockery. It makes a mockery of their lives because the place maybe that they're sitting right now feels so hopeless that no light can get in. And so God, for those people, I pray the power of your Holy Spirit would come and bring hope where there is no hope. Amen. Well, I want you to think about that day, that time in your life where hopes were high. Maybe it was that day that you got engaged and you went home and you picked up the rotary phone and called your mom and said, he asked me and I said, yes, I'm engaged. Or maybe it was the moment that you found out you were pregnant and you'd been trying and you wanted this baby and you looked at the little stick and it said positive. and your hopes for this life were so high. Or maybe it was that day you signed those million sheets of paper buying your first home. And there was a little sticker shock and a little panic in there, but as you thought about building your life in this new home, your hopes were sky high. Maybe it was that day that you decided to start that business that you'd been wanting to start for years. And you'd quit your job and made the plans, and it was day one. You hung the sign up on the shingle, and it was game on. Your hopes were sky high. Remember that day? Well, there's a character in the Hebrew Scriptures. His name is Abram, and he had a day just like that. where Yahweh spoke to him personally about his sacred future. So I want to read it to you. It comes out of Genesis chapter 12, starting in verse 2. We read these words from Yahweh to Abram. I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you. And I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. Now, what you need to know about Abram at this time is he was 75 years old, and his wife Sarai was about that age too. And what was unique about them at that point in time is that they had no kids. And what God means when he says that I will make you into a great nation is I will make many people out of these two people. And for that to happen, you have to have a child. right? And God was saying to Abram, what I want to do is make you into a people that will be my people with the express purpose of blessing the entire world. Abram and Sarai, you are going to be the father and mother of that nation. This was a day of high hopes for them. And I can just picture it in my mind. Abram driving home from work, pulling the car up in the driveway, running in, throwing his keys on the table and telling Sarai the news, Sarai, I heard from the Lord, we are going to have kids, and our kids are going to have kids, and our kids' kids are going to have kids, and we're going to be made into a great nation. To which Sarai probably said, honey, I wish you wouldn't stop by the bar on the way home from work. Right? But it was true. This is what the Lord said. I'm going to make you into a great nation, and you will be a blessing to all people. Write it on a rock. Well, we read a rather unfortunate thing in Genesis 16, verse 1. This is 10 years later. Four chapters in the scriptures equals 10 years. We read in one of the verses, Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had not born him children after 10 years. now she had an Egyptian maid her name was Hagar we'll get back to Hagar in a second but I want you to think about 10 years 10 years between the day when your hopes were so high and the day you're at right now when your hopes had not been fulfilled and maybe some of you are at that very moment right now where it's Thanksgiving 2010 and you could finish this sentence in a number of ways. I was sure by Thanksgiving 2010 I would be, then you fill in the blank, I would be married. I was sure by Thanksgiving 2010 I would be married. I was sure by Thanksgiving 2010, we would have kids. I was sure by Thanksgiving, I would have a job. I was sure by Thanksgiving 2010, I would be over my depression by now. I was sure Thanksgiving 2010 that I would still Be Married. I was sure Thanksgiving 2010 that I would not have cancer. what happens when your high hopes fall like rain and become ash well many times what you and i do is we take matters into our own hands when our high hopes don't come true. Am I right? And what we do is represented by this picture that's going to come up on the screen. That is a stripped screw. And what I do with a stripped screw, what I should do is take out a vice grip and remove that screw so I can put in a new screw, right? that's what I should do but what I usually do is take my powerful power drill and I say you know what if I just apply enough force I can get this bit to thread into those threads and I can really jam that thing in there until it fits right you ever done that Well, no, you haven't done that, but I do that. When my high hopes aren't coming through, what I do is try to force something to happen. And it usually doesn't end well, does it? Well, Sarah had her own version of stripping the screw, of forcing it, of taking matters into her own hands, and it's found in Genesis 16, verse 2. This is where we meet this person named Hagar. So let's read it now. Sarai, and I'm using this amazing translation called the Five Books of Moses by Everett Fox, and what it is is it's a almost painful translation of the literal Hebrew idioms that come up, and so you get a much greater picture, much more clear picture of what the original Hebrew language was. And so that's why I'm using it. I'm going to tell the whole story from that translation. Everett Fox, Five Books of Moses. Here we go. Sarai said to Abram, her husband, Now, here, Yahweh has obstructed me from bearing, which is that's how we translate when our hopes are dashed, right? God has kept me from bearing children. So, here's my idea. Abram, pray, come into my maid. Again, the most literal translation. You can fill in the blanks there. Come into my maid. Perhaps I may be built up with sons through her. Now, the word built up is the Hebrew word bana. Let's all say that together. That was tame, though passable. Bana means to rebuild or restore. And so the picture that you get from Sarai, this old woman who is childless in a society who places value on women based on their ability to give their husbands sons. You get where this is going? Her reputation and value and identity is near rock bottom. And so she has an idea. Picking up her drill and putting that bit into the threads of the screw, she says, perhaps my reputation and identity will be restored if I give my maid to my husband and she can have children for me because the Lord has obstructed me from having children. Have you ever used someone else in order to build yourself up? Have you? Have you ever used something in order to build yourself up, to restore something you feel like has been lost to you? Well, when we are in that situation where our hopes have been dashed and where our reputation is at its lowest, we have two options. Option number one is this. That's option one. And you can keep drilling and keep drilling and keep drilling and keep drilling and keep drilling and keep hoping that maybe with enough force, you will get the result you want. And those of us who do this become a picture of a black hole of need. Keeping forcing the matter, taking matters into our own hands is another option. That's represented by this chalice of water where we say, now I want you to imagine you're really hot, your throat is parched, and imagine cool, pure water touching your lips, going down your throat, and restoring you. Taking a source that is outside of yourself in order to meet the need that is deep down. And then I want you to put your thumb and just put a placeholder in that picture because we'll come back to it. Those are the two options. Now, remember Sarah's plan to give Hagar to Abram. Well, we find out in the scriptures that the plan works and backfires all at the same time. So let's pick up the story in Genesis 16 verse 3. Now Sarai said to Abram, the wrong done me is upon you. Now pause right there. The wrong was that Hagar got pregnant. The plan worked. But when the plan worked, something else went horribly wrong. Sarai said this, I myself gave my maid into your bosom, Abram, but now that she sees that she is pregnant, I have become of light worth in her eyes. So Abram, may Yahweh see justice done between me and you. To which Abram said, what? You told me to do it, right? See, what happened was this. After taking the drill into her own hands and trying to force the screw into the hole, Hagar got pregnant. and after Hagar got pregnant, this, let's call her a 16-year-old servant, when she felt that life growing inside of her, she looked at her boss, Sarai, someone that she used to respect and someone that she used to really honor and almost probably treat as a mother and she started treating her as if she was worth nothing because she could do something that Sarai couldn't. And the word that is used, that's translated as light worth, is a word called kalal. And it literally means to make lighter. It means to take something that once had substance and take the substance away from it. To make something trifling and inconsequential. Hagar began to look at Sarai as if she was inconsequential. And the result of that just gets worse and worse. In Genesis 16, 6, we read this. So Abram said to Sarai, Here, your maid is in your hand. Notice how Hagar is being passed back and forth like property. Your maid is in your hand. And notice how he doesn't even call her. Neither Sarai nor Abram call her by her name. Your maid is in your hand. Deal with her however seems good in your eyes. and so Sarai afflicted Hagar and so much so that Hagar had to flee from her. Now the word afflicted is a word that means a number of things but it's a word called anah and it means to be bowed down. It means to humble someone else. It means to do violence to someone else, to violate them, to silence them. The thing that Sarai did to Hagar was brutal so much so that this single young mother had to flee from the only home that she ever knew, and she went off into the wilderness. We read in the scriptures, we can only assume to die. She had no other options. But we find out what happens. She finds herself by this stream of water. Let's pick up the story in Genesis 16, 7. But Yahweh's messenger found Hagar by a spring of water. anytime you see water in the scriptures, what it means is a new beginning is possible. Think about the waters of baptism. A new beginning is possible. Death to life. And so it's very significant that she finds herself by the spring of water, and that's where Yahweh's messenger finds her. In the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur. And he said to her, this Hagar, notice, Abram, Sarai, never called her by her name, but Yahweh does. Hagar, Sarai's made, whence do you come and whither are you going? And that would be reason enough to use this translation. Whence and whither. When do you get to use those words? Ever, right? Whence do you come and whither are you going? She said, I am fleeing from Sarai, my mistress. Now notice this. She knows where she's coming from. She has no answer to where she's going. She is going to die. She doesn't know where she's going. She has no plan for that. The word Hagar, the name Hagar means stranger. It also means dragged away one. What if your identity was stranger? I think about Kim. Growing up in her house where she barely ever saw her parents. Where she had to call a neighbor to take her to this crisis pregnancy center in St. Cloud. Stranger. Dragged away one. Dragged away from home. and she finds herself in the wilderness. Now the wilderness is a very interesting place in the scriptures. The root word for wilderness is a word called debar and it means to speak. Very interesting. If you think about how the wilderness is used all throughout the scriptures, the children of Israel, when they leave Egypt where they're in captivity, right? and they make what should have been about a week-long journey toward the promised land, but they end up in the wilderness for how long? Forty years! God had a lot that God wanted to speak to them in the wilderness. David talks about the wilderness in Psalm 55, not as a place to be resisted, not as a place that you would go to die, but as a place of refuge, as a place of safety, as a place where you would hear God speaking. Jesus himself is led by the Spirit into the wilderness, where we can only assume he hears from God who he is and what his mission is in life. The wilderness is a place where God speaks, and Hagar is the first person in scriptures that God speaks to in the wilderness. And she is an Egyptian pregnant teenager. Now, if that doesn't tell you who God is and what God does, then I don't know what does. And if that doesn't give you a picture of the God of redemption, then I don't know what does. Amen? Well, what does Hagar hear in the wilderness by this spring of water? Let's read in Genesis 16.10. Yahweh's messenger said to Hagar listen Hagar I will make your seed many yes many and it will be too many to count and Yahweh's messenger also said to her this here you are pregnant you will bear a son and I want you to call his name Ishmael God hears God hearkens for God has hearkened to your being afflicted bowed down punished now she called the name of Yahweh Here is Hagar speaking to Yahweh, the one who was speaking to her. And this is what she calls him. She says, you God of seeing. Amazing. For she said, have I actually gone on seeing here after his seeing me? Therefore, the well, the water that she was sitting by is called even to this day, well of the living one who sees me. Here it is between Kadesh and Bered. And Hagar bore Abram a son. And Abram called the name of the son whom Hagar bore. God hears. Ishmael. What did Hagar hear in the desert, in the wilderness? Four things. First thing she heard was God saying to her this, Hagar, even though you feel like you are about to die, you need to hear from my lips, Hagar. even though you are in the worst situation you've ever been, having been afflicted by your maid, being homeless, being pregnant and left for dead. You need to hear from me, Hagar. You are not going to die, not here. This will not take you out, Hagar. Second thing Hagar hears from the Lord is this. Hagar, even though you've never been a voice, you've never had a voice in your whole life, even though no one has listened to you, You need to hear that I hear you. And we know that because the Lord told her that the Lord heard her. And every time that she would look into her little son's eyes, she would be reminded that God heard because his name was God Hears Ishmael. Third thing Hagar heard was this. Hagar. Abram and Sarai never even called you by your name, but I want you to know that I see you. I see who you were. I see who you are. I see who you will be, Hagar. Person that I see, you matter to me, God says. And the fourth thing that Hagar hears from God in the wilderness is this. Now, Hagar, because you now know that I see you and I hear you and you will not die. You now have the power and strength to go back and live your life with Abram and Sarai. You now have the strength that you need to live your life. And it'll be hard. But now you have hope. And I am convinced that this word that God gave to Hagar is a word that some of you desperately need to hear today. You will not die. And the great part about that is even if you physically die because of Jesus, his death on the cross and resurrection, you will not ultimately die. What you're facing right now cannot ultimately take you out, God says to you. God also says to you, I hear you. If no one else has heard you in your life, you need to know that your voice comes to my ear and it comes in. The God of the universe says this to you, I hear you. The God of the universe also says to you this, I see you, I see you. Maybe no one else has, and maybe you felt invisible to everyone else in your life, but the Lord of the universe that said to Hagar, I see you says to you, I see you. And you also need to know this, because that is true. You can live your life. You can live the life that you are in right now. Now when it comes to the wilderness, here's the deal. I leave you with a question. When faced with these two options, picking up the drill and making it happen on your own and forcing it if need be, or going into the wilderness to hear from God and get fresh new beginnings flowing into you, the question that comes to you is, what do you want? Later on in the scriptures, in Deuteronomy, the Lord says, See, I have set before you life and death. And you can choose life and you can choose death. But the exhortation is to choose life so that you may live. And my word to you is this. If you want to choose life, the water of new beginnings, then you're going to have to make space to hear from God in the wilderness. and in order to do that I leave you with two questions. Number one, what do you need to leave? What familiar thing you need to leave so that you can hear God in the wilderness? And I'm not talking primarily to most of us about leaving a job or a marriage or a person. I'm talking about leaving a familiar way of thinking that says he won't change, she won't change, I can never change, this will never change. I am just stuck. You're going to need to leave that way of thinking so that you can create space to hear from God in the wilderness what God needs to say to you. So first question, what do I need to leave? What familiar thing do I need to leave? Second question, what do I need to hear from God so that I can go back and do my life? As you create space to do those two things, God will speak to you. God is faithful. And God sees you and God hears you and God will make a way so that this thing that you're in will not take you out. But you have to choose life so that you may live. let's pray together now Lord there are those of us in this room right now who are dying without hope it's dark there is no light and so Holy Spirit of God please come right now and shed some light of hope so that there can be hope so for the people that are just hanging on barely by a thread, maybe even with plans to choose death as early and as soon as today. God, I pray that your spirit would come and bring the encouragement and power and life so that they can choose life and live. But this word right now from you would give them permission to go on living. You will not die, says the Lord. You are seen by me, says the Lord. You are heard by me, says the Lord. Your cry comes into my ears and goes in. And you can do your life. Through the strength of God, you can. Holy Spirit, come and breathe life into dead places. Holy Spirit come and breathe new beginnings to places that were dead Holy Spirit of God come to the person that is wondering whether or not to end it all bring new beginnings to the person who's wondering whether or not they should end the pregnancy. Bring new beginnings. To the person who's wondering if she'll ever change and if there's hope, bring new beginnings. To the person who has lost all hope of having kids ever, bring hope and bring new beginnings to the lonely ones among us who are so desperate for arms to hold them, bring new hope and new beginnings. Holy Spirit of God, come with power now. choose life so that you may live amen as we close I want to invite the prayer team forward if you are here and if you have needs for prayer for anything you can come up and be prayed for the rest of you please stand for the benediction this benediction I'm going to read to you is printed on a little card like this that's going to be available for you as you leave the ushers would love to give it to you so you can just bring it with you throughout the week and so please receive this benediction remember a benediction is something that God does for you not something that you do for God and here it is there is one who sees you and hears you. You are not alone. So may the God of hope fill you as you trust in him. Amen? Amen? Go in peace, everybody. Thank you.
