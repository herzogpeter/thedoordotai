Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Let's pray as we dive in. but Jesus for courage to believe that what you say actually is true and that we can trust in it that's what we pray amen well for the last couple of months we've been looking at the parables of Jesus now you need to remember that parables are stories which are intentionally designed to provoke you and to challenge you. I think a good parable is like that little piece of food that is stuck in your teeth that you can't quite get out. It's uncomfortable and it bugs you a little bit. So if you found yourself feeling provoked over the last couple of months or challenged or even thrown off course a little bit, hang in there. That just means it's working. It's what it's supposed to do. But as you wrestle with these parables, I think it's really important that you take your questions to the people with whom you do life, your friends and family, so that you get some help in interpreting what you're experiencing. Because I've found, for me, when I experience something that sort of rattles my cage a little bit, I need to go to the people that I trust, so that I can get some help in interpreting what it is that I'm feeling, what it is that I'm questioning, so that what needs to get let in gets let in. And what needs to change in me can actually change. And one of the ways you can do this is by using the message tool. We mention it a lot, but we created it to help you process these weekend messages with your friends and family. It's updated every week at thedoor.org, and it includes practices and experiences and questions, all designed to help you process the weekend message with a few other people. Now the message tool exists because we believe that these weekend messages are not meant to be a meal that leaves you full and satisfied. Rather, I think, if we do them well, they're meant to be more like an appetizer. Something that whets your appetite and leaves you hungry for more. This isn't the work up here. The work is out there for me and for you. So with that in mind, let's dive into this week's parable. Found in Luke chapter 13, starting in verse 20. And he, that is Jesus, asked, What shall I compare the kingdom of God to? Well, it's like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about 60 pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough. Now with this parable, Jesus is attempting to paint a picture of the kingdom of God to people that don't yet see it or don't yet understand it. For those of us who have never given birth, it's like asking a woman who has given birth, what's that like? And then the woman would say, hmm, to what shall I compare giving birth? Well, the first thing I noticed about this parable seems pretty obvious, at least to me. When active yeast is mixed into dough, a transformation happens. For those of you who have taken a little starter dough, a little starter sourdough kit, and mixed it in to a bunch of dough, and then you leave the room, when you come back, the dough has changed. It rises. It rises because yeast converts the sugar, which is present in the dough, into carbon dioxide, which then forms bubbles or pockets in the dough. That's what makes the dough rise. And then when the dough is baked, the bubbles or pockets set, which gives bread its spongy or soft texture. Because when you put active yeast into dough and you work it in, the dough will rise. You can't stop it, even if you tried. In fact, it's irrepressible. So the kingdom of God, Jesus says, is like that, it's irrepressible. When it mixes with something else, things change. Transformation happens. You can't stop it. One of my friends, she talked to me recently. She was deeply hurt by a person that she had trusted quite a lot. And this person that she had worked with was kind of a public figure. And so he has quite a few fans, but also quite a few critics as well. And so my friend wanted to talk to me about the situation. And she told me that what she felt like God was asking her to do was to begin to pray for this person who had hurt her. To even stand in between his critics and him in prayer. To pray that God would begin to bless him and his family. She said that she felt called by God to begin the long road of forgiving. And I think anytime someone chooses to begin the long road of forgiving, it's because a little bit of kingdom has been growing inside of her. Or inside of them. Now, question. Is she naive to do this? I mean this guy may not even ever know That she has forgiven him or that she is doing these things And who's to say that that makes any impact at all I mean you'd have to be a little naive To think that praying for someone that hurt you That God would bless their family Would actually do something But according to Jesus it's that very thing that is the kingdom because when you start doing things like that what you begin begins a process that is irrepressible so be a little naive because that's the kingdom of god a few years ago steve hansen our global pastor found himself sitting in a church in uganda now he was sitting in this church but it's a little bit of a misnomer to say he was in a building because the church only had walls. There was no floor. There was no roof. There was no windows. And as he was sitting there, he heard the pastor what he thought was going to be an impassioned plea for money to finish this building. But he was shocked when instead they shared that they were putting their building project on hold because of the desperate need of the neighbors around them. They had already built a house for a Muslim grandmother who had inherited her grandchildren when her own children had died of AIDS. And now they wanted to build a home for a woman with five children who had polio and who was HIV positive. And when Steve shared this story back home, there was a couple that heard the story, and they were about to be married. and they were so impacted by the story, they talked and they said, instead of buying rings, we're gonna take that money and give it to this pastor in this church who's gonna help this woman build a house. And to their wedding guests, they said, please, don't buy us any gifts, but instead send it to this church that's building this house for this woman who has polio and who has five kids. And since then, 30 homes like that have been built. It's crazy for a pastor in Uganda to stand in his church with no roof and no windows and no floor and say, we're not going to build this church until we build this church. It's crazy. It's naive to think that his impassioned pleas would even do anything. But Jesus says the kingdom of God is like a little yeast that gets worked into dough. And the dough rises. James 1.27 says this, Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this, to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world. And when people start looking after orphans and widows, when people start sacrificing their own needs and possessions for the needs of other people, then you know that the kingdom of God has been worked into them and is now growing. A little group of people lived this way about 2,000 years ago. We read this in Acts 2, verse 44 and 45. All the believers were together, And they had everything in common, which doesn't mean that they all liked American Idol. It means that they held everything in common. There was no, this is mine and this is yours. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. See, the kingdom of God was active in this little group of people. And what happened was when they saw a need, they said, well, we have this property over here. and we have to sell it because that person is in need. I can't hold this property over here and see this person over here in need that I share a table with. And so needs get met because when the kingdom of God is growing and active in someone, people start doing really naive things like selling their property to give to someone else. Now, a few of you may have noticed a little phrase at the end of James 1.27, and it says, don't be polluted by the world. Now, all this talk about building houses for Muslims, I mean, don't we need to be careful? Well, it's interesting that Jesus never warned the disciples to be careful around those who didn't believe the same things that they did. Instead, Jesus warned them to be careful around those who did believe the same things but didn't practice what they preached. In Matthew 16, 6, we read this. Be careful, Jesus said to them, his disciples. In fact, be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Be on your guard, Jesus is saying, against those who will dilute your ability to affect the world around you. See, there is a kind of yeast that isn't like kingdom yeast, which makes things rise. There's a kind of yeast that Jesus talks about here in Matthew 16, 6 that makes things die. And Paul talks about it in 1 Corinthians 5 when he says, beware, just a little yeast will leaven the whole loaf. So don't be encouraged that it's just a few people that are making things die because that will have an irrepressible effect as well. So in this parable, Jesus is saying, but the kingdom of God is irrepressible in a way that is stronger than the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Now, do we need to be careful about being polluted by the world? I think the answer is obviously yes. We do need to be careful about that. Be careful that you don't let greed overcome the generosity that might bubble up in you. Be careful that you don't let your appetite for more rule you. And as Jen said last week, I think so, so well, be careful that you don't become polluted, so polluted by the world that you begin to marginalize other people in your own quest to be at the center. Because if you do those things, you'll be like yeast, which doesn't make things rise. You'll be like yeast, which kills things. So be on guard for that, unless you're inactive. Unless you become inactive. But in your carefulness, don't remove yourself from the dough entirely. Because how else will it rise? Question. If yeast isn't mixed into dough, what happens to it? Any baker's present? If it's left out on the counter for weeks and months, it actually stops being active. it loses its ability to change sugar into carbon dioxide. It might still look like yeast, but it stops actually being yeast. Sarah Groves, singer-songwriter, she wrote a parable that she put to music. And it's about yeast that has lost its ability to affect dough. It's a little song called To the Moon. And it's all about a church that looks like yeast, but it stopped being yeast. In fact, it's so removed from the dough that it's decided this great idea would be to go to the moon. That way, no one will affect us and pollute us. Some of the lyrics in this song go like this. There'll be no one there to tell us we're odd. No one to change our opinions of God, just lots of rocks and this dusty sod here in this church on the moon. We know our liberties and we know our rights and we know how to fight a very good fight. So grab the last bag there and turn out the light. We're taking our church to the moon. And some of us have been in churches like that. And some of us have become people like that. Without even knowing it. And I think that happens when we start caring more about preserving yeast than we do about transforming dough. Because when yeast doesn't mix with dough, it loses its ability to affect anything. And if we are the body of Christ, then we need to realize we have Christ in us. Our presence around people incarnates Jesus to people in our neighborhoods, in our schools, in our churches. And so that should take us right into the dome. I'll read this parable again. Luke 13, 20-21 says this, What shall I compare the kingdom of God to, Jesus asks? Well, it's kind of like yeast, that a woman took and mixed into about 60 pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough. Well, the second thing I notice about this parable, it has to do with the way the yeast is mixed into the dough. Now, most translations, including the TNIV, which I use, use the word mixed, which sounds normal enough, but the Greek word is a Greek word called ekrypsin, which is a compound verb. Crypto means to hide. It's where we get the word cryptic or crypt from. It means to conceal, and the prefix means within. And so when Jesus is using this word ekrypsin, he's literally saying to conceal within. It implies a secrecy rather than a normal part of preparing bread for baking. And so I think the original hearers would have heard him use that word and they would have been kind of waiting for the punchline. It must have sounded sort of like a joke to them because even if you work really well at hiding just a little bit of yeast into flour, so much so that you can't find it, there's gonna be a very visible reaction that lets everybody know that the yeast is in the dough, and that is the fact that the dough will rise because active yeast makes dough rise. It's irrepressible. But have you ever thought it's a little odd that he uses the word hidden? Have you ever wondered if maybe the strategy of Jesus to change and save the entire world is more of like a hidden strategy. That the kingdom of God would be hidden within the dough. You think about Jesus leaving heaven and coming to earth. You realize that God said this, in order to save the world, I will hide myself in this human being. And this human being's death and resurrection will give an invitation to the rest of the world to what? To rise. Well, we did a survey recently, and we found out that there's a lot of school teachers here at Open Door. In fact, that's the number one job that you all have, more than any others. And I sometimes wonder if Christian teachers feel like they're sort of handcuffed by their school in terms of being a Christian. because they're not allowed to share the gospel with their students or pray with them. And because they don't have the permission to be a visible, out loud presence for Christ in their school that everybody would immediately recognize as Christian, I wonder if they sometimes think that they cannot help the dough to rise in the place that they spend most of their time, their schools, their jobs. But remember, when active yeast is put into dough, even when it's hidden away, what happens? the dough rises it's irrepressible you can't stop it and so i think if you're a teacher a christian teacher that cares a lot about the students and other teachers in your school you need to hear the good news of this because christ resides in you where you are he is and where he is, things rise. Things rise. I was a substitute teacher when I was in grad school in Chicago. Seems like about 100 years ago. But it was this rough school and the relationship between the teachers and students was pretty rough and I got that every time I stepped into the teacher's lounge and heard them talking about the students. Well, I subbed there pretty regularly, about three or four times a week, so I got to know some of the students even pretty well. And I'll never forget one day, I was kind of leaning on the front of my desk, just watching the students file in, and I mean, it was Monday morning, and so it was like a funeral procession. I mean, these kids, I mean. And I noticed one guy in particular, and I had a couple interactions with him because he spent a lot of time in the principal's office. But, you know, so I talked to him a few times, and when he looked up and saw me standing in the front of the room, before he could conceal it, he looked up and his face kind of lit up, and he said, he kind of whispered, kick, beep, it's Mr. Weens. Now, I don't know exactly what that meant, But my intuition, but my intuition was in a school where he felt totally rejected. There was one teacher that helped him to rise. And I think about that. And I think, I don't know what happened as a result of that. Because I didn't get to talk to him about Jesus. I didn't get to pray with him. But I think because Christ was in me in that school, I need to trust that something invisible and hidden was happening. Now, there certainly are times when it is very appropriate and needed to use the name of Jesus and to talk to someone about Jesus and about the way to come into a relationship with Jesus. When to stay silent would not be the right thing to do. Like when people ask. But when you cannot do that for various reasons, I think there's a discipline of trust that we need to lean into, that because Christ is in us, that where we are, He is. And where He is, things rise. You can trust that. You don't need to wonder about that. When yeast is worked into dough, the dough rises. So moms, your presence helps your kids rise because Christ is in you. CEOs and business owners, your presence helps your company rise, especially in these troubling times. College students, your presence in your dorms helps the students in your dorms to rise. You're hidden away within the dough and your work as you're hidden away is simply to know and love God and to know and love the people around you. And the active yeast that is Christ in you will work its way through you and the dough will rise. So I think the question that comes up for many of us who are just hidden away in our mundane jobs and mundane lives is this. How do I know if the kingdom within me is active? Because I don't see a lot of dough rising, to be honest. This is where I think, I notice something beautiful in this parable as well, is that Jesus uses this ordinary, everyday thing that people do all the time. Working yeast into bread because you need to eat. This is everyday thing. I think there are some of us that need to really really remember when Paul writes that we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power comes from God and not from us that even when we feel like a fragile, cracked jar of clay and that we're doing nothing in our little hidden away place. That because Christ resides in us, because there is an all-surpassing, which means irrepressible power that resides in us, then the dough will rise. You can trust that. Well, there's a little test that you can do with actual yeast to find out if it's active. You take a little bit of water, you add the yeast to it, and then you put a little bit of sugar in it, and then after about 10 minutes, if the yeast is active, it'll begin to bubble. The sugar will start to dissolve into carbon dioxide. So how would we know if the kingdom of God was active in us? Well, like we do every month, today we come to the table. And just like the disciples did 2,000 years ago, and what followers of Jesus have been doing ever since, we're going to take the bread of life into us. We're going to hide it away in there. We're going to take the cup of salvation and we're going to take it into us and we're going to hide it away in there. When those mix inside of you today, notice what bubbles up in you. Dave and I talked to a young woman last night after the service. She came up and she was crying and her friend said, my friend here just took communion for the first time. And we asked her, oh, you know, what prompted you to do that? And she shared a little bit about, you know, losing her job. And then Dave said, did you kind of realize that you needed God? And she just, I mean, it was like, you know, water works. And it was beautiful. Well, I don't care whether you bent your knee to Jesus in a Sunday school room and you were four years old, or whether you've never taken communion before. We need God. And today might be one of those critical moments where you realize that. Where you realize, I need the active yeast inside of me so that something in me will rise. Well, here's the deal. This yeast, Jesus, is very alive and very active. And if you allow him to work his way inside of you, hidden away in your normal everyday life, it will cause you to rise. Because that's what he does. He is irrepressible. Amen. Amen.
