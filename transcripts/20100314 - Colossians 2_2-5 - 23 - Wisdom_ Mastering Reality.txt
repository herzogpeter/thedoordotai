Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Joel, man, before he played that song, he was like, I don't know how I'm going to end it. He was telling me that's back in the green room. I don't know how I'm going to end it. I'll just kind of amp a little bit, and then we'll see. Joel, I hate you. A little bit. A little bit for being so good. Everybody, welcome to Open Door. My name is Steve Wiens. I'm one of the lead pastors. And if you're a regular 11 o'clock attender, I want you to reach to the person next to you who's probably a 9 o'clock attender, who turned the tables on Daylight Savings and actually got an extra hour of sleep. So bravo, 9 o'clockers, that joined us. I'd love to invite you to pray with me as we dive in. So pray with me. Jesus, thank you for continually inviting us to follow you, even though we are at best a mixed bag, full of mistakes and failures and false starts we are. But you love us enough to have faith in us, that we would keep coming back to you when we fall. And you're there for us with your grace and your mercy for another day. And that's actually why we keep coming back to you. We love you. We want to follow you. Give us the courage to do so. Amen? All right, open your Bibles if you have them to Colossians chapter 2. Hooray, we are in the second chapter after six or eight months or so. Starting in verse 2, I'd like to read it to you. Paul writing here, And we've been camped on this phrase for about three weeks now, that you may know Christ, especially in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. And for the last couple weeks, Dave has sort of acknowledged the skeptic that might say, really all wisdom and knowledge is found in Christ because it isn't necessarily found in Christians, skeptics may say. And so Dave has been asking the question, can smart people believe in Jesus? or do we have to check our brains in at the door? And if you didn't hear those teachings, go back online and listen to them. They were really, really good. It's another way to ask the question is this. If I say I believe in Jesus, does it mean that I have to become an idiot and pretend to believe the things that I just cannot believe? Or do I need to agree with every bumper sticker that passes me along the road that has something to say about Jesus? Does it mean that I can't question? Does it mean that I can't question? Well, we really do believe that in Christ are found all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. And so we believe that in the church should be the safest place in the world to ask questions and to struggle with even doubts. So there's room for questions here. But I'd like to turn our thoughts to what it means to find the treasure of wisdom. And this week, we're going to unpack the nature and character of someone who is on the road toward having wisdom. And next week, we'll tackle the kinds of choices that a wise person makes. And the word for wisdom in Colossians 2, 3 is a Greek word called sophia, but it's actually derived from a Hebrew word. The stem of it is called hacham, hacham, which I just love the Hebrew language, right? Because you can sort of spit almost as you say it. So, you know, you can say that at home. Just, you know, ha-ham. You don't have to know what it means. Just say it. It's fun. But it means to be wise, to be wise, to have wisdom. But it's also frequently used to describe someone who is a master at a particular craft, is very skilled at something. So in the time of Jesus, it might be someone who's very skilled at woodworking or very skilled at shipbuilding or a very skilled rabbi. It would be someone that has ha-ham. And so we understand the nature of masters even in our time. People who are experts and masters at their craft. Joshua Bell is someone that I'm learning to really appreciate. He is a violinist. And if you just click on iTunes, just one of his songs, and just listen to it for 30 seconds as a preview, he is one of the masters of our time in terms of violin. J.K. Rowling is an author. You may have heard of her. She wrote the Harry Potter series. And listen, I'm not saying you should, I know there's Harry Potter lovers and Harry Potter haters out there, okay? So I know that. I'm not supporting it. I'm not denying it. I'm just saying, in the world of juvenile fiction, J.K. Rowling is a master. She's sold a billion dollars of books and that really, she is one of the best at her craft. Brett Favre, ladies and gentlemen. Yes, master quarterback. Really, he holds most of the records, but as you watch him play, he has the kind of joy and the kind of ability to come back and win a game that looks like we may have lost it. And the last game notwithstanding, people, we have counselors that are going to be available to you if you're still grieving over that loss. I have every hope and belief that he's going to be back and he'll probably let us know that around Labor Day, which is great. Brett, if you're listening, we'll take you on Labor Day, all right? But all these people have at least one thing in common, is that they don't only know a lot about their craft, whether it be football or writing or playing a violin. They constantly make the decision to put their craft into the world of reality. Meaning, Joshua Bell, when he plays his violin, people fill concert halls to listen. And J.K. Rowling, when she writes a book, people read the book. And Brett Favre, when he finally decided to become a Viking, ticket sales went through the roof. His jersey was, in fact, the number one NFL jersey sold this last year. Masters have the courage to put their work on display in real life. They don't just think about it a lot. They don't just know a lot about their craft. They do it. Now, contrast that with the critic. a person that's paid to evaluate the work of masters. See, they know a lot about someone's craft, whether it be writing or football or playing the violin, and they may be incredibly articulate in even saying why a certain author or quarterback is better or worse than another author or quarterback. But here's the thing. Here's the difference between masters and critics. A critic will never sell out the metrodome. A critic does not have their work on display at the Guggenheim. They've never played in front of a hushed audience at Carnegie Hall. They might be experts, but they're not masters. And so when we're talking about gaining wisdom, we're talking about becoming the kind of people who are masters, not simply experts. But the question is, masters of what? Well, according to one scholar that I read this week, A wise person is someone who has an experienced and competent mastery of life and its various problems, where action rather than thought is the point. I want to say that again. According to one scholar, a wise person is someone who has an experienced and competent mastery of life and its various problems, where action and choices rather than thought are the point. Now in the Hebrew scriptures, in the book of Proverbs, it's known as the sayings of the wise. It uses the same Hebrew stem, hacham, when we're talking about wisdom. I'm going to read to you Proverbs chapter 1, verses 1 through 6, through the translation of the message. And it says this, These are the wise sayings of Solomon, David's son, Israel's king, written down so we'll know how to live well and right, to understand what life means and where it's going. It's a manual for living, for learning what's right and just and fair, to teach the inexperienced the ropes and give our young people a grasp on reality. There's also something here for seasoned men and women, still a thing or two for the experienced to learn, fresh wisdom to probe and penetrate the rhymes and reasons of wise men and women. The rhymes and reasons of wise men and women. See, these masters of life have wisdom in dealing with the complexities of actual life. They know how to live well and right. They understand what life means and where it's going. They're not interested in simply collecting facts or becoming an expert in knowing about something. They don't spend a lot of time critiquing others. They're too busy learning and practicing and living. And that's where you realize Jesus was an absolutely brilliant master of life. He invited disciples, certainly the 12, but also more, men and women, to come into his life and learn from him, learn his ways, learn his yoke, which is just an image where it's a farming image. A yoke would be this sort of picture, an M, and where a young ox would be teamed with an older ox, and the person would plow a field leading these two oxen, but the young ox would learn about what it means to be under the yoke from an older ox. And so that's the kind of image that Jesus says when he says, take my yoke upon you and learn from me, learn my ways of living and loving. And so he did that for a few years, and then he sent out these disciples, these ragtag fishermen out two by two to practice the kingdom, the life in the kingdom with others. He said, heal the sick, cast out demons, do what you've seen me do. To which I can only imagine as they set out on the road. You know, one of them might have said to the other, now like, so when we come to the first guy who needs a demon cast out of him, just can you remind me again what we're supposed to do? Like I've seen Jesus do it a couple times, but I just like, did he, does he pray first? Does he put his hands on second? I don't know, right? When it comes to healing someone, I've seen him like haka loogie, put it on the ground, make some spit, put it in someone's eye. Is that always what you do? I mean, I could just see them sort of like, because we don't know what we're doing. But Jesus just says, listen, don't be a critic. Don't, just get engaged in life. Get engaged in doing it. And you'll find that God is right there helping you along the way. In John 10, 10, Jesus says this, The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy, but I've come that they might have life and have it to the full. Now, that doesn't mean have an easy life. That doesn't mean have everything you've ever asked for. It means to be engaged in life in the way that a master would. My paraphrase is this. The chief critic doesn't and can't bring life. He can only steal life or kill life or destroy life because that's what he does. But Jesus is saying, I am the master of life. So I can bring life even where there is no life, even to dead places. And I can teach you how to live life. Because Jesus really was the master of life. He didn't come just to make sure we have a place in heaven when we die. He came to help us learn how to live life. If you were to ask a panel of really smart people across the world whether or not they believe Jesus was God's son or not, If you ask them, let's make a list of the masters of life, Jesus would be at the top of every list. That's why someone like Gandhi, very brilliant person, but not a Christian, based his vision for the freedom of India on the teachings of Jesus because he recognized him as a master of life. Now, side note, when you become a master of something, you get a lot of critics. You know this is true if you go on Amazon.com. And if you're at all connected to the theological world, which I admit I'm much too nerdy and I'm a little too connected to it probably, but if you click on a book by Rob Bell or John Piper and then look at the reviews written by Christians, you're going to find some of the most scathing, hate-filled responses. about how either one of these guys are wrong, heretical, and are sending the world to hell. Both of these guys. Now, this is coming from Christians. FYI. Uncomfortable silence. John Piper. Okay, disagree with him all you want, if you want, but one of my friends lives right by him, And as he was driving on his way to work most mornings, he sees a younger guy, you know, stepping out of Piper's house and then getting into a car and driving away. And so he kind of wondered about what that was. He found out that Piper spends six months out of the year, every year, inviting a young man to live with he and his family. So he disciples someone living with him, learning his way. And again, disagree with John Piper all you want, But are you discipling a young person by inviting them into your home for six months out of the year? I'm not. All right, let's take someone from the other end of the theological spectrum, the great Saint Rob Bell. Now, see? Disagree with him all you want. And you should. Or not. But his writings and teachings are inspiring a whole generation of young people to want to learn about what it means to follow Jesus. So, question. Like, what are you doing to inspire a generation of young people to get hungry for Jesus? The question is, do you want to be a master of life or do you want to be a critic? so I want to spend the rest of our time this morning pointing out two differences between critics who know about life and masters who do life well difference number one critics are satisfied in pointing out the flaws and what others have learned but masters continue to learn their whole lives critics are satisfied in pointing out the flaws and what others have learned but masters continue to learn their entire life. They see life as an education. Now, in the first couple chapters of Luke, we read a really kind of hilarious account of one day when Joseph and Mary, the earthly parents of Jesus, apparently lose him for three days. Now, I want you to imagine, you know, the prayer time that morning for Joseph and or Mary. God, funny thing, I lost your son. don't know where he is uh well let's pick up the story in luke 2 verse 46 after three days they found him in the temple courts and if you're a parent this is awesome right because you're thinking where is my kid he's out behind the dumpster smoking i know it he's in all kinds in trouble. You finally find him. He's in church. Brilliant. So anyway, Jesus, verse 46, is sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking questions. Twelve years old. Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. And when his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you. And Jesus' response is interesting. He said, and kind of cryptic, He said, why were you searching for me? He asked. Didn't you know that I had to be in my father's house? But they didn't understand what he was saying to them. But then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. And then we get this little clue about how maybe Mary is headed toward being a master of life. His mother treasured all these things in her heart. Just these experiences of Jesus. And as Jesus grew up, here's a phrase that maybe you haven't noticed before and it might blow your mind a little bit. As Jesus grew up, he what? increased in wisdom. Now, the Greek word for increased is not like pretended to increase in wisdom so that he might look human. It's he actually increased in wisdom and in favor with God and with people. So if you believe in the scriptures, it says that Jesus grew in wisdom. Can you wrap your mind around that one? But if you think about it for even a second, like think about two-year-old baby Jesus, right? To Alligate of Night's reference, not meant or intended. Think about two-year-old Jesus. Mary is feeding him a little hummus and some little bites of pita bread. Joseph is playing peekaboo with him from around the corner. If you were to ask two-year-old Jesus, can you explain the theory of quantum physics? The answer you would have gotten is goo. Right? If you were to ask the 12-year-old Jesus, who's going to be the first president of the United States? 12-year-old Jesus would have said, what are you talking about? Because Jesus actually grew in wisdom. Now, Greg Boyd gave a talk. Here's another theological lightning rod, right? Greg Boyd, but friend of Open Door, gave a talk on wisdom a few years ago at Woodland Hills that was really helpful to me in this regard. He said, Jesus was the one sinless person who ever lived. And he's the prototype of what humanity should have looked like if sin had not crashed the party. Jesus was the prototype human being before sin came in. And we read in the Bible that Jesus increased in wisdom. So Greg's point was we can assume then that it is hardwired into what human beings should be to grow in wisdom. This is not a result of sin or a result of the fall. Life is an education. It's an endless opportunity to live under the rule and reign of God, learning more and more as you go along who God is and what God is like. And in fact, this life, Greg says, is a kind of rehearsal for what life in eternity will be like. And we're learning more and more to live under the complete rule and reign of God by putting ourselves under the rule and reign of God now. But this confronts a deeply held, I think, American ideology that has even crept into some Christian theology that says this, life is an opportunity for us to be comfortable and to seek pleasure. Because pretty soon we'll be dead and gone. So we believe that life is a kind of opportunity to place ourselves in the center and use everybody else as a means to make us happy. That's what we do. That's why most of us get married. Why do you want to marry this person? Because they make me so happy. Right? Well, fast forward five years, right? Anyway. Nervous chuckles. The movie Groundhog's Day, remember this movie, Bill Murray? Groundhog's Day demonstrates this point beautifully. And the central character, his name is Phil. He's played again by Phil Murray. He's self-centered. He's patronizing. He's cynical. He's a stereotypical critic. And he finds himself stuck in this small town of Punxsutawney to cover the story of whether the groundhog will come out of the ground and see his shadow, letting us know whether or not there will be six more weeks of winter. So he does the story, but then the snowstorm comes into town and it forces he and his team to stay in Punxsutawney overnight. And when he wakes up the next morning, 6 a.m., to the beautiful song, I Got You, Babe, by Sonny and Cher, and starts living out his day, he finds that he is replaying the previous day, Groundhog's Day. And we're led to believe over the course of the movie that this happens for maybe even thousands of years, him replaying the same day over and over and over again. But once he's kind of gotten over the shock of this, He decides to use the time to learn weird facts about everyone, right? To manipulate them to serve his own purposes, especially his beautiful co-worker played by Andy McDowell named Rita because he's trying to seduce her. So he's learning all these facts about her to use on her so she'll fall in love with him. But every single Groundhog's Day ends with her slapping him in the face. Phil learns over the course of thousands of years that no matter how many things you know about someone, you can never manipulate someone into loving you. It's a great philosophical movie, Groundhog's Day is. I'm actually indebted to Greg Boyd for this characterization as well, but ultimately Phil despairs because he learns over thousands of years of trying to manipulate people for his own self-centered gain that that actually does not work to bring happiness. He tries it, and it doesn't work. It only brings more and more dissatisfaction. And so he ends up trying to commit suicide a hundred different ways, but every single time he wakes up again, 6 a.m., I got you, babe. Finally, Phil gets it. See, despite all the knowledge he has gained about people and what they're going to do and every nuance and facet of their character, Despite knowing all these things, he realizes he's missed out on life, on the point of life. The point of life is that you can't be happy by getting other people to serve you. So he decides to learn, use what he's learned to serve others. And so you remember that he helps the old lady whose car breaks down, or he helps the guy who's about to choke on his food in the restaurant, and on the last day that he spends, before he breaks out of this trap in Groundhog Day, there's this big party. Remember, he's playing the piano because he's now a virtuoso of the piano. And he's the life of the party. And everyone thanks him for doing all that he has done for them. And Rita is sitting there taking all this in, realizing this guy, Phil, is really a wonderful man. And that is when she falls in love with him. See, Phil starts out the movie, stereotypical critic. But as the movie ends, he's become a master of life, who has learned that the secret of a satisfying life is to actually paradoxically move yourself out of the center and join the mission of God in restoring all things to how they were meant to be. He becomes a master of life. So the question for us is, in this life of education, what are you learning these days? or are you spending most of your time pointing out the flaws of others? Now one way to know if you're actually learning some things is by noticing what surprises you because again paradoxically wise people are frequently surprised by people. They allow themselves to have people that they never expected to do anything good when they see them do something good they don't go, ah, that's a trick. They're losers. They go, how fascinating. Someone that I never expected to do something good did something good. Matthew 8, we read this weird story about a time that Jesus is surprised by the faith of a centurion. Apparently this guy comes up to Jesus, this Roman centurion, asks him to heal his servant. And Jesus kind of asks him, why are you coming to me, basically? The Roman centurion says, I'm coming to you, basically, because I understand what it means to be under authority. And I understand what it means to give authority. And so I'm going to come under you and say, I need you. You are the master of healing. And Jesus is absolutely amazed. In fact, he responds this way, found in Matthew 8, 10. When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, Truly I tell you, I've not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. Which, you've got to understand, the people following him, from Israel. You know, so when he says that, they're like, Wait a minute. Now the word amazed here is a Greek word called thalmazo, which means to marvel at something or someone with wonder, to be utterly astonished. Jesus is saying, whoa, this is a new one. Here's a guy who's supposed to be dead set against me, this Roman centurion, and everything that I'm about, and he's coming under me to learn from me. This is amazing. I am shocked. but how fascinating and then Jesus uses the same word in Mark 6 6 to describe how astonished he is at the lack of faith of his own people in his own hometown Mark 6 6 he couldn't do any miracles there we read and then I just love this comma except to lay his hands on a few sick people but you know you can hardly count that right it's just sort of weird no miracles wow there was those two guys okay two guys whatever anyway he was amazed astonished shocked that the people that had seen him grow up did not believe that he was the master of life if anyone should believe that I'm the master of life he's saying you should but instead I got this guy who's not from our own religion he's coming to me as the master of life what's wrong here the people that should be wise are critics the people that should be critics are wise and this reveals the paradox of wisdom the more wisdom you have the less you feel you know but the less wisdom you have the more you feel you know and that's revealed by how surprised you are I was thinking about Tiger Woods lately and you know just was I saw in the news story that maybe he and his wife have moved back in together and are working toward reconciliation which the collective response of the United States and around the world was, right, once a pig, always a pig, right? Which maybe that's true. That might be absolutely true. But what if there might be a few among us who have maybe been through a rough patch of marriage and been through to the depths of despair in our marriage but have actually worked it through? through hard work and God's grace to where you can come through it and say, man, we were once a mess, but now we're back together. A master in life says to a guy like Tiger Woods, good for you. I hope reconciliation is happening. Allows themselves to be surprised. A critic goes, no way. That's fake. It's all just a big ruse for the media. Well, one of the big differences between critics and masters are critics are really satisfied in pointing out the flaws of others, but masters see life as continuous education. Difference number two, critics don't submit themselves to any master. But people who are on the road to being masters seek out the master of their craft and do what they do. Critics don't submit themselves to any masters, but people who are on the road to becoming masters seek out the master of their craft and do what they do. Justin Charbonneau is the guitar player with the dreadlocks over here. Almost every service, I notice a couple of young people, usually guys, will come up and sit right there. And during, I sit right over there. So during the worship time, right, I look at these younger guys. And I mean, maybe they're singing, maybe they're not, but they are like intently studying Justin and the way he's playing guitar. And everyone's smiling when Justin kind of does something cool. You know, they're like, you know, it's awesome. So imagine one of these young guys comes to Justin after the service and goes, man, I really would love to learn how to play the guitar. I'm noticing that you are a master guitar player. And Justin says, fine, meet me at my house at 1 o'clock. And they meet at their house. And, you know, this young student brings his guitar freshly strung, maybe polished. I don't know if you polish guitars or not. I'm not a guitar player. But comes, you know, their coolest shirt on, whatever. And Justin says, okay, lesson number one. I want you to put your guitar case in the attic. And when you get home every day, I want you to bring your guitar around in every room you go into in your home. Because you're more likely to play it if you have it around. And then this young person will say, okay, great. Next. And then Justin might say, there is no next. see you in a month now the critic would say I'm going to Joel Hansen because I was expecting to learn how to play Stairway to Heaven right the young guitar student who is becoming a master will go home put his guitar case in the attic and super glue his hands on his guitar because his master said that's what he should do. Now, lots of us, I think, are delusioned, disillusioned, because we feel like we never hear from God. You ever said that or felt that? I never hear from God. All these people are supposedly hearing the direction of God. I never do. Just newsflash. That's 99.9% of the people in this room, and the other 0.1% I've never met, okay? So here's the thing. Until you start hearing the voice of God, there are four books in this book, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, filled with practical teachings from the Master of Life. So until you hear the voice of God, you might say, okay, I'm going to pick a teaching from the Master of Life, and I'm just going to try it to see if it works. My friend Stephan, he's amazing at this, great teacher for me in this. He started doing this with the teaching found in Matthew 5.42, which says, give to the one who asks you and don't turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. Right? So give to whoever asks you. So he goes, I'm just going to try this. So one day we were sitting in this coffee shop populated by a bunch of homeless people, and we were sitting down with one of them. His name was Sam. And for some reason we had our wallets out. We're kind of looking at our wallets, and I had mine, and Stephan had his. and Sam's wallet was nasty and smelly and filled with all these old receipts from like 1969 and just craziness. But pretty soon, I noticed Sam started sort of admiring Stephan's wallet. And he goes, man, that Stephan, that is a nice wallet. Translation, I'd like that wallet. So I'm thinking, I knew that this experiment Stephan was going through by trying to follow the teachings of Jesus. So I'm like, hey, what's going to happen? And Stephan said, all right, Sam, how about we trade wallets? and so Sam emptied out every receipt that was in his wallet, 1969, yellowed and, you know, and Stephan emptied his and they traded wallets and Stephan still has this wallet from Sam and every time he, maybe not every time, but many times when he breaks out that wallet, he's reminded of a truth. I do not need every possession I think I need in order to be happy. It's amazing and the more and more you do this give to someone who asks you it's not so that you would be threadbare and you know miserable it's so that you would learn I don't need all the things I think I need it's actually a road to freedom it works so and the funny thing is later on in that conversation we were looking at our watches and um no kidding Meredith had just given Stephen's wife just given Stephen this new watch and Sam, no kidding, looks at Stephen's watch and goes, man, that is a nice watch. And I'm like, no way. You know, I'm glad I didn't do this deal. And to which Stephen goes, Sam, you're not, you're not getting my watch. Okay, my wife just gave it to me. Whatever. Listen, James chapter 1 verse 22. Do not merely listen to the word. Do what it says. That's what we read in James. James is a great teacher of practical wisdom. Don't merely listen to the word. Do what it says. And that shouldn't be taken as like the shame thing. Do what the Bible says because I want you to be miserable. God's saying, I want you to live life in freedom and become someone who makes wise choices. So do what it says. It works. People who become masters are willing to do it. They're not satisfied with simply forming opinions and lining up right answers. They want to know if something works. Critics can't be bothered with real life. They're content to think about things and read books. Not that there's anything wrong with reading a book. But if that's all you do, and you don't ever put it into practice, then you're not a master of life, and you're not becoming one. So the question is, what do you want to be? A critic or a master? Next week, we're going to look at more of the choices that a person that's becoming a master starts to make. But as we close, I need to tell you, it's sort of confession time because the whole week as I was writing this talk about critics and masters and reading the words on the page, the voice that screamed back out at me is, and it was true, was you are a critic. You're a critic. And I thought it's much easier for me to point out the flaws in others than it is for me to see life as an education. It's much easier for me to order the newest book about Jesus and get excited about it until the next book comes out. And I don't give people the benefit of the doubt nearly enough to be surprised when something good happens. And so if it's true about me, I wonder if it's true about some of you. That even though you want to be maybe the master of life, a master of life, the truth is you're more of a critic. And if that is, y'all, I just would like to invite you to join me in a kind of mass confession. I'm going to pray this prayer because the truth is if you want to be a master of life, you need to go to the master of life who says to us, for those who lack wisdom, just ask and I will give it to you. We can find wisdom in the master of life, but we have to go to Jesus. and I think where it starts is admitting where we are mired in the world of being a critic. So if this is you, just pray this prayer with me in your spirit. I'm just gonna say some words and if it's you, you might wanna put your hands out in front of you as a way of yielding to God and the spirit of God who might be doing some work in you. So let's pray together. Jesus, master of life, we have indulged in the safety of criticism. we have not believed the best about other people and we have not had the courage to live our own lives we've pointed out what's wrong in others instead of learning from our own mistakes we've listened to you and then not done what you said so please, please forgive us and give us the courage to live our own lives following you into the way of life that is consistent with who you are and what you want because we believe that in you is hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. And we believe you still are calling people to follow you. So give us the courage to follow. Amen. Amen. Come back next week as we talk more about the way of wisdom. God bless you. Have a great weekend. Thank you.
