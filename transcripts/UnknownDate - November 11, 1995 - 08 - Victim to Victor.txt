Yeah, you know, the title of this workshop is called, the sense of this workshop is called So I'm going to do a good work. And that's what I'm going to talk about. I have an agenda. I'm going to say that. Obviously, there's something that is not going to do with this topic. I'm hoping to cover it. If there is, I'd like to cover that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's just a switch. Oh, okay. That doesn't relate to me like a judge. So in the last 30 years, I mean, I guess that's not who this judge is. I mean, that's what it looks like. I mean, I think that's what it looks like. So, well, the big answer is, it's not the judge, it's your dad. The ruler, the answer is, it's those compliance terms. I think that's what happens there. is that people think this feels like this, my parents and my dad is real. That's what real dads are about. God is just focused. These parents are what real Christian parents are about to God's notice instead of like, if they're just familiar with God's notice, God is just focused. Amen. They were going to be true. When you start talking about the issues of being, and you talk about the difference in your life, Jesus is constantly because of the victim mentality and because there is some part in this whole thing that people are responsible for, that they have to get to so they can change it, but we can't get to it too soon, because we're going to do what people do and say they're going to do it. I'm sorry to send that. The abuser is always responsible for the abuse. There never is a good enough reason to be able to abuse. And there are other things that the victim is responsible for and that they can change. But if you talk about those too soon processes, people use it. Well, if you would have done this, it's going to happen to you. And if you accomplish the abuse, you break down. What would be rape on a bad street? In the street. And maybe she needs to work on the streets. But in no way is the rape thing that is constantly there. In other words, there's no good enough reason to be rape on any street, any kind of thing. And you have to separate those issues. And you have to try to do that through a similar process. and then people will be victimized and someone who wants to abuse or ask for it. But the truth is, before you write it down, you know what happened. The truth is, if we are talking about spiritual abuse in a place of spiritual power, then any kind of abuse that Christian person has a power is a sense of a person who's not in a place of power being overwhelmed by the power. which means that it's not that you're allowed. It's that a person with the authority of power is the power of the wealthier of power, and it's not that you're allowed. You know, now I don't allow this to run well. A person who's going to run over, does he have to allow it to get run over? It's just like you're going to run over by a truck. If you get run over by a truck, I wouldn't say to you when you get run over. I would say to you, you need to look closer across the street, but I wouldn't say that too soon in the process, because if I didn't continue to say you were the place to get run over, you weren't the place to get run over, the person who ran you over is responsible for the street. Now, I went to a, I went out down to Phoenix, Arizona, which was Holly, you know, there was an instance of friends in this ministry of the church. And the person that we stayed with had a friend who was in the ministry of the marriage council and had some certain kind of techniques or certain ways to deal with the church. and our friend is excited for us to see this person and how they felt a marriage. So she's excited for us to meet this person. So we went to this person, and in order to show us how they did this, we would watch. And we started speaking with our speciality company. And we were, I have to tell you, that we were in to probably two hours of the spiritual view before I figured out. And I mean, I were a podcast, I was a podcast. But I was overwhelmed. We were running over. And at some point, you know, I just stood up and I said, this is all the way. We have a job. We have a job. So, I just said no. I said no as fast as I can. The whole issue of the community is that somebody knows their wealth. It's not about allowing. It's not about causing. It's that people who have been entrusted with positions of authority and power, strength and full spirit that's why scripture says people are more accountable unless it's a bigger deal because authority and power and class people are following so it's not just about us but us are very very essential thoughts and follow us Thank you. I was like, I was like, halfway through the second podcast. I was like, halfway through the other. And there was a guy sitting there looking up the other way. And I said, what's up? And he said, no. He said, no. The way we were treated, the way we were done, by the students who were in their lives, was wrong. You could point to, there was a little road outside of the emergency brush, and the angle of the brush and the brush of the road. You see that little brush over there? It's like we got lead over there, and we had brush and our eyes came up. And they said it like that. That was wrong. They were wrong. And they said, at least follow you. At least follow. Honestly, at some point in his feeling, he's got to ask that question. And if you try to ask that question to Sue, then the person who is on the brush is feeling like you're saying that it's their fault that they're on the brush. And that they somehow, as possible, they're not able to show you. My question to the person at the perfect time would be, what is it about you, what's going on with you, that you follow leadership, that you don't think it's a good idea? How come on the inside you say no, but on the outside you say yes? What are your therapeutic issues? Those are the things you have to ask, but if you ask them too soon, the person knows you say no. Thank you. That's hard to say. I guess not in the New Valley, but more like the concern of the New Valley. The panel discussion of being a sanctuary at 145, and either, is because we haven't separated that very well. And the end goal is swung way over by saying no one's responsible for anything. and then people went, oh no, that's not true, and now it's gone way back again. And I think it's gone so far back with the end of the week. That's right. So when people come to this announcement, they say, tell me about their marriage, they're talking about the same thing in the church. My question, that is the point, which is the most helpful to that, is what can you do with it? Not because you're causing this, not because in any way you're responsible for this other person. You know, the other person is always responsible for the other person to behave. But what can you do just so you can handle a healthy life, so you can handle a healthy life, so you cannot keep finding yourself insane. Use the place. What do you need to learn to change here? Those are the key questions. I don't think I'm stretching this as much to say, There are probably people here, just for this one, small and small people here, the high people here have their spiritual views in more than one setting, even though they're still at the last setting, and they do that. So my question is, what is it about you? What is it you? Where is your lack of boundaries? Where do you learn not to do this in your radar or your station? Those are all your certain conditions which in no way make you responsible for the abuser doing the deals. The abuser is always responsible for the abuser. Am I separating this from all that, Sam? Okay, I really think. I feel like I need to say that every time I say that. I'm trying to say you're just going to spend time. So, the difference between holding someone accountable for the behavior and blaming them. The difference is this. If I'm blaming the lamb for something, if I'm blaming her, what that says is, I am where I am because of lamb. I am where I am because of lamb. She's the wife. The difference between that and holding the accountable is, to say, I am where I am because of the choices that I have made in response to what they've done, but she is responsible for what she has done. Okay? I'll say some of this again. I am where I am because of the ways I've chosen to respond to what they've done. If I'm a shut down person who decides not to trust you guys, in you. And in my past, I've been really abused by Lynn. What I've done is I've chosen, and now I'm with you. I'm not talking. I am not talking to you. The Lynn is responsible for the abuse. The abuse of the game. So I am not where I am because of Lynn. I am where I am because of the trust. And because of that, by the way, there's great freedom in that. I can make up trust. But I have to kind of see the connection here. I'm going to have to see where I'm just constantly and where I can be disciplined. If I don't like being in a place where you're some safe people now and still got me all here and I'm like that, it bothers me to see that I can do what I'm saying. It's a change. There's in no way a lecture off the book from being a abusive person that she was and in no way blames me for being a abusive person. If a two-year-old is standing at five-year-old, if a father and a parent says a person will need things with a five-year-old, and the five-year-old has heard feelings, they're sad about this. What is the scripture so much to do? Even if a five-year-old is talking to a parent, so let's say you go to a parent, and the parent hears what they're saying, and they apologize, So, you have to come out, you need to go to church that you're not now. But let's say that the three-year-old kids get worse. Now they've got kids or whatever they're getting kids over. Now they get kids, they can't hold the term accountable. They can hold their people, they're disrespectful, they're not convenient, they're not going to be a disaster, they're going to be a stuff. And they get that a couple times and they decide that it's easier to say, so they're just not going to tell the truth. Are the children who are responsible for not telling the truth? No, the child is responsible for being the truth. The parent is responsible for punishing the truth. The five-year-old is the one who's responsible for choosing not to tell the truth. Does it make sense that the five-year-old children have to tell the truth? Yes. Are you glad that they chose not to tell the truth? Yes. Couldn't we think of any other thing a five-year-old could even choose to do besides that? No. Because he's a straight-click, powerful person that's overwhelming them with their power. And in response to that overwhelmingness, they choose to be the safer of, which is when mom and dad says how to do it. They say, okay, that's their choice. That's how they decide to do it. So they're responsible for that part of it. Even though the scripture says they're supposed to tell their parents, and even though that's what the Bible says, they choose not to. We understand why they didn't. We're glad they didn't. It's good that they didn't. We could blame them for doing that. And now they're 35 years old. Now they're 35 years old, and they have some power. They have some strength. And now it's time to tell their children.... And if they're put at choosing not to tell the truth, then now they're, it isn't even like a choice anymore. It's not even like they'll start telling the truth. It's not telling the truth. It's what they're doing. When they take responsibility for their telling and not telling the truth, they can make just the choice. But that in no way makes them responsible for the abuse. These are still responsible for the deals. And the decision that they made to lie to the parents, and that's why you're going to be upset for a long time. And if you're saying sad, you get it. Make sense? I'm going to start trusting. And now we're going to be doing something. See, in that setting, even in that setting, if you could bring someone next to you, you put four-cellular power into the five-year-old system, like a child infection or something like that, then you see that person, even in that setting, might be able to choose and tell the truth. But not into their own power, it's kind of an overwhelming power of this person. There's a power inequality there. You know the illustration of when you've ever been to the circus, you've seen elephants go down, come in place, stick, do a little kind of stick. You've seen them, you know, just a little kind of little stick, but left a little rock. You know, they're not going there. The truth is that it could, but it doesn't make you think. If you were to quit, it would. And so then the keeper's job would be to make sure the other person doesn't sound out. As long as the other person doesn't sound out, it's much more powerful than the other person. You see, now we're 35, 40, 45 years old, and we have these brick and old parents that are 7 years old, When you were five years old, when you were 35 years old, you really didn't cost them. You can choice them in response to that. You can navigate that. You can take the reason. You know, whatever. Now, with 35, still having to make a big cost of people. And now, you have a call, a word baby, a word dog, so you could say something before you start, but you can't because you believe something. And that's part of it. So I'll give you a little test here. I have a friend who used to pick a flying woman for a shotgun company. And one day when she was there, a shotgun was pushed. She put her purse in the car and it's on the flyer. And she went over to the bank plan. She came back to the cart, somebody looked up the purse. And what they did was, on the way out of the cart, they went to the purse, and it's about cash, and all the cash, and all the cash. So I don't think it's a good thing. Well, anyway, so she was telling me about this. And she said, she said, I'm so stupid to leave in my purse. in the garden with a blind lady in the garden. Basically, that's what she said. And I said, wait a minute. Why did you push it? It's gone. Why did you push it? She said, because I left it with a blind lady in the garden. I said, no. No. I said, no. Because she's blind in the garden. Okay, so the first time she blamed herself, she violated her, I'm responsible for this. The second was she blamed the guard and she blamed her. And I said, no. She said, why? I said, because there's a crooked cut. She said, I'm crooked. See, the cut, the teeth, is always responsible for the teeth. She said, can you make a better decision about it? Where you read the purse. Simple. Then you made a poor decision. Doesn't that make you responsible for the second? No. Makes you responsible for the first step. Is that? Okay. Can she make a better decision about who she has to guard the purse? Yes. Does that make the blind woman responsible for the first step? No. There's no good reason for the first step. You should be able to leave it out in the open, even in the blind line. But if you don't, the peace is always responsible for the spirit. Do you need to make this right? Yes. Do you need to make this right? Yes. Can you make this right so you can't show me that you're just happy again? Yes. But even then, you will want to get better at it. Because remember, the damage is something that Paul overwhelms. But the best prepared person. I mean, you can take a guy who wrote books, especially, and get him over the world. The best in the book of Galatians 2, he talks about it. There's a confrontation that Paul is having to Peter. As Peter gets overwhelmed by the power of the Judaizers who come down, and try to get him to make the Jews come up. Try to get Peter to make the Gentiles who come to church. But before we got there, Peter looked like a Gentile. And he's probably going to get a Gentile. And Gentile, then he's going to do something now. and they are upset with the fact that, number one, Peter is living like a Gentile, and number two, that he's not trying to get the Jews, the Gentiles, to live like Jews. And he caves, you know, and all these people he's partying with, 15 minutes ago, he's standing over here now, you know, thinking, you know, talking about these guys, thinking they should be living a certain way. This is Peter, he got home and wealth. That's the same Peter who, not that long before, he was setting up on the rules, and the sheep comes down, and they're cleaning up the animals, and God gives him like a personal message that says, you know, get comfortable and catch you. So it was real clear to him then. He went to Cornelius. Cornelius began to believe he got the Holy Spirit. It was real clear to him then. At 15, he was saying to the leadership, why would we put a burden on the temple to carry a weight that we ourselves haven't been able to carry? We're clear on that. People show up to do this on the game. So even the best prepared person gets shot. Avoid the streets where people are shooting across the street. Okay? But, if that's the current person to get shot, you can get better at how much change is going. Yes. If you go down the street where the shoes have to be shot, are you responsible to get shot? No. The person who's a traitor is always responsible for the shoes. Do you need different choices? Yes. Do you need help with our boundaries? Yes. Do you need help with our big time permission to run? We're going to pay attention to our radar when it comes out. Yes. We're going to trust our instincts. Yes. We're going to listen to the Holy Spirit that's in us. Yes. The fact that we work so good at that, does that make us responsible for reducing? No. The user is always responsible. Let's get an old man. Let's get back to work like that. Okay, the question so far. The victim mentality thing, the victim mentality comes out of believing and not holding on. I am the way I am because of you. Well, if I am the way I am because of you, then I'll have to stay the way I am until you change. But if I am the way I am because of me, regardless of you, or the response to you, I say, I can change what you can change not. See, I think that's what the good news, what the refreshing news was for the church, what kind of church did you do? There's no name in this process. The refreshing news to be from the church, because that's an incredible person. We need relationships in and out of church family. We need not to be able to do it. Of course, it is okay to look at these things and call them what they are. And say this has hurt me, has hurt. Because we recover. It's okay. We go intentionally slow. We go, wow. We talk about the past. Yes. It's important to understand the past. Not so we can blame the past. It's because we can understand the choices that we bring. I think some of the rap that the Christian government has not been correct is that we haven't been clear about the things that I'm talking about today. I think some of it is not clear. I think that the major reaction is that the Christian government has not been clear about the things that we're talking about today. This is exactly the same reaction that the church has always had with people. You know, that's not going to shut up and shut up and put that down to the earth and get it right now. So this has had that stance for people trying to deal with their issues all along, but certainly it's going to have that stance for people who are aggressively giving people permission to deal with those issues. And so we went, oh no, we're creating a whole generation of victims, and we don't want to do that. You see, somehow I was swinging back the other way, and it made me more difficult, once again, to get things to say, and I'm very excited about that. If I have a Jesus that I can't see, he's my security, he's my source, he's loving my life. You offer me an opportunity to measure my identity based on the person's ability. You are responsible for me, so I'll put it in that. But when I decide to look at the person's face, I assess myself, so they're saying, okay, I have one. I don't want to look the way to do it. But you understand that if I say that to you in the process, you just hear me say, I'm not afraid of what you want to do. I'm not afraid. You're not saying it. I'm saying it. If you can take responsibility, so you don't want to look the way to do it. You understand that that's what we do. and then you can take responsibility and then you can take responsibility. And not only that, you might get so practiced up at that, so aware of the choices that you have that when this person comes, it comes with a chance to get excited about it. You might remember that you don't know what it was. It didn't work. You might even make that choice. That's just our own roles and our own boundaries. God, unless you get conscious about this, you can't get the same unconscious choice again. I think so. I think that it was. It's all different. It's all different. It's all different. It's all different. I don't think they're different. And I'm not sure that everybody knows the same. I don't think, even when I say somebody's got a little wrong and somebody else's power, why? That doesn't mean my estimation doesnít make a blessing, it just makes sense to what happened. I'm not saying they're giving you little. I'm just saying that doesn't make sense to what happened if you say that to yourself. Really shouldn't make a silly word. So what should you do? Thank you. Thank you. This is how it gives you an opinion. And so you get some support, some encouraging and empowering to be able to have an opinion that you have. Instead of asking that you don't have an opinion that you have, which is what you learn to do to survive the pain of the danger. So now we get a good idea. How many of you are told that there's no problem. is you're from, you're on, you're on, you're coming behind yourself, you're in the system, you're in the system. Now, see, what I would say, objectively speaking, going out on the road here, I would say, you were in that system because you chose that system, because you sent that system, because you already knew how to live in a place like that. You can't understand what happens if you say that to yourself. I'm shaming that as hell. That's why when I first said it, I first asked the question, do you know the words I used? I said, first asked the question, how many years found yourself in the world? You need to find yourself. And that really is what I feel like. One day you go, here I am again. Right? I walked in the room, and there I was. In the view, you know. Yeah. Because it doesn't feel like you're saying, okay, here's the really healthy church. Here's the really unhealthy church. I think I'll just go over here again. You know, I'll say I'll clear the back. It's just that you're making choices. You're going to have to come up with it. It makes sense. It makes really good sense to me since we're in it. It makes such good sense now when it's coming. And we're going to get past that individual consciousness. What do you do? Well, let's try health. Health. If what you mean by health is problem three, or relatively problem three, If you have a church with all kinds of horrible problems and terrible issues going on in it, but if it's in movement, you're not stuck. That would still be an healthy church in my estimation. And then if you have a church where there's one problem, but you're so stuck about that problem. It's like this church that I went to in Iowa in September. Five years ago, the senior pastor there, five years ago, that's actually about to be. And what happened was that they fired them and basically didn't talk to them. They locked up that issue and locked up people's pain. And they can't get past them. They have one issue that isn't even going on anymore than half and five years ago. And I would say that's a good one issue. If you do that definition, then I think there's more health insurance. Thank you. Thank you. It sounds like you're playing a different one. You understand? You're playing a different one. Can you ask the question? Before you ask the question, I question the one. Before I ask the question, I would say it's not about being smart or not. It's not about going on the top. It's not about the LC now. It's about the LC. I'm not being overwhelmed by the source of what policy is going to happen. So that's the answer. You need to be overwhelmed. You knew that you became strong enough to not be overwhelmed. You said, I'm not going to be overwhelmed. Okay. Okay. Yes, it does. Okay, look at it like this. So you're talking about it in terms of spiritual things and maybe an emotional thing. You know, just emotional, psychological, so let's talk about it. A physical thing, you know, you could go to the club and work out and say, next year, and talk yourself out and get out and get out of your soul, and get out of your soul. And announce it at night and work out to you. Thank you. you can say well I got shot you don't have to get shot you can get totally out of your control now if you're in a place where lots of people get shot figure it out you know make a different choice you need to find a way to make a different choice if you say things to people like chicken monster and challenge I'm going to shoot him. Say some different things. Learn to talk to his people. Does that make you responsible for getting shot? No. Because we should shoot value. It's not true. Okay. Now, it's quite a description. I really want you to offer a description. Okay. I want to put it back on. One of the reasons you stayed might be because you invested so much while you were there. And you didn't want to be able to invest in. So you stay, make your attitude best a little bit more, and make all your house, and it will be great. How's that? I have counseled people who have gotten married to rescue four years of lousy. Four years of lousy, no, I'm the old state. It's terrible, awful. Instead of saying, hi, it's been work. Nice knowing you, I'm sorry. They get married because they invest that one last little thing, and then that's going to make the four years. Man, for a few months. So if they say buy, it's like saying I've wasted four years. So it's easier to give another six months. You have to say I've wasted four years, but then when the six months goes by, it doesn't get better? No, if you say goodbye, you've wasted four years. It's six months, so it's actually harder to let go now than what's six months ago. That's what the hell issue is because even in the most unhealthy church, people do find genuine relationships in church. Lots of unhealthy, disgusting people, but genuine connection. Friends, people, and time. That's what they're interested in. They're interested now. And when you walk away from an unhealthy place, you don't get to do that. Especially if you stay. So, it's easier to stay. If you stay a little longer, you get back. All of that is get back. And say, I got to leave. No, I can't leave. So what happens? You've got to do one month. And things get worse. You've got to do one month. Things get worse. You've got to do one month. Things get worse. What happens is that when things get worse, the person usually compares this to this. And compared to this, this student got much worse. Instead of comparing it to this, which would be no compromises yet, healthy stuff, not getting beat up, normal, whatever that is, normal. Well, see, compared to that, this is a really big adjustment. Compared to this, that's not that big of a compliment. This is a really big compliment. And so part of it psychologically is that we need some help and support and accountability to get reminded to compare this to health, not to the last compliment. Well, again, in that place, you'd be told, well, it's not that bad. In fact, you'd be told the reason why it's going down like this is because you noticed it. Really, it's not that bad. Because you're making us think about it, you're the ones making it into a bad thing. Here's something I heard yesterday. A woman needed to confront a spiritual disagreement. She needed to do it for her. She wasn't doing it because she thought it was going to change. But she needed to do it because she was going to wish she would have done it if she didn't do it. And she had some unfinished things to say. She knew she needed to do it, but she was tempted to do it. She was scared to do it. This is a person that had hurt her, brought her tears, nothing like that. When we talked through this, what she said was, the reason why it was so hard, it would be easier to say nothing and keep being abused than it would be to say something to take your stand and just go and then lose anything. And that's kind of history. You take your stand and then the person still runs you over. That's so humiliating, so shaming, so painful. It would be just easier to just stay on the ground than to stand up and get run over again and fail by taking your stand. But that's not true, though. It's not worth it staying on the ground than it is a standout. You don't know why you're getting to stand out. It's not a city country. She stood up because of the year. There's a year leading up to the standout. You know, all it was? You know what the big stand was? Saying no to being asked to do something. That's all it was. You know, I mean, I look at, we look at that and go, what's the big deal with that? Say no, you know. Tell the person to get a lot. Tell them they don't get to tell you to do it. You know, like that. All it was was saying no to a request. But see, what happens if you get all brave and big and stuff like that, and you go to the person and say, you know that thing you asked me to do? The answer is no. And then they say, well, I thought we were friends. Or I thought that you care about this ministry. Or after all I did for you, you're saying no, or whatever. Or now you've really inconvenienced me because I was counting on you. Or like that, and then you gave. And you go, oh, okay, well, I'm sorry. That therapeutic issue would be how come you get me, who are you going to take responsibility for whether you're the person sad or not? That would be that therapeutic issue. So now they lay this all on you, And then you go, okay. This woman would rather have just done it than go through all of that and end up doing it. Do you understand? Because you thought that was better, but it's not. Even trying and failing is better. And also it makes it harder for the person to, even if you can, it makes it harder for the person to ask you what happened. So you have games wrong. Yeah. Yeah. And for the victim who has the victim mentality, who realize that they do, is they're liberating. And that's why you just have to take the time. Last question in the back. My question would be, what is it about you that you don't have a boundary that prevents people from making you make them healthy? Where's your lack of boundary that somebody can come up to you and make you responsible to make them well and be responsible for them well? Yeah, the issue isn't that they're making more than you responsible to make them healthy. The issue is that they're trying to be responsible for making you healthy. You see, they were over here in this spiritually abusive place and this spiritually abusive leader, and they're out of there now. Now you have some kind of connection with them, so they don't ever want to go through that again, so they've got you coming to the seminar. No, but you are connected to them. And they don't ever want to experience this as a leader again, so now they're hooked up with you, and they've got to make sure you get to the seminar so you figure out how not to spiritually abuse people so they have a safe place to be. Crying and whining and complaining is not the victim mentality. Saying, I can't do anything about where I am. But now you're at a seminar and you're not sure you want to be yet, so maybe you're the victim. Okay. You won't give them the satisfaction of them knowing that you wanted to come anyway. Okay. Yes. What I would say to them is, if you want me to be healthy enough and a good enough leader so that you don't have any issues anymore, I will fail at that job. If you want me to support you in your process of getting well from what happened to you, I can do that. Say it just like that. No, it can't make you do anything. No, you're right, you don't.
