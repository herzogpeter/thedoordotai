Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Let's pray as we dive into the Word. God in visible ways and invisible ways we are all so lost and so our prayer this morning is that you would come and find us that you'd come and find us Amen Well I want to invite you to open your Bibles to Colossians chapter 2 verse 6 as you're turning there what we do around here is, lately at least, we've just been working through the book of Colossians. And we do it pretty slowly. We usually only get through about one verse or so. And the reason why we do it that way is because really, we're terrible long-term planners, Dave and I. No. Well, it's partly true. But the real reason why we do it that way is because we just think that there's so many rich things to find in the letters that were written about Jesus. It's just that you can't speed too quickly ahead because you might miss something. And so, you know, sometimes we linger on a certain word for a while or a certain passage for a while, and then we just, when it feels like it's done, we kind of move on. And so Colossians 2, verse 6, we read this. So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, Continue to live your lives in him, rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught and overflowing with thankfulness. And then this is the verse we've sort of been camped on. See to it that no one takes you captive. And the word for captive is to be kidnapped. See to it that no one kidnaps you away from the home in which you live. Through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ. And so for the last three weeks, Dave's done a masterful job at exposing how the spirit of mammon has really taken us all captive in one way or another. It's a hollow and deceptive philosophy. And what makes it hollow and deceptive is that it promises something that it fails to deliver. Buy this, get this, and then you'll be satisfied. but we all know and sort of intuitively and really that that isn't true that that only leads to wanting more stuff and so as a community it was really helpful over the last three weeks I think to start to find some hope to climb out of the hole of captivity that we've been in regarding money but what I want to talk about today is another hollow and deceptive philosophy but unlike mammon this one sounds really spiritual when we say it to each other i call it the jesus plus philosophy jesus plus now most christians if you were to pin them down and ask them they would argue to the death that it was jesus christ alone and the work that he did on the cross that alone is what saves them and what matters but most christians also live their lives and relate to others as if something more is required if you really want to be a good Christian. John Ortberg calls this boundary marker spirituality. He says that all groups have a tendency to want to be exclusive. We want to set up fences that define easy ways to see if I'm in and what makes me in and you're out and what makes you out. And all these groups want to separate themselves from outsiders. So they develop these highly visible ways to distinguish themselves from who's on the inside and who's on the outside. Christians do this, but other groups do it as well. So as a way to sort of expose this, I want to do a little give and take. I want to take a little quiz. So here you go. I think you're going to find it relatively easy. We'll start with the easiest one. The color of clothes that bikers wear is? Very good. See how easy that is? You guys got the first one right. NASCAR fans, in general, listen to what kind of music? Country. Amazing. Okay. If someone has a nose ring and a tattoo, they most likely voted for? See, there's a nervous right there, like nervous. Can I say that? Oh my gosh, can I say that? That was great. You guys did it perfectly. And if you show up to church on a Sunday in the fall with a block of foam cheese on your head, you are, you're really confused because you live in Minnesota. well here's the deal sadly Christians don't seem to be very different when it comes to this kind of thing and you may say wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute Christianity should be exclusive and I agree but we tend to want to be exclusive about way more things than what the scriptures teach us to be exclusive about. So I want you to raise your hand if you've ever been around a Christian who in what they say or what they do act as if being a real Christian means any of the following. And maybe, maybe some of you are guilty of some of these too, but let's not even go there. Let's just say if you have a friend who do these things, okay? So if you have a Christian friend who acts as if being a true Christian means attending a specific church or denomination and not others. You ever been around, okay? Friend, okay. If it means voting a specific political party and not others. Got a little more quiet there. Now I'm talking both sides of the spectrum here, people. They both do it. They both do it. Okay? Doing certain daily disciplines, like Bible reading or something like that, okay? Speaking in tongues, anyone? A few hands shot up like that. Well, there's some counselors in the back that are... All right, watching Fox News or CNN. Oh, man. Okay, making sure you don't swear. Okay, anyone involved in the Christian group that it's make sure you do swear? I'm not kidding. That group exists. Oh, man, they don't even swear. They're so inauthentic. I didn't go to this, but there was a Christian conference that one of my friends went to, a Christian conference that had a bingo card full of swear words. And so you would check off the swear word every time you heard it from the stage. It was amazing. Wow, we're not legalistic. We swear. oh man we're so messed up aren't we okay boycotting certain things movies books whatever or making sure you go to all those things to prove to those boycotters that they're simple-minded and myopic right here's one of my favorite ones these days saying that you're not a christian you're a jesus follower now i get it i get it but you can see how that might come across as a little arrogant right i follow jesus okay settled down well here's the thing here's the thing we start with Jesus there's probably a moment in your life where you really can remember when you really knew it was Jesus plus nothing when I mean you were broken and you were down I mean there there was nothing that was going to save you other than the person and work of Jesus Christ. But then we end up, as we grow, adding certain things. This philosophy of Jesus plus something is deceptive because though it sounds really spiritual, it actually doesn't result in more life. It's hollow because it promises more life, but it only brings deadly legalism. Because when it's Jesus plus something, you always end up losing Jesus. When it's Jesus plus, you end up losing Jesus. When the Apostle Paul went around the world in the first century preaching Jesus, there was a group of religious people called the Judaizers who would get on his website and look at his speaking tour, and then they would set up dates that immediately followed him. They would follow him around from city to city, wherever he taught, and they would say things like, oh brothers and sisters wasn't Paul great? Didn't he speak eloquently? And isn't Jesus great? We just want to tell you that Paul is great but he just left a few things out. And the Judaizers would come around and complete in their words the teachings that Paul taught them. They liked Jesus they just thought he wasn't enough. So turn to Acts 15 1. If you want to grab an example of this. I'll read it to you. Acts 15.1 Acts is the story of the early church in its early years. We read this, certain individuals, the Judaizers, came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the believers. And this is what they were teaching. Unless you are circumcised according to the custom taught by Moses, you can't be saved. Notice that according to the custom taught by Moses, we're getting this straight from the scriptures, people. You can't be saved. So this brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. Because for the Judaizers, it was Jesus plus being circumcised. Jesus was great. We're all about Jesus. You just need a little bit more. And so this affected the belief system of some of the members of the early church, and we see it right away. Just a few verses later in Acts 15 5, we read this. Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, listen, the Judaizers are right. The Gentiles must be circumcised and they must be required to keep the law of Moses. And so who was the group of people that was saying this? The Pharisees. So you think, ah, the Pharisees, those villains. Well, before the anti-Pharisee train gets a lot, gets a full head of steam and leaves the station, notice a couple of things. Number one, the early church included Pharisees. It says, some of the believers, and it's the word believers, it's the same word that's used in Acts 2.44 when we read all the believers were together. They shared everything in common. So there were Pharisees that were believers, and that's pretty incredible when you think of the harsh words that Jesus had for the Pharisees. So from the very start, we learned that the church was diverse. You imagine the dinner parties. The Pharisees at one end of the table, and you know that they, you know, because they learned from Jesus, they probably, you know, put a Pharisee right by a tax collector, you know, the early church, just to see. They had little questions on the table, you know. Anyway. So notice that. Number two thing to notice is notice how far these Pharisees have come. I mean, these are the same Pharisees who at one point in their life would have spit on the ground and tore their robes if you had suggested that Gentiles were at any part of their group, were on their side of the boundary marker. They would have said, no way. So for them to say, yeah, Gentiles are in, is revolutionary. The problem was they were just too tied to their own boundary markers and customs. They believed Jesus was great. He just wasn't enough. It had to be circumcision. And I could just see them talking amongst each other saying, listen, I'm all for the Gentiles being here, but how do we know they're legit? I mean, they worship all kinds of crazy gods and stuff. I need to know that they believe what we believe. And how will I know unless there's some sign that I can see? So here's the deal. What's dangerous around Jesus Plus is not people who hate Jesus. It's people who like Jesus but insidiously and subtly add to Jesus. And we do it all the time. We get attached to something that's our way of outwardly identifying whether or not you think God has worked in someone else's life or your life, but then the danger is to put your trust in that thing instead of God. In the early days of Open Door, if you've been here for any length of time, you'll remember there was a grace awakening. The message of grace was so refreshing and real that people who were dying under the weight of legalism would come from all over the Twin Cities to descend on this hot in the summer and cold in the winter gym that you couldn't find. I mean, there was no signs that said church of the open door. The parking was terrible, right? The kids' rooms were way up on the third floor. You couldn't get to them. Remember the big fans in the back of the room during the summer? You couldn't hear anything. You know, I mean, there's like airplane hanger fans. But we came and we packed out that place because every week it seemed like the wind of God was blowing. I mean, it was amazing. It was a work of God. We had language even that described it through the text. Remember? How to get out here what's in here and blessed are the broken and our only hope is Jesus. Amazing grace. It was unbelievable. But then you know what happened, at least in part. It became Jesus plus open door for some of us. Some of us who experienced this amazing grace would now come into contact with other Christians who didn't quite say it the way we said it. Or we would hear other preachers preach and we would kind of whisper to each other and say, he's not Dave Johnson. Or we would show up to the gym and we'd grab our bulletin and we'd look to see who's speaking. And it wasn't Dave. Some of us would turn around and leave because man, God can't blow if Dave's not speaking. we acted as if the only way God could move is if we were in that creaky gym and I remember sitting in that gym looking up at the ceiling where the basketball hoop had broken through the ceiling tile and wondering like over the years is anyone ever gonna fix that thing and realizing no and remember the broken scoreboard remember that deal you know and that was beautiful it was our way of saying we're broken. It was awesome. But then when we moved in here, there seriously were people who said we gotta put in bleachers. You know, that would have been fine. But it reveals something about us that's so natural and so normal. We all do it all the time. When a work of God happens, we want to cling to the work of God. and we want to cling to the way it happened instead of God himself. And what makes me realize, that's why God does different things all the time. God's always doing the same thing in different ways so that you can't trust in the thing. You have to trust in God. Yeah. I think about Jesus healing people. You know, and you think about that time that he spit on the ground and made mud and put it in the guy's eyes. what if he was just trying to be super creative about doing it differently, you know? So, of course, Jesus healed the guy. But then, like, later on, years later, the disciples would encounter a blind guy, you know, and they would, you know, spin the ground, put it in his eyes, and it's not working, it's not working. Do it again, do it more, more mud, more mud. Well, when Jesus did it, it was clay, so we gotta find clay, you know, ah! Well, when we begin to trust in the thing, we lose Jesus. It's gotta be Jesus plus nothing. So listen to Peter's response found in Acts 15, verses six through nine. In his response, we find the philosophy of Jesus plus nothing. Verse six, the apostles and elders met to consider this question of, do Gentiles really need to be circumcised in order to be believers? And after much discussion, Peter, who was the pastor of the early church, got up and addressed them. He said, brothers, you know that some time ago God made the choice among you that Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. And God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us. He didn't discriminate between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith. There's just a couple things to notice. In verse seven, notice that it was God who made the choice that Gentiles might hear and believe. God made that choice, and it wasn't a democracy. God said, this was always my plan for the beginning, that the whole world would be saved. But we need to admit that we like making the choice. We like insisting who is in and who is out based on our own boundary markers. We should be the ones who make the choice. Thank you very much. We should be the ones who decide, who can hear and believe, and will decide who it is that really has heard and really has believed based on these outward signs. Jesus plus speaking in tongues. Jesus plus swearing. Jesus plus not swearing. Jesus plus open door. Jesus plus Dave Johnson. And it goes on and on and on. We talk about who it is who has accepted God. But in verse eight, Peter talks about who God has accepted. It's amazing. We talk about our decisions for God. Peter talks about God's decisions for us. The reason why this is such an important distinction, whose choice it is, that it's God's, not ours, it's found later in verse eight, when we read that it is only God who knows the heart. God who knows the heart. is the one who gets to decide. But we discriminate between one believer and another. We read in Acts 15, 9, that he that is God does not discriminate between Gentiles and Jews. When you hear and believe and get the Holy Spirit, God comes and does a work in you. So the last part of Peter's response found in Acts 15.10 is this. And you can almost hear him getting a little testy here. When he says, now then, verse 10, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear? No, we believe that it is by grace, Grace of our Lord Jesus, that we are saved just as they are. It's the same for us, you guys, he's saying. We didn't get saved because we followed all the commandments, because even if you think you did, you didn't. We needed grace just as they need grace. So the question for me and for you around that is this. Are you putting a yoke on someone else? Jesus plus whatever it is is your thing that you yourself can't bear? Are you putting a yoke on someone that you yourself can't bear? This week, this just really came to me, confession time for me. One of the ways that I think this is true about me is this. One of the things I believe from my toes is that Jesus really is the only way. And I believe the way of Jesus, his teachings, his way of living is the way toward life. It's the way of life. It's the way of God. So I've committed to and taught others, including you, to be like Jesus. I think that message, be like Jesus, is great. It's inspiring. I believe in it. And when I hear it, my want to kicks in big time. Do what Jesus did. Respond to people how Jesus responded to them. Find time to get away and be silent because that's what Jesus did. Remain in God as Jesus did every moment. Love your enemies all the time. But let me tell you where that message, be like Jesus, can take me. It might not be where it takes you, but when I let that message, be like Jesus, sit in me long enough, the primary emotion that I feel is tired, exhausted. Because you know what I know about myself when I'm thinking clearly? I'm not! Love your enemies. Love your wife. Love your kids. I realize oh man and I'm teaching other people be like Jesus live your life exactly as he lived his that's what Jesus wants and you realize it's Jesus plus my commitment to follow Jesus then and you're like oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness well luckily when we get to that oh my goodness part we find Jesus listen to his words in Matthew 11 verse 28 when he says come to me all you who are weary and burdened and I will give you more work to do a standard you can't live up to. I'll give you, let's say, together. Man. Take my yoke upon you, my way. It's the agricultural metaphor of a yoke where two ox would go together. So it means I'm locked in one side, you're locked in the other side, and we're doing life together. Learn from me, for I'm gentle and humble in heart. and you'll find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light. And that last sentence, my yoke is easy and my burden is light, I think so many people are laboring under a kind of shame and guilt because you realize your life is not easy and your burden isn't light. So where you go is, so I must not be following Jesus. Oh man, I'm not getting it right. So love your enemies some more. Well, the word for easy here doesn't mean easy. It means Jesus will furnish what you need to go through your life. When you're hooked up to the yoke of Jesus, doing life together, it might be hard. It might be incredibly hard. But you need to know that you don't have to furnish everything by yourself. Jesus will. And that is the best news that I have heard in a long time. Jesus is saying to me in this, Steve, honestly, don't focus on being like me. Focus on being with me. Focus on being with me. if you're with me you'll learn my ways you'll learn that I am enough so if you're exhausted if you're carrying a yoke that you were never meant to carry and maybe even forcing others to do it I wonder if you can receive the same invitation that Jesus calls out to you be with me be with me be rooted in me established in me because I am enough. And I think when that starts to happen that Jesus plus stuff will start to fall off because it'll just seem like, ugh, what did I ever see in that anyway? Here's the deal. Whether you're messed up by legalism or messed up by terrible choices, God has made the choice that you might hear and believe. God has accepted you. God sent the Holy Spirit to you so you can have a unique way of being with Jesus that's different from mine, different from Stefan's, different from anybody else. It's your unique way of being with Jesus. We're gonna talk about that more next week. God has chosen you. As we come to the table, let's return to Colossians 2. 6 and 7, there's this one little phrase I want to end it. So then we read, just as you receive Jesus Christ as Lord, again continue to live your lives in him, rooted and built up in him. That's next week. Strengthen the faith as you were taught. But then here's the phrase I want to end on. Overflowing with thankfulness. Now the word thankfulness is the word Eucharistia, which is where we get our word Eucharist or communion. When the early church decided to name this thing coming to the table, they named it Thanksgiving. So when we come to the table, what we're doing is saying, Jesus, I have added to you, but I don't need to. Thank you, Jesus, that is Jesus plus nothing. Thank you, Jesus, for furnishing what I need in my difficult life. Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for accepting me. Thank you for inviting me to simply be with you by sending your Holy Spirit into my life. Thank you, Jesus, that it's not me, it's you. That's what we do when we come to the table. When you have Jesus plus nothing, you have everything. Amen? Amen. Amen.
