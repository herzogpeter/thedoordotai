Let's pray as we go now to the Word. Father, I pray that by the power of your Spirit you would give life to this Word that reveals the rest of the story that is Christmas. I pray that in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Joy to the world. Among the primary themes of Christmas, you'll hear no doubt you did this morning in our worship, is joy and peace. The hope most people have for Christmas is often the same. For joy and peace, which on a personal level might not mean much more than getting what you really want this year for Christmas. That'd be joy. Or at a more noble level, maybe being able to give what you really wanted to give this year to someone that you care for. That'd be joy too. Or family and friends and food and celebrating in some way. It's all joy. Because for most of us, myself included, Christmas joy is associated with most often and contingent upon some idyllic scene. the kind you might see in a Thomas Kinkade painting with sleigh bells and snow and serenity and joy because that's what joy looks like. But did you know it was a war, this Christmas story? A life and death struggle with all of eternity hanging in the balance. no sleigh bells, no Santa, no idyllic scenes of snowfall and serenity because in the kingdom of God, while there is in fact joy inexpressible and full of glory to be had, it almost always comes, this joy does, at a very high price. This joy in the kingdom of God almost always comes through a conflict of some kind from a battle of some sort, a battle that is being waged for the hearts and minds and souls of men and women universal, God wins the battle, and that's your joy to the world. But this joy is costly in the kingdom of God. Almost always is it messy and bloody and sometimes very disturbing when you look underneath the surface of where this joy we celebrate came from. See, most of us want joy served up. especially at Christmas without even knowing it sometimes we have expectations of Christmas they're more than expectations sometimes they are internal demands and if everything isn't just right like the picture I have in my mind with snow falling this year I'm kind of ticked off feel ripped off because they're just it didn't play out because we want joy served up but in the kingdom of God it almost always comes at a price almost always through a conflict almost always through a battle of some kind. Hear the echo of that truth in Hebrews 12, verse 2, where it says of Jesus that who for the joy, there's your joy, he endured the cross. In order to get the joy, he endured first the cross, and for the joy to the world, he chose the cross. How many of you know the Christmas story? That's a silly question. You all know it. Because you're sitting in church, you know the real one, not the commercial consumer one. We know the Jesus born in the manger one. The little town in Bethlehem how still we see thee lie one. We know the peace on earth, goodwill toward men one. I go to church once a year at Christmas one. But have you ever heard the Revelation 12 one. That's actually my favorite one. It actually is the Christmas story from a slightly different perspective. It's John's perspective who, through a vision, gives us a glimpse behind the scenes as to what was really going on that Christmas morn. And what was really going on, in addition to what we could physically see was a battle, a war, a life and death struggle for joy. So here's a Christmas story this morning, Revelation style. What was going on behind the scenes? If you have your Bibles, open them to Revelation chapter 12 verse 1. Begins with these words, and a great sign appeared in heaven. A woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of 12 stars, and she was with child, and she cried out, being in labor and in pain to give birth, verse 5. And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who was to rule and redeem and to restore the nations, bringing mankind back to the heart of God. Now, as many of you know, when we're dealing with the book of Revelation, we're dealing with what's called apocalyptic language. And if you were here a few years ago when we went through the book of Revelation, you know what that means. I don't have time to get into defining apocalyptic language. Suffice it to say that it is symbolic language. And in the book of Revelation, sometimes the symbolism is quite obscure. Other times it's obvious. In the story we're telling out of Revelation 12, some of the symbolism is actually quite obvious. You've already known what these things are. As I read those verses, the male child born to the woman who would rule the nations is obviously Christ. The woman giving birth in the largest sense and application of this analogy or symbol is actually Israel, because it was from Israel that Messiah would come, but more specifically, as it manifested itself in physical ways on earth, the woman about to give birth is Mary. Action picks up in verse 3 of chapter 4, and another sign appeared in heaven, and behold, a great dragon appeared. I don't think it takes a lot to figure out what the dragon is or who the dragon is. It's obviously Satan having seven heads and ten horns, and on his head were seven diadems, middle of verse four. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth, he might deliver her a child. He might, I'm sorry, he might devour her child. And then the first six words of verse seven are these, and there was a war in heaven, all of which raises this question, whatever happened to Silent Night? I mean, the story I just read you, if it were to be scripted, if it were to be made into a movie, would look an awful lot like more. The movie I saw this week, the third installment of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Return of the King, I went, yeah, wasn't it a great movie? I know how it ends. You want to know? How many of you want to know if Frodo dies? You can take out your gun and shoot me, won't you? But the thing I just read to you sounds and would be played out in a movie an awful lot more like that movie than Away in a Manger. See, here's how it works. On earth, Away in a Manger. On earth, for what we could see, O little town of Bethlehem, Oh, how still we see the lie. In heaven, a war. With a woman about to give birth to a child who will rule and redeem and restore creation. And a dragon waiting to pounce as soon as this child is born with the intent to devour this child. And when the child is born, the dragon does indeed pounce. And that pouncing even is manifested in a physical way. using King Herod and his jealous paranoia as his pawn, like a puppet, Herod has all the male children in the entire region slaughtered, thinking that in the slaughter of all the innocents, he would, in that slaughter, kill this one who was called the Christ, who was called and told to him by the prophecies that he would be the king of the Jews, but he misses, the child escapes, and there's your joy, so joy to the world, The dragon missed. Joy, there's your joy. But it came through incredible drama. It came through a war in heaven. Joy to the world. But what a price for that joy. Even played out physically. Thousands of innocents die for this drama war going on in heaven. Matthew 2.18 says, There was another voice heard that day in Ramah, and it wasn't a song of joy. Weeping and great mourning, the text says, Rachel, weeping for her children beyond consoling because they were no more. I guess it wasn't such a silent night after all. I mean, whatever happened to all is calm, All is bright. Are we talking about the same story? Yeah, we are. It is the same story. And it's not the last time, by the way, that Satan pounces, desiring to devour the Christ, and it's not the last time that he misses. Because he pounces, does this dragon, and he misses again at the cross. Satan, the dragon, thought he had him for sure this time. He was dead, not only dead, he was buried. He descended into the lower parts, the scriptures say, into hell, most believe, where in this lower place, in this hell, he tasted death for every man. With the sin of the world on him, he died on the cross, tasting death there. Let me tell you where he really tasted death. When with the sin of the world on him, he went into this hellish place, and for three days, Satan danced a jig. he finally had devoured the Christ he had been trying to devour since the beginning of this story but God, Acts chapter 2 verse 24 says raise him up again putting an end to the agony of this kind of death and as Jesus left that hell 1 Peter 3.19 says he made a proclamation to the dragon and his demons it was this my paraphrase of Ephesians 4 verse 8 Satan, dragon, and demons here's the deal I win, you lose, bye bye and he blew open the gates of hell as he led captive a host of captives and he gave gifts to men so joy to the world Merry Christmas everybody point is that joy to the world came through incredible battle, an enormous cost. And Jesus, before the battle began, made a decision. And this was his decision. I will choose suffering for joy. Go back to that phrase I just read out of Ephesians 4, verse 8, where it says he led captive a host of captives. It's kind of a strange phrase. What it means is that he set free or he recaptured, led captive, a host of people who had been taken captive. Men and women whose hearts and minds and souls were in bondage to sin and death and hell. And the gifts he gave to men were in effect the spoils of war. I'm going to explain that because Ephesians 4.8 is actually a quote from Psalm 68. In Psalm 68, it's the Psalm of David. And he is doing a psalm there that speaks to and describes what happens when a king of Israel goes in to defeat the enemy and comes back victorious. And when he comes back victorious, he comes back with two things. He comes back with a bunch of people who have been in captivity, but now they're being set free. Do you remember last week we saw what happened to David and Ziklag? And the women and the children were all taken captive, and God said to David, go get them. And he went and got them, and when they were victorious, they came back into the city triumphant, and they had all of those who had been captive. Now they were set free. But there was something else the victorious king would always bring, the spoils of war. And what he would do with the spoils of war was not keep them for himself, but he would share the spoils of war with the people. It's part of the celebration. In Ephesians 4, verse 8, when it takes Psalm 68 and applies it to the redeemed, what he's saying is this. When Satan, when Jesus blew open the gates of hell after the dragon pounced and he missed, he came back redeeming people, but also bringing the spoils of war. And the spoils of war, if you read the rest of Ephesians 4, are clearly this, spiritual gifts. That he shares with the redeemed. Spiritual gifts, simply these, divine enablements given to the redeemed so that we would now be able to have the supernatural capacity to continue and complete what Jesus began to in fact do what he did. And among the things that Jesus did, most powerful was this, he willingly chose suffering for other people's joy. Hebrews 12 verse 2 again, who for the joy, joy, that's what I want, set before him, he what? Endured the cross, despised the shame, and he endured the cross, not because he liked it, and he despised the shame because he got a kick out of it. No, he endured the cross, despised the shame for joy, particularly for your joy. So there's your joy to the world. My Christmas message this year, which I took all of that to set up, centers around a question born of this behind-the-scenes story of Christmas. The question, in my opinion, is a disturbing question because it's been disturbing me all week, and I hope it lives in my life for the rest of my life in a disturbing way. It could be a life-changing question because what it does is it pulls us into this behind-the-scenes story. It pushes us past being grateful that Jesus chose suffering for joy and calls us into that same thing. Past gratitude that Christ is willing to choose suffering for joy, the question is this, what would I be willing to suffer for someone else's joy? What would we, as a church, be willing to suffer for other people's joy? Suffering. Let me clarify something. I'm not talking about the kind of suffering we talked about last week. We talked about what it looks like and what it feels like to be in a cave. Remember that? The distinction I want to make here about the cave suffering and the suffering I'm speaking of today is this, that you don't choose a cave. Caves come to you. Last week we talked about David and his 10-year in the wilderness experience where he was hiding from Saul in caves. He didn't choose those caves. He wouldn't choose them. He shouldn't choose them. In fact, I said, I hate caves. It's okay to hate caves. Let's hate them together. I hate caves. Those dark times in our lives when we enter into suffering, but we didn't choose the suffering. The suffering came to David, and he endured it with a steadfast heart, And in the cave, he learned what it means to strengthen himself in the Lord, his God. But I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about becoming the kind of men and women who would choose to do something for which you might pay a very high price. In other words, you might suffer so that someone else might be healed. Becoming the kind of men and women who would choose suffering, do something for which there could be a price so that someone else might be helped or housed or fed or clothed or redeemed. It's called redemptive suffering. It's embodied in Christ who for the joy, there's the joy, who for the joy set before him endured the cross. He chose suffering for joy. Isaiah 53 verse 5 is a passage we're fairly familiar with. hear a lot around Easter, Good Friday, where it says this, by his stripes we have been healed. And we praise God for the fact that by the suffering he went through, we receive our redemption, we receive our healing as it were. But did you know that we've been invited into that story? That's part of what it means to be a kingdom liver. Not just to celebrate that Jesus suffered for us, though we do that, not just be grateful for the fact that he did, but that quite literally, there are places in our lives where this is true, that by the stripes we might be willing to receive, the sufferings we might be willing to endure, someone else might be healed. It doesn't mean we're anybody's redeemer. It means we've entered into this kingdom reality that says, you willfully say, I will put my self in a place where I may pay a price for this, for someone else's joy. You've touched on this kingdom truth. By the way, if you think I'm misapplying Isaiah 53.5, you may be right. But in Philippians 2 verse 5, it makes this call into the story explicitly clear. When Paul says this, have this attitude in you, which was also in Christ, who although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but he emptied himself, becoming a slave, even a bond slave, becoming in that position, obedient even unto death, even death on the cross. The invitation is clear, have this attitude in you. I'm inviting you into the story. This is, as we say around here a lot, this is not about just accept Jesus, go to heaven when you die. The invitation is come into the story. Come into the story. It's clear that Paul entered the story when he says in places like Philippians 3, verse 10, in a personal way, speaking of himself, revealing the passion of his heart, he says this, my passion in life is this, that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings. Let me break that verse down real quickly. That I may know him. That's an incredible passion. That's your passion. That's my passion, to know him. It's very evangelical. We go to church to learn more about him so we can know him more. And the power is resurrection. That's a charismatic thing. It's kind of pressing a little further. I want the power. I want all that stuff. That's great. It's incredible. And the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings. don't hear much about that. We don't know much about that. When he talks about the fellowship of his sufferings, it's not just speaking of sufferings that come to you because life is hard. Paul is not there speaking of his cave experiences. He is not speaking of someone who says, you know, I just go through these really hard things and I'm suffering for Jesus. There's no victim thing in here at all. When he speaks of a fellowship of sharing in the sufferings of Christ, the sufferings of Christ were things that Jesus suffered because he chose to pay a very high price for someone else's joy. We're about the fellowship of suffering. To give you a picture of what this is actually about. Sometimes at halftime of a football game, they will have a ceremony where they call out some old team in the history of the team. It'd be like if the Vikings at halftime celebrate the days of the Vikings when they were going to the Super Bowl several times, even though they didn't win. But that was an era of success and excellence in the history of the Vikings football team that from time to time you would honor. And at halftime you could see it. They come out and they celebrate them. And we think about Alan Page and Carl Eller and Fran Tarkenden and all those guys. And those players, as they walk out from the sideline into the middle of the field and everybody cheers, are part of a fellowship. And in the fellowship of these guys who played this game years ago and bled and struggled, there is a knowing among them. There is a knowing in this fellowship of what they did and what it cost them to do what they did that others might appreciate and look at and admire, but they aren't in the fellowship. And it's not even just like a club you can't come. It's like they don't know because they weren't the ones who were bleeding and training. See, the same kind of thing in the context of the military. And when that fellowship of men and women and whoever they are gathers who went through something for a prize of some sort. When they gather together, you know what they do? They get around and they begin to tell stories. You're going to see it, can't you? As they gather together 20 years later and they haven't seen each other at all, but they gather together and they start to tell the stories of what it felt like to play the game. And the memories come back. And we hear from Charlie over here. He says, you remember that third game on fourth down and 12? We went for it. Somebody over here, I remember when you played that third quarter with a broken leg, couldn't believe it. And this other guy, you were bleeding all over, he broke your nose and you played anyway and they tell the stories. And some of them a little bit more shy, maybe thinking they didn't make that kind of contribution, would be called out by someone and say, you know, Bob, over here, tell us your story. I remember you, I remember you, how you did this. And they tell their story. They're part of a fellowship. And if you didn't play, you don't have a story to tell. Here's the deal, beloved. The only opportunity we will ever have to willingly suffer, to pay a high price for someone else's joy, for someone else's healing, for someone else's help and housing and redemption. The only time we will ever have an opportunity to do that is this side of eternity because on the other side of eternity, no more suffering, not even for joy. But I'm going to tell you this, on the other side, where there is no suffering, there will be a fellowship. a fellowship of ordinary men and women who in a variety of ways on this side of eternity in their marriages in their families in their connections with their children in their communities in their friendships and workplaces said in a variety of ways I will go and I will give and I will serve and I will suffer if need be for other people's joy Paul will be there, no doubt. And some of you will be there as well. Some of you, and I'm not talking about being in heaven. Let's say we're all in heaven. But in heaven, there's going to be a fellowship of people who played this game a different way. And I see them, these fellowships in heaven, doing what people who are in the fellowship do, like old army buddies who went through the war they will be telling stories of things they suffered for joy. I don't know about you, but I'd like to hear some of Paul's stories as he's sitting there, maybe even unconscious of himself, saying, remember that time we were shipwrecked? Oh, I hated that. It hurt so much. And yet out of that, there's these people who heard the word. And then Peter would start to tell a story, and you'd just be transfixed. And some of you will think, well, I don't have a story to tell. And maybe at some point in the storytelling, They'll point at you and say, Bob, come here, come here. Well, you tell us your story, and you'll go, no, no, that time, remember that time for three weeks in a row you woke up in the middle of the night because you couldn't sleep, and you woke up and you realized you were supposed to pray, so all night long you prayed for three weeks for a kid over there that you didn't even know, and that kid didn't know until now that you prayed for him. Welcome to the, you're part of the fellowship, and you tell your story. Here's what's stirring me. I want some stories to tell. Relentiously, beloved, we sometimes live our entire Christian life as if God did it. And it's all for me. And we never enter into this treasure. We never enter into the fellowship of wondering what we would be willing to suffer for someone else's joy. In Philippians 1.29, Paul says something that sounds really bizarre to tell you the truth. unless you've begun to unlock this treasure of redemptive suffering I'm talking about this morning. Because he says this, it has been granted to you, meaning you have the rare privilege, meaning you have struck the jackpot, you just won the lottery, because it's been granted to you not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake. Lucky me. Please clarify it again, though. Clarify it in your own mind as you're wondering what this means. This is not the kind of suffering that comes to you because life is hard, because someone else's sin, you're in a cave. No, the granted to you to suffer for his sake are those opportunities you have in this life before eternity to say, you know what, I'm going to enter into something that could cost me for their joy, for their healing, for their housing, for their redemption. I'm going to pour something out here. It has been granted to you to be able to do this on this side of eternity. To make this less obscure than it may be for some of you. Let me just try to illustrate this because it's not as obscure. It's not as far away as we think. Illustrate it this way. One day an angel came to Mary saying essentially this, Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. For to you it has been what? granted. To have the life of God come to you, Mary, to be planted inside of you, to grow in you, to come from you, and as it comes from you, to literally change the world around you. That's what it's been granted to you, but you will suffer, Mary, for this. Ran into Steve Hansen this week. We're talking about this. He told me about a book he read about Mary. I didn't read the book. He told me this. The premise of the book is this. It ruined her life when she said yes to God. It ruined her life real good. She did suffer for saying yes to God because this life in you, Mary, as it's planted inside of you, both physically and figuratively, this life in you is going to stretch you. As it stretches you, it's going to hurt you. As it hurts you, it's going to mark you. It's going to scar you, and physically it did that as it does to every woman who ever has a baby. It's going to embarrass you, Mary. You're going to have a tough time explaining to your friends and relatives how it is you're still a virgin. Even, yeah, they're going to buy that. It may cause Joseph to leave you. It didn't, but she had to press into that. It has been granted to you, Mary. Her response is the response of many of the heroic of faith from time and into eternity. Be it done unto me, just as you said. In other words, Mary, the blessed mother of Jesus, chose suffering for other people's joy. Guess what? She's in the fellowship. And she has some stories to tell. And we can only bring conjecture to it in terms of what she suffered. but on the other side in the fellowship of those who said, I'm going to pay a price for obedience to Christ and for other people's joy. I'm going to sit by the fire when Mary has her turn and talks about what it cost her. To say yes to God. Beloved, you know this. It was because of her yes to God that we can sing at all the song we sing at Christmas, Joy to the World. Now, we've tasted this in ways we don't always recognize. And again, I want to make it even more simple. I think God's calling us deeper into this, but there's ways we've already touched it. Maybe it's because I've got this Mary analogy in my head, but when I think of choosing suffering for joy on a purely physical level, I think of women. I think of mothers in particular who physically say yes to suffering for joy when they give birth to a child. I mean, the suffering is obvious. The joy is obvious. You don't get to the joy without the suffering. I'll never forget when Bonnie and I were having our first. Actually, Bonnie was having it. We were at St. Mary's Hospital. We were 24 years old, just kids. I can't even believe we were that young having our first. Scary. I don't recommend it. We had just seen a movie at this pre-marriage, pre-marriage, no, pre-birth thing. that's how rumors start it's on the tape we saw a movie we saw a film of a woman having a baby it scared the daylights out of Bonnie and I remember going out at a break and we were sitting in the parking lot and she began to cry and she said I don't think I can do this and I was big help I said it's already in you honey it's already there buck up you know I don't go down this road it's not like I live with this awareness but whenever I think of these things I think of my wife and honestly she's a hero to me because my wife who not only said yes to that process of suffering so that four little ones could have life but the fact is to this day in ways our kids sometimes see and appreciate and sometimes can't see and don't appreciate, not because they're ungrateful, because they can't see it. And they just don't need to see it. And maybe one day they'll understand it when they have their own. My wife enters into things and carries things and feels things and suffers things for those four children, and she does it for joy. But guess what? It's not for her joy, it's for theirs. It's for theirs. She's in the fellowship. I think I'm a good dad, but I can just tell you, my wife carries things and feels things I don't know about. She enters into things for joy, not hers. Among the most powerful but unseen ministries in any healthy church is the ministry of intercessors. Intercessors, by definition, are anonymous. You don't know who they are. But intercessors enter, if you're a true intercessor, you know what I'm talking about, and you're usually quiet. You're one of the people who, when the fellowship starts telling a story, I think we're going to have to point at the intercessors and call them out because they won't naturally tell their story. But I want to tell you something about intercessors that I know. They enter into suffering. They are the people who wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning and don't know why. Except this, I'm supposed to pray. And they don't even know for whom. And God puts someone on their mind, and they begin to pray, and they pray from 3 to 5, or 3 to 6. And they're praying for you, and they're praying for us. And they do it three days in a row, and it's a way of life, and they carry things, and they feel things. And they enter into suffering for other people's joy, and nobody knows their name, you're in the fellowship. I want to say to the intercessors, you know what I'm talking about. You tend to minimize what you carry. I'm telling you this, you're in the fellowship, and one day we'll hear your story. This one might be a bit of a stretch, but I think I'm right about this. Every Sunday I drive in, I get in here a little early, and I see these guys setting up our parking lots, and they work in the parking lot. I'm not talking about the rent-a-cops, though I'm sure they're all wonderful people. I'm talking about our guys, and there may be some women in there, but in the wintertime, I can't tell. They're all bundled up, so. These people come early. They leave late. They do it in pouring rain and freezing cold. You know why they do that? You know why they help out in their parking lot? Because it's so much fun. No, because it's their spiritual gift. They have the spiritual gift of parking cars. No, they don't. No, they don't. No, because ever since they were little kids, they just loved playing with those orange cones. How much fun do you think they have? Not much. Do you understand they're not doing it because it's fun? They choose to do it for other people's joy, yours. So maybe, so maybe, someone could get in to a parking place a little quicker and you guys would all press through it, but maybe there's a visitor this week who's just wondering about this weird church and they came today. And if there's a traffic jam, they're gonna get frustrated and drive away and there's a parking guy saying, no, no, no, come on, right here. We got one for you right here. So they're doing, and they're dying. It's cold, it's rainy, and they're getting in there so you can get in here and maybe hear something about life. You know, we try to recruit people for ministry needs around here. We almost always try to sell you. I don't think it's a manipulative way, but we always try to sell you to get you involved in this by convincing you how much fun you'll have. Come on, help with the kids. It'll be fun. Kind of trying to show you what's in it for you. Because, you know, that's kind of why we do things. We have testimonials of people who work with the kids or they work over here or they did this little thing and the story is all about how I got blessed. Oh, well, you got blessed. Well, if I get blessed, then I'll do it because I'll get blessed. Here's the deal. You will get blessed. You will. You will. But wouldn't it be something if we began to recruit this way? Folks, you know what we need? Not just this weekend, but next and the next. You know what this community needs? You know what this city needs? You know what this world needs? It needs some people who'd be willing to suffer. Anybody willing? And we need some people who'd be willing to suffer for someone else's joy. Some people who'd be willing to suffer for someone else's healing and someone else's help and someone else's housing and someone else's redemption. There's some sign-up sheets in the back. I want us to live with this question. I am living with it. I want us to live with it. What would you be willing to suffer for other people's joy? It's a question that needs to be answered on a number of levels. We need to answer it as a church. I think we do answer this question. We're trying to. I think absolutely God's calling us deeper into this question. Open door, what would you be willing to suffer? What would you be willing to endure as a church? To do without for a while for other people's joy. So that this community, for instance, this community that we live in, would be affected in incarnational ways. What would you be willing to suffer so this community could be changed, not by our preaching or singing songs or musical, but they would be changed because people coming from this church are wondering what I could suffer for their joy, just simply to serve them. We're involved in a sanctuary church downtown, most of you know, in Minneapolis. It's becoming more and more of a real relationship. We're instrumental in planting it, but the relationship is growing. We meet with them. We pray with them. We see the need that they have in North Minneapolis. I've gone down there a few times. I look at the neighborhood, and as I look at the neighborhood now, I'm coming with this question. What would we as a church be willing to suffer for these people's joy? Closer to home, what about our community? What about our church? You've heard the announcement here in the fall, and you responded so positively to prison fellowship and kids in our community, far more than we knew that were here, one who have one or both parents who are in prison. And as we announced that to you and gave you opportunities to serve those kids and minister to those kids in some real practical ways, your heart's just so big. It just went toward them so big and so wonderfully. But I just want to push all of us, and I want to be pushed myself. I wonder what we'd be willing to suffer for those kids. You know, we have some kids right here in our community. In fact, we have kids right here in our church who've been effectively orphaned by parents who are too busy or too angry at each other to have any time for their kids. All you gotta do is talk to somebody in this community who's working with kids, people in ministries like the Treehouse Ministry, and talk to them and ask for the stories of what kids in this community are going through. And they'll tell you that what's going on in the city is incredible and it's hard and we need to move there as a church, but you don't have to go there to see the pain. It's unbelievable. The splintering of families. These kids are effectively orphaned and they're lonely and they're scared and they're growing up very, very angry. And the question arises, what would we be willing to endure? What would we be willing to suffer? So kids like that could be healed. last year I was thinking about this last year we didn't buy a new car so we could give more maybe that's good and noble could I push you further because I'm being pushed further see I still have a really nice car big deal here's the question what would you be willing to suffer for other people's joy I want to ask that question to my sons I want to ask that question to my daughters I want to ask it to my sons and daughters That go beyond my two physical sons and daughters To the sons and daughters I have here That I don't even know Join me in asking this question of yourself What would I be willing to endure For someone else's healing For someone else's joy For someone else's redemption I think about our marriages And our families Here in this church you know the Bible says love your wives husbands and wives love your husbands as well in what manner in this manner the way Christ loved the church and what he did among other things for the church was to lay down his life in other words he chose suffering for our his bride's joy and you know as the bride I love receiving that. Thank you Jesus for laying down your life but Jesus hear me has invited us into the story. If you're a kingdom person it's not just heaven when you die. I'm inviting you to Jesus. I'm inviting you into the story of the kingdom of God where we begin to walk out these things that Jesus walked out himself. see I talk to and hear about men all the time Christian men and I talk to and hear about women all the time Christian women who have come to the realization that their spouse doesn't meet their needs doesn't understand them at all oh they're really a good person might even be a Christian not abusive in any way but they don't meet my needs they don't understand me so they take what they think in fact they say this to me sometimes they're taking the hero's journey and the hero's journey is when they make the boldly courageous move of admitting they don't love their spouse and I can't pretend anymore and they leave. How courageous. You want courage? Admit that you don't love them. That'll take some courage. And quit pretending. Do what I said last week. We talked about lament. you need to lament. Quit pretending that everything's happy and say out loud it's not and then stay and figure out what it means to love your wife the way Christ loved the church and figure out what it means to love your husband the way Christ loved the church. I'm preaching this today but I hope that you're sensing that I'm in this too this word is landing on and calling me out to see none of us are good at this all of us are learners here that's why this Christmas message isn't a message at all it's a question it's a disturbing question I hope it's disturbing you the way it's been disturbing me could be a life-changing question the question is this what would I what would we be willing to do to suffer to endure for other people's joy and then begin to wonder what would it mean I wonder what would it mean for our marriages, for our families, our children, this community, the local high school here in town, the homeless shelter here in town, for the least and the lost in our city, if ordinary people like you and me began to say, I want to be part of the fellowship that Paul talked about. The fellowship of people who like Paul have said, I will go and I will give and I will serve and I will suffer if need be for other people's joy. What would it mean? I know what it would mean. It would mean joy for our marriages. It would mean joy to our families. It would mean joy to our church, to this community, to the local high school, to the homeless shelter, to the least and the lost in the city. It would mean joy to the world. So you want a Merry Christmas? Okay. Have this attitude in you, which was also in Christ, who for our Christmas joy gave everything he had so we could sing this song, Joy to the World. Merry Christmas, everybody. Joy to the World. Let's pray as we close. Father, we are thankful that we have a God who revealed himself to us in Christ, who chose suffering for our joy. But we thank you also that you have invited us and you have granted to us the wonderful privilege of entering into that very story and doing the very things you did to bring joy and healing and help to a desperately lost community and city and world. Help us to become more and more the kind of people who are entering in to this kind of story, continually asking ourselves the question, what would I be willing, what would we be willing to endure for other people's joy? So we can sing with joy, joy to the world. I pray these things be increasingly real among us in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
