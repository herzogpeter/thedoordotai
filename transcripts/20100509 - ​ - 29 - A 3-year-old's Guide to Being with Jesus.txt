Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Hi there. My name is Mary Martin Weins, and I've been asked to offer a blessing for Mother's Day. I'm the mother of three little boys, ages three and under. I'm also a woman who struggled with infertility for many years. And during that time of suffering and waiting, the invitation that I heard from God was to become a mother in my spirit, with no guarantee that there would ever be children from my body. so because of that invitation I began to see that there are many ways to give birth many ways to give life many ways to nurture life and as I pondered what kind of blessing to give today it felt important to honor the mother that I was before children the mother that I am now and the many women that I know who mother in both traditional and untraditional ways I've seen friends do the work of a mother when they've given birth to a book or given medical advice or by teaching, by standing up for justice, by laying hands on others in prayer, by listening. So I want to bless each of you women today who sacrifice so that life can come through you to another. I invite you to let in whichever of these words seem to be for you today and let go of whichever ones are not. Now mothers, receive this blessing. Mothers of children, mothers of adults, mothers to ailing parents, mothers in spirit, mothers of creative works, mothers with empty wombs, mothers whose arms ache to be filled with one who was once there. You, life givers and life nurturers, You who hold the small, essential things that make a world. You who are the ground on which others find their footing. You who are the sole witness to private stories unfolding. You who respond to cries of hunger, heartache, fear, or pain. You who shelter growing things. You whose most significant work is unseen. You bringers of tenderness and comfort. To mother is to make oneself vulnerable to loss. To give oneself wholly to something that has the guarantee of at least a measure of failure. To give birth to something that is beyond you, that doesn't belong to you, that you can't control. To engage in a work that reveals both your best and your worst. to surrender your time, your body, your rhythms, your resources for the joy set before you. So mothers, may God, the life-giving spirit, be your source. May God be both witness and companion to all the unseen moments of your life. May God preserve you at your core when the needs of others threaten to wash you away. May God give grace as you seek to unwind the knot of both founded and unfounded guilt and enable you to bring healing in places where you've brought harm. May God give you courage on thresholds of change. May God make of your emptiness a wide and free place. May the one who holds all things together assure you that divine arms surround all that is beyond your reach. And when you lift up your eyes to see your life, may your joy be great. Amen. Well, one of the great joys of my life is to be able to share a life with her. My wife. Yeah. And that blessing that she wrote will be available on the message tool this week if you'd like to get a copy of it. And I just saw about a thousand heads nod right there. Thanks, honey. That was amazing. Before we dive into the talk, just a quick announcement. Today's the last day to sign up for the thing that we're calling Conversations, which is a really great opportunity for some of you who would like to to sign up for a one-on-one conversation between a trained Open Door facilitator who will just ask you questions about what God is doing in your life because we really want to know. We want to explore what God's doing in you so that we can explore what God is doing in us as a church because the vision for the church doesn't come from a few. It comes to the body. And we want to hear from you. So if you haven't signed up for one of those, today's the last day to sign up for it. Just go online. It's real easy to do. The questions that the facilitator will ask you are printed out so there's no surprises. And so please, please do that if you would. All right, would you pray with me as we dive in to the talk? Jesus, what I pray for this morning would be a profound sense of the simple. That we would resist complicated so that we can embrace the profound simplicity of your invitation to us. Amen. Well, last week I talked about the danger of what I call the Jesus Plus philosophy, which is illustrated by the fact that while most Christians would, if you sort of pin them down, they would say, listen, I am saved solely by what Christ did on the cross. But then they add to that this complex behavioral systems that are designed to determine which Christians are just doing it a little better and which Christians are not quite there. And these behavioral systems we talked about include the following. For some of us, it includes making sure we don't swear. But for other Christians, it's making sure we do swear so that we show how authentic we are, right? and we didn't even touch drinking or not drinking last week. That's a big one. We talked about making sure you vote for a certain political party and not the other one from both directions. We talked about attending a certain church or denomination and not others as a way to show if you're really a Christian and if you really get it. We talked about adhering to a certain set of disciplines or church attendance or hours of serving as ways to determine whether or not you are a true Christian. We add these things to Jesus, I think, as a way of feeling superior over those who are doing the things that you aren't doing or as a way of feeling superior to the people that aren't doing the things that you are doing. A Jesus plus philosophy is deceptive because though it sounds really spiritual, it doesn't result in a more spiritually mature person. It's hollow because it promises to bring life, but it only brings death through legalism, and that leads to division in the body of Christ. Because when it's Jesus plus something, we usually end up losing Jesus. When it's Jesus plus something, we usually end up losing Jesus. So today I want to talk more about what Jesus plus nothing means in someone's actual life. To simply be with Jesus, as we talked about last week. Because if we don't talk about what it means practically, before we know it, the Jesus plus thing will become our new t-shirt. We will get t-shirts to say, I am a Jesus plus nothing follower. I'm not just a Jesus follower, right? And we'll get in people's faces and we'll say, you can't confront me on anything. I'm Jesus plus nothing. I'm not Jesus plus your confrontation. Before we know it, we really could make this Jesus plus, Jesus plus nothing. Oh, snap. So open your Bibles to Colossians chapter 2. You know, we're just making our way through verse by verse this great letter to the Colossians, and I just want to read one verse to you. Colossians 2.6, we read this. So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in Him. Verse 7, rooted and built up in Him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness. And so Paul very clearly writes that we are to live our lives in Jesus, rooted and built up in Him. Not in believing the right doctrine, not in church, not even in knowledge of the Scriptures. We are to be built up and rooted in the person of Jesus Christ. The word used for built up in this verse speaks to a foundation that we build everything else on. So the question is, how do we build on the foundation of Jesus? And how do we become rooted in Jesus and not something else? How do we, in fact, sink way down deep into Jesus? Secure in our footings so that what we build on is Jesus and not the Jesus plus stuff. How do we actually do that? Well, Mondays are my day off. And so last Monday, my three-year-old son Isaac, almost three, we spent a lot of time in the backyard primarily pulling weeds. And then we also mowed the lawn. Now, I need to tell you that there's something really wrong with Isaac, and that is he loves pulling weeds, right? I have grown beyond that love of pulling weeds. But the thing was, me and Isaac, on this day, Monday, it was actually really fun because we were just together. And he kept saying really funny things like, Daddy, we're planting weeds, right? And strawberries, he kept saying, which was amazing. And then I noticed something. Whatever I did, he would start to do. So if I grabbed a little shovel to dig out a weed, he would grab a shovel. And if I blew a little snot rocket, you know, right? I remember one time he kind of, and he tried to blow a little snot rocket. And I've now just given you a new vocabulary for something that maybe you did or didn't want to know about. Well, on Monday, Isaac enjoyed simply being with me. And I really enjoyed being with him. And we were working, but, you know, to be honest, it didn't really matter because we were together. And even, to be totally honest, this might be a shock, but I did most of the work. I mean, as he dug his little shovel into the weed. I mean, it was, it didn't work out really all that well. But here's the thing. I really didn't care. Because I loved being with my boy. And he loved being with me. For Isaac, it was a day of being rooted in daddy. of being built up in daddy. For Isaac, he didn't care. He wasn't just pulling weeds. He wasn't just mowing the lawn. He was rooting himself in me. And I'm not kidding. As I was sitting there in the dirt, my talk from last week just kept reverberating in my mind. Be with Jesus. Be with Jesus. Be with Jesus. And then this thought came into my mind. I wish I was with Jesus the way Isaac is with me. But I'm much too focused on pulling the weeds and making sure I get it all right and everything out and mowing the lawn as if doing those things right were the point. And I realize how much I'm embedded in the Jesus Plus philosophy. But on Monday, Isaac was not worried for one second about his grade that he was going to get on pulling the weeds. He wasn't worried that I would notice that he was actually pushing a very small plastic lawnmower that didn't, in fact, cut one blade of grass. He didn't care. Now, sometimes people ask me this question, So how's your spiritual life? How's your walk with God going? And I'm never totally sure how to answer that question. Are you? And so what I end up doing maybe like you is you kind of fumble around and look for some things that you maybe did this last week. Well, I've been reading the scriptures a little bit. Well, I guess I missed Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Okay, I've been doing that. Well, I went to church. Well, I preach at church, so okay, that doesn't really count. So you go through this laundry list of things that includes the amount of time that you've spent doing things, pulling weeds and mowing the lawn. Our answers reveal that we really do subscribe to the Jesus Plus philosophy because none of us would want to say to another Christian especially that, in fact, our relationship with God might be terrible. And we feel like we're faking cheating and lying our way through life. The biggest fear that I think so many of us has is that we're just one slip up away from everybody finding out that we're really faking it. Especially as it relates to our relationship with God. And so Jesus knows that anyway, we know, from Sunday school. And so we're in the penalty box. And so we can't be with Jesus because he doesn't like the way we're pulling weeds. So we avoid being with Jesus and we wither away and we keep trying harder and harder to fake it and hope no one will notice that we're really messed up. And the one person that could help, we avoid. Now if you asked Isaac the question, this question, Isaac, how's your relationship with your daddy? He would look at you funny. He wouldn't say, well, I pulled 213 weeds last Monday and I was pushing a plastic lawnmower, but I think I was doing it really well and really hard, so I think my daddy appreciated that. No, he would just look at you and say, like, Daddy. Because to be rooted in me and his mom is all he knows. To be built up, at this point anyway in life, in me and Mary is all he knows. so what if the secret of a life rooted in jesus really could be learned from a three-year-old why do we make it more complicated than that we make it so theological and our models for being the perfect christian person are these famous people like calvin and luther and speakers and writers. What if we actually had the courage to model our spiritual life after three-year-olds? Well, it seems to me that I remember Jesus saying something about this. Well, these are the things we don't really read from Jesus, or we don't believe them. Matthew 18, two through five, from the message, Jesus said this, I'm telling you once and for all, that unless you return to square one and start over like children, you're not even going to get a look at the kingdom, let alone get in. I mean, like that sentence, we should stop and listen to that. Whoever becomes simple, Jesus says, and elemental again, which we all are striving for, right? To become simple and elemental. We hate that. We hate the words of Jesus. Well, that got a little intense. Whoever becomes simple and elemental again, like this child, will rank high in God's kingdom. So let's get simple and let's get elemental again. When it comes to being with Jesus, what about if we modeled our lives after the life of a three-year-old? It's really strange that we have to break down how to do this, but we do because we've made it so complicated. when we get to those points in our life where we say, okay, time to buckle down. It's time to get my life square with God again. Square one. I'm going to fast for 40 days. What? You haven't fasted for an hour in your life. You know? Square one. Grad school, right? There's something wrong with that. sell everything, and spend all my time with the poor. Well, some of you may be called to that, but it's probably not square one for most of us. So what if the most radical thing you could do was to simply be with Jesus right now? What if that was it? The most radical thing that you could put your hand to is to start learning about what it means to be with Jesus right now. Isaac knows how to do that. We have forgotten. And what if you believed, really from your toes, that everything you needed would flow from that? That every single thing that you needed to know and learn and be about God and about life would flow from that? Well, if we're going to learn from a three-year-old, let's notice some things about three-year-olds. First thing I notice about Isaac is for the most part, He's utterly dependent. If he wants something, he asks for it. And he gets pretty big about that. And we try to help him say please and stuff. He wants juice, he wants pancakes, or to watch a show, or to go outside. He's really out loud about what his needs are. He goes right to me or Mary. And Isaac really is dependent on us. I mean, this is a little morbid, but like if we drove him out to the middle of nowhere and left him, he would die. He wouldn't know how to get back. He's actually and totally dependent. Now, on that word dependent, before we go any further, because I just can hear you all sighing when we say, oh, the faith of a three-year-old. Yes, that is what it's like. Isn't that wonderful? Yes, let's return to that. here's the thing about being dependent you and i we hate it right we we work so hard to not have any needs from anybody we do not like being dependent most of my efforts are about making sure i'm in control not like i don't want to be like a kid uh dave and i kind of nervously laugh with each other about this when it comes to our preaching. We both really kind of write out our talks word for word, pretty much. And there's some really good reasons for that. But sometimes we wonder whether that's at least a little bit about control. Because I don't want to be up here and look stupid. If I say something ridiculous that isn't planned, like I did last night, and you would have had to be there last night. I'm not going to say it again today. Come on Saturday. Okay. So here's the thing. A good, honest question for me, and especially for Dave, to deal with. Just kidding. Just kidding. Don't hiss. Okay. A really good, honest question for me in the area of dependence versus independence would be this. How much of what I do, honestly, is motivated simply by not looking stupid or out of control? How much of what I do is motivated simply by not looking stupid or being out of control? You ever notice how stupid three-year-olds look? No, I guess you haven't, right? But if you let them dress themselves in the morning. What they're going to put on on Christmas morning is pajama bottoms, cowboy boots, and a tank top. They haven't learned that it's important not to look stupid yet. I remember, in fact, when Isaac was about to be born, and then, you know, we're getting clothes, people are giving us clothes, and it was really important to me that Isaac didn't look stupid. So I got the word out that he wasn't, people were not to buy him those cute little onesies with like dogs flying airplanes and stuff like that, you know, and the cute pastel colors. And so people would be like, okay, what do you want me to get him? And I'd be like, I don't know, find something black. Seriously. Now, this is how great my family is. They tried, and a couple of people found sweet things, like this one black onesie that says, I crawl the line. You know, it's so awesome. Johnny Cash stuff. So cool. Here's the thing. Why, why, why would I care? It's at least part about me not looking stupid. Now you might be thinking, what does this have to do with being with Jesus? That's not very spiritual. I mean, that's just kind of the elementary stuff, right? No, that is my spiritual life right there. Right there. That is precisely the times that I need to be with Jesus. Being with Jesus is not lofty and ethereal. In fact, he's right there with me as I'm saying these things about wanting black onesies for my babies. And the question he has for me in that moment is this. wow, what was that about? I'm serious. And we can talk about that. What was that about? When you're up there, Steve, and you're worried about not saying something stupid. Now, I get that, he would say, maybe. But what would happen if you let yourself go a little bit? See, I think this is what Paul means when he writes, just as you receive Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in Jesus, rooted and built up in Jesus, in the everyday, normal, ordinary moments of your life when you're more interested in not looking stupid than you are in becoming like Jesus. Because if I dig down deep enough, I find out that this question, well, what's that about that Jesus might ask me, is about the fact that I am not living in anybody. I feel like I am alone. So I have to be in control because I live my life as if someone has driven me off to the middle of nowhere and left me there. And if I'm not capable and confident, no one will come through for me. See, many of us who've said that we trust Jesus for everything, in fact, don't trust Jesus for much. We really don't. So listen to what Jesus says in John 15, verse 4. These amazing words as an invitation to you and me. Jesus says listen remain in me and I also remain as I also remain in you it's even bigger than being with Jesus it's being in Jesus as Jesus is in you then he says no branch can bear fruit by itself it must remain in the vine that sounds so obvious right but it must have been happening people must have been trying to do things on their own. Radical thought that people would actually try to do that back then, but apparently people were as we do now. Jesus says, I am the vine. I am the source of life. You're the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit, but apart from me, you can do nothing. Apart from me, you can do nothing. Now, that last sentence is not true, right? Because I can do a lot of things on my own. In fact, most of my life is a biography of that. I can do all things on my own if I want to. So the question that I found helpful in this area is this. What are the areas in my life where I am intentionally allowing my competency to run out so that I might actually need Jesus? What are the areas of my life where I'm intentionally moving toward I can't do this unless Jesus shows up so that I'll know that I need to be in Jesus. I had a conversation this last week that I knew was going to require more than just my ability to talk well or to say a strong thing or hear a hard thing. I had to trust in this conversation that if anything of any significance was going to happen, it was going to have to be because I was remaining in Jesus and remembering that he was remaining in me, not because I said it right. Because what I believe about Jesus, if I believe that Jesus really remains in me, then I can show up to a hard conversation and rest. I'll have to say it still, but I can rest that whatever happens will be because the Spirit of God is working and it doesn't have to be just me. And that's what gives me confidence when I choose to put myself in situations where my competency is not going to be enough. St. Ignatius said this amazing sentence. He said, there are very few people who realize what God would make of them if they abandoned themselves into his hands and let themselves be formed by his grace. There are very few of us that realize what God would make of us, you guys, If we had the courage to abandon ourselves into his hands and let themselves be formed by his grace, what a childish thing to do. We don't want to be childish, so we do it on our own. And we wither away like a branch that's been snapped off the vine. So I want to give you some helpful and practical ways of being with Jesus, of remaining in Jesus, of abandoning yourself into his hands, to move more towards the childish dependence and less towards independence. But these are just suggestions. I really think it's very important that each person needs to find their unique way to be with Jesus that is enjoyable, repeatable, and realistic to your life. Every person needs to find their way of being with Jesus. That's enjoyable, repeatable, and realistic to their lives. So first suggestion. As often as I can remember it, I start my days with a picture of me and Jesus. Now, this picture is kind of cheesy. It's a little weird, but it's mine. And the picture is me and Jesus sitting in a pickup truck on the top of this hill, overlooking the ocean. And we're just sitting before we haven't moved anywhere, and he's looking at me mostly, and he has this carefree look on his face. And the picture communicates, whatever it is that you're going to do today, Steve, we're doing it together. We're rolling through life together. I'm not going anywhere. I'm with you throughout your day. And the ocean. I grew up near the ocean, so I've always associated the expansiveness of the ocean with freedom. And the words in the scriptures, when God talks about bringing you into a big and spacious place, and the rhythm of the waves coming in and sets reminds me of breathing. And so as I make my way through my day, whether it's easy or hard, very often Jesus will bring this picture back into my mind that in the end it's me and him together. In the end, whether I'm overwhelmed by my kids or having a hard conversation or annoyed because I'm doing the dishes or laughing at a co-worker, at the fundamental core, it's me and Jesus. And he is not going anywhere. He's with me. So what would a picture look like for you? This woman come up to me last night and said, my picture is I have this kind of dress on and I'm a little girl and I'm running through an open field and there Jesus is waiting for me. It's just me and him. What's your picture that communicates you with Jesus? Be a good thing to think about. Second suggestion is this, that you would take a sentence from Jesus into your day with you. Now, I think even those of us who really try to immerse ourselves in the scriptures, which is a really good thing to do. We think somehow we gotta read like four chapters at a time. So what you do is you start reading and then your mind goes to laundry lists and grocery, you know, and then you go back and then you feel guilty and ah, you know, and ah. But you're trying to digest like 17 million nuggets of wisdom and you end up getting nothing. So my suggestion is, don't try four chapters. Try one sentence from Jesus to bring with you throughout the day. Here are some ones that have helped me. When Jesus says, remain in me and I will remain in you. Just take that through the day. Write it on a card so that you can see it. Remain in me and I will remain in you. And just let that breathe in and breathe out. It will become part of how you think. If you breathe it in and breathe it out. Remain in me and I will remain in you. As a father has loved me, here's another one, as a father has loved me, so have I loved you. The perfect love from the father to the son is the love that the son has for you. He loves being with you in your little plastic lawnmower that doesn't do much. Another one, my command is this, love each other as I have loved you. So when I get into a little conversation in my mind with someone who I'm mad at, you know what I'm talking about? Where I say their stuff that inflames me, and then I say stuff back which nails them right to the wall and proves a point in my mind, and then I feel all proud of that. Sometimes this sentence comes back to me. Wait a minute. Is that how I loved you? No. So love each other as I've loved you. Another one. You didn't choose me, Jesus says, but I chose you. Man, that's good news. We're not together because, like, you picked me. I mean, I'm glad you picked me, Jesus is saying. But I chose you first. I pursued you. I went after you. I am wild about you. I am in you. I am with you. And I am not leaving you. ever. That's Jesus. So let that sentence, and I'll let it in. You are the salt of the earth, another one, and the light of the world. You are the salt of the earth and the light of the world. So when I start getting cynical, I'm reminded, wait a minute, salt isn't cynical. Light isn't cynical. Salt preserves society. Light warms society and reveals darkness so that hope can come in. Lastly, Jesus says, I will guide you into all truth. I will guide you into what you need to know. So, take a sentence with you throughout the day and let it, that's meditation. Don't get freaked out by that word. All it means is letting a truth from Jesus get in you so that it affects how you think. Third suggestion. At the end of the day, you could end your day with two simple questions. We call it the examen. Ignatius came up with it. And it's just two opposing questions like, what was I most grateful for today or what was I least grateful for? Ignatius called these consolations, things that you would be grateful for or happy about or thankful for. And then desolations, things that you are sorrowful about. You can pick whatever questions are most helpful, but let this be a daily prayer, a check-in with you and Jesus. When did I feel most with Jesus today? Consolation. When did I feel most alone today? Desolation. When was I most alive today? When was I most drained? When was I most patient today? When was I least patient? What brought me joy today and what brought me sadness? These are ways in which you can journal it out, pray it out, talk it through with another person. it's just a way of checking in and saying how am I doing today last Monday after spending the whole day with Isaac I noticed some things about him what I noticed was he felt secure and he was content he wasn't thinking about what he was going to do later on he felt free even on that day to run away from me and check out you know the neighbor's lawn that was being mowed at the time and then he would come back and I'd be like hey buddy and he you know it was it was incredible and when we were done he looked at me and said this amazing sentence. He said, Daddy, we have more weeds to pull. Which was true. But also it was his way of saying, Daddy, let's do this again. Because this is my favorite thing to do. And I really think this is what being with Jesus can be like. not ethereal and really spiritual. It's down and dirty in your life and your work of pulling weeds and mowing the lawn and raising your kids and making your mortgage payment and doing the dishes and having the hard conversations. There's a way of being with Jesus that can transform your ordinary life into an abundant one no matter what it's like. And if that sounds idealistic, it is. But it's the best idea that I have ever come across. because I really can live my ordinary life with Jesus, learning to be more and more childish, more and more dependent on him and less and less on my own capability. And this does not mean life is easy. I think life will be hard and I'll still have moments of struggle alongside my moments of joy and I'll sometimes care way much more about not looking stupid than I do about being with Jesus and becoming a person who loves him more and more. but when I realize those things I can return back to the center at the core of who I am and I will always find Jesus there no matter how far I've run away because Jesus has promised me that he will remain in me in me and that is amazing news I want to leave you with St. Ignatius' quote again as a benediction. So please stand for the benediction. There are very few people who realize what God would make of them if they abandoned themselves into his hands and let themselves be formed by his grace. So church of the open door, leave this place today more childish, more dependent, and more in love with the one that has promised to be in you forever. Amen? Happy Mother's Day. Go in peace, everybody. you
