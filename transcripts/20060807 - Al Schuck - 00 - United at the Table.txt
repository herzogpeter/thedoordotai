Good evening. Over the course of the last couple weeks, we've been looking at the first letter that the Apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthian church. While Paul talks with them about a number of controversial and often divisive issues, we've been focusing on the main issue that Paul wanted to communicate, that being the need for unity within the church, within the body of Christ. We talked openly and honestly about the similarities between the Corinthian church and the church today, both the Christian church in general and Church of the Open Door specifically. We identified that our problem is the same as their problem. That problem being, in fact, the reason why Paul wrote the Corinthians in the first place, that oftentimes we do not love others very well. And the truth is, is oftentimes the reason we don't love them well is because we care more about ourselves and our needs than we care about others. Two weeks ago, we talked about the necessity of owning our lack of love, our sin, both corporately and individually, and taking any necessary steps to bring about unity in the church. Last week, we talked about two ways that we can begin to move towards being a more unified body. These two ways were laid out for us beautifully by the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter 12. The first being that for us to become a more unified body, and then for us to have a unifying effect on the larger body of Christ, and ultimately for us to have an impact for the kingdom of God unifying this world, we must first come to respect, value, and actually delight in our differences. The second thing is that we need to humble ourselves, and lay down our own individual needs, wants, and agendas for the sake of the whole. I expressed that this felt overwhelming to me. With all the individuals and all the differences among us, differences of opinions, differences of likes and dislikes, differences of ministry passions and thoughts about how things should or shouldn't be done, and differences of beliefs and practices and theology and all that stuff, how will we ever be united as one? Well, Paul's word to them is a word for us as well. Paul says that for that to happen, for us to truly be that kind of body, we're going to have to learn to love each other. In the first three verses of 1 Corinthians chapter 13, Paul makes some powerful statements concerning what we do and what really matters. Basically, Paul says that if there are a lot of good things to do with your life, but if those are done, if those aren't done out of love, they mean nothing. He doesn't say that they don't mean quite as much. He says they mean nothing. If you do it without love, it doesn't count. This is a big deal. We have to get this right because there is a day when God will sift away and sift through everything we've done and the only things that matter, the only things that last, are the things done out of love. In a book I recently read, the author said it this way. if you want a good litmus test for spiritual growth, simply examine the nature and quality of your relationships. Are you more loving, more compassionate, more patient, more understanding, more caring, more giving, and more forgiving than you were a year ago? You see, who we are is what really matters. And if that's true, then you need to know that the most important thing you bring to this body of believers is not your time, your talents, or your money. While those things are good and needed, the most important thing you bring, and I bring to this body, is a love for others. And so, you were given a homework assignment. I'd like you to raise your hand at this time if you did that. No, just kidding, don't do that. You were asked to read 1 Corinthians three different times in three different ways. First, by inserting your name in there and seeing what it would look like for you to be a person who is loving. Second, I asked you to insert Church of the Open Door in there, our name in there, to get a picture of what it would look like for us as a church to be a loving church. And while I think it's meaningful and helpful for us to read it in those two ways, it's the third way that I told you to read it that gets me the most excited. And it actually gives me hope. and I think it is the starting point for us and it's what this table is about and it's what this weekend is about. The third way I ask you to read it was by reading the way that love is described in 1 Corinthians 13 and reading it knowing that this is the perfect love of God and the way that he has perfectly loved you. Is what Jesus, you see, in my mind, what we've come to realize in our lives and what we talk about around here is that if you and I truly experience and encounter the love of God, we will be changed. It'll change us. It's what Jesus said when he said, now I'm giving you a new commandment. Love each other. Just as I loved you, you should love each other. It's like Jesus was saying, once you've experienced my love, you should love each other that way. Nothing else would make sense but to love each other that way. He simply is asking us to love each other as we have been loved. Now that may sound easy and it's not. For that to happen we're going to have to learn how to love and we're going to have to grow in love. But he does give us a starting place and that is the way that I have loved you. So the question for you tonight is this, how has he loved you? How is it that he's loved you? I want us to wonder today, just for a little bit in the time we have together, I want to wonder about his love for you, his love for me, his love for us, as it is described here in 1 Corinthians 13. You see, it says in 1 John that God is love. and if God is love, then God is perfectly what is described here in 1 Corinthians 13. What we read here is how he has treated us and how he has been in relationship with us. And understand that if that is true, then this is by far the best news you and I will ever hear. In the time we have, I want to just wonder just about a few of these descriptives. So enter into this with me. if you want to close your eyes you can do that just picture your life and think about God and his love for you and it will call things out of us for each other how good is it for you to know that God is patient with you we get fed up with ourselves, we get fed up with other people sometimes we wonder if we will ever get our act together we are very impatient with ourselves. How good is it tonight for you to sit here knowing that your God is patient with you? That your God isn't in a hurry? That he understands and he will stick with you? He's a patient God. How good is it for you to know that your God is a kind God? Others may not be kind with us and quite often we may not be kind with ourselves. But as you're sitting here tonight, you need to know your God, he's a kind God. And his heart for you is overflowing with kindness. Kindness at its deepest level is about how you feel when you are in a relationship with someone else, how you feel about yourself. And when you really are with God, you will be accepted. and you'll feel it. You will know that he values you, that he delights in you. How good is it tonight to know that your God is a kind God and his heart toward you is filled with loving kindness. It says that love is not self-seeking. Philippians 2 says that we are to have the same way in us that was also in Christ Jesus. who although he was God, he had it all. And yet he emptied himself. He humbled himself. Even to the point of dying a humiliating death on the cross for you, for us. How good is it tonight to know that our God was not a self-seeking God? That our God didn't have a me-first attitude? But he emptied himself. and humbled himself out of love for us. That's our God. Wonder with me. How good is it to you tonight to know that your God is not easily angered? That your God doesn't fly off the handle and lose his temper with you? He doesn't get angry with you easily. It would take so much for him to lose his temper. He's such a loving God. He doesn't get angry. He isn't provoked by you. In all of your stuff, where you're like, he's got to be so upset with me. He's not. Our God is not an angry God. How good is that for you to know that tonight? How good is it tonight for us to know that it says that love keeps no record of wrongs? Anybody else here really glad that God keeps no record of wrongs? That as far as the east is from the west is how far he's removed our sin from us. And it says that he'll remember our sin no more. It's like, oh God, who, if you kept a record of wrongs, who among us would have a chance to survive if he kept a record of wrongs? But our God doesn't. how good is it tonight to know that God does not delight in evil but rejoices in the truth when there is evil at your door and it comes walking into your life he doesn't delight in that he's right there with you and he feels your pain when things are going bad and your world seems to be imploding and it feels like you're just getting taken over by evil he doesn't delight in that not your God your God is with you and he feels your pain how good is it tonight for us to know that our God is a God who bears all things that he's able to put up with a lot that he can handle our failures and our insecurities that when things in our life get so heavy and we feel like we're gonna be crushed he bears all things it's not too heavy for him he can bear it how good is it tonight to know that your God is a God who believes all and hopes all that when we're ready to give up on ourselves he still believes when we feel like we've made such a mess that we'll never be able to recover that we'll never be able to put the pieces back together again and he hasn't given up on us. He still believes. Even if we feel like there is no hope, he has incredibly high hopes for us. He has not lost hope in what we can become. How good is it tonight to know at this moment that our God is a God that endures all, that our God is a God who will never leave us or forsake us, but will stick with us, Though we fail over and over and over again, our God will endure all with us. That's really good news. It says that love never fails. What's it feel like tonight to know that your God doesn't fail? It may feel like it, but the love that your God has for you will never end. It will never be exhausted. It'll never quit. It'll never stop. It will never, ever fail. But it's so easy to forget what kind of God we have. And that's why symbol is so important. And that's why we come to this table. This table is a reminder. It's shouting to us, please, remember my love for you. Remember that I will never leave you. Remember that I'm patient and I'm kind. And when you don't believe in yourself, I still believe in you. Our God is a God that is setting the pattern for us of how we are to love one another. And so we come to the table together as one body. It says, on the night he was betrayed, he took the bread and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, this is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me. In the same way, after supper, he took the cup, saying, This cup is the new covenant of my blood. Do this whenever you drink of it, remembrance of me. For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. For we ought to examine ourselves before we eat of the bread and drink the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. And so, we want to recognize each other tonight. And that affects how we're going to do communion this weekend. We're actually going to sit at these tables, and there's a few tables around, and we're going to be in a circle, and we're going to look into each other's eyes, and we're going to break bread together as one. You see, when we taste the amazing love of God, we cannot help but recognize that there are other people here who have tasted the amazing love of God. And his love for you is the same as it is for me. Whether we realize it or not, we are one. And now we have to enter into it. And the table is a logical place for us to come together. It only makes sense. For it is here that we are reminded that we all come the same way. We are all broken, we are all wounded, we're all needy, and our God is sufficient because his love never fails. I love what Henry Nouwen says. We are unified by our common weaknesses, our common failures, our common disappointments, and our common inconsistencies. And that sums it up for me. There are no superstars to sit at the head of the table, And there are no second-class citizens at the table. In fact, tonight, there's not even a head at the table to sit at. It's a round table, which puts the focus on the only one who is worthy of the focus, and that is the body and the blood of our Lord. So we come to the table tonight, and as we do, I want us to slow down and let in the reality of God's deep love for you and the reality that he is here, and he invites us to come to the table as one with that same deep love in our hearts for one another. Because the fact is, is you and I will never ever be asked to be more patient with someone else than God has been with us. And you and I will never ever be asked to be and show more kindness to someone else than our God has shown to us. And we will never ask, no matter how bad it gets, we will never ask to be one who can endure more than he's endured on our behalf. I'll never be asked to give more grace away than I've been given. And no matter how bad it is, I'll never be asked to forgive someone more than I've been forgiven. We come to this table grateful and willing to enter into a oneness with each other. and if we can't come together here in this sacred place at this sacred time where God himself unconditionally loves us this is our starting place let's pray together God we come tonight as grateful people So grateful that you're a God who is patient with us And kind to us God that you still hope in us and believe in us God that you don't keep a record of our wrongs we don't have to be afraid of you that you delight in us and call us your children and you smile upon us God I pray that your love would affect us and I pray that we would indeed love as we've been loved teach us Lord teach us to love grow that in us Holy Spirit I pray tonight we come to your table and we enter into the mystery that you already have made happen and that is that we are your body one body unified together and we say yes to that the whole mystery about it we say yes to it and we enter in thank you Lord for making us one and for giving us all the gift of your amazing love Amen Well as I mentioned this is a different weekend filled with
