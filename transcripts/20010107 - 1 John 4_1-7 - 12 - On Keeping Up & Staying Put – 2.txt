Last week in our dealing with the first seven verses of 1 John chapter 4, in the context of New Year's reflection, I asserted that while in John's day, there were many false prophets. Chapter 4 verse 1 made that clear that today there are many more. That we are living in a day of unprecedented change, what Leonard Sweet referred to as a tsunami of change, a tidal wave that is radically changing the topography of our culture and world economically, technologically, scientifically, and spiritually, all of which raises this question we dealt with last week. In what ways do we as God's people in this rapidly changing culture need to keep up with the changes in the culture? And in what ways do we need to stay put? Well, 1 John 4 was quite helpful to us in identifying ways that we as God's people in this rapid change context need to stay put. But what about keeping up? Can we keep up? Can we maintain our relevance in this radically changing world? Can we keep the pace? Are we going to be as a people quick enough? Are we going to be smart enough, informed enough, energetic enough? Because keeping up requires all those things, doesn't it? It sure seems to me that it requires energy and quickness and intelligence and information. It only stands to reason in my mind that if things are moving faster and faster, we have to keep up, we have to go faster and faster, don't we? And forget about we. Can we keep up? What about me? The personal question I have to face, so do you, is am I fast enough? Am I quick enough? Am I smart enough? Bright enough? gifted, resilient enough to keep up, and not with just the changes in the culture for the sake of the kingdom, as lofty and as important as that is. Sometimes it gets even closer to home in my quiet times of thought and contemplation. I want to know if I can keep up just with life. The demands of my job, your job, with the demands of the marriage, the family, maybe for you at school or bills that you were able to pay last month and maybe even last week, but when you project out into the future, it's really a frightening thought. Am I going to be able to keep up? Am I fast enough, bright enough, energetic enough? Can I keep up? Did you ever wonder about that? What I decided to do this morning as we prepare our hearts for the table is to share with you a time in my life, not too long ago, when it felt like the answer to that question, can I keep up, was no. I don't think I can. And how in the middle of that little crisis feeling, if you will, God gave to me what I believe now is a word from him that I have been kind of living in and doing my best to unpack ever since. It came in the context of a conference that I was attending about seven months ago along with a pretty significant number of our own staff here from Open Door. It was in Colorado. The conference was entitled Exploring Off the Map. And consistent with the title, the purpose of the conference was to do just that, explore off the map. Uncharted territory. It's a whole new world. We needed to acknowledge that. It was no longer a time to play it safe. We needed to do everything a different way, and we needed to start doing all that now. The speakers were all very much like the people I was quoting in my sermon last week as I was kind of putting you in touch with the changes in our culture. There were futurists and global consultants putting us in touch with not only the changes in our culture, but with the speed those changes were happening at and the alarm bell that was being rung, and I think appropriately so, was that the church needed to be aware of these things if it wanted to maintain its relevance. The very first night of the conference, one of the speakers said this, and the reason I remember what he said was I wrote it down in my journal. I write things in my journal for various reasons, sometimes because they're truth, and I want to go back and be able to remember that truth that sometimes I'll forget. Sometimes it's because of positive things that move me. But sometimes I write things in my journal because they irritate me, and I want to maybe think about it later as to figuring out why it irritated me. I wrote this down because it irritated me. Here's what he said, and you might even wonder a little bit, Why did that irritate you? Listen to what he said. Let us leave the safe places to begin a journey to a land never known to the glory of God. That's not irritating. That's inspiring. Leave the safe places. Begin the journey. Land never known to the glory of God. Those are all little buttons that go, wow, yes, hallelujah. You can even maybe on certain Sundays envision me saying something like that. Well, on this particular day, it wasn't inspiring. It was irritating. On a different day, it might have been inspiring. But on this day, I was tired, very tired, bone tired. And the word in his little declaration that found my tiredness and irritated me was the word begin. Let us leave the safe places and begin the journey. And here's how that little word snapped into and found my cynical, sarcastic, tired little brain. Here's what I heard him, here's my response to it. So now we're going to begin. Finally today, we're going to start leaving the safe places and beginning the journey. Till now, you haven't been anywhere. You haven't done anything. You haven't gone anywhere. Today we start, begin a journey off the map. Off the map. Fine. We're going to start today going off the map. I'm sitting there listening to this. I'm going, I'm already off the map. Man, I'm looking for the map. There's a map? today we start let me ask you a question how do you usually feel at the beginning of a journey you know the first day of your your family trip to california before you've actually gone anywhere well i don't know how you feel but if it's a vacation kind of thing and i've been looking forward to it i feel fresh i'm excited i'm full of anticipation the sights and sounds i'm thinking about the mountains and the streams and And maybe even on the front end of the trip, I've got all sorts of ideas about how I'm going to want to get off the beaten path and go through the small towns and take my time and go slow. I'm even looking forward to the desert. I know there's a desert I'm going to have to cross. People have told me about it. I've never been there, but I know it's, I've heard sermons about the desert. And I'm even, I'll handle the desert. I've got energy for the desert. Anything is possible at the beginning of the trip when you haven't actually gone anywhere. Lots of energy, but four days later in a car full of kids in the middle of Nevada, and the air conditioning's on the blink. I thought we fixed that thing. I'm still headed for California. I'm not bailing on the trip. I'm still gonna do the work. I'm still gonna stick with the task, but I'm not feeling quite so frisky. Well, I arrived at this conference in Colorado in the middle of Nevada, and I couldn't find much energy, and I didn't feel fresh. And what I was hearing the speakers at this conference say was this. Now we're going to start the trip. We're going to leave the safe places and begin the journey. Begin the journey. And something inside of me quietly said, begin the journey. Well, you can begin the journey without me. Because I can't keep up. Now, Believe it or not, I know this is unbelievable, but I do get grumpy at times. And I find this little kid in me going, I ain't going, I ain't going, you can't make me go. That kind of stuff happens to me. It's not just totally out of the realm of my whole life existence. But when I do respond that way, I usually know enough about myself to know that something's up. What's going on? I went up to my room that night, pulled out my Bible, my journal, began to pray. I don't know what you vision my praying at a time like that to look like, but it's not very quiet or passive. I pace and talk loudly, and it's more like a wrestling match than what you might think prayer looks like. In the middle of that whole thing, God gave me what I think indeed was a word. It came out of left field, as words from God often do. An errant thought is what I thought it was at the beginning, because in the middle of this storm in my mind, and quite frankly, some irritation and anger at the demands I was feeling were being put on me. a sermon that I had recently preached popped into my brain. I'm going, what are you thinking about this for? The sermon was in the context of Revelation chapter 11 where John was told by the Spirit of God to mark off the temple. Well, that's very helpful. What does that mean? Well, in that passage God by His Spirit was giving to John some advice as to how he might survive his ministry of the Word in the context of significant resistance. And I don't expect you to remember this. I had to go back myself and look at Revelation 10. And in Revelation 10, God was saying to John, I'm going to give you the ministry of the word. And the word of God is going to taste sweet in your mouth, but it's going to be bitter in your stomach. Meaning this, you would love the word, and the word you're going to get, and the word you're going to give is a good word, it is truth. But the bitterness in the stomach is that it is going to face, at times, significant resistance. Not everyone is going to respond to this. And you're going to pay a price for this whole thing. And the advice to John in light of that, chapter 11, verse 1 was this, John, take a measuring rod and mark off the temple if you want to survive this. Mark off the temple. What is a temple? What does that mean? Well, the word for temple there is the Greek word naos. The naos of God is the dwelling place of God. Mark off, find, identify in your own mind the dwelling place of God, the sanctuary of God where the presence resides. John, here's the word, identify, mark off that place. And that place, that dwelling place, the presence of God place, will be in the midst of significant resistance. It'll be your safe place. That place will be your holy place, your quiet place. So mark off the naos. But then in the very next verse, God says a strange thing, but don't include the outer court. Not that, just the naos, The inner court. Leave out the outer court. Now, none of that makes any sense unless you know something about the temple. And I do remember some things about the temple in the Old Testament. And that the temple physically, its structure had several courts. There was what was called the outer court. The courtyard of the Gentiles. Inside of that was another courtyard where only Jews went. Inside of that only men went. Inside of that only priests went. And then you got to the core of it where there was the Holy of Holies. The neos of God. The presence of God residing there and my mind began to expand a little more broadly seeing the courtyard of the Gentiles as being kind of in a metaphor the place where life happens. You see out in the courtyard of the Gentiles at the outer court place is everything and everyone. Gentiles are in the outer court. Gentiles being maybe a symbol of unbelieving world. The Jews are in the outer court. The Jews at that time being a symbol of God's people, the believing contingent of life. Men are there, women are there, children, animals are there, commerce is there, ripoffs are there, everything that's unfair is there, life is there, life is just happening in the outer court, the courtyard of the Gentiles. Still part of the temple, but it's the outer court. Picture of the temple, as you see there's an outer court, but then as inner court is the holy place, the picture of the whole temple, including the outer court is that the whole temple is really very big. The inner court, the naos, the presence of God place is not so big. The word to John was mark that off. Find, identify that inner place, that holy place, not the outer court. Leave that out for now. Identify and mark off where God by His Spirit resides. And John, this is so critical for you. That's your safe place. In the middle of life that isn't safe, that's your quiet place. That's your holy place. And measuring that off, identifying that and marking it off from the outer court, separating it out from the outer court is how you will survive. As I sat in my hotel room reflecting on all these things, wondering why that thought even came into my mind, reflecting on the temple in particular, what dawned on me as the picture was clear of the physical structure of the temple was this, that in the new covenant, the temple is no longer a physical structure. The temple in the new covenant is no longer a building of brick and mortar, but it is now a flesh and blood thing, for I am the temple and we are the temple. 1 Corinthians 3.16, 2 Corinthians 6.16, you are the dwelling place of God. And as that reality began to dawn on me, I began to wonder. I wonder, Lord, if the temple that you say I am, that you say we are, is anything at all like the temple that physically was. When it was brick and mortar, I wonder if I am kind of like that temple. In other words, I wonder if I have an outer court. The outer court, where all of life goes on. It's still part of the temple because it's still part of my life. It's part of who I am, but in the outer court of my life, all of the noise is there, all of the activity. The unbelieving world is there. The believing world is there. The demands on my life are there, and all of my questions about whether I can keep up or not are there in the outer court. Everything and everyone is there in the outer court, and quite frankly, that is where I have to do my life, and that's where you have to do your life as well. You have to show up there kind of every day. It's where I do my marriage. And then in the context of this image that was beginning to become a little clearer, I felt like the word from God came to me. The word was this, David, if you hope to survive in the outer court, in the life that I've called you to, and not just survive there, but thrive there, in this particular time of history that is changing rapidly, you need to do what John did. You need to measure off the neos. You need to mark it off. You need to identify and find inside of yourself the quiet place where God resides, the holy place, the safe place, the presence of God's place. You are the temple of God. Being part of this big temple you have in you, around you, it's part of your life, the outer court where life is. But there is inside of you this neos of God. You need to mark that off. You need to find and identify it. Now, among the gifts God gave me in all of that was this realization. Maybe the key to keeping up in this rapidly changing culture and the demands that were kind of just coming from every direction and overwhelming, maybe the key to that whole thing was not so much in kicking it up a notch and going faster. Every instinct I have says that is how you keep up. I mean, just the whole thing of keeping up means something's moving. If you're going to keep up with something that's moving, you have to what? move. And you have to move as fast as that is moving. But as this word was coming to me, what we're doing is very hard to penetrate of it, very thick in my thinking, especially when it comes to my instincts for survival. I want you to do something, Dave, that's going to go against your instincts for survival. You think you're supposed to kick it up a notch. I'm calling you to kick it down a notch. And not go faster, but go slower. Indeed, that may be the key to keeping up. To not get louder, but to get quieter. To not just speak and to solve, but to listen and to drink in the life of God. So mark off the naos. Identify it. Find it. It's in you. But not the outer court. Separate it off from life. The whole temple? The whole temple, all of your life, including the inner, really big. All of life. Is there the neos of God? The quiet, safe, holy presence of God? Place not so big. All of which led to a prayer that I have been praying ever since. And it's a prayer that I would commend to you. It was almost like God was saying to me, David, I want you to mark off the neos. And when the picture came clear to what that meant, God inside of me, he is in me. I know that holy of holies is in me. Then I came up with a request. Okay, if you want me to mark it off, here's what I want you to do. I want you to expand it. I want you to enlarge it. Expand in me the holy place. Expand in me the quiet, safe presence of God place. And I began to write in my journal just about every day and pray two or three times a day, Even at times when it didn't feel particularly potent. God, expand the neos. Expand the neos. If I'm going to keep up, one of the things I'm absolutely convinced of is I need a bigger quiet place. I need a bigger holy place. I need a bigger inside of me safe place where I can go and find you. I need a bigger presence of God place. So Father, teach me the disciplines of solitude and quiet and listening and prayer while every instinct of mine is to go faster and faster. The gifts you give, the gifts. See, all of a sudden now this feeling I had of I can't keep up and I was even irritated, all of a sudden it became a gift because he got me so tired that I knew I couldn't keep up. It's a gift. I need those disciplines in my life so I can hear your voice and know your heart and speak your truth because if I don't get a bigger quiet place I can't keep up expand the neos today as we come to the table I would like to commend that prayer to you I'd like to invite you into that prayer one of the reasons I feel pretty confident in doing that with you is one I think it's consistent with scripture one of the prayers that Paul prayed in fact after this I get these weird ideas by myself in hotel rooms and I got to check them out later because it just could be this weird idea you get when you're alone because I'm weird but Paul had an incredible prayer in Ephesians he said my prayer among other things is this that Christ would settle down would dwell in your heart through faith. That Christ would dwell in your heart through faith. And the word dwell means to settle down and be in home. That he would enlarge himself inside of you. That really liberated me to pray this. The other reason I feel strong or good about commending the prayer to you is that it's a very simple prayer. It doesn't come to God even knowing necessarily how this is gonna happen. It's just coming to God and saying, God, this is what I need. This is what I want. In the light of my feelings sometimes of not being able to keep up. In the chaos and the change, that is going in my family, in my marriage, in my life. I need you to get bigger inside of me. And I'm going to be like the widow who knocks on the door and just keeps on asking and keeps on asking. And even when I feel like it's not happening and I'm probably not doing it right, I'm just going to keep on asking for God to do this. Now, I am aware that this analogy might not work for all of you. Maybe this image of an expanded naos in the temple that you are works for you. Maybe it doesn't. If it doesn't, then maybe this will work. Let's come to the table this morning to partake of the bread and the cup, which speaks to us of Christ and how he made access to the Father possible. I would like you to see the table this way. In the face of all your questions, maybe about whether you can keep up or not. In the face of all your fears, disappointments, and demands on your life and time that are coming from all sorts of different directions. I do not know if this analogy of the naos needing to get bigger works for you. Here is what I know for sure about you. Though, you need a safe place. You need a quiet place. You need a holy presence of God place. You need a healing place. Well, here it is. At the table. So come and eat. Come and partake and be with him. Because if you don't find in him a quiet place, if you don't find in him your safe place, your healing place, your presence place, you know what I'm pretty sure about you? Here's what I'm pretty sure about. You can't keep up. You can't keep up. But in the bread and in the wine and in everything that they symbolize relative to the life and God and the sustenance I need, there is my quiet, holy, safe, presence, healing place. Come and eat. I'm going to ask the stewards to come and take their place in front. We will serve them first. I have just some words of instruction I'll give down here and then we'll begin. just a couple words of explanation as to what we're doing so that you can enter in fully especially if you're visiting with us you're going to see three things and hopefully participate in all three of them in one way or another, going on at one time. The first and most obvious will be the partaking of the elements. And the way we do it here is to ask you to move from where you are and come to a station. There'll be stations and people ready to serve you in various places throughout the gymnasium. And I just encourage you to go to the place that's most convenient for you. The second thing that's going on is that you'll notice on both sides of the stage, People will just be standing there, and you'll probably notice just kind of a steady stream of people coming to them. And what they're doing is praying for people. And as we just move through this time, and the Spirit of God ministers to your heart and calls things out of you, maybe makes you aware of things that you're not even thinking about right now. You'll feel this prompting, oh, I wish there was somebody to pray for me right now for healing or direction, or I need to repent of something. And just come, and you'll be among people who are doing the same. Lines may form and just wait and we'll get to you. The third thing that's going to be going on through all of it is worship. We're going to stand in just a few moments and bathe the whole thing in worship. And as we lift our hearts to God and some of us in places where it's real easy today to do and others of you are really difficult to pray or to praise, but we're going to bathe it in that. Three things, the worship, the table, and the prayer will be happening. And we just invite you, especially those of you who know Jesus, to come and take and remember where your safe place is, where your holy, where your quiet place is, what you need to survive to keep up, if you will. A little word of instruction, you'll see the bread and then someone will be holding the cup. We'll just ask you to take the bread and dip it in the cup and that's how we'll partake. Paul says it this way in the book of 1 Corinthians that the night in which Jesus was betrayed, he took bread and he broke the bread and he said, this bread is the new covenant. This is my body which is broken for you. Take and eat in remembrance of me. And then he took the cup in the same way also after supper, saying, this cup is the new covenant in my blood. Take and drink. As often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. Let's pray over these elements. Father, we thank you and praise you for the working of your spirit among us I thank you that you are our bread and you are our wine. You are our safe place. You are our quiet place. You are the presence we need in our life in order to live this life that pulls us in so many different directions. Help us as your people at deeper and deeper levels, not just to speed up, but to slow down. Not just to always talk, but to learn to listen. And at this table, may we find these places of quiet, of safety, of healing, of your very presence. We ask your life's power to be released among us as we would honor and bless your table. In Jesus' name, amen.
