1 Corinthians chapter 7 verse 8 through 16. I want you to know that I'm going to be preaching and teaching word by word those verses, but in order to even grasp the fullness of those verses, we are going to be hanging on to and bouncing into all the way into the verses through verse 40 of this chapter. You're going to see why that's important later. The issue at hand in this particular text is the issue of divorce and remarriage. I can't think of anything more timely. I can't think of anything more pertinent and appropriate for our day, for our age. I can't think of anything more appropriate for even our people. This issue is invading and has invaded us as believers. I cannot remember being as obsessed by a sermon in all my life. There are things that move me deeply and I care a lot about. but in terms of studying and seeking God and becoming more and more aware this week of the incredible kinds of disagreement there is even among believers on this issue I am looking forward tonight for a night of sleep let me just put it that way it has been an obsession I feel that it's been a holy obsession I feel that God has put me through some real kinds of tensions in order to really wade through all the different things we hear to try to get back to what the word of God says so I would ask you to pray for me I know that many of you have been as you've known that I was going to deal with this but continue to do so even as we get into this let's read the text and then begin but I say to the unmarried and to the widows that it is a good thing for them to even for it is a good thing for them if they remain even as I he was single. But if they do not have self-control, let them marry, for it is better to marry than it is to burn. But to the married I give instructions, not I, but the Lord, that the wife should not leave her husband. But if she does leave, let her remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband, and that the husband should not send his wife away. But to the rest I say, I say, not the Lord, that if a brother has a wife who is an unbeliever and she consents to live with him, let him not send her away. And a woman who has an unbelieving husband and he consents to live with her, let her not send her husband away. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband. For otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy. They're not unclean. Yet if the believing one leaves, let him leave. The brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases. But God has called us to peace. For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife? Let's stop right there and pray. Father, we are taking this extremely seriously. I feel like it is your spirit that is bringing the seriousness to it. Lord Jesus, I am, I believe through my study and through what you have led me to in a position where I need to take a stand. Everyone here has a right to know just exactly where we're at with this, but God, I pray that it would not be so much what I think as what you do indeed think, what Paul indeed thinks. I am also aware of the fact that there is no way, given the divergence of opinion on this, there is no way that we will all be in agreement. And because of that, I just claim your blood on us as a body for love and unity among us and a gentleness of your spirit as I speak. I ask for your control in Jesus name. Amen. Newsweek magazine in a recent article had a journalist ask this question. Is there anybody anymore in the land who has not had a friend, a child, a parent go through or be able to describe the agony of divorce? The answer was no. Divorce in our land is not only epidemic, it has become pandemic, to the point where every one of us, in one way or another, I believe, have been touched closely by the issue of divorce, remarriage, where do the kids go, that whole painful issue. In the United States last year, one million plus couples severed their marriage relationship. This year, at least that many will happen again. And what that means is if you think of that in terms of people, if one million marriages have dissolved, that means two million spouses have been involved. If you would add to that children, we could maybe add two to three million children on top of that being directly involved with the breaking up of a family. That gives us five to six million people, and that goes on year after year. Just keep adding and keep multiplying after year after year. And beneath the rubble of those numbing statistics is the pain of people who go through this thing all the time. And I don't think I need to tell you that this issue has indeed invaded the church. Right now in the United States, 48 out of 50 states have what is called no-fault divorce. I don't have time to go into explaining all of what that means, but in essence what it means is this. That it is easier now to get a divorce than it is to get married. So it is that we are dealing with a relevant issue. It is a timely one. It is a staggering problem. I have a little thing I need to tell you right now. We are absolutely, totally committed to expository teaching of the Word of God. That means verse by verse by verse. The reason we're talking about this today is because that's the verse we land on this week. Verse 8. It is a timely problem. It is a staggering one. And because it is so timely and staggering and relevant to us, that drives us to the Word of God. It drives us to study the Word of God. and our hearts, I trust, your heart with mine, is crying out to God even now, God, give us some sense on this. Give us some wisdom on this. Give us a clear message on what we are to do with this even as it comes into the body of Christ. But even as I say that and I kind of say now we're going to come to the Word and get the answer, if you're really thinking and aware of what's going on in our Christian society, we are aware of the fact that there's a lot of confusion even about what the Bible says. This teacher says this about it, another teacher says that about it, and every one of the teachers, even though they might be disagreeing 180 degrees, are all pointing to Scripture to prove what it is that they believe, the stand that they have taken. The fact is I find myself amazed at the divergence. The reason I find myself amazed by the confusion is because I do not believe that the Scripture is that unclear. I do believe, however, that there is a lot of fuzziness in our thinking. The reason I believe there is fuzziness in our thinking on this issue is because very often, without knowing it, people, I believe, who would never under any other circumstance even do this with Scripture, we have our interpretation skills down pretty well. But when it comes to this, very often what we see people do, myself included, it was one of the battles, we come to this with preconceptions, preconditions, preconclusions about what God says about divorce, about what God says about remarriage. And before we ever even dig into the text to find out what it's saying, We've already decided, so we can make the text say anything at once if we do that. Some look at the problem of divorce and remarriage and say this, Hey, when I look at this issue, I see people. And I see people who are deeply hurt. And I see people in our church who are wounded and bleeding. And we are here as a body of Christ to heal people, to bring them back to a position of being able to serve and love the Lord. We want to love them and accept them and put no conditions on that. We want people to be happy. We don't want to put them under any undue pressure. To do that, however, very often in order to do that, we end up lowering the standard to accommodate people. We call people who do that liberals. I'm very concerned about the issue when we do that. But I also believe something else, and you need to hear me on this as well. Because I think very often there's another group of people who also looks at people and they see the pain and they see the hurt, but they see more than that. They see things out of control and things are out of control. Divorce is running rampant. And the impulse in the heart is to say we need to stop divorce. We need to make a clear statement, clear this up, and I'm afraid very often that what we have done is raise the standard even beyond that which the Lord Jesus himself ever intended it to be. And we put people unintentionally, I believe, but we do it anyway, under law in some ways that God never intended. we come up with doctrines like this no divorce, no time for nobody for no reason ever let's put in touch this week with some teaching that I enjoyed reading very much one of the problems I had with the teaching however it is a teaching that many people who love the Lord go with the teacher is one who is respected by some Christians by many Christians but when they came to this particular issue what they fundamentally did in my opinion was they even went to Matthew 19 in fact I think this is so important after we're done with this text we're going to go back to Matthew 19 and not only understand Paul's teaching on divorce and remarriage but we need to understand Jesus teaching on divorce and remarriage but they took the issue where Jesus gave the exception clause I don't have time to go into it that deeply but the exception clause was this if you divorce and remarry except for the case of porneia immorality then you have committed adultery The exception clause is except for the case of immorality, porneia. What that means is sexual sin. We've done that many, many times, a word study on that. This particular teacher takes that word, limits it to three areas. It means incest. If you are involved in an incestuous marriage, 1 Corinthians 5 had that. If you are involved in a homosexual marriage, and there was one other, if you were engaged and infidelity happened there. But that porneia means specifically that. And if you broaden it to mean the rest of what porneia means in Jesus' context of the exception clause, you're going to have all sorts of confusion. Well, I do agree with that. The problem, however, the confusion for me arises in this respect. The confusion arises for me because porneia does indeed mean adultery. In an effort to protect ourselves from divorce and protect a good, solid standard on remarriage, we come up with doctrines that say remarriage, never, anytime, under any circumstances, and under, in any way, never. And all of that, I'm afraid, sounds very good, and very spiritual, and very biblical, and it sounds like a high moral standard, and it is. The problem is this. And the other thing I feel is when, because it sounds so good, it's very intimidating to disagree with. It's very intimidating to disagree with, but I'm gonna. By the time we're done here this morning, I hope you will know why. You see, I've got some problems with no divorce ever under any circumstances. It isn't true. I have a problem with remarriage never any time under any circumstances anyway. It isn't true. There are exceptions. And they are very, very clear. I believe with all my heart that an objective study without deciding first reveals that. The word of God must be followed. It must be allowed to speak. We are going to take time to let it speak. Like I said, we're going to go back to Matthew 19 after we're done with this. but very often we find ourselves and maybe unwittingly with a Corinthian mentality that begins to follow teachers. We're just dying to know what Swindoll thinks about this. We're dying to know what John MacArthur thinks about this and Bill Gothard thinks about this and now what you can do is add Dave Johnson to the whole list. And we need as much as we can by the power of the Spirit who can liberate us from that to be indeed liberated from all that. Who cares what I think? What I think does not matter. I will tell you what I think. We need to come to the word of God and find out what Paul thinks, find out what Jesus thinks. Let's go to the text. There's some things we need to remember. Paul is writing this letter, these instructions to people who were saved out of rank paganism. These people to whom this letter is written did not grow up in a Christian home. They did not go to an alliance church all their life. They did not go to St. Paul Bible College and then kind of go through a time of rebellion. Marry the wrong girl. marry the wrong guy, have a little struggle in their marriage, and get a divorce, and now come to Paul saying, what do we do? Can you fix this up for us? What kind of information do you have? That is not who this is being written to. So in some ways, we've got to do some work to get ourselves into a position where we understand who it's writing to, because it doesn't just always apply across the board. These people to whom this was written grew up in Corinth. Some of these people one day were having sexual relationships with the temple priestess prostitutes, Incessantly, the very next day, Paul came and preached the gospel of Jesus Christ, and they were redeemed. 1 Corinthians 6 says this. 1 Corinthians 9 says this. Do not be deceived, neither fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, effeminate, homosexuals, thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers, swindlers, none of them shall inherit the earth. And beloved Corinthian church, you wonderful, sanctified place, such were some of you. You all came out of that. But you're not anymore, but you've been washed and you've been sanctified. That's what they were saved out of. And now they're coming to Paul and they're saying, I see how sick that lifestyle was. I had what you would call a pornographic lifestyle. What do we do now? What is our status now? Do you remember the confusion about marriage? We need to be reminded of it. There was first contubernium, which was slaves living together to procreate. We would call it live in sex. No legal sanction on their marriage. Some of these people were married more than once. If a slave owner decided to sell a slave, he would, he could. And so some of these slaves were never really married, living with some guy, living with some gal, sometimes moving around. These people were getting redeemed. Coming, what do we do? Who's my wife? Who's my husband? What does God say? It was confusing. That leads us right into what was called Eusus, and that was Roman common law marriage. They would come to Christ, having been redeemed, maybe the man and the wife, living together for six years, never legally married. They come to Paul, they've got three kids, never legally married. legally married. What do we do? What's our status? Let's complicate it a little bit. I think it's realistic to assume that this was going on too. Let's say they were living with EUSIS, common law marriage, lived together for three years, six years, had three kids, but both of them or one of them was legally married to someone else before this ever happened. They've been married six years. They come to Paul, they say, what do we do? Now we're redeemed. We look back on that and cannot believe that we did that, but we did. What do we do? Do we break this relationship up, go back to that other one? where do we stand? Marriage by sale. Some of the people in this issue, some of the people in this church were people who had been sold into marriage. Didn't want to be married to this gal, didn't even know this gal, didn't even know this guy before they got married, and now they're redeemed, and you know what? All of a sudden, very possibly, they got a heart to serve God, but they've got this wife they don't even care about, they've got this husband they don't even know, didn't even know if they wanted to get into this thing at all, and they're holding back, not wanting to serve. I want to serve the Lord. I've got to get rid of this turkey. and then there was confariato that was the legal marriage that the high born were involved in the great ceremony that very much looks like the one we have now add to that the confusion of rampant pornea adultery, incest homosexuality, bestiality militant feminism was running through that culture in reaction and probably understandably so much like our own to the unbelievably low view of women finally rising out of the ashes of all that mess about sexuality and marriage came the wonderful philosophy of stoicism, and they began to just deny all of their fleshly desires and feel real spiritual about themselves by refraining from all sexual relationships altogether, and that even infected married couples who, feeling much more spiritual and now redeemed, couldn't see sex in a context that was good at all, refrained even from their wife or their own husband. So, having been redeemed from this pornographic lifestyle, they've got a lot of questions, so they wrote a letter now concerning chapter 7, verse 1, Concerning the things about which you wrote, Paul begins to answer. Question number one, is sex unspiritual? Is sex unspiritual? That was last week, in fact, the last two weeks. Is it okay to be single? Is it okay to be celibate? I think we can understand how one coming out of that mess of sexuality and marriage confusion would lean toward a stoic reaction. Sex, under any circumstances, is vile. I can't see it. I can't understand. In fact, my life was so controlled by that, I can't even relate to my wife anymore. I can't even relate to my husband anymore because I'm called not a purity and holiness and that's my deepest desire. I can't even conceive of sex as being good. Paul answers their question and says, first of all, in verse 1, yes, it is good to be single. It is kalos. It is good. It is not the best. It is not superior. It is excellent, but it isn't the only way. It's good. If you want to be single, don't let that Jewish mother who tells you you have no value unless you're married to intimidate you. Stay single for the glory of God. It's a wonderful thing. But verse 2 through 5 says this. While celibacy has a place, so does marriage. But, and this was the part that we spent quite a bit of time on last week, celibacy has no place in marriage. Celibacy has no place in marriage. Verse 5, so stop depriving one another, except by agreement for a period of time that is agreed to by both of you. You remember what they were doing? That these believers getting into this stoic thing, having been saved, Not being able to see sex in a good light at all. Withdrawing from each other, husband and wives, in a sexual relationship. I can just see my wife going off to a retreat or something. Coming back spirit-filled and just full of the Holy Ghost. And wanting to serve him. And because of all that, wanting to withdraw from me. Ha! Thank you, Lord. Anyway, I'll give you a spiritual right in the head. And wives and husbands, especially if they had an unbelieving wife or unbelieving husband, was saying, I've got now a deeper life. One of the things that was happening in the early church, in fact, historians write about the fact that marriages, that pagan people were looking at Christianity as an unbelievable threat on people's marriage because people were doing exactly that, withdrawing from their husbands, withdrawing from their wives, and divorce was rampant because Christians were feeling so superior about their attitudes towards sex. When God called us to that and we spent time, if you want to know more about that, you're going to have to get last week's tape. Got to keep moving. after he did all that he said verse 6 and 7 as he's dealing with singleness and marriage he says what you need to remember is that both are gifts use both of them to the glory of God if you're single thank God for it's a gift from him if you're married thank God for it's a gift from him both of them have advantages both of them have disadvantages God can use both move on now question 2 important question can those formerly married before they were saved remarry verse 8 and 9 write that down can those formerly married before they were saved remarry verse 8 and 9 this is a burning question in this church I think you can understand that for all the reasons I just mentioned they were saved out of blind pagan involvements and the questions would come I committed adultery before I was saved in my former life I was formerly married to someone who didn't know the Lord now I do I don't even know where that person is anymore what do I do do I go back and remarry that person I was laying with a prostitute almost every day of the week am I married to her If I made some mistake in the past and I see it now as vile and I can't believe it, am I stuck to that mistake? Is that something I need to go back to and join myself again with that person? Verse 8 refers to two, let's just get into the text. Verse 8 refers to two categories of singleness. You can see them real clearly. It says, but I say to unmarried and to widows. Unmarried and to widows. In this chapter, from verse 8 through verse 40, there are three categories of singleness mentioned. I want to draw your attention to it. The first group of singles is called the widows. Keres is the Greek word. Previously married, but single now why? Because of death. The second group is the virgins. Parthenoi, single, but never married before, and therefore called virgins. They are virgins or single on that basis. They're referred to in verse 25 of that chapter. Also in verse 34, those are two key chapters. There are also other references as well. The third group of unmarried or single people is this term unmarried. And it's interesting because I would never even look at it except for the fact that I did indeed catch the whole context through verse 40 and discovered that there are distinctions made between unmarried people and widows, and there are distinctions made between unmarried and virgins. What are you talking about, Dave? Let's look at it. What is this group unmarried? Who are they? Are they just generally anybody who's single? Well, you need to know some things. The only place in all of Scripture that this term is used is right here in this chapter. Something else you need to know is that in this chapter, there are four places that it is mentioned. Let's look at them. Verse 32, turn on your page. If your Bible's like mine, you turn your page. Verse 32 says, I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord. What does unmarried mean there? Well, the verse itself doesn't give us a lot of help. Okay? There isn't any clarification there. It could mean single. It could mean anything, just anybody who's single. The unmarried, that's the application. Let's move on. The other verse is verse 34. Paul, again, is here extolling the virtues of singleness, which he does over and over and over again. It gets really obnoxious after a while. But he talks about something here. He says this, after extolling the virtues of singleness, and the woman who is unmarried and the virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord, and then it goes on. The thing that I draw your attention to is that we're making a distinction between one who is unmarried and one who is a virgin. We also know, so the unmarried person is not a virgin, okay? He's single, or she's single, but she's not a virgin. The other thing we know in verse 8 is this unmarried person is not a widow. This unmarried person is not a widow. Why? Because we have a distinction between a widow and an unmarried in verse 8. So the unmarried person is not a widow. The unmarried person is not a virgin. What is the unmarried person? In verse 11, we have another reference, the other reference, the only other reference in this chapter, to defining or helping us know how this term is used to describe who. It is speaking of absolutely illegitimate divorce among two believers. And the illegitimate divorced person is called an unmarried person. Verse 11, giving in instruction, but the term is used again. But if she does leave, let her remain in what state? The unmarried state. Having been married, now unmarried. Unmarried. Verse 11, it's used alone. So the people who before they came to Christ really fouled up their marriage, now are single, might have been a live-in situation as a slave, might have been an adulteress or an adulterer, sinned without doubt, maybe it was totally their fault that that marriage blew up. Didn't know God, didn't know the law of God. If they did know the law of God, they didn't give a rip about the law of God. What do we do? Where do we go from here, Paul? Now I'm redeemed, I see how bad that was. I'd love to maybe go restore that. I don't know how, what do I do? What are my options? Paul very clearly says what their options are. First of all, that you would remain as I. single. Do you remember the debate whether Paul was married and his wife died or whether Paul was married and his wife left him when he became a Christian? Not many people really debate whether Paul was married. Just about everybody knows that believes that Paul was married at one time. He was a member of the Sanhedrin and that kind of thing. There is debate as to whether his wife died or whether his wife left him. If his wife left him, it wouldn't be that unbelievable. In fact, in some of those things, if he would leave, if he was a member of the Sanhedrin and really into that, and a husband would become a Christian, that wife may be even getting instructions to consider him as dead. It's very possible that Paul is speaking from one who is right in that position of being an unmarried person, having been married, not anymore. Paul says, my option was this. What I did was chose to stay single, and God has honored that, and that is my priority choice too. But if they, who is the they? Verse 9, but if they, the unmarried and the widows, can't handle that, It's better to marry than to burn. That is who this applies to. This is not just a general statement about whether any old buddy should get singled or not. The two groups are unmarried, formerly married, before saved, and widows, formerly married, not married anymore because of death. If you can stay single, do it. But if you can't marry, because it is better, if you can't, then marry. Because it is better to do that than fight off everything that's been built in you in terms of desires all your life because of a mistake you made before you even were redeemed. The grace of God that saved the soul does not enslave the body to life, does not enslave the body to a life of utter frustration and anxiety for sins that were committed before they came to Christ. This is me making a lot of us scratch our heads. I'm not sure I follow this. I'm not sure I get this. Let's turn to verse 17 in the same passage. Again, hanging on to this whole context. I want you to know, just so you can be comforted in this, if you're reeling and keeping up with this, we are going to take time with this, but I want to go to it now. In verse 17, this question is still raising and raging, and he's answering it. What is my condition? What do I do? If I came to Christ, one who is divorced and my wife may be even remarried and there's no chance of reconciliation, where do I go from there? Do I go back and try to do that? He says this in verse 17, Only as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each, in this manner let him walk. As God called you, as God designed you, walk that way. If God designed you to be single, stay single. If God designed you to be married, stay married. and thus I direct in all the churches I have a message for the church he says in verse 17 verse 18 was any man called already circumcised? don't become uncircumcised don't go back and try to unscramble the egg he's saying has anyone been called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised you can't unscramble the egg circumcision is nothing uncircumcision is nothing but what matters is keeping the commandments of God let each man remain in that condition in which he was called. When you became a believer, the way you came if you were single, I would prefer you stayed single. If you were married, stay married. Don't go back and try to unscramble the egg. Were you called while a slave? Don't worry about it. But if you are able also to become free, do that. For he who has called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord's freed man. Likewise, he who was called while free is Christ's slave. Who bought with a price, don't become slaves of men. On and on and on. Okay, verse 25, He continues to clarify this, what he's saying, and not only clarify, but begin to apply. After he says you can't unscramble the egg, if you came single, stay single. If you came married, stay married. And if you came unmarried from another situation, stay unmarried. But, he says, verse 25, now concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord, but I give an opinion as one who by the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy. I think then that this is good in view of the present distress, that it is good for a man to what? Remain as he is. If you came this way, stay that way. Are you bound to a wife? And now he begins to get into the practical possibilities. Are you bound to a wife? Don't seek to be released. Are you released from a wife? What does that mean? That's the unmarried, released from a wife. Maybe she died, maybe she left you. If you are released from a wife, don't seek a wife. Stay single, that's my option. But, see, he's giving a law. Stay single. But, verse 28, if you should marry, you have not sinned. And if a virgin should marry, she has not sinned. We're making a distinction here between a virgin who's never been married and giving them permission to marry, and one who has been married before they were saved and giving them permission to remarry if those are the circumstances. I want you to know something, that for some of you that might be very liberating. It may be that some of you have been laboring under an unbelievable kind of law under no circumstances. But I want you to hear something and it's advice from the Apostle Paul. And that is this. Apostle Paul's top priority in this situation was that you stay single. Not priority, but his priority choice. My choice for you would be that you stay single. God can use that. It can eliminate a lot of problems and issues. But, know this, I'm not putting you under some sort of law. If you remarry, You have not sinned. And if a virgin does it, she hasn't sinned. Second group, third question. Third question. What about people who are married? We're moving on. Group number one, there were three groups of married people that he addresses here. Group number one is where both people are Christians. Group number two is where one's a Christian and one isn't, but they want to stay. Group number three is where one is a Christian and one isn't, but they want to leave. Okay, group number one. Two Christians, believers, love Jesus Christ, have been redeemed, both are married. To you I give instruction, verse 10. instruction there is stronger than instruction. It is a command. It is a military term. Not I, but the Lord. Now, he is not pulling rank here and saying, now, you can't even disagree with this because the Lord said this, not just me. Paul has authority, too. I want you to know that if Paul was the only one saying it, it would be as if the Lord said it. All he's indicating to us here is that he is quoting the Lord's teaching, and we find the Lord's teaching in Matthew 19. Okay? I give instructions, command, not I, but the Lord, that the wife should not leave her husband. Who's he talking to? Two believers who are married, who, when they became Christians, became Christians together. Wonderful thing. Not everyone had that blessed thing happen to them, but some did. That's who he's addressing here. I said this before, and I'm going to say it again. I believe that Jesus' teaching on this issue is so important that after the holidays and when we come back and get back to normal, we are going to go back to Matthew 19, teach it verse by verse, go back into the Old Testament as well and find out what all the things have to say. I don't have time to do it now. I want to get through the text. In Matthew 19, however, the Pharisees asked Jesus a question. It was a trick question. It was one to disturb him and get him in trouble with the people and also get him in trouble with the king and themselves. They asked him this. Is it lawful to divorce for any cause? The fact is this. For these Pharisees, it was lawful to divorce for any cause. You could, she bat an eyelash wrong. You could give her a certificate of divorce and that was that. Any cause, no big deal. The reason they asked him that question because they knew that he would take a strong stand on divorce. He would get himself in trouble. Jesus did do indeed that did indeed do that and he goes on to talk about in the beginning God created man and he created woman and he created him for each other and he instituted the supernatural bond of what we call marriage and what that teaching is is simply this that a father and they will leave their fathers and mothers and the two will cleave to each other and the two shall become one flesh and what God has joined together let no man put asunder. Having heard that, they just asked him after that, well, what about divorce? You know, Moses even gave a certificate of divorce. Why did he command that, to give a certificate of divorce? And Jesus said this. The reason he gave a certificate of divorce was because of the hardness of their heart. And then he went on to say in that next verse, if you divorce your wife or husband, and then go on and remarry, except for the cause of porneia, sexual sin, immorality, adultery, Adultery, also incest, I suppose, and also homosexual relationships, marriage. If you have done that, you have committed adultery, except for those issues. And we hear that and say this, Aha! There's my loophole. There's my way out. That's wonderful. If I could just get that turkey to commit adultery, I'll be on my own. It's great. Or if I could catch them in adultery, I've been living with this lousy marriage, And you know, to be quite honest, it wouldn't hurt me that much if he committed adultery, because I'd have my legal loophole to get out of this marriage and do what I want to do anyway. I want you to know something. Adultery is not a good enough reason for a divorce. I don't know how I can say that harder or more firmly than I did. Adultery is not a good enough reason to get a divorce. Johnson, what are you saying? You just did the verse, and Jesus said it was a good enough reason. What did Jesus say? This is where the teaching and going back to the text is going to be important. But I want you to know that what he said, let me give you an illustration, Bonnie and I. You know we're married, right? It was legal. It's happened. You know something else about us? We're both redeemed. We both love the Lord Jesus. What's going to happen if one day in the context of our relationship, we begin to have all sorts of problems, and Dave here goes and commits adultery? What's her option? Well, what she does is I think she should do. In fact, I'm telling you this. Skip that. She comes to the elders and she says, elders, I need some wisdom from God. From you. What do I do with this? And they would begin to give instructions. First of all, David would be removed from the pulpit. Second of all, a process of restoration would begin if David was repentant. If I said, I'm sorry. If I said, I have sinned against God, and I have sinned against myself, and I have sinned against this marriage, and I have sinned against the body, then restoration begins. And that would be one of your ministries to me if that happened. God forbid. And then what they would say would be this. Since adultery is the exception clause, You go out and divorce him. No. The only time that divorce is legitimate in the context of adultery is when it is hard-hearted adultery. What is hard-hearted adultery? Hard-hearted adultery is adultery when I would say, I don't give a rip about my family anymore. I don't care about Bonnie anymore. I don't love her anymore. In fact, I have joined myself with this lady who God calls a harlot. I don't care who she is. Who God calls a harlot. And that is where I'm going to live my life. And I join and I divorce and I marry. That is hard-hearted adultery, folks. And we're going to discover that when we go back to Matthew 19, that was one of the issues that was going way back on in the Exodus issue or in the Moses issue. I know a pastor. I don't know him personally, but it was an evangelical church. You know the word spreads in Chicago. Who got involved in adultery, broke the church apart. I believe that they didn't follow some real clear biblical guidelines in terms of how to deal with that when a pastor or an elder does that. They wanted him to stay in the pulpit. Well, he did. Bad idea. Repented, tried to put it back together. Six months later, he ran off with that woman again and is living with her and married to her to this day. That, beloved, is hard-hearted adultery. What about that wife who's left? It is my view that that woman is the exception clause. What if two believers do it and it's too late? We have the instruction in verse 10, not leave her husband. What if it's too late? What if you already have and you're a believer and you've already left your husband, you've already left your wife and you're unmarried. You're still unmarried. In Corinth, by the way, that was happening all the time. And what was the basis on which it was happening? You know what it was? In the name of serving Jesus, in the name of getting really wrapped up in the Lord, they were saying, oh, now that I'm married to Christ, I really, you know, in love, we'll just depart in love and you go your way and serve God and I'll go my way and I'll serve God. And doesn't that sound bizarre? Nobody does that anymore. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. and in fact again maybe this is because my heartbeat is so much into this because I'm in the ministry and I have a family that I'm deeply committed to and you know I consider it a priority over this church but I know the pressure on me to make the ministry more important than my family too and I know people in ministry positions and whether they're in ministry positions or not maybe in other ways under the guise of following God have never legally divorced their wife or divorced their husband but they are absolutely totally unavailable to them and what is there is a chasm and in fact when it talks about leaving the Greek word does indeed paint a picture of a chasm adultery in terms of a marriage is the ultimate expression of that chasm but there are people who are still married beloved who in God's eyes might be closer to a divorce in God's eyes than you might ever know because they're living together but they're not together at all there is no marriage there and in a legalistic way we're still married and isn't that wonderful and it looks good at church but God's going to deal with that you see I believe with all my heart that God hates lousy marriages just as much as he hates divorce. We got this legal thing on it, and it's not true. If, however, two believers divide, what are the options? You only got two believers. If Bonnie and I divide, what are the options? One, reconcile or remain single the rest of your life. Why is that? God's punishing you for that, right? No, he's not punishing you. I don't think that's what's in view. I think that what's in view is the reconciliation. Get it? The reason you remain single isn't because you're being punished. The reason you remain single is because if it is indeed two believers, God's intention for you is that you be married. Let them not leave her husband. Let them not leave her wife, his wife. And if you do, remain unmarried. Remain in that position of being formally married but not anymore. Or else be reconciled to the husband. And that the husband should not send his wife away. I'm going to just keep going because I don't think that could be more clear. B, the second group, mixed marriages. where one's a Christian, one isn't, and one wants to stay. Verse 12 through 14. But to the rest, I say, not the Lord. What is he doing here? Now giving his own opinion so we don't have to take this as seriously. Not at all. Paul is writing under the absolute inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God when he writes this. All he is saying here, don't make this say any more than it does. All he is saying here is simply this. I am speaking now under the inspiration of God. I am no longer quoting the Lord's teaching. In fact, the Lord never commented on this kind of situation. Never needed to. There weren't any believers married to unbelievers. There weren't any spirit-filled believers. Regeneration hadn't even taken place then. I say not the Lord. If he or if she consents to stay, then you stay. Do not send her away. And this is where I would just invoke all of the instructions of chapter 7, verse 2 through verse 5, where it says, fulfill your marriage. If you're married to an unbelieving husband, wives, fulfill your marriage. Emotionally, psychologically, sexually, every way. Give yourself to your husband and love him with everything you've got. The problem in some of these early Christian churches and marriages, and I'm sure even in the context of our situation, if that would happen, if some of you were married to an unbeliever, there was the problem of women and men feeling so spiritually superior and out of their husbands and wives that they would begin to withdraw. Sexually, emotionally, all this. And if you think that's crazy, a gal, a woman, a gal, A lady of about 75 years of age came up to me after church two Sundays ago, is from out of town, and shared with me how much she wanted to know how she could get a ride down here and find out about this, because when she was married, she was married to an unbeliever, loved him with all her heart, became a Christian, and was beginning then, after she became redeemed, to get all sorts of advice from wonderfully wise Christians how she needed to not have any more relationships with him, and how that would draw him to the Lord. And she just began to go into the Word of God, And she didn't get emotional, but I'm sure there were times in her life when she dealt with this that she did. She said, Pastor, I loved my husband. And I rejected that, and I said, Thank you, Lord. But I think in the meantime, there was a lot of tension. Next question is this. If I'm married to an unbeliever, isn't that going to corrupt me? That will corrupt me. That's just terrible. Again, keeping in mind their whole understanding of sexual relationships, how it was always defiled. He says this. You don't understand. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband, for otherwise your children would even be unclean, but they're holy. What's he saying? Don't make this say anything more than it does. It doesn't mean that they're saved through the believing wife or the believing husband. That's obvious. I think I don't even want to spend a lot of time on that. All it's saying is this. These people were feeling like relationships, sexual, emotional, psychological, total giving of myself to my husband or wife would be defiling me. He says this. It is exactly the opposite. You join yourself with that unbelieving husband, and you love him with everything you've got, and it will sanctify him. It will bring blessing on him that he will know no other way. And yes, maybe he'll come to know the Lord, but you don't even control that. We're going to see that in a minute. Third group, mixed marriages. One wants to leave. 15 and 16. Yet if the unbelieving one leaves, what do you do? Kick, scream, go to court, make sure he's threatened suicide? No. Let him go. Let him leave. I want you to know something. This is not the believer leaving. The believer under no circumstances leaves that situation. But if the unbelieving partner wants to leave, you let him leave. And then it says this. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us to peace. What does it mean, not under bondage? Here's another place where you're going to get divergent teaching. I'm going to tell you where I'm at. I feel strong about it too. There are some who say in this particular thing that not under bondage is a legal bondage. That means that if they leave, you let them leave, and you're no longer under legal bondage, meaning you're not legally bound to them. I mean, you don't have to answer to them anymore. You're not legal. But in the eyes of God, you are. Okay? So you're not free to remarry. You're not free to go on with your life. You can't. You're stuck. You're single. That's it. Law of God. Real intimidating. How do you disagree with that? Sounds good. It's not true. Not under bondage means you are what? You are free. Free from what? Free from the only bond that marriage refers to. In Romans 7, 2, it says this. The married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is living. The married woman is bound. It's the same kind of meaning in those two words, by the way. The married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is living. If he dies, she is no longer bound to the law. By the way, it's amazing to me how we go to verses like that and build this whole theology of marriage around that verse. That verse is true. And it is talking about the fact that if one dies, they are free. The point of that passage, however, is not to teach about marriage. The point of that passage is to draw a picture of what it's like to be under the bondage of the law before Christ and how to be set free from the law when someone has to die for that to happen. Talking about Christ, the whole thing. But that is true. It is a true statement. You don't, however, take that thing and apply it across the board. See, there's other exceptions. There's another exception. There's another way when someone is set free, and that is hard-hearted adultery and that is also when an unbelieving spouse says fully with you I'm going my own way. So that person is just bound all their life. No they're not. They're set free. They are free. We know 1 Peter 3 says that with everything you have you do everything you can to win them by the purity of your life and by your chaste behavior by your comely behavior by the giving of yourself to him by the giving of yourself to her. But I'm afraid that some people hearing this kind of stuff take that to mean that in an effort to keep this marriage together and the only way he's got a chance or she's got a chance of ever being saved is me, they actually can compromise their own integrity, compromise their honesty, compromise even their morality, compromise their Christianity, compromise their morality, absolutely. In the Corinthian church, what do you think their life revolved around before they were saved? Practical application. I do not believe that a Christian sacrifices his principles of morality to keep a marriage together. The whole married life before these people were saved were revolving around dissipation, drunkenness, sexual fornication, and in order to keep that marriage together, we act yes to that. No, we don't. No, we don't. Your love for Christ, these people's reading of the Word of God, their time in prayer, their desire to be around believers, their desire to grow, their renewed or newly discovered honesty in relationships because Christ is about truth and we begin to talk about things, irritates him or irritates her. So you stop. No, you don't. If they leave, you let them leave. You love them, you give to them, you care about them. And don't you dare try to find another loophole here where you make their life so miserable and you don't ever give yourself to them so they do leave. That is absolutely, that's being persecuted for doing wrong and not being persecuted for doing right. Verse 17 through 24, I've already referred to this. He sums it all up. In verse 17, Paul says, I got a message for the church. The way God called you, he designed you, walk that way. If he made you single, be single. If he made you married, be married. If he saved you single, stay single. If you were saved and you were married, stay married. If you married an unbeliever, stay married to that person. Unless they leave, let them go. And that led to the fourth question. What about those people who've never been married? Like virgins. What about those people who've never been married? Virgins were beginning to get an idea that now that they've come to Christ, you've got to forget about marriage. I have a higher call. It's God alone. Parents were even beginning to influence their kids in that same way. You've got to give it, in fact, a spiritual value of singleness and celibacy. You're really somehow higher. The Catholic Church obviously picked up on this real heavy and went with it in terms of their celibacy with their priests and their nuns and so on and so forth. Verse 25 says this, I give no command of the Lord concerning virgins, but I do give an opinion as one who by the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy. You know my credibility. What I say makes a difference. I think then that this is good in the view of the present distress. Here we go again, him extolling the virtues of singleness. Why is it good for those of you who are single to stay single? I'll give you four reasons very quickly. Write them down. I'm not going to elaborate. First of all, because of the present distress in verse 26, it's good to stay single. What he meant there, I believe, was simply a reference to their specific sociological cultural tension. It was a violent, hostile world to believers. Christians were being slaughtered by the thousands. Every one of the disciples but one, the disciples but one, lost their lives in a martyr's death. And he's saying simply this, in view of the present distress, I would, that you just stay single. It'd keep things from being too complicated. You're free. The second thing is the problem of the flesh. It's tough enough. That's verse 28. Yet such will have trouble in this life. And I am trying to spare you. The problem of the flesh. It's tough enough for you to live your Christian life with your own inadequacies and your own lack of faith. And to add another one to that makes it tougher. Now, when you get married, you know what you do? You pool your resources, don't you? So you pool your strengths. But the other unfortunate thing is you pool your weaknesses as well. Anyone here live with a spouse who has less spiritual zeal than you? yeah sure there are anybody here have a husband who you look to and just wish would take the spiritual leadership in your home and no matter how much you love him and how much you encourage him without pushing they just never do and you just go crazy it just frustrates you you have this sense of your own potential as a woman as a godly woman supporting a godly man and all this kind of stuff and it just never comes because he doesn't give a rip about the Lord that's what he's warning about you know it's better to stay single than go through that because once you're in you're staying and you're going to have to deal with it and you're going to have to love your husband and you will, by the grace of God, need to do that. And some of you husbands have wives who don't have the same vision maybe that you've got and maybe some of you have felt this unbelievable call to go into the ministry and you're not to this day, maybe, doing some of the things you feel God has called you to do because your wife never saw it. And you know what? You don't do it. And in view of that kind of thing, it's better to stay single. Just a warning. Don't write off singleness. Again, we have been bombarded by our culture that the only way to be is married. Garbage, says Paul. There's another reason. The time is short, verse 29. But I say, brethren, the time has been shortened so that from now on, those who have wives should be as though they had none. The time is short. By the way, one of the things I believe, this is debatable, but one of the things I believe about this is that Paul had an eschatology that had Jesus coming back right now. And he was anticipating that happening and that was one of the things behind some of this kind of teaching. In fact, we're not going to go into 2 Corinthians after 1 Corinthians, But some scholars believe that Paul even began to alter his thinking on this a little bit, that his eschatology changed, that he wasn't exactly as convinced that Jesus was coming back today. There's a fourth reason, and that is the preoccupation that married life brings, verse 34. His interests are divided when you're married. And as I elaborated on that last week, it's a holy and a blessed distraction, but it is one nonetheless that we have to recognize. The apostle here is giving good advice. Verse 28, and we need to be mindful of this, but in verse 28, it says this. With all this advice about staying single and all the good reasons to stay single, he says, but, verse 28, if you should marry, you have not sinned, and if you're a virgin and you should marry, you have not sinned. Now back that up and pick up the summary in verse 27 and then go to verse 28. Are you bound to a wife? Don't seek to be released. Are you released from a wife? Divorced in your former life and now you're free and what do you do? Don't seek a wife. Stay single. That's my preference. But if you marry, you haven't sinned. Two more questions. I just give them to you. Can't elaborate. Dealt with fathers who are imposing perpetual virginity on their daughters again in the name of spirituality and feeling a little bit better. And we go on verse 36 and see this. But if any man thinks that he is acting unbecomingly toward his virgin daughter, that does not, I don't believe, refer to incest and things like that. Unbecomingly there is just asserting his will on that child and saying, you can't get married. If she should be of full age, that's past puberty, by the way. And if it must be so, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin. Let her marry. But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no constraint, but has authority over his own will, and has decided this in his own heart to keep his own virgin daughter, he will do well. So then, both he who gives his daughter, his virgin daughter in marriage does well, and he who does not give her daughter in marriage does even better. That's fine. You know, it's almost as if Paul's saying, would you relax? Don't give all these unbelievable spiritual qualities to being single or being married. Divorce is another issue, but you get the drift. The sixth question is this. What about widows? Verse 39, they had a husband who died or a wife who died. Verse 39, a wife is bound as long as her husband lives, but if her husband is dead, she is free to be married to whom she wishes. Word to the widows, marry, who? Whoever you want. Only in the Lord. Well, that cuts it down, doesn't it? Only in the Lord, meaning obviously only a believer. Secondly, only according to the will of God. That means not any believer. That means not any believer. Summary this way, and this is it. If you're single, point A, if you're single, you fall into four categories. You're single by delay. You're single by delay. You're single now, but you won't stay that way. God's going to bring you a husband. God's going to bring you a wife. You are single by design. And that is this, that God gave you a gift of singleness. And that is God's design for you. In fact, that is God's call on your life. Stay single. You are single by divorce. Unmarried. If it happened before you were saved, and if you were abandoned by an unbelieving, hard-hearted, adulterous situation, you are free. If you are married to a believer, and that is what resulted in the divorce, remain single. Not for punishment, but for reconciliation. God wants you to stay together. But you don't go back and unscramble the egg. if it happened in your former life. The other category of singleness is by death, the widow. Stay single if you can. If you can't, it's better to marry than to burn. Second category was simply this, if you're married. And if you're married, stay married, period, paragraph. And with that, it's my belief that we have the mind of God on that passage. Let's pray. Father, I pray that you would continue to teach us, Continue to give us the courage to be open to the things you're teaching us. Continue to keep my eyes open and my heart open to things I'm not seeing. Continue to give us as a church wisdom in this matter that is so unbelievably important to every one of us. In Jesus' name, amen.
