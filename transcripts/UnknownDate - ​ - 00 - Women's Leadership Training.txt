You know how much we care about being real, about being authentic, and in fact one of our core values says just that. It says the amazing grace of God frees us to live honest, loving, and fearless lives. And this authenticity is a hallmark of who we are as a body of believers here, and it's something that we believe is also fundamental to the life of Jesus. In John 15, 15, Jesus said, I no longer call you servants because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends for everything that I have learned from my Father, I have made known to you. We know that this kind of authenticity is vital in relationships, and we strive to create environments in which it is safe to be this real. The million-dollar question this morning is, how real should I, as a leader with my small group, or if you're a small group leader, or in my serving, if you play other roles, should I be? How real should I be? And I'd like to take a few minutes to take a look at how Jesus did this, see what we can learn from some of just how he lived his life. And we've already noted that at least with his disciples, Jesus was utterly vulnerable, transparent, and honest. Whatever the Father told Jesus, Jesus turned around and he told his 12 disciples. Just kind of went that way. Or at least his most closely trusted Peter, James, and John. And he really held back nothing from them. He didn't hold back his pain. He didn't hold back his disappointment. He didn't hold back his anger even. He didn't hold back his love. He didn't... he knew of his past, his present, or his future. He shared those things. He didn't hold back his needs. He didn't hold back his suffering. He didn't hold back his failures. And he didn't hold back his successes. He shared all of those things with his closest friends. But notice that Jesus did not share all of these things with all people, just with his disciples and those who had covenanted to share life together for an extended period of time. And as leaders, you may find that some of the people that you are in group with will become people that are covenant friends of yours. That does happen here, and we applaud that. So some of the people that you're in relationship as leaders will become your covenant friends, and they will be the people from whom you don't hold back anything. But for many of the people whom you lead, your time and your scope with them will be limited. And does that mean that you never share these things? No. But let's take a look at how and when these things are appropriate to share. And I think there are three main areas. Topic, timing, and treasure. Those are the three things on your sheet there. And there's three main questions to ask yourself before sharing something with people who are not your covenant friends. First question I would ask is around topic. Is the topic appropriate? The second question I would ask is around timing. Is the timing appropriate? And the third question I would ask is around yourself. Am I being appropriate in sharing this? So first, let's take a look at the topic. Is the topic appropriate? Now, if you are leading a group in the holy sexuality class, it may be appropriate for you to share something about your sexual frustrations. That might be okay. But if you're in a study on the patriarchs, and the topic for the day is God's generosity. Your sexual frustrations just might not be the right topic to share. So think about the context. Likewise, if you're leading a holy sexuality class and you just had a fight with your teenage daughter, that might not be the appropriate place to share that. If what you want to share is out of context, I would caution you as a leader to hold it. to practice what we sometimes call emptying your cup, taking the stuff that's inside of you and laying it at Jesus' feet and praying that he would help you to set it aside for that time so that you can be present to those that you are leading. And a second caution I would give you is to remember that someone else's problems are never an appropriate topic to share. Okay? That falls under gossip. so look at the context as you look through scripture you'll see that with the crowds at large jesus stuck to the topics at hand or some expansions of those and that he didn't publicly bring up the problems of his disciples or others the problems of others only surfaced in parables when he would tell a general story or as situations arose in which jesus was confronted directly with those problems and he dealt with them directly. So once in a while he found himself, say, at the house of Martha and Mary. Martha was running around and he would directly confront Martha on her need to slow down. Or in the context of Peter saying, I will never deny you. And Jesus said, yes, you will. So there were times when Jesus did confront things publicly, but it was things that were either the situation he was already in or questions that came towards him. He didn't seek to do that himself. So consider the topic, the context that you're in, and is what you're going to share something that is appropriate to the context? That second question is about the timing. Is the timing appropriate? Is it too soon to share this information? Now, Jesus knew he was the son of God from a really young age. But he also knew that the crowd at large wasn't really going to get this. So he didn't share it voluntarily. As people asked him, who are you? He responded, who do you say that I am? And that timing is certainly an art. And it's really impossible to give you a black and white rule for when it is too soon to share information. But try to put yourself in the shoes of those people who are responding to you. And imagine how that information is going to affect them. Will it confuse them? Will it upset them? Will it distract them from the topic at hand? Or could that information bring them joy? Or bring them clarity? Or bring them a sense of solidity? So ask yourself, how is that information going to be received? will what you are saying be helpful to them? Consider that in the timing. A second aspect of timing is the length of the information you want to share. Beware the amount of time your story will take to tell and weigh out the benefits to all of those that you're sharing with against the cons of the amount of time it's going to take to say it. Now, it could be that the story that you want to share is so vital to what is being taught that it does warrant 10 minutes of their time. Or conversely, it could be that it's not even worth five minutes of their time. Okay? So consider the length of time it's going to take to share that piece of information, that part of your story. And a third aspect of timing is actually not sharing enough of yourself. If you've been leading for six months and those you're leading don't know anything about your passions, your joys, your failures, your life lessons, it's time to share something. Watch for an appropriate topic and timing and take the plunge of sharing something of meaning and value to you. At the end of Jesus' conversation with the woman at the well, the woman says she knows there is a Messiah coming, and Jesus takes the plunge with her and says, I who speak to you am he. Now that was a vulnerable thing for Jesus to say. You know, notice first he did wait until he had established a relationship with the woman before he said that. The topic was totally relevant. She had brought it up. And it was pertinent to their whole conversation, actually. And he kept his comment short. He said, I who speak to you am he. That's all he needed to say. So again, ask yourself, is the timing appropriate? Third piece is around treasure, and it's, are you appropriate? And by this I mean, are you able to share this information without falling apart? Now, that doesn't mean sharing without tears, because tears are healthy. Tears are a good thing. It does mean, can you maintain your composure and finish what you're saying? will you be able to be present to those you're leading when you're done sharing can you remain present to them when you're done sharing will you be able to receive their reactions to what you've just shared with them and realize that sometimes those reactions are going to surprise you you may share something and go oh i didn't expect it to land on someone that way so ask yourself are you ready to receive their reactions to what you've shared and then consider that not all aspects of our lives are to be shared immediately and some aspects are never to be shared one of my favorite verses is luke 2 19 where it says but mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart some aspects of our lives are simply meant to remain between you and God. To be kept as treasures and pondered in your heart. So again, you might ask yourself, am I appropriate? Is this treasure meant to be shared? So there you have it. Three T's of being real. You have topic, timing and treasure. And I will take any questions if you've got some questions here. Yes? Yes. So this is for our own sharing, but as we're in a group, and I was specifically in the classroom, and we said people aren't letting you share what they are sharing, and you know that you're in the midst of that, and the person is not, you're basically witnessing someone falling apart. What then? Yeah, you're asking as a leader if a group member enters into sharing and they are falling apart. Specifically when you were saying that you're not going to be ready to receive I as a group member, I'm not going to be able to receive anything that's coming. I'm basically just doing this because I really don't feel like I have any other choice. Yeah, than to say something. yes some of the principles that i've given you are for you as leaders and then your question is really more around what happens if someone in your group falls apart on you yeah if someone in your group falls apart on you we love them we care for them we offer what resources we can we can we can model coming around that person and listening we're going to talk a little bit more later today about listening skills and self-care things. And so we offer them what resources we have to help them, and it's okay for that to happen. You do want to watch to see if there's a pattern. If you have a person who's falling apart in your group every week, you may want to meet with them aside and just see, are there other resources that we can help them with to deal with some of the things that they're dealing with? It can at times hijack a group. and so you want to be careful to protect the group as well, but care for that person. And it is a place where you can model caring for the person, you can invite the group to help care for that person, and then if the person is hijacking the group, see if there are other resources that you can offer them to help them deal with whatever it is that keeps coming up. And if it gets to a place where it's just, you're like, oh, I don't know what to do, that's when you do come to your leaders and we'll come with you in that place and walk with you in that. Yeah, good question. That can happen. Yeah. What is good care and what is good care? We're going to actually talk about that. Yep, we're going to get into boundaries. We're going to get into, yes, so we'll save that question. Yep. Yeah. You can save this one too, but we just wanted to make sure we brought it up. Being real at the start, whether it's called, I guess it used to be called check-in, or some way for everybody to be real and kind of connected to the start? Yep. Apparently in the past there were guidelines on that. Are there guidelines now? If you're getting to that, that's fine. Probably not addressing that. I can address that right now. You can use a check-in statement at your table. It can be as simple as I feel, however it is, because. So I'm feeling happy because I enjoy fall weather or I'm feeling sad because I just had a fight with my mom. You can do that as a check-in at the beginning of your time together to just get a pulse on where people are at. You do need to be careful to keep those short because then that can also hijack your time together. But it can be a good way to just help take a pulse of where everyone is at. So, yep. Yeah. Just a thought in that regard. So to your part, you do a check-in by saying one word. How do you come tonight? It's all between our couples. We try to stick to the model. Marriott, one word. That's great. I feel savvy and it gives me a pulse and to hear about how the leaders are when they show up. Because it would be great joining because it helps you be aware of how the leaders are when they show up. Because they all come. cluttered generally. We do. So just a one-word response to the question of what's in your cup. That's another way to do that. Good. All right. Yes? One of the things that sometimes is helpful in a situation where you have a person who's kind of laid out more than probably they've been intended to is if that's when you step in and say, can I pray about that for you? And you need the prayer. And the reason I'm saying that, unless you know your group pretty well and you know they can come around and do that, you're kind of controlling the situation so they're not getting a lot of feedback stuff and you can keep the prayer, which is always a caring thing to do. You can keep the prayer really focused on, Lord, we just want to bring our sister through and not have what sometimes can happen there, as we all know, as we start praying God's fixing on people. That's not so helpful. That's one way that you can take that situation. It's just a one-off time rather than someone who's continually in there. Yeah, so Nancy just offered that we could pray for a person who is falling apart and that that can sometimes reestablish a good group sense there. Good. All right. Well, I'm going to invite Emily to come up and talk to you guys for a little bit on boundaries here. Ooh, our favorite topic. Yes! Yes! And I'm going to... Oh, I do. There you go. There you go. Can I touch you? Sorry. I just reached right in there. Sorry about that. There you go. Oh, that little hum? I know. I know. There you go. Okay, I'll leave you in your notes. Yeah, leave me in my notes. Well, thank you, Lisa. I think we all recognized in Lisa's hearing quite a few boundaries. I think you'll probably see those integrated through everybody's teaching today. But the handout that I'm going to be referring to is white. It starts out with leading with boundaries, definition of a boundary, and so forth. So I'm going to talk a bit about this first handout and then send you to groups. So I'm trying to mathematically think of how I'll do that, and I'm going to deal with that when it comes. First off, definition of a boundary is in which it defines a relationship, something that indicates or fixes a limit or an extent. And I think we all believe that this limitation allows room for freedom. So in Lisa sharing, she talked about how the being real is the amazing grace of God freeing us to live honest, loving, fearless lives. I think a small group without boundaries is basically a place where there would be a lot of fear and a lack of freedom. So we're going to talk a bit about the danger signals that you maybe are seeing already, maybe not, existing within your small group. That could be some red flags of a lack of boundaries. Just right off the top, a group member consistently taking up too much time in her sharing. Another one is a group member side tracking rather than pressing into the topic at hand. And that can just look like suddenly just random details and talking for the sake of talking. And that can be uncomfortable as a leader when you're just trying to hold that temperature of the table and be intentional about this being a place to connect and everything you've committed to out of the covenant. And it can be something that you notice. And we are going to get to play with some of these later. So when it comes to a talkative group, the third one there, certain quieter group members need to have brief silences in order to have their word in. They're not going to jump in and interrupt. I'll get it in eventually. I was the youngest of five, and I'll get my word in. I don't, you know, no one needs to allow too much space, but I do understand the need to have a group maybe slow down and to press into that issue. If you're noticing that group is processing way too quick, you're going to need some brief silences to honor everyone's different temperament and to honor the spirit. And the fourth one there is one group member's current pain seems to be dominating the group as they take more in terms of time and energy. And it seems we've already touched on that. And I think Pam and I might have a little overlapping in both of what some of these handouts are, but I'm going to just let her kind of take that one and run in regards to care versus caretaking later. At times I think group members, in an effort to identify even just that good intention, they may end up telling an individual what she's feeling and what she's needing out of where they've walked in that, and that can just be a red flag. When a group member who is sharing is not being listened to, that's a red flag. And any time I think that anyone goes into prayer for a group member without asking permission, I don't see that as okay. A group guide, that's from a group guide perspective. If we or you are feeling dependent on your small group for your support, Lisa touched on that, very well said, that that's not okay. And just a basic lack of respect for the principles in the covenant, if you're seeing that being played out. And as a group member, a group leader, if you have a yes or a no coming from an outside pressure, you know, when it gets to people pleasing and so forth, as needs arise in your small group. Maybe that's as simple as the small group has a desire to get together outside of your morning or your evening together, and you are not feeling prompted to coordinate that. And rather than putting that out there, you invite someone else to take that on. And that's just being authentic to what you are able to say yes to. So moving into small groups with good boundaries. women have space to tell truth about themselves because they're safe there's an intentional focus there's a rhythm to that these women did not sign up for a book club and we don't want to facilitate as if it was so we've got this whole other element going this Holy Spirit gig, this God gig and we want to be able to I'd say that just requires intentionality on the leaders part and the fact that they've all signed a covenant shows that there's accountability there too. So we want to keep that at the forefront, that there needs to be intentionality. So if it's just kind of flying by the seat of its pants, it's probably not being very well led and maintained. So a group with good boundaries is a group of women realizing this is not the time to just say everything they think, Just random chatty chat. No gossip is happening. A woman's expectation is not on the group members or leader to fill her needs. That's clearly laid out in the covenant, and that's a very valid principle. The group respects the leadership of the group guide as she needs to redirect. Hopefully, as you need to step in at times and so forth, that is being respected by your group member. And if it's not, then that is an issue that you're going to need to press into. And rather than letting someone's defiance to your voice trump the situation, that would be a time where you'd have to step in, even though that can be really uncomfortable. Group members are able to stay present to her own process and feelings. Because she's not being asked to carry the pain of other members, She's able to go, you know, in response to this question, I feel blah, blah, blah. No one's putting on her to carry other people's stuff. Now, if she gets hooked and chooses to do so, you can't control that. You know, as you see it rise, you're going to be dealing with that. But a rightly ordered teaching and a rightly ordered group allows people to be processing their own journey, their own feelings, and so forth. Talkative women submit to time limits. Quiet women have the opportunity to share without feeling as if they need to interrupt. The group guide is able to care for these members out of the fullness of who she is, knowing she's God's and the dependency in that. The last two is just conflict is dealt with, and the group guide is reminding the women of the principles of the covenant. I would say if that's not happening, that you are putting reminders out there, you might want to look at that. Is that either you feeling a little passive and letting things slide because you want to be gracious? Or is the group just dynamic and just a bunch of people just signed up for this covenant thing and wanting to play this out right? But I would just say typically, when you're leading a small group for any duration of time, there'll be some reminding the women of what we're all here for. On the next page, I just top it off with just permission. That was just a word that I was getting as I just think you as leaders have said yes to something significant. And the women coming have said yes to something significant. Yeah? Oh, examples of struggles in small groups and sample practices that you guys are going to play out. Lisa, what time did I start? So I know. Okay. Basically, as you are the spiritual authority over your group, you each here have permission to interrupt, redirect, offer gentle and firm reminders, connect with a group member one-on-one as needed, break from going around the table at times to offer some specific time for prayer, like Nancy was talking about, encourage women to share a bit more by offering questions ask your group for a brief silence at a random time because you're just sensing that's needed in order for everyone to rest a bit you can just facilitate that reminding women of certain covenant principles and just whatever other permission you are in need of as a leader as you are led by God that's your gig That's what you're signed up for. So that can be a little bit uncomfortable. And just the piece that's hard about that is there's just always this tension between here we are dependent on God as leaders, and here there's actually something I need to do in action, and that tension between the two and the dependency and the wanting to be nice and yet firm and have authority and yet step back. And there's tension. And I don't, no one's asking anybody here to systematically figure out how you can avoid that tension from happening, but to live in it. To basically know this is what it is, to accept it, and to know that that tension's necessary and it's going to exist. and as leaders, learning to love well in the midst of that with your God. And that's a little bit of what we're going to practice. I'm going to let you, and as you heard, we have just about four minutes. I'm going to assign you a number. You have numbers one through six. And I need some brave soul to demonstrate a phrase. You're going to see an issue, and you're going to see a phrase that the group guide, it's just a sample. It's a little Emily Hattie a wording to it. This is probably not what you'll say, but if you need to throw it out there one time to see how it fits you, grace you. And then you'll add your own wording and personality the next time. But the bottom line is getting it out there once and trying the hat on, seeing how it feels, and just permission for you to be a learner in it and not to know exactly how to do it. So I will just say you're one over here. you're two, you're three, you're four, you're five back there, and you're six here. And I don't know if we want to even out a little bit more or if one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. That would probably be wise. Could a couple of you come over to Marilis and Linda's table? Anybody willing? Okay, thanks. Yep, I know. We've got morning blend all over. No, Marlis, you're okay. Thanks. Okay, so what I just want you to do is read through your number. Let's talk about conflict and listening. Now, my mother, God rest her soul, had one response to conflict, and that was take a breath before you say something. And you know, it works. Although we're going to hopefully as a group, we're going to put up a bunch of information as you share it on conflict and how you deal with that. And then what I'll do is after this is over, I'll give you a handout that can be sent out either by email or something, so you don't have to write all these down unless you want to, okay? That'd be nice. Oh, thanks. Perfect. Thank you. Wow. Youth. Well, let's talk about listening. conflict and listening. Now don't those two seem to be just like opposite ends of the spectrum? But I think that oftentimes conflict arises when we are listening because we start hearing what somebody else says and stuff starts kind of bubbling up in us and we can as long as we never ever interact with anybody, we never have conflict or at least that works for me. I'm pretty good in the morning when it's just me. But when we are actively, clearly listening, which is a very good thing, that's when oftentimes stuff comes up. The other time conflict often happens is when we just don't quite get all the information. And so we're listening through our own grid and those types of things happen. So who thought this up? You are the best. And you are the best runner. Yes. Okay. So should we start with conflict? All right. What are some situations that you've had where conflict has arisen or just are ripe for conflict in your small groups? When people make assumptions about what you should Great. Another? Yep. Disagreement with teaching. Opposing needs. What's the definition of the law that you need? If someone needs to talk to the military, they need to go backwards. It can come up in a lot of different ways, but when you're sensing that in your group, two people are in one place and three people are in another place, and you're not too sure how to help them be together. And sometimes it comes to a head in a verbal context or a type of talk. that's what i was just thinking that's good yeah no well not because i thought it Okay. Should we start kind of working through some of these, or do we have a couple more we want to throw up? Ooh, yeah. Divisive subjects. Y'all vote the way I do, don't you? of course we're all lockstep aren't we okay okay now assumptions kind of pop up because we just we've lived our lives and we have there's a lot of stuff and when you're as old as me there's a lot of stuff that you've kind of sorted through and personally I thought about things and my assumptions were considerably different 10 years ago than they are today and I'm pretty sure that they're going to be a lot different 10 years from now than they are today. Has that experience happened to any of you? Okay, so my assumptions are that teenagers are very difficult until I went on a mission trip with a bunch of teenagers and I found out they were incredible. So that's one of the places where if I'm working from a standpoint of this particular topic is not fun, and you're working from the assumption that this particular topic is interesting and enlivening, those assumptions are going to be conflicting. Is that true? Okay. So what are some of the things that we can do to help our group members come to a point where you get to be who you are, and you get to be who you are, but yet we can listen to each other? Mm-hmm. And as a group leader, we can even help to point them out. That you're probably, are you thinking this way? And is this what you're thinking? Kind of before we even get to our group, I'm so happy to have a thing that happens every week is we go for the covenant. And in that covenant, we talk about mutuality and sex. And I think it's a really good idea to suggest that to have that covenant on the table. And just having the presence of that covenant on the table and our closet helps us to kind of re-focus that on that. We can sometimes do it with humor. I can catch myself. For example, in my upbringing, my father-in-law, he would have never admitted that he was always right, but you probably could tell if you just lived around him for any length of time. And I was raised in an environment where having an opinion was, pretty much everybody had one, and we didn't care necessarily if they agreed. They just happened to overlap, and sometimes they bumped, and sometimes they didn't. So if I would make a joke about the fact that, oh, I'm supposed to think that because you do, it would kind of lighten the situation, and sometimes he could be open to it, other times he wasn't. Within our group, we can sometimes take on a position of saying something funny about ourselves, not in a hurtful way, but kind of point out that I'm looking from my own grid, and I'm looking through my own assumptions. And that makes it a little safer for somebody else to say, well, I guess my assumptions are here. Does that make sense? I think if I know it's in my cup and I'm in a group, I have to be aware of my own behavior. And that's one thing I've done in the last 15 years. In order to not put my attention on somebody else. And if I can be aware of my own behavior, like I totally disagree with what this person was saying about what he believes, But if I'm a group leader, my non-verbals, my body posture, my language needs to be open and loving and kind in the group. Maybe even that can, like that comes with. I can actually, if I can keep my assembly world open, I've actually learned things that I didn't agree with before. and i've gone like no i need to pay attention to what this person is because i learned or if i disagree i can just say well thank you for sharing what you shared i mean if it's not against scripture or you know scripture mainly totally out of whack i can then later on go like this generally. But the thing is, I need to step hard. So I think one of the things you're saying is in that, one of the ways of listening well is to maybe ask some questions about where that without sounding condescending where that, tell me more about that. What are you thinking? How did that play out in your life in ways that can help you have a window on their world? Very good. Did my world grow up? It was just knock down, you know, so I didn't learn. So if we can open ourselves to not everything is black and white. either truth or not truth, then sometimes we can find the places where we mesh together. I think assumption can quickly jump to judgment. So finding a place to kind of discernment Yeah, did you hear that? Assumption can quickly jump to judgment. And so interjecting or disarming those assumptions before they move so strongly into judgment, I think that's excellent. Yes? It seems like, and maybe, like I'm picturing in a group dynamic that sometimes someone's really giving their opinion scripturally or spiritually about something, or even the response someone's saying well i don't agree with it you know if you can give as a leader some clarifying statements for this is how you feel you know like you're talking about how you feel about this and helping and sometimes just to leave it left out there feels uncomfortable in protection of some of the other women maybe they're wondering Correct. Yep. And some of the things that helped me ground myself in not being right, because I could be really right, is that there are a lot of scriptures that point to the fact that we see in part, we prophesy in part, we see but through a mere dimly. So it's, we as a body together need each other to be able to discern anything, really. Occasionally, we get something pretty clarifying from the Lord directly. But oftentimes, it's within community and within touch points with each other that we actually do get more discernment and confirmation. So if we kind of work from that process, and even before it talks about the fact that we, in community, know more than what we do individually, it kind of sets a table for the fact that one person is not an authority. You think? Okay. Did we kind of hit disagreements with teaching yet? That one's really kind of fun, isn't it? I kind of like that one. because I think it's easier to be really kind of vocal and in conflict with the author who's not there than it is, so that really can get some good discussions going. But then I'm kind of a, you know, I like conflict, so. Opposing needs. How can we deal with those? Where, say it again how you said that, Where part of the group is wanting a support group and part of the group is wanting a strict teaching group. If there are a lot of people who just want to check in and there are other people who are wanting to get to the need of what came along. How can we as leaders balance that? Because there's good in both. One of the things I learned a couple years ago was not really start out with a check-in, like start out with sort of a check-in around the book? Like what is the technique in the book? I think that's something I learned from you because I can really go on the side of feeling stuff. So I could get way over on the side of, oh, aren't we all happy together? And we never got to the book. I mean, there was a point where we needed to do the other side, too. So that was something I learned from you. Yes? I think another piece is clarifying how quickly you can start. So if there are groups, you decide with the group or have the decision to do it. Or say, this is how the people can do it. Or this is how the staff is going to do it. So people come in and agree about what they're going to do together. That's a great boundary setting that this is not a support group. We're here to learn from each other. We're here to support each other, but we are not a support group. Offering other options. Offering other options? Say someone's just got an issue going on that they really want to spend some time, and it could even be related to the topic, but it doesn't work. Or people are just really getting sidetracked because they want to get to know each other. Just to offer getting together outside of the group or another resource for them outside the group. Just acknowledging the need, but then offering another. Did you all hear that? Acknowledging the need, but yet providing alternate resources or alternate time. Did you? Yeah. I think there's a leader who's remembering Great. Okay, I think we're, yes. One more thing that really helped was after we had, whatever year I learned, because my folks had already kind of got really used to a section kind of thing, I had to kind of regroup from that. So one of the things I said when I kind of made this change was, I kind of began with saying, out of respect the local work that you have done this last week, I'm going to start with this question. You know, I think that's a really good point, that when we as leaders are going to shift gears, it's pretty good to be verbal about it and not just try to get them and avoid the statement, but actually just put it right out there. Okay. Well, from here, we'll get this out to you either by email or handout, and we. Emily's done all of this great writing. Thank you, thank you, thank you. But I will do that part. And right now, Pam's going to come and talk with us. My name is Pam Shannon, and I am part of Morning Blend. And this morning I'm going to be talking a little bit about caregiving versus caretaking. And it's really my intention to offer some tools this morning, not necessarily answers, which for some of you that could be a little disappointing because if you're like me, we like answers because answers make life neat and tidy, don't they? So caregiving versus caretaking, what is the difference? And how does that actually look as we are relating to one another in our small groups? Here in women's ministry, we really want to provide a place where women can come and safely lay their stuff out if they choose to do so. But this can be awkward at times for us, especially as leaders, and it can feel a little bit out of control, as we've already talked about. And then what can sometimes happen is in our enthusiasm to be a good leader, we can have a tendency sometimes to rush in and to say or do something that we think is going to resolve that tension and make things better. So I think for me, I feel one of the essential parts of caring for others is really knowing and understanding what is and is not our responsibility as leaders. And this is a place of trusting God. We trust that he knows and understands the situation better than we do. We trust that he cares deeply and is fully able to meet the need. And we choose to believe that he is actively working on behalf of those around us. And so trusting God enables us to take a step back and allow that space for the Holy Spirit to do his work. And then we are free from taking on responsibility that is never meant to be ours. Another important piece of caring for others is respecting their personal journey. And this puts us all on level playing field. It's important because all of us are in need of knowing truth, and not one of us has all the answers. Each one of us is in the process of transformation, and that process is going to be unique to each individual. And we cannot assume, whether we're a group member or a leader, we cannot assume that we know just exactly what that other person is thinking, feeling, or what they need at any given time. And so we choose to honor that person and respect their personal journey by not offering unsolicited advice. Just leave space. Be a good listener. Before we go any further into some of the specifics, I want to be a little vulnerable and share with you a problem that I have. And maybe some of you can relate. My problem is that wherever I go, my mouth comes with me. And that isn't always a problem, but it was last week when my 28-year-old daughter called. And she was in the middle of some kind of stressful circumstances, and she really just needed to vent. And, you know, that happens a lot for us as human beings, and it happens a lot in our group. So I'm on the phone with my daughter, and she's just venting about all the things that are making her feel overwhelmed. And what do I do? I just kick it full speed ahead into mom gear, if you know what I mean. And I start to offer her advice. So I'm kind of imagining now what some of you 20-somethings might be thinking as you may relate to your mom. So I'm offering her advice, and I wrap it up, my advice giving, by saying, you know, Kelly, you know what you need to do is you just need to set some boundaries. And she did. She says, Mom, I don't really need this right now. And so I apologized for butting in, and she apologized because she said, I'm a little crabby, and so all is good. In fact, we laughed about it when I asked her if she minded if I shared the story. But I was not being a caregiver to my daughter. I was being a caretaker. And that is not what we want to do. So we're good for now, me and my daughter, until the next time I open my big mouth and offer advice that I shouldn't be offering. So anyway, what though if a woman in our group asks for our advice? Should we give it? Maybe. Should we refrain? maybe what if we sense God speaking should we share that openly out loud or should we keep it to ourselves and pray about it and this is where it gets really hard for those of us that like answers a few weeks back Vicki Degner spoke to our group leaders in Morning Blend and she mentioned holy listening talked a little bit about that and what it can be like to listen for three voices. Keeping an open ear for God, an open ear to herself and what might be going on inside of her, and an open ear to the other person all at the same time. Allowing that sacred space before we respond too quickly and allowing room for the Holy Spirit to work, even though, as we've talked about already, it may feel a little tense in that moment. I think it's good to recognize that we can do this as we're trusting our Father, and to also know that we're not going to do this perfectly. That's hard. It's something we're going to grow into, and we're going to make mistakes, and I just want to say that's okay. It's part of learning. If you would open your little packets, you have some yellow handouts, and I just want to draw a little attention to those. The first one, I think, is being responsible. If you could find that one. We're not going to take time to go through this, but if you would please, I think you will find this a wonderful, wonderful tool. On the left-hand side, it says, when I feel responsible for others. That would be the caretaker. So if you want to write caretaker above that, you can. The other side, then, is when I feel responsible to others. That is the caregiver. And we're not going to go through all those, but if you would please take some time to do that whenever you are able. This sheet helps us to identify what our motives are as a leader and the corresponding results. Then you have the handout, Role of a Facilitator. Oh, rather, I'm sorry. Yes, yes, Role of a Facilitator. This helps us to really bring more definition to what is our responsibility and what is not our responsibility. I think that this, if you read through this when you have time, it will really provide a lot of freedom for you as a group leader. And then the last one, appropriate caring responses. This is where I want to spend a little bit more time, and we're going to get into some specifics. It's really important for us. I think one of the best things that we can do for our group is to be a good listener. And a lot of that is done just in nonverbal communication, but I want to address some of the verbal responses that we can offer. And these are real concrete. For some of you, they just come so naturally you probably don't even think about them. But I still think it's good to address it. And I kind of have laid things out in a progression here. First, that just active listening piece of just letting the person know that you've heard that they have just shared something by saying, you know, thank you, I really appreciate that, or thank you for being so open. Just a very brief comment. And it's good to vary that a little bit. For instance, if we went around after everybody shared, we said, thank you for sharing, thank you for sharing, thank you for sharing, thank you for sharing. It doesn't sound as though we're really engaged with a group. So vary those responses a little bit. And then the next group, affirming responses, these are ways that we can offer genuine encouragement. And every person needs encouragement. These can also be really helpful when you have a person in your group that might be extra quiet or shy, because when they are affirmed, it might make them, help them to feel more comfortable in sharing the next time when something shared is encouraging or affirming to them. Just say, you know, boy, I really appreciate what you bring to our group. I loved hearing from you today. That is really helpful for those that are maybe a little bit more quiet. And same with the next group, allowing room for deeper dialogue. These are not only good for the quiet member, and I'm mentioning the quiet member because sometimes I feel like as leaders, and I can even hear a little bit of this in our conversation so far today, is a lot of our time and attention can be spent on the person who is very needy or very verbal, and that can draw a lot of our attention in that direction. And so I just want to mention that we need to care for the quiet person as well. So sometimes questions are a good way to do that. It can help the person who might not be familiar with sharing on a feeling level. Maybe they're only sharing facts, and we would like to help them to maybe get in touch with their feelings a little bit more or share in a more intimate level, questions are really a good tool for that. And then on the flip side of that, if you have a real talkative member, you may want to limit the questions to them because they've already probably shared with ease about their feelings and all kinds of things, and to ask them questions is just going to invite more of that dialogue that perhaps you would like to leave room for somebody else to share. And then pointing to the Father. This is probably the most wonderful thing that we have as leaders, an opportunity to help others to turn their eyes toward Jesus, toward our perfect caregiver. And this is really a privilege for us as leaders. It can help the group to take the focus off of the problem, or it might even help to take the focus off of us as the leader, feeling like, oh, we need to offer some kind of solution. No, we can point to the Father. I just want to read the paragraph on the bottom there. These are only ideas meant to assist you in dialogue. They're tools, not answers. And Emily touched on this earlier. Use your own style and words to convey a heartfelt response. Be genuine. It is not so much about needing to offer the right response. It's not about that as much as it is being a caring presence to those that are in your group. Okay, so I've mostly talked about the individual care, but how do we balance caring for that individual and caring for the group as a whole? And we've already talked about that a little bit, so I'm not going to go into a lot of depth. But it's been mentioned that sometimes there's a woman in our group who is in a place of great need, and her situation or needs might begin to dominate the group time. And so what do we do at that point? I want to make a distinction between someone who is in need of extra care, like this particular day or on occasion, that's a very different situation than someone who dominates the group on a regular basis, and that's when we need to be a little bit more concerned. The discussion time when we come every time together, it is not going to be equally divided between every person. There's going to be a little bit of give and take, and there are going to be situations that come up when it is completely necessary to devote some extra time to support another individual. And this is a good thing. It's a good thing as a group to do that and to come around them and to spend some extra time if we need to. But if it begins to be the same person requiring extra care and extra attention over and over again week after week, then their needs begin to take precedence at the expense of everybody else. And that is no longer healthy, and it needs to be addressed in some way. So there's a difference between someone who needs care on occasion or today at this moment we need to be sensitive and available and present to that. That's a very different situation than someone who continues to kind of dominate the group. And some of this has already been addressed, but it's good to take time to be up front with the entire group. The covenant was mentioned. That's an excellent way to do that. We can take time either at the beginning or at the end of our group time to just say, we want to be sure that when we come together here every week, that everyone has an opportunity to speak if they want to. We can gently let them know that this is a safe place to share, but at the same time, we are not equipped to be a substitute for therapy. And I refer to the covenant, particularly the be filled statement, to just remind them that our dependency for truth and life must primarily come from God. And I guess I think this has already been mentioned as well. And somebody mentioned that in maybe Sophia's heart, you do this on a regular basis, to say it out loud before any discussion actually begins, to just remind people we don't need to wait for a problem to arise. Sometimes it can be avoided, not always, but sometimes it can be avoided if we just remind women and it helps to clarify the boundaries. If an individual continues to dominate by needing extra care or attention, it's probably going to mean that we need to talk with her privately and reassure her. I think you were already talking about that, Lisa, early on. Reassure her that you care for her and ask her if she just might consider utilizing some other resources to help her go through this time. And restoration through prayer is one of those. I think you probably all have those cards that you might be able to make available to her. So we can't address every care situation this morning, but I do hope that we've been able to offer you some tools. One of the challenges as a leader is that there isn't any one way to do these things, And we need to be open to the Holy Spirit. And this can be stretching for us. Yet I do have confidence that God is able to equip us for the things that he's called us to do. So, Nancy. Okay, I just wanted to tell you that I forgot to tell you. That this little purple sheet, all I put on this is... We had, on mission trips, we tend to put together a team conflict agreement, and this is one that we did and everybody signed, and so it kind of outlines what we agree to, and I thought it might be beneficial to just kind of have some thoughts about that. And the other thing I wrote or provided was this article by Tozer on provocation, and I just felt it was so amazing, his words, so I just wanted to give that to you to read. So I am going to ask that you pull out this other purple. It's kind of like orange. You may not have recognized it as purple, but then you might get a little holier if you did. Okay. On this, I'm not sure which page. The back of it, I believe, is what I want to start with first. Mother Teresa is just someone I just, as so many do, have admired. And her business card said, The fruit of silence is prayer. The fruit of faith, prayer, is faith. The fruit of faith is love. The fruit of love is service. And the fruit of service is peace. And if we can minister from wholeness in Christ, I think that peace does come. And if we get our orders out of whack, that's when we, I tend at least to get all agitated and upset about things. So I like to go back to her business card and just kind of, oh, okay, get things straight. On the opposite side, and also in your, I forgot to bring mine, but you have a little brown card. For any of you who are on the Purple Chord people, this prayer is provided to you for cleansing after prayer. We also use it in restoration through prayer. A lot of people use it for other things. I think it's really a beneficial discipline to when you have participated in ministry of some sort to step back and pray. You can use this prayer if you want. You can pray just however you wish, but to return that ministry to the Lord. So you're not carrying it around. It's not yours to carry. So I'm going to recommend, I'm going to encourage, not dictate, that would be wrong. that what did I do with my glasses? Are those mine? You know, when you get to this age I thought I brought them up. You know, when I was younger I thought, what is with these people with the glasses on and off thing? You know, if you're that offended by glasses, get contacts. But then I got a little older, and I realized you can't see anything out there if you have these on, and you can't see anything up here if you don't. So off and on. Sorry, guys. Okay. So with that, if you would take the side that does not have Mother Teresa's business card on it, We're going to walk through that. This is the prayer that's on the brown card. So, let's start with the first sentence. Can we read it together? Lord Jesus, thank you for sharing with us your wonderful ministry of healing and deliverance. Now, we might not consider our ministries to be that of healing and deliverance, But I suggest to you that you might be surprised at how much is happening within your small groups. It's really important, in my opinion, to remember that this is his ministry, not mine. We partner, we join, we submit, we plant, sometimes we reap, but we do not control the ministry, nor do we control the outcomes. If somebody is way inappropriate, you don't control that either. If someone is not getting better, you don't control that either. If somebody has a miraculous breakthrough, aren't you lucky to have been there? But you didn't control that either. The next sentence, if you'd read with me. Thank you for the healings we have seen and experienced today. And that is one of the blessings of ministry, that we get to keep coming back and coming back, And we get to see God up close and personal doing his stuff. And we get to participate. We're midwives in that process. We're not the creator. We're not the deliverer. We just help along the process. The fruit's not ours, but the joy is. The next sentence. But we realize that the sickness and evil we encounter are more than our humanity can bear. Isn't that the truth? Sometimes that joy is not joy, it's sadness. And we need to not carry too much of that with us. We have the authority to call on Jesus, not on ourselves. We have the authority to bring everything to the feet of Jesus and let him have the results. The next sentence. So cleanse us of any sadness, negativity, or despair that we have picked up. You know, and this is just so really important. Because, and it's even biblical. Because remember when Christ cast out a bunch of demons and they didn't have any, there was nothing to refill and they attached themselves to something else. Do you recall that? I can't remember which. I was going to look it up and I forgot. But we can, I think, well, read your Bible. You'll find it somewhere. It really is easy to, and I'm not trying to, you know, find a spirit or an evil thing behind every bush. But it is easy to pick up other people's stuff. And it is important that we don't do that, that we protect ourselves from that. And I'm going to ask that we read the next three together. If this ministry has tempted us to arrogance, anger, impatience, contempt, or lust, cleanse us of these temptations and replace them with humility, gentleness, joy, compassion, and peace. If any evil spirits have attached themselves to us or oppressed us in any way, we command them to depart now and go straight to Jesus Christ for you to deal with as you will. Come, Holy Spirit, renew us, fill us afresh with your power, your life, and your joy. Strengthen us where we have felt weak, and clothe us with your light, fill us with your life. Wrap yourself in Jesus. Ask for his strength. Ask for his joy, his life, his power. Ask for the infilling of the Holy Spirit. He wants to share with you. You don't ever wait until your car is on the side of the road without any gas. You always go back to the pump and you keep getting more so that you're not stuck. And in the same way, we need to keep going back to Jesus and going back to him and becoming more and more filled with him so we don't deplete ourselves. And on the other side of that, we also need to go to him with a fairly open agenda. don't tell him how you need to be fixed well I would suggest you don't tell him how you need to be fixed I have several times, he didn't do it my way and quite frankly when I've gone with a fairly open hand he's miraculously provided in solutions that I personally never ever would have come up with and if you'd read with me another sentence please and the Lord Jesus please send your holy angels to minister to us and our families and to guard us and protect us from all sickness harm and accidents there is scripture that says you have not because you ask not and I'm not saying that to be abusive I'm not saying name it and claim it But ask. God is really wanting to do whatever he can to make us, to enrich us, to enliven us. So if we go to him and ask, he's relatively likely to give us something that is going to bless us. and I just would like you to experience and feel the freedom to ask and receive from the Lord and our last sentence in this prayer we praise you now and forever Father, Son, and Holy Spirit and as often as possible praise you Jesus Amen Thank you, Nancy. Oh, good stuff. Okay, I'm going to have you pull out the green sheet. This is our last thing for today. And I, first of all, just want to remind you that you are all chosen. You're chosen not only by God, which is the first and greatest honor, but we also have chosen you as women to lead here at Open Door. And that was not a light decision. There was much prayer around all of you being present here as leaders. And what I would like us to do for this last little bit of time we have together is I'd like you to break into groups of two or three. And I want you to take a little bit of time with some passages from Peter. And you don't have to use them all. But there are some amazing things in these passages on your green sheet here. And I want you to take a look at those four questions there. First of all, as a believer, what rights do I have? You have some rights as a believer. And as a leader, what rights do I have? And then, as a believer, what responsibilities do I have? And as a leader, what responsibilities do I have? So those four questions there, as a believer, what rights? As a leader, what rights? And as a believer, what responsibilities? And as a leader, what responsibilities? I'm going to give you about six or seven minutes here in groups of two to three at your tables there. if you would get together and see what you can find together in those passages, and then we'll bring it back to a whole up here. Okay, I'm going to pull you guys back up here. There's lots of good stuff in there. You'd have more to unpack over the next month. You can take it with you. But I would love to just hear a few things that you discovered in your time talking here. Tell me a little bit about some of the rites we have as believers. What are some of the things that came up from that? To receive mercy. All right. I like that one. What else? To be lifted up. Yes. Yes. To receive grace. Great. The spirit of glory and God rests on us. Wow. The right not to be ashamed. Beautiful. The right to call on him. Good stuff. How about as a leader? What are some of your rights as a leader? You have the right to be clear-minded and self-controlled. Okay, the right to be clear-minded and self-controlled. Reward. Reward. All right. Yeah, as leaders, yep. We have a right to suffer with Christ. We get to share in the glory. Yep. Yeah. Yes.
