Matthew chapter 18, picking up our study where we left off last week in verse 15 through verse 20. If you were with us last week, you're aware of the fact that we are dealing with a passage of Scripture that is commonly known to most of us as the church discipline passage. Discipline in the church. The immediate context of our study is the entire chapter 18. What Jesus has been painting pictures of in chapter 18 is the childlikeness of the believer. In order for you to enter into the kingdom, disciples, in order for you to enter into the realities and the power of ministry in the kingdom, you're going to have to come into those things just like a child. And he took a little child and put this little one on his lap and said, whoever humbles himself as this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom. They are the ones who are going to be effective. And the principle we discovered was the principle of dependence. You're going to have to be dependent like a child. After he spoke of the dependence of children, he then spoke of the protection of children. Whoever causes one of these little ones of mine who believe in me to stumble, it would be better if a millstone was hung around their neck and they were cast into the middle of the sea. And the stumbling was not just stumbling into sin generically, but a stumbling away from childlike dependence. If you disciples or anybody else call my people, my little ones, away from a dependent relationship on me to self-sufficiency, even if it's self-sufficiently doing good things, it would be better if a millstone got hung around your neck. So we talked about the dependency of children. Then we talked about the protection of children. Then we talked about the care of children. Lost children. Verse 11. For the Son of Man has come to save the lost little ones who belong to me. And the Luke passage that is parallel to this, we remember, was speaking of lost ones who are unredeemed lost ones in the commitment of Jesus. And the reason for his coming was to find lost people in the world and call them into the kingdom. But what we discovered in this context was that it was being used by Matthew and by Jesus to speak of the lost little ones who are already part of the family of God, who wander off into sin and find themselves in deep, serious kinds of issues that could shipwreck their lives. And after we spoke of the dependence of children, the protection of children, the care for children, and the commitment of the Father to find the lost little ones, we then began to speak last week of the discipline of children. you remember that the overall context of our study is the training of the disciples preparing them for ministry and as well as the delineation i gave you there those four things that jesus is doing in matthew 18 he is also speaking very specifically and personally to the disciples disciples if you personally and this would need to be applied to you and to me if we personally want to enter into the realities of kingdom ministry we need to see ourselves as dependent children. We need to see ourselves, verse 11 to 14, as sheep who wander. We need to know that about ourselves, that I have this potential and propensity, and so do you, to even though we love Jesus, to wander away from time to time, even sometimes on a daily basis, getting foggy and getting our perspective and priorities wrong. We also need to understand and see ourselves not only as sheep who wander, but as shepherds who seek. And that dynamic that almost sounds like a contradiction was introduced last week, that every one of us are sheep and we need to know it. Every one of us wander. But every one of us at the same time we are wandering sheep are called by God in the body of Christ to be shepherds to one another, calling each other back to our real priority, to our real focus. And that needs to be happening all the time. And it is in that vein of being a shepherd that we read verse 15 through 20. And if your brother sins, go and reprove him in private. Be a shepherd, go pull him back. If he listens to you, you've won your brother. But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every fact may be confirmed. And if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax gatherer. Truly I say to you, whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. And whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they may ask, it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven. For where two or three have gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst. Let's pray as we begin. Father, my prayer this morning is that every one of us, first of all, would see ourselves as children who love you, who are sitting on your lap this morning and learning from you, but like children who love you, we also wander and get lost. I pray that we would see ourselves as sheep who have, again, this inclination to get lost. I pray, too, that we would see ourselves, all of us, at the same time as shepherds who lovingly, gently, but consistently are pulling each other back in. I pray that dynamic and reality be released among us even as we learn about it. In Jesus' name, amen. Last week we began this. I told you last week that there are five aspects of discipline or shepherding that we need to understand. I gave you three of them last week. First of all, I gave you the when of discipline. When do you do a discipline? Verse 15, and if your brother sins. That's when you do it. If your brother sins. The key word there is the word sin. It is the word hamartia, and consistent with the picture of the lost child that we saw in verse 11 to 14, or the wandering shepherd. The Greek word hamartia here means to depart, to miss the mark, or to go astray. It is important that we understand again that when we're dealing with Matthew 18 discipline, we are not dealing with stubborn rebellion. We are not dealing with angry defiance or arrogant immorality. It is a brother or sister who, like a sheep, began to wander away. And now they're lost, and the sin they may be involved in may be extremely serious and life damaging. But the reason they left was not, I'm going to do it. They just got distracted, and now they're in serious things. And if a brother wanders away, that's when you apply discipline and shepherding. The who of discipline was the second thing we talked about. Who does the discipline? Who does the shepherding? And the thing we found out was that we've got some real impressions about this. Most of us, when we think of church discipline, especially Matthew 18 discipline, we think of boards and elders and ecclesiastic kinds of governmental movements upon people. But the real truth is that Matthew 18 discipline happens between people all the time. If your brother sins, you go and reprove him in private. If he listens to you, you have won a brother. Real church discipline, according to Matthew 18, is happening between you and you and you. It's between us. It's a relational accountability, if you will. The picture we had in our minds last week was that of a herd of cattle or a herd of sheep. And we're moving along as the body of Christ together. And we're moving toward the kingdom more and more and moving in the context of the kingdom. But like sheep and like cattle, we kind of get out of step from time to time. And in the course of life together, we just keep pulling each other back in. Sometimes it's a gentle nudge, a little reminder. How many of you got nudged this week in one way or another? You don't have to raise your hand, but all of you did. In some way, you maybe got nudged and didn't even know that's what it was, but you got disciplined, you got brought back, you got reminded, you got a priority. Oh, yeah, it was happening to me in worship. You get disciplined in worship. All of a sudden, my only hope is you. I need to be reminded of that. That's a nudge. That's a nudge. You just get brought back and, whoa, I got all sorts of cluttery things right. You got nudged. Sometimes it takes more than a nudge. Remember we talked about getting cracked upside the head because you're not paying attention and you're ignoring the calls and so you've got to do that. And sometimes it's even more severe than that. Where the sheep has wandered far away and now they're on a cliff or they're in a thicket and they're about to die. And so it is we go after them with more force and try to bring them back. But the key issue is that it's a part of life. It's something that isn't the dictates of boards but of relationships between people. the why why do you do discipline in the church why do you do shepherding in the church well it says this that if you if they listen to you you've won your brother to win the brother that's why we do it the word win there was significant it means to gain a treasure the reason see i come to you and the reason you come to me to deal with sin in my life or in yours is not because i want to humiliate you if i'm doing it for that reason i'm the one who ought to be confronted. It's not because I enjoy having something on you and I like watching people stumble. If we're doing it because of that, we are the ones who need to be confronted. The reason we're doing it is to win a treasure. I come to you because I think you're a treasure. And I don't want you to move in a direction that's going to defile your capacity to minister in the kingdom. That's why you do it to me, because you love me. That's the why, to win a treasure. At that point, we realize that the whole flow of Matthew 18 has nothing to do with putting people out of the church. And we kind of had to deal with that because many of us have impressions. If you did a Matthew 18 on somebody, if somebody told you that, I did a Matthew 18, that meant, oh my, they put them out of the church. At no time in Matthew 18 is putting anybody in the church out of the church in view. Matthew 18 is constantly, all the way through the cycle, about bringing people back. The worst it gets is this. When somebody has left, decided to stay, we let them stay out there. But it's not about putting people out, it's about bringing them back. We made a clarification, though, that while Matthew 18 is about consistently bringing people back, there are people, according to the Word of God, that we will put out. That we will, with their desire to stay, are defiling the body of Christ, and because of their presence, out of protection for the body, there are people who need to be removed. But that's not a picture that we have in Matthew 18. is what we had in 1 Corinthians 5 when there was a person there who was in a sexual relationship with his father's wife. It was incest. And his staying in that church was arrogant immorality. I'm going to do what I want, when I want, and you can't tell me what to do. Paul called that in the body, not a stumbling brother who's fallen away from the Lord and has gone a different direction away from the body, but this person's staying in the body and is defiantly doing whatever he wants to do. He called him leaven. And leaven is going to permeate the whole body. And if you let that stay before you know it, sexual immorality is going to permeate that entire body because the message is going to be it's okay. And what you need to do, first of all, for that brother in sin, his restoration, but really the priority is the protection of the body. In those kinds of circumstances, you remove them out. Acts 20, Paul spoke of wolves who will come in from among the body. And those people do not get pulled back. They get put out. Luke chapter 2, Matthew 16, beware the leaven of the Pharisees. Their leaven was the teaching of legalism. Their leaven was the lifestyle of hypocrisy that polished the outside of the cup, looked very holy, but inside it was full of vile venom. You don't make friends with those people. You don't pull them back in. You put that out. And so a distinction was made when we see a brother stumbling and wandering into sin, not arrogant defiance, but they're getting into trouble. we want to go after those wounded, broken people and bring them back. But when you see arrogant immorality, legalistic leaven, you go for those people and get them out. The reason last week that it was so important that we make those distinctions is because more often than we think, our discipline is applied in the opposite way it ought to be applied. All too often, we are putting out the people who need to be brought back, And we are holding to ourselves and allowing to remain those people who need to be put out. And when that happens, the movement of the Spirit in the body of Christ dies. The life of God is quenched. The presence of God departs. And bruised reeds do get broken off. And smoldering wicks do get snuffed out. The ones who really need the help who are wandering off end up continuing to wander and never get their healing. this matter of discipline in the body is a matter of life and death to the church let's get to the new stuff this week the way of discipline i'm into w's really heavy this week the process of discipline i'll give you a p i could do this whole thing in peas you know anyway forget it jeff van viner gives me such a hard time when i do this they all rhyme There are four phases of the discipline. Phase number one is back in verse one. We've already spent some time in this. Phase one is go and reprove him in private. The word reprove there is very significant. When I think of being reproved, I think of somebody kind of coming up to me with a scowl on their face, wagging their finger at me to reprove me. The word reprove is the Greek word elenco. It means to shed light on. It means to expose to the light, to bring something out into the open. and quit hiding it. Jeff calls it breaking the silence. The reason it is extremely important that we shed light on the wandering of a brother or sister is because just like a sheep, when you begin to wander, what was the first thing we discovered about a child who was lost? When they were beginning to get lost on the front end of their lostness, they didn't realize they were getting lost. They were not trying to get away from the father. They were following an enticement and they didn't know they were doing that. They didn't realize they were thinking wrongly. They didn't realize that their priorities had been jumbled. And so it is we shed a light on that kind of thing for each other and it's a gift. Somebody sheds a light on something that I'm doing or a direction that I'm moving that's harmful to me or to the body and that light comes, I look at it and it's something I didn't see until they shed the light on it. And I go, whoa, I didn't want to do that. I didn't realize that I was doing that. And you look up, and then you come back. That's what it means to reprove. Shed a light on it. Get it out in the open. Say it out loud. Give them a gift. Reprove, that's what that means. It's clear from the text that reproving and having that dynamic happen between us all the time as a part of lifestyle is an essential ingredient for our health. That we do it matters. How we do it matters possibly even more. how do you shed a light how do you bring a reproof number one out of Galatians 6 2 not in particularly this text but in Galatians 6 2 it says the way you shed your light is shed your light gently shed your light gently don't take the light that exposes their sin and shine it in their eyes so they're blinded do it in a gentle way one of the things I said about Galatians 6 and I've said it many times is that the picture I get of the stumbling brother in Galatians 6, it's the same kind of thing, is that one of the reasons we do it gently is because when I think of a stumbling person, I've never seen anybody stumble and look good when they did. If you've ever stumbled into sin, you're humiliated by the fact that you did. Again, we're not talking about arrogant, I'm doing what I want. You got your eyes off the mark, and now you're into something that's destroying your life. And when you get picked up, you just pray to God that somebody does it gently, because you're humiliated. You feel shame. You feel, oh, I'll never run again. I'm useless to God. Those are all lies from the pit. And so it is when we come to a brother who's stumbled or gone astray, we come to them gently. Let me tell you something else that helps you do it gently. The text says this, looking to yourself because you're going to stumble too. One of the things that helps me be gentle with you is realizing that when I'm acting as a shepherd to you, shining a light on your sin, that I'm a sheep who's right now acting like a shepherd. And because I'm a sheep, you know what I know about me? For sure, I'm a wanderer just like the one I'm going after. That helps you be gentle. That helps you be gentle because next time the reproof is going to come to me. And I hope they don't shine it in my eyes. I hope they do it gently. It's important that we do this. It's important how we do it. It's amazing how sometimes when we bring a reproof, I know you know how this feels, but all of a sudden you'll see a friend who's doing some really goofy things, and you'll start being able to figure out their whole problem. You know if they would have only done da-da-da-da-da-da-da. And the problem you're solving for them is one you don't happen to have. Ever notice that? I love it. In Job chapter 12, verse 4, Job is responding to the help that he's getting from these three counselors who are giving him all sorts of reasons why he's sick. And he said this, He who is at ease holds calamity in contempt. Think about that. He who is at ease holds calamity in contempt. What that means is you guys come to me and you don't have the boils. You haven't lost your family. You haven't lost all your earthly possessions. And it's incredible how you hold my calamity in contempt. You got it all figured out why I'm a mess. It's incredible how you can figure that out when you don't have the pain. It's incredible how you can figure out your friend's marriage, isn't it? When you're not stumbling the way they are right now. It's amazing how you can figure out the problems with somebody else's kids when your kids aren't doing what their kids are doing. It's incredible. He who is at ease holds calamity and contempt. Don't do that. Don't do that. Realize that whatever you're shining the light on is something that in some time in your life will probably be shown on you, so do it gently. Very important word. You do it in private, too. It says here, reprove him in private. This is simple respect, I think. Common courtesy. It's a protecting of the person's dignity. It's an expression of love for me to go to you before I go to you and you and you and you. You've had that done to you? Or someone coming to you, you find out later, before they came to you, everybody else knew before you knew. Doesn't that grieve you? It hurts. You've not only had it done to you, you've done it. There are a few things that wound more. that are harder to retrieve than half-truths, lies, slander. It's called gossip. Let me tell you how it works. We've got gossips pigeonholed. You know, gossips are, you know, you have this little image. They're all, these are all vile. Every one of us get involved in this. Let me tell you how it works. The dynamic of it is this. Let's say I have an issue with you. Anybody here want to have an issue with me? Just raise your hand. I'll be mad at you. Okay, you, okay. Okay, I'm angry at you. what happens is if I get angry at him I'm going to have feelings and you get angry at somebody or something's inappropriate in your life and you start getting a lot of feelings stirred up those feelings are unpleasant but they are also a gift and you know what they're designed to do? they're designed to drive me to you they're yucky feelings I can't sleep and they are designed to go I got to go talk to you and let's just straighten this out and let's get to where we can embrace again and deal with this whole thing I might even have some wrong information about why I'm angry you know I heard this and that let me just go right to him That's what the feelings are there for. But it's kind of scary to go to him. It's a little bit risky, and that might be a lot of work. And so instead of going to you, I'll go to you and talk to you about him. And what's nice about it, let me tell you how it works, so you don't think anybody who does this is this. You've done this. The reason I go here is because it takes the edge off the anger. You ever notice that? It takes the edge off the anger. It kind of dulls it. It's not bubbling and boiling anymore. Now I can sleep because what I've done is I've vented. But I didn't vent where I needed to. I didn't bring it where it needed to go. I brought it over here so I could just put the edge off it. But now the edge is off it, and so it's not as serious a problem. I think even I've solved it. I feel better now. Thank you for letting me share with you about that idiot over there. Okay, it really helps me. Now I feel better. But I've not done the work, have I? I haven't done the work. And then the anger, because it's not a subtle issue, is going to come up again. I guarantee it. And I've already done it with him, so now I'll do it with him over here. And I'll take the edge off the same thing. And we just keep going and going and going and going to you, my brother, a fellow sheep, a fellow shepherd, is really a lot of work. It's very threatening. It might even risk the relationship. And see, the way I paint it that way, it's not about everybody being a vile gossip. It's that we're scared to go where we ought to go and do the work we need to do. But the word here is this. If real discipline and shepherding is to take place in the body, it is not appropriate for me to bring my anger or my frustration or my concern there, there, or there, when it belongs here. Fundamental, I can't even tell you how many rifts, church splits could be solved if Matthew 15 was something we were experiencing. Go to them in private. Another reason you need to go in private is not to just short-circuit gossip, but because sometimes the issues I've got with you or the thing I perceive in you is inaccurate. Have you ever done that? See, I've got a thing, and I see something, and I perceive something, but I'm making the equation. I've added up 2 plus 3 plus 5, and I didn't have the numbers right. I didn't have all the information, and I'm seeing something in the life there that looks very clearly to me wrong, but I don't have all the information. You know where I could get all the information? From the person. Go to them. Do it in private. Before you spread it all over here, misinformation that going to them would provide. Common sense. This is just simple. That's phase number one. But they don't listen to you. You don't have this wonderful sense that you've won a brother. Maybe they disagree with you. I don't agree with the confrontation. And they don't listen to you, and they keep on moving what looks to you like away from the fold. What do you do then? Phase number two, verse 16. Take one or two more with you. Stop right there. take one or two more with you for the purpose of what now if I were to take this passage the way I've always applied it it's very clear the reason I take two or more with me to you is to gang up on you and so what I do is I find and pick them very carefully who I choose I find two or three people who agree with me about your sin follow that you think he's a jerk how about you you come on with me We're going to make sure this guy comes back to our way of thinking. You've done that, you've had it done to you. That is not what this verse is. What is the purpose of bringing two or three? It tells you right in the text that by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every fact may be confirmed. This is out of Deuteronomy chapter 19 verse 15. And what it is, even in the Old Testament, was designed by God to be a protection for the people of Israel. It is a protection for who? for both people involved. It is a protection for the person being confronted. Why would he need protection? Because maybe the accusation is inaccurate. Maybe it isn't fair. And so you bring two or three people to witness this. They are not witnesses to the sin. They are not coming, yeah, we agree with him, and we're against you. That is totally inappropriate. If it happens like that, you got abused. The two or three are objective mediators who come into the conflict between two brothers or two sisters and help them hear each other and help them clarify the facts of the incident. You say, he said this, but I'm here and I don't hear him saying that. You're going to have to listen to each other every once in a while, even between brothers, people who love each other. You get on communication scales where you're going like this. I mean, you never can. Oh, okay, and it's like this. Everything you say exasperates it. You bring in two or three to confirm every fact. Here is what he said. Here is what they said. And they help you mediate the whole thing. You come out of meetings. Let me just give you some examples of how a mediation like that might happen. Might come out of a meeting like that with the mediators saying this. There wasn't any repentance there on his part, that person we confronted. but the fact is as the facts just kind of came out what we really had was a misunderstanding here there wasn't any need for repentance so to have repentance would have been inappropriate as we just heard each other we've got a brother and a sister here who were kind of on different levels and we helped them hear each other and there's a restored relationship there but there wasn't any repentance necessary so everybody is back in the fold they really were uh they just needed to have some things clarified or you could come out of that meeting and they could say you know we shed some light on things, and as we were together, it became very apparent that the brother, the sister, was in sin. They'd been trying to deny it and move a different direction, but as we came, it was real clear that there was some real significant strain there, but you know what? We saw brokenness and repentance, and God came, grace was poured out, and he's back. It's a dead issue. They are restored, affirmed our love toward him, and nobody else needs to know. It's a done deal. Heaven sings. Or they could come out of that meeting and say, we did shine the light. There is some very significant sin. There's some major delusion as well. Denial, going to keep doing it, didn't want to hear, not listening at all, and at that point you go to phase three. Verse 17, and if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church, tell it to the church. What does that mean? Again, for a long time, I thought if it came to this, in fact, I've even taught it this way in years past, that if it comes to telling it to the church, that means you go and you tell it to the elders. Well, that could be a way you go if that's the appropriate circle of people that are in relationship with that person. But the ecclesia there, or the word church there, is ecclesia. And it doesn't mean church in an organized way that we think of it today. There weren't any elders, when Jesus used this word, tell it to the ecclesia. There weren't any elders anywhere. They didn't have the structure of the church yet. In fact, it wouldn't have been a church like this. The ecclesia for the 12 disciples would have been literally the 12 disciples. Ecclesia simply means the assembly or the gathering of the redeemed. Whatever the gathering of the redeemed is, whatever the size, if you've gone to them one-on-one, if you've brought a couple of mediators and they aren't bringing any reconciliation, tell it to the whole group is all that means. Tell it to the whole group. It's interesting because the group doesn't know yet. isn't that an interesting concept but you tell it to the whole group and the purpose of telling the whole group isn't get rid of him no the purpose of the whole group is let's all be the mediators now let's all go after George let's all go after Tom or Mary and let's go get her and just have a breakfast time with her and find out where she's at and what's going on and tell her or him we love him and come on back and this is what we see and we think you're wrong in this and by just bringing more people into it, hopefully bringing the brother or the sister back. The way I see it in the Matthew 18 context for the 12 disciples would have gone like this if it had happened right. Let's just say using your imagination, for example's sake. John's got an issue with Peter. Peter's doing something goofy, which isn't that hard to imagine. So it is that John, before he tells everybody else, goes to Peter and says, Peter, I don't know if I'm right or not, but I see this, and I'm just wondering where you are. And all of a sudden, John kind of realizes that they're communicating like this. It's just going nowhere. And he says, I don't know how to communicate to Peter. He's a brother in Christ. He's not my favorite person. But James and Andrew, I need you to come and help me mediate this thing. And maybe I am wrong, and you can tell me that when we go here. And they go and mediate it, and Peter just keeps on going, no, I'm not going to listen to this. It's at that point, the three guys would come back, and then they would tell the ecclesia. They would tell the 12. You know, this could happen in a kinship group. It could happen in a Bible study. It could happen at a board level. It could happen at this level, but I even wonder if at this level we would announce it unless everybody here knew the person. There are times that from this pulpit we will announce not a go after this person to bring them back, but we will from this pulpit from time to time in a very painful way announce that we have discerned that there is some leaven among us and we have put them out, and for your protection you need to know who they are. That would be announced. but this kind of thing of going to get them, I'm going to tell everybody they know, we got a brother or a sister, and they're stumbling. Let's go get them. Let's go get them and bring them back and bring them back and talk reason. I can't connect. Maybe you can. And that process has gone through, and now the pressure, really, of the entire body is being felt by this person, and the love is extended, and come on back, and you really are in sin, and I know you don't see it, but you are. You've had this happen. They're getting involved maybe in a relationship that's real inappropriate. They just want to hang on to it, and so they keep on going. They're dealing with some things at work that are very dishonest, don't want to see it, don't want to look at it, refuse to... Just keep telling people, go get them, let's go get them. Sometimes you'll have something with your kid. I know parents probably can't relate to this, but sometimes your kids don't listen to you. and it is like to a friend you're just like this and it's a grievous thing for a parent to realize they're not listening to me i know that at a very crucial time in my life as influential as my mom and dad have been on my life a crucial time when i was a wandering sheep the dad my dad and mom were the last person who could have come to me and called me back their voice was one i didn't hear and another person in the body and again nobody called it discipline then but that's what it was came to me and said, David, you are walking the wrong way. Come back. The light got shown. I looked up. I came back, and then I found my parents. You know what I hope? I hope that's happening here. I hope that's happening for my kids, because sometimes they won't listen to me. I hope it's happening to your kids, because sometimes they won't listen to you. I hope it's happening in all of our relationships, because sometimes we communicate like this, and other people need to get involved to shed the light to bring each other back. What if they still want to go away? Phase four, you let him be. You let him be. Why do we let him go and consider them or let him be to you as a Gentile or as a tax gatherer? Is it because we no longer care about him? No. Is it because we're going to wash our hands of him and we're just giving up on you? It's not because of that. It's because the light has gone on. You see, I've gone to him or her, and then we've brought more people, and then we've told everybody to shed the light, and we've all shown the light on what was going on here, but they kept going, no. And what the light goes on for me is this. Ah, see, I've been treating this thing all along like a wandering sheep issue, and I don't have a wandering sheep here. With all this influence toward this person, they keep on going their direction. We don't have a wandering sheep. We have a prodigal son who is basically saying to us, I want my sin. I like it out here. I have chosen this. When you hear that, leave them alone. Accept the decision. That's what Paul meant when he said those very hard words, I have turned them over to Satan. That does not mean I am calling demons on them, though that might happen. What he is saying, as I said last week, is I am going to allow this person to experience the full consequences of their choices. That is what the father of the prodigal did to his son. He didn't go chase him. He didn't go bail him out. He didn't pay his bills. He let him go and feel the full weight of the consequences. And as he let his son go, he did something else. He prayed like crazy. Oh, dear God, I pray that my son comes back before he dies. I think one of the hardest ministries, the hardest aspect of any ministry, I think the hardest aspect of loving anybody, maybe the hardest aspect of parenting a child, are those times when because of their willful choice to stay out there, we have to come to a point where we quit enabling and quit bailing out and say, I accept your choice. And then pray, oh God, move on that person I love. I pray they hit the wall, and I pray that it hurts. I pray that it doesn't kill them so that they can come back and be restored. Those are the four phases. The last point in this whole thing comes in 18 through 20. And it's the voice of God. And without getting into the details, because the details are going to be a little bit confusing, and I want to teach them to you, but I want to give you the overall picture of the purpose of 18 through 20. The purpose of 18 through 20, it's as if God is saying to us, you know something, this stuff of discipline and going to the person instead of out there and bringing people back and shining light on stuff is a hard thing to do. And you are going to have a tremendous tendency to do what all people do, and that is when issues that are hard come up, you're going to want to ignore them. And you're going to want to just put them off to the side, sweep them under the rug, hope they go away, call that God. But I want you to know something, that when you as a body begin to bring to light the things that are wrong in the body and begin to gently but firmly call people back, and make them accountable. I want you to know that I am never more working in concert with you than when you do that ministry. I am never more concerned and I am never more actively involved in your ministry when you are doing what I am committed to and that is bringing back the lost little ones. And it's going to be scary for you so I just want to give you a word right here that this is so important that I want you to know that all of heaven is with you when you do this. Let's look at the details. Truly I say to you, verse 18, whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. Whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth about anything, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven. Verse 18, whatever you shall bind shall be bound. Whatever you loose shall be loosed. As simple as I can make that. To loose someone is simply to say you are forgiven. To bind someone is simply to say you're not forgiven. I don't sense repentance. Your sin is still on you. These are concepts that Jews would have understood quite readily. It's a rabbinic term, binding and loosing. And the job of the rabbi or the ministry of the rabbi in relationship to people in their synagogue would have been to notice when sin was moving in someone's life, they would go to them just like this. And if there was repentance, they would say, I loose your sin from you. You are forgiven. and may the grace of God be upon your head. And there would be brokenness and tears and restoration and healing. And what God is saying here is this, what you loose on earth, I have already, and by the way, it's the perfect passive in the Greek, I have already in the past with effect till the present, loose them. So what you're loosing, I've already done, but I want you to know that what you're doing is in concert with what I'm doing. You have forgiven them, I have forgiven them too. You loosed it, I did too. But if in your ministry with one another you sense arrogant immorality, proud legalism, I'm going to do it my way, and you say to that brother or sister with your heart beating out of your chest because you're so scared about making the confrontation, I need to tell you, brother or sister, that your sin is still on you and may you feel the weight of all of that until God brings brokenness to you. You need to know that when you do that very difficult thing, All of heaven is with you doing the same binding. When you bind, I will bind. When you loose, I am doing it too. When grace is released, you need to know it's coming from heaven. I want you to do this. That's the overall point. And again I say that if two of you agree on earth about anything, what's the anything? Anything you want. No. You know how that verse has been used, don't you? I don't have time to share with you my anger about that, but ripped out of context. Bible waved around. Anything you ask in his name, if we agree, do we agree? Yeah! Let's! Oh, great. Isn't it amazing when you just stick with the context how the meaning becomes very simple and very clear? If two of you, who is the two? The two who've gone to the brother who's in sin, The mediators. And if you agree about anything relative to what? The discipline. You see repentance? Yeah, we agree. There's repentance. I'm going to do that. I'm going to forgive. You see, no repentance? And I ask God, bring brokenness. I will do that. Bring pain. I will do that. Bring conviction. I will do that. Anything you ask when you agree relative to a discipline of a child, I'm going to do it. I will be working with you. that word agree is a significant one it's a Greek word symphoneo what does that sound like to you? symphony literally what it means is when two people start to produce the same sound again here's the picture we're going to a brother who's in sin someone else has got an issue with him or there's even just a misunderstanding here there's an issue with two people the mediators come, two or three come and these mediators begin to what? produce the same sound they begin to go, you know, as this is kind of just emerging here we see this one who came to bring the confrontation is really the one who needs the confrontation and they begin to produce the same sound and if you agree, I will do anything you ask me to do as it relates to straightening this issue out and maybe there needs to be repentance here and I will do anything you ask as you begin to get a symphony produce the same sound relative to the brokenness that is needed and whatever you ask me to do on that person's behalf even if it is to let them go, I'll do that. Hit the wall, I'll do that. Bring conviction, I'll do that. We've experienced this. The best picture I have of this is sitting in a room with the elders and the staff. I don't know if I shared it in this service or not, but over the last three years, we have had to do five times the very difficult, gut-wrenching job of recognizing in our body leavening influences that were permeating the body in ways that would defile it. And when that happens, it is an elder issue. And I, without going into any details at all, can just replay in my mind those events of having the person or the people who were involved in those rooms frightened, scary we're dealing with people's lives we want to be gentle but the sin of the brother though there was a subtlety of it and words that sounded maybe okay but all of a sudden I would notice that among the elders and among the staff there would be I didn't even know this word before there would begin to be produced the same sound we don't see brokenness here we see rationalization we see delusion, we see all sorts of danger for our body if this person stays. And if you agree, then you move. And I will move with you. That is a powerful concept. When discipline is applied like that, the sheep are protected, the wounded ones get healed, the perpetrators get put out. For where, verse 20, two or three have gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst. Verses 18 and 19 we see the activity of the Father as it relates to discipline. Here you see the activity of the Son as it relates to discipline. I love this verse. I can't tell you how many times I've used it in a prayer meeting context when not many people came. Don't worry. Wherever two or three are gathered there he is. So let's pray and this is really important. A couple problems with using this verse that way. One is theological. I mean I'm sure you've thought of this when somebody maybe nobody's ever used that verse that way on you. Nobody's there and should go, well, we're ever two or three. Or in your little Bible study, there I am. The problem with that is that why do we need two or three for Jesus to be there? As far as I know, all you need is one, me. If I'm there and Jesus is in me, Jesus is here. That's all we need. You don't need two or three. The reason that doesn't make sense also is because of the context. What's he talking about? He's talking about the two or three, what? Of the discipline, who have gone to be mediators. And again, the word from Jesus to us is this. You need to know, beloved, I realize how hard this is. I realize it's easier to ignore it. It's easier instead of going to the one you have an issue with to go over here and here and here. I know that. I know your heart is going to be pounding out of your chest when you confront sin and when you shine lights and bring things into the open. But you need to know that I am never more with you. I am never more upon you. I am never more supporting you than when you are doing the work of bringing back my lost little ones. Where two or three of you have gathered in my name, I am there working on your behalf to bring you a symphony, to give you wisdom and discernment. And I am never more with you than when you're about the business of winning a treasure and being a shepherd. You know why in these three verses he brings this whole God thing up? Heaven is moving and Jesus is moving and I am with you. Makes it real big. You know why he does that? We know why he does that. It was revealed a couple weeks ago when he said in verse 11, you need to know that the priority of the Son of Man on earth is to save the lost little ones. The ones who belong to me, who wander away, the ministry of the Spirit in the church is to bring them back. And when you say yes to that responsibility and be about the business of bringing people back, I'm with you. This is my priority. It is the function of the shepherd. When one goes astray from the 99, to go get them, confront their sin, bring them back, win the treasure, It is the will of my Father, verse 14, that none of my little ones should perish. The perish there for a believer does not mean go to hell. The perish for a believer would be to waste his life. And all of that comes together to affirm again the truth of chapter 12, verse 20, when the prophet said of Jesus, what you need to know about Jesus is that a battered reed, he will not break off. A wandering sheep he will not let go. A smoldering wick he will not put out. But he heals broken reeds. He calls wandering sheep back. And he fans to flame the smoldering wick. Thank you.
