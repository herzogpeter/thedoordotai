Good morning. If we have not met before, my name is Doug Padgett, and I'm not the pastor here. I actually pastor at another church called Solomon's Porch. And the regular fellow who pastors here, his name is Dave, and he is in southern Mississippi at some speaking thing. And at least as far as the climate goes, I think I got the better end of the deal for a guy stuck in southern Mississippi. And happy Labor Day weekend. It is the time where in Minnesota we now all sadly say those three horrible words, summer is over, right? Could snow by Friday, and we just now all have to go home and put the lawnmower away and kind of get ready for things. And I guess what we get to look at here is the collection of people, a part of Church of the Open Door that don't have cabins, right? who cares about property taxes up in the lakes district right none of us it's their own problem well um i i was here a couple of weeks ago um well maybe a few months ago for two weeks in a row and at that time i said uh we're going to sort of go on a couple of dates together back-to-back weeks and sort of see how we like each other and after the second week i said well it's been nice spending some time with you and sharing our lives together, but I'll see you later. And now I show up again with that which we didn't know at the time, and so now I sort of feel like that odd neighbor that's kind of over all the time, you know, looking at things and staring around, so sorry. But we're going to share a few other thoughts and sort of go on a bit of a journey together, if you don't mind. The kind of Christianity that I come from is a Christianity that uses phrases, some of which don't make a lot of sense to me. I don't know if they make a lot of sense to anybody, but we still use them a lot. And one of those phrases is when people will say things like that someone's desire and someone's life should be Christ-like, that they should be like Jesus. And so people will ask each other, you know, do you feel like you're living a Christ-like kind of life or do you feel like you're living life, you know, like Jesus would live and all that. And I almost always conclude, and maybe you do too, if you're familiar with that kind of conversation, to say, well, no, not really. And maybe that's the reason for them asking the question in the first place, to sort of remind us, you know, that no, I'm not so much. But the other day I was thinking, you know, okay, Grant, I'm not very Christ-like, but in some ways, you know, Jesus isn't very much like me either. And I'm not supposing, I'm not trying to be flippant here, and I'm not supposing that Jesus, you know, ought to, you know, try to reach such heights or something. I'm not saying that. But it does seem to me that the kind of life that I live in, the world that I live in, the things that I do on a very regular basis, are nothing like the kinds of things that Jesus did. And so I was in Guatemala this last week, and I was doing some thinking about this, and I jotted up a bit of a list. And it dawned on me that Jesus never talked on a telephone. Never one time. He never had a conversation with someone that he couldn't see and couldn't look at. That Jesus never rode in a car. He never figured out how to put on a seatbelt. He never got caught in traffic. He never changed his oil. He never had to wonder about the price of gas. Jesus never flew in an airplane. He never bought anything at all in a strip mall. He never supersized something. He never had to worry about hand sanitizer. He didn't have to figure out if it was his day of the week that he could water his lawn or not. He didn't have to worry about watching TV. or not watching TV or if digital cable is really worth the price or not. He didn't have to figure out how to use the Internet or how to stop spam. He didn't have to. Jesus never turned on a light. There were no lights like we think of incandescent bulbs now. He never had that sort of experience, never changed a light bulb. Jesus never had to put something in a refrigerator. He had never been to a movie. Jesus never listened to This American Life on NPR. He never heated anything in a microwave. He didn't even graduate from high school. He never received a shot. He didn't set a VCR. He never heard recorded music. He never drank from a cup. He didn't wear a watch. He never ate ice cream. He never rode on a bus. He didn't have to figure out what time to pick his kids up from school. He didn't have to try to potty train a dog. He never vacuumed a floor. He never went to camp. He never had to preach from a stage. He never had to wear an NSYNC-like headset. And Jesus never even used a zipper. Never one time did he ever zip anything up. In fact, the zipper, a lot of people, I mentioned this in the first couple of get-togethers here, and people didn't know that the zipper was an advent of the 1893 World's Fair. So it wasn't until 1893 that we had the zipper. See what you can learn at Bethel College? All kinds of important things like the story of the zipper. But when I was in Guatemala this last week is when this started to dawn on me. We were in a small Mayan coffee farming village called San Juan La Laguna on Lake Atilan, and we're building houses for these coffee farming families. And in some ways, in Guatemala, you live in this pre-1900 and 21st century life at the same time. So in this trip, as the other trips I've been on to Guatemala, it's not at all odd to see in the village of San Juan a coffee farmer going out to work in the fields in the traditional Mayan dress and carrying a machete that he's going to work with all day and on the left hip to have a cell phone. It's kind of a bizarre thing, really. And I started thinking about how my life and that person's life are so different that many of the things on that list that I jotted down were things that the pastors in this town, they never did those things either. But neither did Jesus. And I started looking at what a strange world we live in where this person's living in the 18th century and the 21st century at the same time in this little village in Guatemala. And what an odd thing it is to not be able to get clean drinking water but to have free long distance on your cell phone because you can. It's just a strange world we live in and it got me thinking about the strange world I live in because I am compelled of this following of a first century call of Jesus to live my life in the kingdom of God to make things on earth the way they are in heaven, to join in the work of the Spirit in making all things better. And I'm called by this first century Jesus, but I don't live in that world. I live in this 21st century world with all the things and all the cares and all the concerns of our day. And so I kind of feel like this Mayan coffee farmer in a village of Guatemala where I'm trying to live this first century faith and this 21st century life all at the same time. And it's a very perplexing thing. And it's something that if we don't have the right version of the story going on, it can cause us to live in this incongruence and in this confusion and in this pain and in this, I don't know how to do this anymore. So I was doing some thinking about that. And what a wonderful story we have where we're created by this God the creator who creates us as creative beings to be co-creators with God in remaking the world. And that there's this wonderful story unfolding. So I have that running through my mind in Guatemala and this person on the cell phone and me using the cell phone, walking, this last week, walking in a coffee field and talking to one of the people who was setting up our trip while we're going up to work in the coffee field, speaking on a cell phone. And just saying, and this is what I do every day, is to live in these worlds that sometimes feel like they're clashing. But it seems to me that in the kingdom of God, they're not clashing at all. This is the kingdom of God unfolding. So I started thinking about some sections out of the Bible and some things that Jesus had said. And I want to share one of those with you. One of them comes out of John 14, which if you know the Bible well, then that makes sense to you. If you don't, John is one of the biographies written about Jesus. And the 14th chapter is somewhere around the middle of the book. But it's really from that point on in the way John tells the story, it's sort of the last part of Jesus' life. So Jesus is meeting with his disciples, and he's giving them a little speech. He's telling them about things that are going to happen, and he's encouraging them, and he's saying to them these words, some of which you heard earlier read by Matt during the singing time. And it reads like this out of John 14. Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God, and trust also in me. A little side note. I bet they'd had a different ring in the first century when they're looking at Jesus. Trust in God. Okay, I know what that means. trust in me, good, you're right here, then what it does for all the rest of us who are worrying about things like retirements and jobs and SARS and automobile accidents and all the things that sort of run through our minds. So we're always making this translation, aren't we, from the first century to the 21st century. Jesus saying, don't let your hearts be troubled and trust in God and trust also in me. And in my Father's house, there are many rooms, If it were not so, I would have told you. I'm going there to prepare a place for you. After being in this little village in Guatemala, this has different meaning than it does when you think about somebody here that says, in my father's house there are many rooms. You think, I don't know, we have a sunroom, maybe like a little den. Well, that would be nice. We could each have our own bedroom, maybe an eat-in dining room where we don't have to worry about eating in the living room anymore. That's not what Jesus was getting at. When you build a one-room house, 15 feet by 14 feet for a family of eight to live in, you start to understand what people in that climate of the world are speaking of when they say in my father's house there are many rooms and there's room for all of us and we'll all fit there. And if I go to prepare a place for you, he goes on saying, I will come back and I will take you with me that you will also may be where I am and you know the way to the place where I'm going. And then in this little interaction, Thomas, one of the disciples chimes in like maybe the rest of us would like to at times when we hear things that Jesus says and I say, but Lord, we don't know where you're going, and we don't know the way. We don't get it. And isn't it nice to know that first century people don't get it just as well as 21st century people don't get it? So Jesus answered him and didn't clear up a thing at all by saying, I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no one comes to the Father except through me. If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and you have seen him. So then Philip said, Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us. Great. Just show us God and that's all we need. Don't need much more than that, Jesus. Just give us a full frontal of God and then we'll be all set. Not asking for much, really. And Jesus answered, don't you know me, Philip? Even after I've been among you such a long time, anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, show us the Father? Doesn't sound like much of an answer, really, but don't you believe that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me and the words that I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it's the Father living in me who's doing this work. Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father's in me, or at least believe the evidence of the miracles that I've been doing. I'll tell you the truth. Anyone who has faith in me will do what I've been doing, and he will do even greater things than these. because I'm going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it. I'll tell you the truth. Anyone who has faith in me will do what I've been doing, and he will even do greater things than these because I'm going to the Father. It started running through my head. Jesus tells the disciples of the first century that they will do greater things than he did because he's leaving. That somehow in the telling of the story, Jesus says, things are going to get better, things are going to build, things are going to become more because I'm leaving. Then you're going to do more things and greater things than I ever did. See, this version of the story that things were good when Jesus was around and getting bad is not Jesus' story. Jesus' story is that when he leaves, the Holy Spirit comes, and then this whole thing really starts to go wild. And that somehow in the story of Jesus, it's better that Jesus is gone than that Jesus stays. In fact, in the same speech to the disciples a little bit later, what we would call two chapters later, or just deeper into the speech in what we would call John 16, Jesus says these words. But I'll tell you the truth. it is for your good that I'm going away unless I go away the counselor will not come to you but if I go I will send him to you so it's good that I'm going away I don't know I can't speak for all of you I don't even know hardly any of you but to me that's wild that it life is better with Jesus gone than it would be with Jesus still there that somehow the things of God were going to unfold in ways that they were not going to unfold if Jesus stayed around. That somehow in the story of things, things are getting better and the kingdom of God is unfolding and it's good and we get to join in as the body of Jesus doing the things of Jesus in the world. So maybe the fact that you and I live in a 21st century world that is so different from the world that Jesus lived in is not something for us to bemoan. Maybe we do not look back to days gone by, whether they are a century or 20, and say, wouldn't it have been great to live then? Then we could have followed God and seen the things of God. That's just not the way it works, it seems to me, in the unfolding of the kingdom of God. So the story then goes on, and if you know this, then you know that the next book after the biographies of Jesus is one called the Book of Acts, and it stands for the Acts of the Apostles. It's a shortened name of it. So it tells what did the followers of Jesus do after Jesus left? So after his life, death, burial, resurrection, ascension to heaven, what did they do? And Acts chapter 3 picks up a piece of the story about two of the disciples of Jesus, one named Peter, who's really quite famous, you know, the guy that all the jokes are about getting into heaven with, and then a guy named John, who I don't know of any actual John jokes, but maybe there's a couple of them out there somewhere. But the story picks up like this. One day, Peter and John, they were going up to the temple at the time of prayer at three in the afternoon, keeping with the Jewish tradition of praying at three in the afternoon. Now, a man who was crippled from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those in the temple courts. When Peter and John were about to enter, he asked them for money, and Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, look at us. So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them. Then Peter said, silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk. Taking him by the hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong. He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them to the temple courts, walking and jumping and praising God. When all the people saw him walking and praising God, they recognized him as the same man who had been sitting there begging at the temple gate, called Beautiful. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him. Well, the beggar held on to Peter and all the people were astonished. They came running to them at a place called Solomon's Colonnade, some versions of the Bible, Solomon's Porch. When Peter saw this, he said to them, Men of Israel, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare as if by our own power or godliness we have made this man walk? The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, The God of our fathers has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed and disowned him before Pilate, though he had decided to let him go. You disowned the holy and righteous one and asked that a murderer be released to you. You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this. By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is in Jesus' name and faith that comes through him that has given this complete healing to him, as you can all see. A couple of thoughts on this. Wasn't that last little part, that it was faith in Jesus that did it? It wasn't the crippled man's faith in Jesus, was it? It was Peter and John's faith in Jesus. And how come this guy was still crippled? Jesus used to visit that temple every day when he was a kid. And when he was in his full ministry, he would go there quite often. There's story after story of Jesus interacting with the Pharisees in and around the temple. He healed people in and around the temple. Why didn't he heal this crippled man? Can you imagine being this crippled man? And you hear the stories that the promised one of God, the sent one of Israel, the anointed one, the savior of the world came. Not only came to earth, but came right to your temple, and you still didn't get healed. So there he is still sitting there. This is, it could be weeks in the story, it could be months after Jesus left. Peter and John walk by and there's somebody still crippled. There's a situation still not remedied by Jesus. Maybe they thought back to this comment where Jesus says to them, you're gonna do even greater things than I did. You're in the game when I leave. You're gonna start to do it. You're gonna start to make the world better and Jesus didn't fix everything when Jesus was here. So they walk up and they say, we're supposed to do greater things than Jesus ever did. So they say, we don't have any money, but they grab him by the hand, they say in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, walk. And they stand him up. And he walks. And now they're doing what Jesus did. But the interesting thing to me is I wonder if they said to themselves or maybe to each other like we probably would in our day and age. I wonder if they would have stopped each other in sort of a typical American fashion and said, hang on a second, John. You know, Jesus did walk by this crippled beggar and Jesus didn't heal the crippled beggar. So maybe we need to stop and pray and have a period of discernment and try to figure out God's will for our lives if we're supposed to heal the crippled beggar or not. No, they didn't. And they didn't stop and say, well, if Jesus didn't do it, I'm not doing it. Instead, they did the very thing that Jesus never did in order to act in the way that Jesus would act. They did the thing that Jesus didn't do in order to be followers of Jesus. And maybe as people living in the 21st century, we will do things in this world that Jesus never did in order to act in the way of Jesus and that we are called to live fully in our age. and see it can be really confusing it can turn us around a bit because it's easy for us to say well we're not doing any of the things that Jesus did so he said anyone who's going to believe in me will do what I've been doing I mean we get all excited around our world when one man who's blind at age three turned blind at age three is able to get his sight back in a wonderful miracle of science by inserting new stem cells into his eyes to fix his eyes and it's on the news and it's great great stories. That doesn't seem greater than what Jesus did. Jesus spit on the ground and made mud out of spit and dirt and wiped it out of man's eyes. And one time, apparently he was in such a hurry, he skipped the mud altogether and just spit right in his face. And the man could see. Now that's a miracle. But it's easy for us to say, oh, but stem cell research and penicillin or refrigeration or herbal remedies or chemotherapy. well, no, that's not of God. I don't know. Maybe we're living in a world in which we're able to participate in the kingdom of God with all of our imagination, all of our ingenuity, all of our hopes, all of our creativity because the good things of God are not behind us. The good things of God are in front of us. And the kingdom of God is never held back from one generation to the other. And it never exists in one world and doesn't exist in the other. The kingdom of God expands without end. And that we are invited to join into that process and to make and to recreate in whatever world we live in. And just maybe it's time for all of us in the 21st century to turn on our ingenuity and to turn on our creativity and to join in the efforts of what God is unfolding in this world. And that we don't have to say to ourselves, well, on that long list of things, Jesus didn't do any of those, so they must not be godly. That would be like Peter and John saying, he didn't heal the crippled beggar, it must not be God's will. No, it was and it just may be. And our job is to figure out how do we live as co-creators with God and joining in the work of the Spirit by making all things better, or in other words, making your kingdom come on earth just as it is in heaven, making the world the way it's supposed to be. And it is this wonderful invitation. And maybe it means that we no longer have the right to look back at ages gone by and say, well, that's when spirituality was truly right. The first century or the fifth century or the 13th century. Isn't it time that we create a 21st century Christianity that is a legacy worth those of future generations looking back on and saying they entered into the things of God? Thank you. One little, yeah, all right, that's all right. It's kind of a cheap way to draw an amen, right, is to sort of beg for other ones. I don't know. That's sort of what I've been wondering about. Those are the places that I've been thinking, that maybe all of this world that we're living in is not some big conspiracy against God. Maybe this wonderful world that we're living in with all the creativity and all the ingenuity and all the hopes and all the aspirations and all the new fresh life, maybe this is something that's right in tune and harmony with the rhythms and the ways of God. That just maybe we don't have to continue to tell a story that hearkens back and wishes that this whole thing would just end, but instead that we become a people of the resurrection and a people of a remade heaven and earth that God is recreating and remaking and inviting all of us into. And so every time when we see hope and aspiration and imagination and creativity, we say, amen. Let's see how we can use that to make the world the way it's supposed to be. And it doesn't make life any easier at all because it means now we have to decide how do we know what the world is supposed to be like? You can travel all over the world and see great hope, inspiration, ideas, and people were as well-intentioned as can be, and it has just led to utter destruction of the human being. It doesn't make it any easier, but it also means that we're not cut out of the story. It also means that we have a story to tell each other that is something greater than just, well, everything's all boxed up, everything is all set, Everything is the way it's supposed to be. Now we're just waiting to get out of here. As if the only thing left for creative people to do is to creatively find ways to sin or something. Because everything else would sort of be violating God. So people who are created by the creator as wonderful creations designed to co-recreate with God and to make this world what it should be and that in Christ you have become a new being and the old is gone and the new has come. Take that to the rest of the world and make it new. And bless and serve and love and create and recreate because that's what we do. We behave in ways that Jesus didn't behave in order to behave in the way of Jesus. At our church, we write our own music and part of our own music writing is that we wrote a song. Actually, Ben did. Wrote a song that's a blessing. And at the end of our gatherings, we sing a blessing to each other and for each other. And we leave it as a benediction. A benediction sort of being something you say to someone that you want to kind of stick on them and you want to lay there and you want it to be there. This is before the time when someone would sort of understand Velcro. They used the word benediction far before we had Velcro. But it would sort of be a Velcro-like blessing that would stick to you and would stay there. and we sing it to each other and we sing it for each other as this way of it lasting and staying. And then we end it and the odd thing is that the song is called Go in Peace and then we end the song after the singing of it by saying to each other, stay in peace. So the song's called Go in Peace and then at the end you say stay in peace so it gets a little confusing there at the end but the kingdom of God's really confusing anyway so it just sort of primes us for that. So at the end of it, I'm going to read the words to you and then I'm going to invite, I'm not going to invite them, they know they're coming. Matt and Ashley are coming up. We've done this two other times and we had it all planned out, so don't make it sound like, hey, Matt and Ashley, why don't you come up and play that little number? This is all set up. They're going to come up and they're going to play the song. And then after playing the song, you will then be invited and Matt will just say, stay in peace. And then we'll invite all of you to turn to each other and say, stay in peace. And really there's two meanings to the stay in peace the way we do it around our place. And I suggest them to you as well. One of those is to say stay in peace. Meaning you can stay here. You don't have to run right out. You can stay in this room if you need to. And maybe you need to come up and speak with someone. And there's some people that are on a prayer team. And they come up and around here they call this place, this area, the altar. And so they're the altar team. And you can come up to this area. And they'll talk with you or they'll pray with you or they'll listen to you or they'll just be with you. And so we invite you, when someone's at the end, when we say to each other, stay in peace, know that part of that is an invitation that you would stay. And part of it, the other meaning of this stay in peace, isn't just that you would stay here, so you're not being sent out right away, but it also means that the peace would stay with you, that the peace would last, that no matter what world you move into, the promise of the Holy Spirit sent because of the absence of Jesus would stay with you. Of the many things Jesus said, most frequently he said things like, peace onto you. May it lay on you. And follow me. And so as you follow Jesus in a 21st century expression of life and faith and Jesus' behavior, may that peace stay and sort of rest on you. So I'll read to you the words and make a couple comments about my favorite parts of it, and then we'll all stand up together. and then Matt and Ashley will come up and we'll sing it together. It goes, go in peace, seeking on, united, bought, and freed. I really like that idea of the seeking on. It's this idea that the things of God and the kingdom of God are out there and we're seeking on with them, that we're not just returning to the past and bemoaning how things have changed. We're stepping into this bright future. And in times of trials, our hopes should be spirit-filled, and holy, that we're never abandoned in our trials, that we're never left alone. And may you be eternally blessed and wonderfully led all your days by love's pure light, prayerful in all ways, always. And this next part's really my favorite of the whole thing. Sow in peace and dream of a place and love in the name of the Lord and go in peace. May Christ surround you for the kingdom of God has no end. Amen, amen, amen, amen. And the song goes on, amen, amen, amen. If you don't know what the amen means, that's a sort of religious way of saying, let it be that way, so be it. Yes, let's have it like that. The kingdom of God has no end. Yes, it has no end. Sow in peace. Yes, we're gonna sow in peace. Christ's right, yes. And it's this yes, yes, yes to the whole thing. All right, so let's give it a try. Once you stand up, they'll sing it. You're welcome to join in singing to each other and for each other. Then when they're done, leave each other with the benediction of stay in peace. Go in peace, seeking on, united, bought, and freed. In times of trial, our hopes should be spirit-filled and holy. May you be eternally blessed and wonderfully. Let all your days, by love's pure light, prayerful in all ways. Always Oh, in peace Dream of a place Love in the name of the Lord Go in peace May Christ surround you The kingdom of God has no end Amen Amen Amen Amen Amen Amen Amen Amen Stay in peace. Turn and say that to one another. You're dismissed or you may stay. you
