Let's pray as we go to the ministry of the word this morning. Father, I thank you, first of all, for the work of your Spirit activated already among us. The context of worship, the sense of your presence and power, you're doing things that we may see and maybe don't see already. But now as we move to the ministry of the Word, we pray your Spirit continue to move and breathe life into this and call out life from us. I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, as most of you know, if you've been with us for the last few weeks, born of our study in the book of Colossians, particularly Colossians 3, 18 to 25, where the Apostle Paul is dealing with issues related to women and men, submission and love, marriage and family. Several weeks ago, we expanded the focus of our thinking about women and men, submission and love beyond marriage and family to ministry as well, in part because the same Paul, who in Colossians 1.18 says, Wives, be subject to your husbands, and husbands love your wives. Also said in 1 Corinthians 14, wives, not wives, but women, be silent in the church. Wives, be subject. Women, be silent. Indeed, in 1 Timothy 2, verse 12, which is a text I introduced a couple of weeks ago, Paul seems to be slamming the door on any possibility of misunderstanding where quite bluntly and unequivocally he says, I don't allow women to teach or exercise authority, particularly over men, but to remain quiet. After all, he says in verse 13, and where he now, this is really where it gets dicey, he seems to root his argument in creation itself. He says, it was Adam who was created first, and then Eve. It was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman, being quite deceived, fell into transgression. So there you have it. It's all very clear right there in black and white. And for some people, it really is that way. That kind of settles the issue for them. It's all very clear, but for others, not so much. Not quite as clear, raising actually what I talked about last week or a couple of weeks ago as a boatload of questions and serious concerns for some. among the questions are these. Are you kidding? I mean, seriously, did Paul say that? And if he said it, did he mean it? And if he meant it, what did he mean by it? I mean, seriously, are women to be silent? Not just silent, but the reason they're to be silent is because Adam was born first or created first? That's preposterous, would say. Quite a few, I think, to that idea. But others, maybe even some of you, have a different question when these verses come into play. Taking these verses at face value and trying at a very sincere level to be faithful to the text, believing that they mean what they say, your question actually would be this. Why does our church allow women to teach and exercise authority? because obviously here at Open Door, we do, having women at every level of ministry. So have we, would some people's question be of us, have we at Church of the Open Door simply chosen to ignore these verses? Which would be kind of confusing, actually, if you've been at Open Door for a while because we talk about the fact that we are a church that is rooted in the text. We are rooted in the story of God, the book of God, Core value number one, we're rooted in the text. Well, as I began to explain a couple weeks ago, the answer to that question, have we just chosen to ignore these scriptures, is no. But the explanation as to why we do what we do, the way we do it here at Open Door, relative to women and men in ministry, particularly in light of these scriptures, takes time. Time that we, most of the time, don't have time to spend, but time we've decided to take in this particular series for a number of reasons. Chief among them is this, that in this season of our church's life, where we have been working very hard over the last several months, and you know this is true, to identify and remember and maybe even re-embrace what we have been calling the spiritual DNA of our church. This issue of how women and men minister together in ways that have potential to reveal the image of God and release the power of God is absolutely central, we believe, to who God is calling us to be as a church and to what God is calling us to do as a church. And so it is. A few weeks ago, we began to talk about this issue of men and women, not just in marriage, which is the focus of Colossians 3.18, but in ministry as well. And we began to do it, actually, in the context of our story as a church, a story that actually began to unfold about 25 years ago. When 25 years ago, here at Open Door, we began to really grapple with, not ignore, these problem passages, passages that for many churches still today serve as the biblical basis for excluding women from various places in ministry like preaching and teaching and exercising authority, particularly over a man. But to do that well, that is to grapple well with these scriptures, I explained a few weeks ago, we need to understand and put into play some fundamental principles of biblical interpretation. Principles, actually, that help us to understand not just what is being said in a particular verse. That's obvious enough. You can take any verse in any passage and just read it and know what it says, but we need to get to why what is being said is being said. And until you get to the why, you really don't know what the verse means. So why is it being said at this particular time, in this particular way, to these particular people, which in turn helps us determine and differentiate between what I referred to a few weeks ago, and this kind of turned into a seminary class. We're going to have a little bit of that tone today as well, to differentiate between what we call a timeless truth, which is binding regardless of history or culture, and a regulation for a certain people at a certain time for a certain purpose, which the Scriptures are full of. These regulations that are not binding eternally. My favorite, and I gave you this a couple weeks ago. I'll give it again because I think this one's goofy. And funny, Deuteronomy 23, verse 12 says this, And you shall, thus says the Lord, have a place outside the camp and go out there. And go means go, which is so junior high, and that's why I'm drawn to this. And you shall have a spade among your tools, and it shall be that when you sit down outside that you shall dig with it then you shall turn to cover up your excrement. My favorite part is verse 14. For the Lord your God, here's why you need to do that, is walking in the midst of your camp, and he doesn't want to step in this stuff. Thus saith the Lord, it's in the Bible. Question, timeless truth? Because if it is a timeless truth, if you have indoor plumbing, you're in sin. Or is that maybe a regulation for a certain people at a certain time for a certain purpose? That one's obvious. Not all are, which is why when coming to passages like 1 Corinthians 14 and 1 Timothy 2, we need to be using solid principles of biblical interpretation that put into play things like the original language, which we do routinely around here, dealing with the Hebrew and the Greek, but also put into play history and culture and context as well. Because as I kind of told you last week in that seminary kind of tone we had, any text, biblical text, that doesn't have a context is a pretext because you can't just take singular verses and remove them from their context and still think you understand what that verse is saying. So we're very careful, and we don't always talk about how careful we are. We just kind of apply these principles as we preach. That would be Steve and Jen and me and whoever's preaching. We're very careful to consider when you're dealing with a verse, the verses around it. Sometimes you've got to go to the rest of the chapter. Sometimes what informs that verse is the whole book. What's the flow of that whole book? And sometimes it's good to get the whole flow of the whole Bible. Like what's the whole story? And what would the whole story say about this one little verse that I'm drawing all this meaning from? And when we do that, kind of get the whole story to kind of inform this little thing we're looking at, we discover a number of things. Among the things we discover relative to this topic today is that there are over 100 passages in Scripture, says L.E. Maxwell in his book, I Suffer Not a Woman, over 100 passages in Scripture that affirm the roles of women in leadership all throughout the Scriptures, and there are five, count them, five places in Scripture that restrict the role of women in ministry for various reasons, which just kind of makes you go, hmm, what is that about? And as an exegete, as someone trying to interpret scripture, you start asking questions. What does that mean? What does that signal? What does that tell us with respect to women being silent in the church? Always. Timeless truth? I don't know. Are you sure? In the Old Testament, for example, As I try to kind of get the big picture, and then we'll come down and get real specific with these texts. In the Old Testament, there are numerous examples of women playing significant leadership roles in the work of God in the world. Exodus 15, verse 20, Miriam, who was the sister of Aaron. Aaron being kind of Moses' right-hand person. Miriam is identified as a prophet designed and called by God to speak authoritatively for God, to the people of God. Indeed, in Numbers chapter 12, verse 2, she's kind of sticking up for herself with Moses when she says, in effect, Moses, I know God speaks through you, but you're not the only one. I'm just kind of getting a little feisty here. Has he not spoken through us as well? It's kind of common knowledge. God has spoken through Miriam. Miriam is a prophet. Miriam is a woman. And then there's Huldah, interesting person who in 2 Kings 22 and 2 Chronicles 34 was used by God to actually bring renewal to the nation. When Israel had wandered away and was at a spiritual crisis point and needed an authoritative word, Israel at the time had a good king. His name was Josiah, and he was seeking the Lord. And the word of the Lord came to him in the text, actually, but he didn't understand it. So it says in 2 Kings 22, 14, Josiah said to the priest, so Hilkiah, the priest, along with Ahakam, Ahabar, Shaphan, and Isaiah, went to hold of the prophetess, the wife of Shalom. And they spoke to her, and she said to them, thus says the Lord God of Israel. She's speaking very authoritatively here. Tell the man who sent you to me, that would have been King Josiah, tell the man these words, thus saith the Lord. And then she goes on to speak a word from God for the king, and she does speak a word that turns the heart of the king. And when the heart of the king turned, the heart of the people turned, and there came a revival in the land. And then there's Deborah, who was not only a prophetess, but she was the fourth judge in pre-monarch Israel before Saul was the king. Saul was the first king of Israel. And before the age of the kings, you'll see in the Bible, first kings, second kings, and then first and then chronicles. But before that, you see this book called Judges. And Judges was the period of the judges. She was the fourth judge in that period, which made her during her time, this is interesting to me, the highest ranking leader in Israel. You can read her story in Judges 4 and 5. And though she was married, actually, she, not her husband, was chosen by God and called by God to lead the people of God. And these are God's people she's leading, which is, maybe, you know, you could read that on any day and not connect these dots, but in light of what we're talking about, it kind of makes you wonder, if God is supposed opposed to women in leadership, and that's a timeless truth, kind of across the board, then why this? Why was Deborah giving his, you know, we always hear, God is the same yesterday, today, today, yeah, but what then? Did something change? What's going on? I need to dig a little deeper, I could go on, actually, with Old Testament examples. I could tell you stories of Esther and Ruth, of Zipporah and the daughters of Zelophehad. But I want to get to the New Testament. Just kind of give you a picture here. Again, we're just creating context within which we can maybe get some better perspective on these verses that are kind of troubling. In Acts 21, verse 9, the four daughters of Philip talked about this a few weeks ago are identified as being prophetesses. Big deal. You'd skim right over it, except we're dealing with this place where Paul says women need to be silent. So how could a prophetess prophesy and be silent at the same time? It just creates a problem. I don't understand that. Acts 18, 26. It was Priscilla who was a woman along with Aquila, her husband, who taught this young preacher, Apollos, the way of God more accurately, says the text. So she was, that is Priscilla was, along with her husband, the mentor of this incredible preacher in the first century named Apollos. She was his teacher. And then there's Jesus in this whole mix, whose treatment of women in his day was in stark contrast to how women got treated in his day, both in the secular culture, but also in the religious culture. We've been talking about this quite a lot over the last several weeks, and I'm sure you remember that women in Jesus' day couldn't study the Torah, couldn't even study the Torah. They weren't allowed into certain parts of the temple where only men could go. Women in Jesus' day weren't considered viable witnesses in a court of law, which is kind of just irritating and troubling, but it's fascinating when you know that and then dial into the fact that all of the gospel writers, this is fascinating to me, when giving their account of the resurrection, identified women as being the first eyewitnesses to the fact that the tomb was empty. Now, again, you may not dial into this, but seriously, think about this. Why would they do that? If they were trying to get people to believe that Jesus was risen from the dead, but people don't believe women, they can't be trusted. It's almost as if, like in a sideways, subversive way, God, through the writers of the Gospels, is saying, I believe them. I believe them. I'm going to use them. And kind of stick it in your face just a little bit. Women were among Jesus' Talmudim. And that word means something to us at Open Door because we did that long study. Talmudin was one of his followers, specifically one of his disciples, women who traveled with him in his ministry and sat at his feet as any disciple would with a rabbi. Remember the story of Mary and Martha in Luke chapter 10? Many of you are familiar with that story. It's always a story that's kind of used to be a story that kind of presents two different temperaments. You have Martha, who's the activist, the server, very busy, and she's kind of upset with Mary, who's sitting at the feet of Jesus. Mary is the contemplative, and generally the lesson there is, you know, we're always so busy doing, sometimes we just need to calm down and contemplate and be quiet and sit at the feet of Jesus. So kind of those messages are slow down, everybody, not just men, but not just women, but men as well. But that phrase, This is fascinating to me. That phrase, sitting at his feet, which describes Mary in Luke 10, verse 39, sitting at Jesus' feet, is a technical term used to describe someone who was a disciple of a rabbi. Indeed, the apostle Paul, it says in Acts 22, verse 13, studied at the feet of Gamaliel, which means, and that's just kind of a colloquial, kind of a phrase that indicated he was a disciple of the Rabbi Gamal, which puts a fascinating spin, I think, on this story of Mary and Martha because the woman who's being commended in the story by Jesus isn't the one who is doing what you expect women to do in Jesus' culture and what you expect women to do in Jesus' time would be nothing but, you know, serve the food. Being helpful that way, which is fine, but they weren't even allowed to teach and the one who's being commended, the one who's being commended that is the one who is doing, actually, what women weren't supposed to do in Jesus' day, weren't able to do in Jesus' day, to sit at the feet of a rabbi and be a student and learn the Torah from someone who had shmiah. Remember that word? Authority, which is what Jesus had. And so in these things that Jesus did, there were powerful messages. But maybe the most fascinating example here that helps create some context for our understanding of 1 Corinthians 14, 1 Timothy 2, is the Apostle Paul himself, who in 1 Corinthians 14, 1 Timothy 2, seems pretty clear in laying down the law. Women, be silent. No preaching, no teaching, no authority, no nothing. But in Philippians 4, verse 3, which the Apostle Paul writes, he identifies Iodia and Syntyche as those who have, quote, labored side by side with me, sharing my struggle in the cause of the gospel. And then in Romans 16, where Paul is wrapping up his letter, he identifies 27 people by name as being full-fledged partners with him in ministry, and 10 of those 27 are women, including a woman named Phoebe, who in verse 1 of chapter 16, he identifies as a deacon of the church in Sancturia. Look at that verse. I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a servant, it says, of the church which is in centuria. We put that in italics because that word, it's interesting that in this translation, it got translated servant, not deacon. The Greek word there for servant, deacon, is diakonon. And as a lot of your Bibles say servant, one, I think the NIV translates it deaconess. But what's interesting is this about that word. Every other place you look in the scriptures. And you see that word diakonon appear. Whenever it is connected to a man, the way the translator would translate it would be the right way. They will always call the guy a deacon. But when that same word diakonon is connected to a woman, the translators quit translating. They start interpreting. It's as if to say, this is weird, it's as if to say Paul couldn't have meant deacon because this is a woman. He must have meant servant. So that's what the word that they wrote in there. It's not what the word says. The diakonon's a deacon. Phoebe, a deacon. I commend you to her. And then at the end of verse 2, it says, Paul describes her in some of the translations, call her a helper of many. She's a deacon who's a helper of many, which is a good thing to be. But the word for helper of many, actually, it's a Greek word prostatos. And what it literally means is ruler, manager, governor, someone who governs and manages. And again, it's fascinating when you see that same word prostates in other places in the New Testament. First Timothy 5, 17, for instance, it says, let the elders who rule well, in the Greek word there is prostates, let the elders who prostates well, that is rule, govern, manage, be worthy of double honor. And when it's connected, that word is to a man, they kind of get it right. But when it's connected to Phoebe, They couldn't mean a ruler or a manager because people, women don't do that. Must be a helper of many. But the most stunning and interesting to me is a woman named Junia, who in Romans 16, verse 7, she's in this list of 27 people that Paul commends. In Romans 16, 7, it says this. Along with Andronicus, Junia, he identifies as them being my fellow prisoners who were outstanding among the apostles. He's identifying her and this guy as being apostles who also were in Christ before me. Now, most of your Bibles, a lot of your Bibles, if you look at that, translate Junia as Junius, which makes him, that's the masculine spin, which makes him a man, her a man, even though that's not what the word is. In fact, in the Roman world, there was no such name as Junius. It wasn't a guy's name. It was a girl's name. It was like a boy named Sue. You know, you might do that, but very unlikely. Junia, in the Roman world, this is in Romans, he's writing to the Romans, is a girl's name. Indeed, there is ample evidence, says Rick McInnes, in a book entitled Equally Yolk. There is ample evidence of early church commentators understanding Junia routinely to be a woman. John Chrysostom might be the most noteworthy in this regard. A renowned preacher in the fourth century, not known to be particularly partial to women, said this, and I quote, How great is the devotion of this woman named Junia, that she should be even counted worthy of the appellation or the designation of apostle. Kind of a stunning thing. Now, this is all kind of biblical history, cultural history, kind of creating context for us. and as we kind of stir the pot together, what do we know so far? What do we have so far that might help us determine when we're dealing with 1 Corinthians 14, 1 Timothy 2? Is this a timeless truth, or is it maybe a regulation for certain people at a certain time for a certain purpose? Well, we know so far from the broader context of biblical history that women, all through the Old Testament and even into the new, governed and led and prophesied and had influence at significant levels of ministry, that even Paul, who seems to be kind of the culprit in this whole deal, telling women to be silent, because after all, he says in 1 Timothy 2, Adam was created first, and Eve was the one who got deceived. Even that Paul, when he finds a Phoebe, or a Euodia, or a Syntyche, or a Junia, or a Priscilla, he says of them, let me tell you about them, they work side by side with me, fully sharing the struggle of life and ministry in the church. Indeed, and this is fascinating to me, in his three Macedonian letters, the three Macedonian letters are 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, and Philippians. In those three epistles, absolutely no restrictions on women to preach, to teach, to prophesy, to lead, to govern. But in Corinth and in Ephesus, I don't allow women to teach or to exercise authority, particularly over a man, which, if you're trying to interpret Scripture, just raises this question, what's up with that? Because obviously something must be going on in these two cities that we maybe don't know about that might help explain what seems to be a contradiction with other places in Scripture, even with Paul, who in certain places says, absolutely. They lead, they teach, they govern, they're deacons, even apostolic authority, so let's dig a little deeper. Into the history, into the culture, all of which is designed to create a context that might help us understand not just what is being said, but why it's being said. And until we know why it's being said, you don't really know what is being said. So let's start with Ephesus. But before we do, I need to tell you, as I get into this part of the talk, I'm really indebted to some sources, that it occurs to me, you might be interested in following up. So I just want to tell you about three books that I would recommend to you if you want to kind of go deeper into this whole topic. The first is entitled Equally Yoked by a guy named Rick McInnes. Now, this one is very readable, but it's going to really get into the depth of the text. I really recommend it. He's a credible author. Another one is this, How I Changed My Mind About Women in Leadership by Alan Johnson. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book this week. But what it is is a compilation of stories, actually, of people, actually, that we know. A lot of these names are familiar to us. John and Nancy Ortberg, Bill and Lynn Hybels, Ruth Haley Barton, Tony Campala, John Stackhouse, Ron Sider, Stuart and Jill Briscoe, just to name a few, who deal really well with some of these troublesome texts. But more compelling, actually, it's their story. It's their grappling with these issues and trying to be faithful to the text, but also trying to discover how does this whole thing work. I really recommend that book. And a third is a book that I actually was given last Saturday called Designer Women by Ruth Tuttle-Kanard, a woman actually that I met last Saturday for the first time. She handed me this book, and it's a fascinating book, really well written, deals with the text, but it really comes out of her story. Ruth, who, along with her husband Bill, was in a ministry relationship for many, many years with another couple that, you know, their name might ring a bell, Ruth and Billy Graham. For years, they were together, and they really were together. And so some of her stuff is really rooted in the text, but it really, there's an evocative thing about her own dealing with this thing, and I recommend those three. Let's get to Ephesus. The reason we want to talk about Ephesus is because Ephesus is where Timothy was when Paul wrote the letter to him, 1 Timothy. When this letter is written from Paul to Timothy, Paul, Peter, Timothy, this is my third service, my brain cells are kind of fried. Timothy's the pastor of this church. He's a very young man at the time. He's in way over his head. So Paul, who was his mentor, is trying to help him navigate. Very confusing and intimidating terrain in Ephesus. It included false teaching, Gnostic heresy. Chapter 1 of 1 Timothy talks about myths and endless genealogies and people who present themselves as experts in the law, but they don't understand the law at all. But Ephesus, the dominant thing in Ephesus was the worship of Artemis. Indeed, the overriding feature of the Ephesian landscape physically was the great temple of Artemis of the Ephesians. You can read about it in Acts chapter 19. Artemis of the Ephesians, this great temple, was actually ranked among the seven great wonders of the ancient world, four times larger than the Parthenon in Athens, 127 columns, 60 feet high. That's kind of the height of a six-story building, and that's before the building was on top of the columns. It was an awe-inspiring building that dominated the skyline of Ephesus, just like the cult of Artemis dominated everything in Ephesus relative to life and the everyday affairs of men and women. Let me tell you about Artemis. This is very significant because Artemis herself was portrayed as a mother goddess. But unlike the Hebrew God, who we kind of went into last week, where the image of God is revealed in masculine and feminine together, we see that in Genesis 1, Artemis was the glorification of the feminine over the masculine. According to this cult, she never married, And though she always had a male consort for companionship, she was always seen as superior to any male. So too, her women worshipers entertained the belief of universal female superiority. Now this is radically different, you know, than Genesis 1. Again, we've talked about quite often around here, where the image of God is when you have everything that is masculine and everything that is feminine coming together. You see there the image of God, and it's not the masculine over the feminine, or that is not the image. This is the image. And Artemis was kind of in contrast to much of the culture where the men were always over. Now, Artemis' kind of attraction even in that day was, ah, we'll show the men who are always dominating, we will dominate. And that's what was going on. She was alternately seen as, and I'm quoting here, virgin huntress, the mother goddess, the nourishing provider of all the living, and the power of fertility in nature. All of which, again, was designed to portray and communicate the strength and the power of the feminine, not alongside the masculine, like Ezra Konegdo, which Steve has talked a lot about in creation, where men and women are face-to-face, eye-to-eye, but superior to the masculine. Indeed, one major tenet of the Artemis cult was that she didn't need male participation to bring forth life. I don't need the man for anything. In fact, among her devotees, she was viewed as, quote, a virgin and unbound to any male. But now to all of that, add this, that central to the Artemis cult belief was the belief in the priority of the female in creation. That is, it was believed, and this was central to their theology, that the woman came before the man in creation and that this mythic feminine principle was believed to possess both the power of creation and a superior wisdom that needed to be imparted to males who were really stupid. So they exercised authority over. Just like in many disordered cultures, the men exercise authority over. Now we got it. We got a whole different thing. Now the women are exercising authority over. The Greek word there is authentine, which is the word Paul uses in 1 Timothy 2. now. Rewind the tape a little bit. Because when Paul first showed up, and this is before 1 Timothy would have been written, Paul actually was the founder of the church in Ephesus. And you can read about this again in Acts 19. When Paul showed up on that missionary journey, his ministry there triggered what could be called nothing less than a full-scale power encounter between these demonically empowered forces of darkness as embodied in this Artemis cult and the kingdom of God. And this power encounter was so incredible, and God kind of won this one, that it threw the whole city into chaos. Because people were coming to faith, and not only were they renouncing Artemis as their God and believing now in Jesus as the one who could bring them to God, but they also, and this is logical, they also quit buying the silver shrines of Artemis, which eventually hurt the whole economy, and that caused a riot. Literally, there was a riot because people messed up the economy, and it was all because they were not worshiping Artemis anymore. It caused a riot, which I think is a riot, and you can read about all that in Acts 19. But now, now I'll come back up to where we are in 1 Timothy. At the writing of 1 Timothy, Paul, who started this whole thing with a bang, okay, because he was there for two years, and the text says that while he was there, extraordinary miracles happened, healings all over the place, people were being, demons were being cast out. It was like a huge revival, but Paul is gone, and Timothy is left to pastor the church by himself. Again, picture this. The revival is over. People aren't falling down all over the place. They aren't every night being healed. That kind of stuff is incredible and important, but it kind of had a life. And now that Paul has gone, real life has become to kind of set in. And the job now of the pastor is kind of putting one foot in front of the other and trying to do that hard everyday work of calling people into, learning what it means to follow this Jesus way of living and loving. And now that becomes the task. So Timothy writes Paul a letter. And this is very significant because the letter that Timothy writes to Paul, we don't have. All we have is Paul's response. Timothy writes Paul a letter, and basically what he said, I think, was this. We don't have the letter, but I'm pretty sure this is what he said. Help! This place, Paul, this place is crazy! Why did you leave me here alone? So 1 Timothy, you're getting a picture, is Paul's response to Timothy's letter where Paul says, among other things, let me help you from a distance. All I can do is write you this letter. Let me help you with this. For the time being, don't allow women to teach. Pull a plug on this whole thing. Or exercise authority, particularly over a man. Why? Because that's exactly what they were doing in the Artemis cult, and we don't want that. This is not male over female. It's not female over male. Both of those things got to be put to rest. And Timothy, you just need to remember something. The woman wasn't created first. Timothy, that's residue from this Artemis cult because that belief was central to them. It was Adam who was created first. Then Eve, put all that together. Could it be maybe? that what Paul is doing here is confronting a very specific people at a very specific time for a very specific purpose. Indeed, in verse 9 of 1 Timothy 2, Paul says, he's speaking to the women again, he says, I want the women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly garments, which actually is why some women today, very devout and well-intended, desiring to obey God and what the Bible says won't, even today, braid their hair or wear gold pearls or costly garments. Because they look at verses like this very sincerely as a timeless truth. When in fact, I think it's pretty clear that Paul is speaking to a certain people at a certain time for a certain purpose because braided hair, and you'd have to get some history here. Braided hair, gold pearls, and costly garments were almost like the uniform for temple priestess, prostitutes, in the temple of Artemis. But what's ironic, even when it is a regulation for a certain time, within those regulations, there are timeless truths. And in that verse, the timeless truth would be this. Women, don't be dressing like a prostitute, But adorn yourself with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, verse 10, as befits a woman making a claim to godliness. But until then, what's going on in Ephesus? Until you grow up, until you kind of get this, you need to be quiet and receive instruction with entire submissiveness, and not just submissiveness to any man, but to God. And when you learn that, then we'd like to get you back in the game. Same thing in Corinth, you guys. That's not the Artemis cult in Corinth. It's the mystery religions, and don't have time to go into all of those things, but it's a fascinating study if you ever get interested. And it was marked by, the mystery religions were marked by, among other things, absolute chaos. In fact, chaos was the indicator. We must have connected with the gods because look how goofy everybody's acting. And here's the deal about Corinth. If I could tell you one characteristic of them, It was this, that every aspect of their old life before they came to faith, they brought it into their new life in Christ. In fact, there's this thing called syncretism where Christianity is mixed with voodoo. It happens today where Christianity is mixed with something else and you get this hodgepodge of what is that thing? In fact, every element of their old life. Paul lamented that in 1 Corinthians 3 when he said, you guys, you've been in the faith for a very long time, but I still can't give you solid food. I just give you milk and it's frustrating me to death because you just absolutely refuse to grow up. In 1 Corinthians 5 verse 1 it says, there's immorality in your church, Corinth, that isn't named even among the Gentiles. That someone among you has his father's wife and you're not mourning over that. In fact, you're boasting. You're talking about just how open we are, how broad-minded we are. You're full of baloney, says Paul. Not the original Greek. in first corinthians 11 in light of all of that stuff going on in corinth paul confronts women for cutting off their hair it's a shame you should have long hair says paul or throwing off their veil he calls it a disgrace okay okay how it explains that well here's one thing that might help what was sweeping through corinth at the time and remember everything that was going on her life before. They dragged into their life in faith. What was going on in Corinth, sweeping through Corinth, was a militant in-your-face feminism, which was saying, among other things, this. And they were saying this in a variety of ways. I don't give a rip about you, husbands, men. So it was kind of a different version of the Artemis cult. I am independent of you. I don't need you for anything. And sometimes, by the way, that was fueled actually by the Christian message that Paul would preach saying, in Christ, you are free. And some women are going, I know from him. Finally. But throwing off the veil and cutting the hair was kind of symbolic. It's like saying out loud, I am in it. I don't care about you. Which is why Paul says what he says. In 1 Corinthians 11, when he says, no, no, no, no. This isn't going to fly. because in the Lord, look at that verse, in the Lord, neither is woman independent of a man nor is man independent of a woman. In the next verse, it's almost like Paul is saying, and men, before you start cheering that I'm calling out the women here, know this, verse 12, just as the woman originates from man, which is going back to that Adam was created first. Okay, if you're all excited about that, guys, just remember this. Every single man since that first woman came from a woman. So you're outnumbered here. And all things originate from God. And it's almost like I hear Paul kind of wading through all of these confusing things, I think a little exhausted and a little frustrated that we can't grow up and actually enter into the mission God has called us to because we have to keep, I mean, I'm having to Paul, it would be like Paul having to say, I have to say to half of our team. I'm not kicking you off the team, but I've got to bench you for a while until you grow up. I would say that to women. I would say that to men. And after he says all that, he talks about everything originates from God. I hear him saying, so let's just start there. Could we come back to that? You guys, men, women, wherever you are in this, submit, therefore, to God. Forget about this gender war. Submit, therefore, to God. And if you do now, we at least have a chance to rightly order our relationships, to have rightly ordered relationships between men and women in a marriage, between men and women in a ministry, where all of us are laboring side by side, fully sharing the struggle of life and ministry in the church because when you get to see that, the fullness of masculine capacity and strength coming together with the fullness of feminine capacity and strength and all of that, because people are growing up, are under God. All of that masculine and feminine strength is coming submitted to God. When you see that, you begin to see the image of God. And you begin to see a release of the power of God. And all of this, says Peter in Acts 2.16, is what was spoken of through the prophet Joel, who said that in the last days, I will pour out my spirit on all mankind, on your sons and on your daughters, I will pour it and they will prophesy. Young men and women will see visions, old men and women will dream dreams. Even upon my bond slaves, both men and women I will pour out my spirit and so we pray Holy Spirit come right here right now and release your life to us and in us and through us and all God's people said Amen Amen.
