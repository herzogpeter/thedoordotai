Ephesians chapter 4, our continuing study in the book of Ephesians, brings us to verse 25. Ephesians chapter 4, verse 25. The entire section, if we were going to read it intact, would go from verses 25 through 32. It's a series of things that the Apostle Paul is exhorting us to strip off of our lives. We talked about that before in verse 17. Because we're believers, we walk a different walk. In verse 25, he begins to tell us what that means. Therefore, lay aside falsehood, speak truth, each one of you, with his neighbor, for we are members one of another. Be angry, and yet do not sin. Do not let the sun go down on your anger, and do not give the devil an opportunity. Let him who steals, stop, but rather let him labor, performing with his own hands what is good, in order that he may have something to share with him who has need. Let no unwholesome word proceed out of your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification, according to the need of the moment, that it may give grace to those who hear. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice, and be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ has forgiven you. James chapter 2 verse 19 says this you say you believe in God you do well or good for you the tongue is firmly implanted in the cheek as he goes on and says so do the demons in hell in other words you say you believe in God big deal the problem you see that James is pointing out and we're going to see something of what Paul is pointing out of the same nature is this that Christianity involves more than a system of belief. Satan has the right system of belief. Satan believes all the right things. Did you know that? I've mentioned that to you before, that if Satan was in one of our Sunday school classes, he'd get all the answers just right. Does Satan believe in God? Yes. Does Satan believe that Christ is God? Yes, he believes in the deity of Christ. He probably believes in the deity of Christ more firmly than some of you and I. Does Satan believe that Christ died for the sins of the world? Yes. Does Satan believe that Christ rose from the dead? Yes, he was standing right on the tomb, on the stone when it happened. He believes it. You know what? Satan even believes in the second coming of Christ, and he's doing everything he can to wreak havoc until that happens. Satan's belief system is right. The problem is this, that biblical Christianity involves more than the things I believe. It involves more than nodding my head in approval to certain points of doctrine. It is by definition the commitment of a life to the Savior, namely Jesus. It is the transferring of my trust from myself, from my money, from even my self-worth that I get from my job. It is the transferring of my trust from my friends, from my drugs, from my religion, from my works to Christ and to Christ alone. It's having a new dependence. And when I make that commitment, and when I transfer my trust from everything I've ever depended on before to Christ and to Christ alone. An astounding miracle transpires. And it's simply this. I made a new creature in Christ. And I become a partaker of the divine nature. And I've got a new life. And I've got a new nature. And I've got a new direction and a new hope and a new inheritance and a new standing before God. A new nature. Old things are passed away. Behold, new things have come. It's very exciting. That's great. That's exciting. It's a fact. But there's more. And this is where we need to dig and we need to understand in chapter 4, verse 17, Paul says this. He begins to explain that this miraculous transformation of going from death to life doesn't just stop there. That transformation continues because he says this, when I became a new creature, a process of change that began to produce a new character. In essence, what Paul is saying is this, that people who name the name of Jesus, that people who have really been transformed, that people who really have a new dependency, that people who really have this new nature living within them will evidence that new nature with a newness of living. They're going to walk a different walk. It's going to evidence itself. In other words, those who have really been regenerated are easy to identify. They walk a different walk. It's real easy. Jesus himself said the exact same thing. In the Sermon on the Mount, when he said this, that the people who really belong to the kingdom of God are different than the rest of the world. They think differently. They act differently. They talk differently. They worship differently. They have different desires. They have different motives. They have different intentions. They're different. They walk a different walk. In other words, when God creates a new creature in Christ Jesus, that creature is new indeed. and if that nature is in fact new, it is going to evidence itself. It's going to make itself known because there's going to be newness of life. There's going to be changes in our living. I want you to notice something that's very interesting and very troubling at the same time, and it was one of the reasons I struggled over this sermon so much this week. The fact when I look at Ephesians 4, I see the same thing, but also when Jesus is speaking the Sermon on the Mount, he is telling those words and he is preaching that sermon to people who believe themselves to be part of the kingdom. when he was speaking of people who were part of the kingdom those people who were listening to him said this well yeah he's talking about us we're the children of the king we are the believers we are the religious we are the followers we are the ones who know the answers we are the ones who are the members of the church and I'm sure that as some of those people began to hear the words of Jesus as he was beginning to describe the distinctives of a believer the real distinctives of a believer some of them were even looking around and wondering I wonder who he's really talking about and never even catching the fact that he was talking about them. The problem is Christianity is more than a system of belief. These people that he was talking to were professors. They were not possessors. They were religious but they were not regenerated. And Jesus was doing everything he could in his power in that particular text, Matthew 5 to somehow shake up the delusion that they had that they were children of the king when they really weren't. And he said words like this, Look, not all who come saying, Lord, Lord, are going to enter into the kingdom. Friends, the verifier of your faith is not the fact that you say you believe this and that. The verifier of your faith is not the fact that you nod in approval to certain points of doctrine and even that you can sit and know what is right and what is wrong. It isn't even the fact that you claim to be a Christian, the verifier of your faith, is the distinction it makes in how we live. If there is life, there will be signs of life. If there is life, there will be signs of life. And that's why Paul says in this particular text, Dear believer, strip off the old. Why? Because when you have the old surrounding you, it makes you look like you're dead. It makes you look like you're not. if you have the new nature, let those old things, those old rags that are covering yourself be torn away because if you don't, you'll look just like you're dead. I heard a story, a little illustration, the guy who got electrocuted when he was working on some live wires and the electric shock, they were moved into the morgue thinking he was dead, but the electric shock had only paralyzed his entire nervous system. He could hear others and see them with a fixed gaze, but he could not communicate with anyone. He saw and heard his wife and she came to see his body, but he could not speak to her. He saw every action of the morticians as they prepared to embalm him. How would you like that? That'd be great. But he was unable to let them know that he was alive. Can you imagine that? Go crazy. In the desperation of the moment, a small muscle in the eye flickered, just a little thing. Someone saw it. A doctor was called and a more careful examination was performed. A faint heartbeat was detected. Soon the man was back in the hospital and under special care for shock. Eventually he recovered. He was alive, but no one knew it. The flicker of the eye showed the people what was really true, but when there was no movement or response, it was natural to assume that there was no life. I believe that very often we as believers, getting into our comfortable little churches and in our comfortable little ways of thinking, begin to move into positions as even Christians, that we begin to lose the radical nature of what our faith is really all about. We begin, even subtly, even without knowing it, all good intentions, but we begin to move into kind of an easy believism. And sometimes even in our attempt, well intended as it may be, to save the world. We see someone who needs the Lord, and they do need the Lord, and the Lord will transform their lives. But we have this idea because they raise their hand or they say certain words, If I can get them to just say these words or walk the eye, then it'll do it. We fail to explain to them the radical nature of Christianity. We fail to explain to them that it's a commitment, that it's a dependency, that it's a transferring of trust. And in our naivete, we think that because they say a few words, that somehow they've gone from darkness into light, even though the heart hasn't been changed. that kind of thinking is non-Pauline that kind of thinking is non-Petrine that kind of thinking is non-Johannine that kind of thinking is non-Sermon on the Mount thinking Jesus said, Paul said, Peter said, James said unless there is a distinction in your living there is a good possibility that there is no distinction in your nature What is there to lead me to believe that there is a distinction in your nature if there is no distinction in your living? And no matter what we claim and what we imagine and how secure we feel and what we think we know, it's a scary thought. The problem is Titus 1.16 says things like this. They profess to know God, but there's a problem. You know what the problem is? Their deeds deny them. They profess to know God. They have all the right answers. they say the right things, but their deeds deny them. They're living contrary to what they profess. Philip's translation puts it this way, I think very well, their deeds deny their profession, being disobedient and worthless. The church in Corinth, remember that church? That church that Paul spoke of and spoke to, and he believed he was speaking to believers, but as he went on and on and on, considering all the characteristics they had that were of the old man, the old nature, one of the things he was finally led to say was this, dear believers, examine yourselves to see if you're in the faith. When I see all these evidences in your life of death, examine yourselves to see if you're in the faith. Even here in Ephesians 4, verse 21, as he's telling these believers to walk a different walk, that the believer, the characteristic of a believer is that he's going to walk a different walk. He says in verse 20, you did not learn Christ in this way, if indeed you have heard of him, if indeed you did hear Him if indeed you did receive Him. Even as believers, I think we see the tension of this in our lives. Those who are truly born of God. I face this all the time in my office as people come and I know that you've experienced this and I've experienced this from time to time that if I begin to fall into kind of a sinful situation you know one of the first things to go for me one of the first things to go for you and one of the first things people need to talk about when they come is this, when they fall into kind of a system of sin, the first thing to go is this sense of assurance of their salvation. They begin in their own hearts to see the dichotomy between what I say I am and what I am. We may be believers and we may be saved positionally, but it seems that over and over again our practice denies that fact and we lose, you know what we lose? The joy of our salvation. Psalm 51, when David had fallen into sin, what was his request? Restore to me the joy. Restore to me the reality of my salvation. The position may be there, but I don't feel it at all. You know, 2 Peter 5, I want you to turn to this, very important in this vein of thinking. 2 Peter 1. Peter is saying this, you've received a new nature, you have received great and precious promises, You are partakers of the divine nature. Now that that's who you are, supply to your faith, what? Moral excellence. Supply to your faith, knowledge. Supply to your faith, virtue. Virtues like kindness and love. Why? Read verses 8 through 10. For if these qualities, these virtues, are yours and are increasing, they render you neither useless nor unfruitful in what? In the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. I'm going to know. Why? because I see it verified in my life. Verse 9, Listen, here's the opposite of that. He who lacks these qualities is blind and short-sighted, having forgotten the purification from his former sins. Verse 10, Therefore, brethren, be all the more diligent to make certain about his calling and choosing. For as long as you, what? Practice these things. As long as you see the evidence of life in your life, You will never stumble. In other words, Peter is saying that assurance comes not in remembering a past event, but in seeing a present virtue. John said exactly the same thing. They will know we are Christians by what? By the fact that when I was six I raised my hand. That time when you were six and raised your hand may have been the time that you received Christ, but that is not the thing that identifies you as a believer. What identifies you is a present virtue. I will know you're a Christian by your love. by the thing that's going on in your life now. New creatures act like new creatures. Got that? New creatures act like new creatures. And that's exactly what Paul is saying in this particular text and this text that we're going to be dealing with for some time. I thought we'd do it in one week. It's getting stretched. We're going to do one verse today, verse 25. Somebody was talking to me yesterday and telling they were overhearing someone talk about our preaching and the text we're doing in Ephesians. And they were explaining to someone that we're in Ephesians. And the person who was visiting said, Oh, is he doing a chapter at a time? And he said, No, not really a chapter at a time. What? Well, like a paragraph at a time. No, not really a paragraph at a time. Well, like a verse at a time. No, it's more like a word at a time. And that's why we're going so slow. This is so big. This is so big. Paul says in chapters 1 through 3, he says, Believer, this is who you are. These are the riches you have. This is your high and holy call. You are holy and blameless before God, and it is all of grace, and it is all of faith, not of yourselves, lest any man should boast. There's nothing you can do to deserve that. That's who you are, believer. Chapters 4 through 6, because that's who you are, you get the wording there? This is very important that you hang on everything I'm saying here. Because that's who you are, you know what? This is how you'll live. I can't separate the two. Cannot do it. I cannot preach chapters 4 through 6. It would have been impossible, it would have been irresponsible for me to come to you and start our sermons in chapter 4 because it would have been assuming too much. There is no way that anyone in the flesh has the power to live the life we're talking about. There is no way I can talk to you about living a godly life unless you've got the new nature, unless you are part of the kingdom, unless you are one of the elect. There is no way I can preach 4 through 6 without having first preached 1 through 3. but I want to say something else there is no way in the world there is no way in the world that we can embrace chapters 1 through 3 there is no way in the world that we can claim for ourselves me being part of the one who is the recipient of those riches without also seeing 4 through 6 being born out in our lives let's look at the text and see the changes that take place in the life of the one who's got that new nature you see when that spark of divine energy gives us life and we become that person with a new nature it marked for me the day I received Christ as my Savior it marked for me the beginning of a life of changes and I want to a lot of teaching here and I really got to grab you and you've really got to hang with me here when I received Christ and these distinctives we're talking about as being part of the life of the believer this is not a wham bam thing we Christians are not perfect this is a change we're talking about this is a process we are talking about but it is engaged a Christian in terms of lifestyle isn't automatically changed done but I want to tell you this the one who's got the new nature one of the evidences is that he is continually changing do you see the difference? he is continually changing you know there are things in my life right now as your pastor you may think I've arrived I hope you don't I think you know that if you don't you're blind but there are things in my life this year that are there and I don't even see them and you know what as my will continues to be open to the power of the Holy Spirit in me and I open myself more and more to that there are things in my life this year that won't be there next year that's the change I'm going to be continually all my life stripping off the old stripping off the old putting on the new putting on the new and we are all at different levels in our spiritual lives, aren't we? But one thing is sure, the verifier of my faith, the verifier of the new nature, is that there is change. Is that I am changing and becoming more and more conformed to the image of His Son. Let's look at the changes. Verses 17 through 24. He gives us general statements. Paul says things like this. Christian, the change we're going to see in you is this. You're not going to walk like the Gentiles walk. How are you going to walk? You're going to walk a different walk. You help me a lot. Remember that? I even told you that when we were preaching. I'm not going to tell you what that means. I'm just going to tell you, walk a different walk. However you see them doing it, do it different. If they scratch their head, you scratch your belly. If they walk straight, you walk crooked. Walk a different walk. And then he begins to tell them again in a general sense, that means you're going to strip off the old, put on the new. I still have to scratch my head and say, what does that mean? I kind of generally, theologically know what that means, And we are moving now into an intensely practical passage as he gets specific and says, Believer, these are the differences in your living that will indicate you have life. These are the indicators, the differences in your living that are going to indicate that you have life. And I, before I even gave Mary the title to my sermon, I would change it now because I'd call them the signs of life. These things we're going to be going through in these next few weeks are just that. These are the signs of life in the life of the believer. There's five of them all together, one today. Verse 25, the first sign of life for the one who is truly born of God is this, that he exchanges lying for telling the truth. He exchanges lying for telling the truth. Verse 25, therefore laying aside falsehood, lying, speak truth, each one of you with his neighbor. Why is that so important? Because we are members one of another. Revelation 21.8. I want you to turn to that real quickly. Important verse that's going to set up this whole thing real quickly. Revelation 21.8 says this, real strong words, but for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers, a pretty motley crew here, hey, and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake of fire that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. Whatever else you think, one thing is sure, that lying is an indicator not of life, it is an indicator of death. When I see the characteristic of lying in someone's life, it is an indication of death, not of life. Whatever else is true, lying is characteristic of those who are dead in their sin under the judgment of God, not alive in Christ. It's real important, even now, as we begin to build on this, that we catch the contrast right now. Life and death, lying and truth, they are contrast, light and darkness. John 8.48 says, Satan is a liar. and not only is he a liar he is the father of all lies he is the manipulator of all lies he is the conniver of all lies he is the one who takes them and weaves the web of deceit therefore if our lives are characterized by a constant flow of lies by a constant flow of deception and conniving it is really going to be tough these are strong words but it is really going to be tough to get any biblical evidence that you are truly born of God because the indicator of life is truth. You see the contrast? It's important that we do. When our lives are a constant flow of lies, we give indication that Satan is the source and hell is the destiny, not life and light and truth. And that's why Paul says strip it off. Why? Because it makes you look like you're dead. It makes you look like you're dead. one of the first signs of life is that you tell the truth we got a problem with that though the problem is this that our entire world system is built on lies the whole thing in fact you get the idea when you consider again that web of Satan that moving and intertwining of deceptions and lies that our society is all about if somebody told the truth one day it's almost like the whole thing would fall apart I think we'd have World War 3 Lying is part of life. It's just the way the game's played. Lawyers lie. In fact, they tell you to lie. I had a friend who had a traffic ticket one time, and he had to get a lawyer because it was about his eighth or something like that. And so he had to get a lawyer, and one of the things his lawyer was asking him to do in order to get out of this thing was he lied. He just said, I didn't know the sign was there, or I didn't really realize how fast I was going. He did. He knew. He saw the sign. He knew how fast he was going. He lied. Satan's the father of that. And that's an indicator of death, not life. Why do we have that on us? Lawyers lie. Doctors lie. Teachers lie. Preachers lie. Salesmen lie. How do they make their sales if they don't? I mean, you know, be realistic. Entertainers lie. And secretaries lie. And their bosses lie. And advertisers lie. And politicians lie. And husbands lie. And wives lie. And their kids lie. And we all lie. And it's all lies. it's what keeps the whole thing going and all of that is the masterpiece of Satan his function, his very nature is to lie and to get us to believe that the lies are the truth and the thing that is disturbing to me and I hope disturbing to you even as I'm building on this more and more is that the thing that is disturbing is that the lies he tells us even some of us believers in certain areas of our life have not seen the deception and have not seen that we have bought into it hook, line, and sinker he lies about life he lies about death he lies about God he lies about Christ he lies about the Holy Spirit he lies about himself he isn't that bad he lies about God he isn't that good he lies about the Bible it isn't really real he lies about heaven it isn't that great he lies about hell it isn't that bad he lies about good it isn't that good he lies about bad it isn't that bad he lies about lies he lies and we've bought into it and our whole society is made up of it. You ever go to buy a car? I'll never forget when Phil shared, he's laughing already, when Phil shared with us in prayer meeting a few weeks ago when he tried to go buy a car and he immediately walks in the door and he gets a song and dance right off the bat. And you get this feeling when you go into that place and now, I had a terrible time this week as I was going through this because every time I went into a place where somebody was trying to sell me something, I felt like I was in the den of iniquity, you know, because I know they're lying to me. And I was more aware of it than I normally was. We had a salesman in our house this week. It was a bad week for him to come. And he gets out this book. It's wonderful. You know, there's this thing I needed in my house, and if you don't have this thing in your house, it's just going to blow up. You have this nice new house, and oh my goodness, I can't believe you don't have it. So he takes out his book, you know, and he shows me all the prices. And he says, Mr. Johnson, this is such a wonderful thing. I'm glad I got you on this date, because, you know, see these prices here? There's three columns, three or four columns. I'll tell you something, you know. This is what normal people pay right here. See how high that is? But I'll tell you what. just because you're new to the community and I like you. What can I say? I really like you. You know, you're new to the community. We got this thing going just to the end of the week. We'll give you this price here. It's a little cut rate thing. It's really kind of neat. And I'm going, yeah, really good. No, I'm not. I'm going, lies, lies, lies. It's all lies. And then he goes, well, Mr. Johnson, what do you do for a living? I says, well, I'm a minister. He says, a minister? You're not going to believe this. We have a 10% discount for ministers. It's just wonderful. Lies, lies, lies. The biggest lie of all is there was no salesman in my house this week. Yes, there was. You think about what's advertised on TV, and you get the feeling after a while that if they did what they promised they would do, they'd be priceless. But now, for $1.95, you know, it slices and it dices and it crawls on its belly like a reptile, and you'll believe it's real. It's lies. It's all lies, and then God comes into our life. And I want you to see the contrast. Then God comes into our life, and the Bible says, God is true, and every man a liar. And the Holy Spirit takes residence in my life, and the Bible says he is the spirit of truth who wants to lead me in all truth. And when I became a believer, I stepped out of darkness and I went into light. When I became a believer, I stepped out of that system of lies into the truth. When I became a believer, the call of God in my life was to speak the truth in love. But even as a believer, I have a choice. I can either strip it off or I continue to walk around looking like I'm dead I hope you see the contrast you know I talk to people from time to time some of you businessmen and you come and we'll talk and sometimes some of you who maybe are even new in the faith you're working in your business you're working in your job you may be a mechanic I don't care what you are but one of the first things the first sign of life one of the first signs of life is that you go from lying to telling the truth. And suddenly you've got a dilemma as a businessman, don't you? That's right. I already mentioned a little bit of it. How do I sell this thing if I have to tell the truth about it? You know, I know they don't need a whole new engine. But, you know, I'm told to just kind of push that thing. I know that they don't need a furnace that's big, but I sell furnaces, you know? And what am I supposed to do? And I don't need, they don't need that much insurance. And I know they could use that money other ways and their kids need it and their family needs it and maybe the church needs it. And they don't need that much, but I sell them that much, and my product really doesn't do what I say it does. And the fact is, they could probably live real fine without the product I'm selling. And it really isn't the lowest price after all. And you know what? It isn't even important. There is no loss of integrity in not giving them the lowest price you could. Where the lying comes in is we tell them that it is. And so I trick them, and I deceive, and I lie, and I make my money, and then I go and I thank God for supplying my needs. you know what Satan fathered that not God believer one of the first signs of life one of the first signs that we are born of God is not that you quit smoking and cut your hair it's that you go from truth from lying to truth you go from lying to truth but you know what I'm not done because you know what there's all sorts of different ways that we lie and all the things I gave you might be real easy those are fairly easy for me those are little things and make a little adjustment, that's fine. There's all different ways to lie. Just telling what ain't so. That's one of the easiest, the most obvious. Simply fabricating. We would call it fabrication. And it's simply a just plain, good old, flat out, down home, down on the farm lie. Did you do it? No. Didn't you do it? Yes. You know, just absolute lie, just flat out. Another kind of lie that we get involved in is shading the truth. That would simply be called deception. I deceive and I just kind of, I just kind of color it a little bit so that the real truth doesn't come out. That's all of Satan. That's all of Satan. Even the word, I don't know if I want to get into this like it's from the Greek or anything, but shading, it's to make it look like it isn't. That's all of Satan. Another one that we get involved in, and this is getting a little closer to home for we evangelicals, is exaggeration. Exaggeration. The story is told of a guy who was wonderfully saved and went around telling his testimony, and it was just so real to him and so alive, And it was just real. It wasn't real elaborate or anything, just real. And he moved people's hearts, and he went and he gave his testimony over and over and over again. And then he started getting into this thing with people encouraging him and really getting on his case and really loving what he said. And all of a sudden he started kind of garnishing it up a little bit and making it a little bit better than it really was, exaggerating just a little bit. And finally, after years of going to places and giving his testimony, he had to stop altogether. And someone came up to him and says, why did you stop giving your testimony like you used to? He says simply this, I garnished it so much, I exaggerated it so much that I literally forgot what happened. We get caught up. We exaggerate. I do this. We pastors are really guilty of this, especially when we get into this church growth thing. I'm excited about what's happening in our church. It's a real thrill. But we have this thing, and I grew up with this, and I resist it, but I still find myself stumbling back into it. And that is this thing, you know, if we count feet. You know, we don't count people's heads, we count their feet. You know, if there's 300, 600 people, that's real innocent, isn't it? You know what? Satan fathers that. That's a lie. It's exaggeration. And what do we need it for? Strip it off. It's ugly. It looks like you're dead. Missionaries have confessed to me, and not in any proud way at all, but simply trying to deal with what God's doing in their lives. And part of it's our fault. They've said, I've been on the field, Dave, and this was in my former church, so it's no one you would ever know, but I've been in the field and I've felt so much pressure from people at home to produce and to be doing it that I write my letters home and I just make it sound way better than it really is. And I exaggerate, and it's to make me look better and to make God look better. It's a lie. And it makes us look like we haven't removed ourselves from the system. but that's okay isn't it the problem is Paul indicates that the first sign of life is we tell the truth we tell the truth and the characteristic of the believer is he tells the truth and if he's characterized by lying where then is the distinction between life and death cheating in school cheating in our business not paying our taxes betrayal of a confidence when I said I wouldn't say it, I go ahead and say it but maybe the most subtle and I end with this one maybe the most subtle and also maybe the most prevalent in our churches and even in our church and I also believe that maybe the most destructive and the one we are involved in the most is simply this that sitting in silence when the truth needs to be told is lying sitting in silence when the truth needs to be spoken is lying. You see, we are called as believers not only to not lie, we have been called to do what? To speak the truth. See, there's a difference. And we can withhold what is true and that is a lie. We are told to speak the truth. How in love? But we are to speak the truth. And withholding what is true is a lie. We see this in churches all the time. and I just, one of the things that frightens me, and one of the things that was a burden on my heart as I was doing this sermon, and considering the characteristics of a true believer, and considering what it really meant to be telling the truth, is that I see this as being one of the plagues on our church. We can see sin in the church, we can see superficiality in the church, we can see carnality in the church, and we sit in silence. And we can see those same characteristics in our leadership. We could see sin on the board. We could see sin among our elders or in our pastor's life. Or we could see superficiality and carnality. What do we do? We sit in silence. You know, next week we're going to talk about this exhortation, Be angry and do not sin. And one of the things we're going to learn is that there are things that ought to make us angry. In fact, if certain things don't result in anger from us, that's the sin. If we don't resent sin, that's sin. Something's wrong. you know I talk about leadership a lot ever since I've been here I've talked about the incredible responsibility God has placed in the lives of the leadership upon me upon our elders upon our board and I have preached sermons about the fact that God mediates his rule through godly leaders always has and always will and a church cannot grow beyond that which its leadership is able to take it but you know there are churches where year after year after year men are placed into positions of responsibility to oversee the flock of God awesome responsibility precious responsibility and they are chosen why? because they're godly men? no, because they've been there 50 years and you know what? often they aren't even godly men and you know what else? the whole church knows and you know what else? they sit in silence and you know what else? That's a lie. And you know what else? The church dies. Sitting in silence when the truth needs to be spoken is a lie. But I want to tell you, I appreciate so much the recent action of our board. Something maybe to most of you just, it would just kind of buzz over your head and it wouldn't make a difference, a hill of beans, doesn't mean nothing. But simply this, that we have taken our board meetings and taken the minutes of those meetings and put them in the newsletter. Now you say, well, big deal. And you probably don't even read them. fine. Don't read them. I don't care. It's fine. But you know what that is on the part of our board? That's an effort on the part of our board to speak the truth. Because speaking the truth is more than not just not lying. It's not holding back what needs to be told. And again, there are sicknesses in churches all over America where boards become like kind of a little sick, perverse, and in kind of a sinful way. They become this little closed society where we make all our decisions and we You just kind of, people can't handle it, and they won't really know, and they don't need to know, and I don't ever have to be responsible. And you know, that attitude just opens the door for all sorts of situations where what can happen, the truth, can be withheld. See, just hold it back. It's a lie. You know who fathers that? Satan. It has no place here. God calls it lying. Strip it off. We did, and I'm glad. Maybe it seemed like a little thing. I think we need to look for a lot of little things like that. You know why the truth is so hard to deal with? Because lying is so expedient. Lying is so easy. Lying, even withholding, is so much easier than telling. It's so much easier not to put those minutes in the bulletin because now people might ask me questions. Dave, why'd you do that? Now I've got to be responsible. Now I've got to explain. It'd be easier just to hold it back and never explain, never be responsible. Lying is the same thing. Somebody asked me if I did something, if I say, no, they're off my case. He did it, they're off my case. I don't have to explain. I don't have to be responsible. You know what? Truth makes me deal. Truth makes me deal. Even the truth about my sin, it makes me deal with my sin. If I lie about my sin, then I don't deal with it. It just goes on living. It just goes on staying there. It's on me. I look like I'm dead, but I don't tell the truth, so it looks fine to me. I don't like telling the truth, so I lie. And I shade it, or I exaggerate it, or I just withhold it. And it's all lies, and Satan is the father of all of them. Final question is this. Why is this so important? What's the big deal? The reason it's so important is what I said at the end of that verse. The reason it's so important is because we are members one of another. And this is the clincher, and I really want you to get this, because this is crucial. We are members one of another. Verse 25 at the end of the verse. Do you realize what that's saying? It's saying this, that if the body is going to be healthy, it has to be honest. There is no option. If the body of Christ is going to be healthy, it has to be honest with itself. Okay? We have to look at sin and call it sin. We cannot have any grand illusions of ourselves as a church being really going. No, the sign of life for a church isn't that more people are coming. It isn't that more money is coming in. The first sign of life for a church is what? It tells the truth about itself. you can use the physical body as an illustration it's beautiful it works real well you know our bodies are absolutely dependent and i am absolutely dependent on my body telling the truth to me okay think about that let's say if the senses are switched let's say hot is cold and cold is hot and my senses get switched okay and now I think cold is hot. So what do I do? I walk into a fire and I get burned up and the flesh is going off my bones and I'm going, hey, yeah, it's great, you know? And blindly, with wonderful merriment, I walk into a fire and I die, okay? I didn't feel any pain. That was great. The problem is I die. Your eye deceives you. Just think of it a little bit. Let's say it's not just telling a lie. It'll just withhold something, okay? Just withhold something. Hold something back. Like the fact that a semi-truck is coming at me at 80 miles an hour. That doesn't say anything. It just withholds that information. Bam, I'm gone. Okay? I'm driving down the road. My eye just shades the truth a little. Okay? Just not a lot, just a little. There's really not a curve in that road. I'm over. Our survival is absolutely dependent on the honesty of every part of the body. Absolutely. There's no getting around it. And how foolish I would be to wish that my body would quit telling me the truth, So that when I put my hand in a fire, it doesn't hurt. It's got to hurt. It's for my own self-preservation. And there's a system of pain system that hits me, and I feel it, and I go, I've got to do something about that. But we sit in silence. Two weeks ago, I talked about the fact that he gave some of his apostles and prophets and evangelists and pastor teachers what was their job to equip the saints. They are the truth-tellers. The people who are in the pulpits are the people who have to tell the truth. And if they don't tell the truth, you know what happens? If the message isn't clear, you know what happens? If the warnings aren't given, you know what happens? The body goes on its merry way into all sorts of destructive behavior and it doesn't even know it's doing it because the body isn't telling it the truth. It isn't because people's hearts are hard. It's because the body isn't telling the truth. It's because the senses aren't registering and saying that's sin, that's sin, that's sin. We're going to do that. We're going to do that. We're going to do that. listen God has built into our bodies a pain system that's honest enough to tell us when we have a problem he's built into us a system of revealing diseases you know what that symptom is that system is it's symptoms symptoms I got all sorts of physical symptoms that reveal something's wrong and when I see the symptom I can go right to the core of the problem and in the body of Christ the symptoms are also clear they go from verse 25 to verse 32 bitterness wrath anger clamor are all symptoms of what? A spiritual problem. And all symptoms of death, too. And if we see people whose lives are characterized consistently by bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, flander, malice, unforgiving spirits, where then is the life? How in the world can we pray for each other? How in the world can we minister to each other, love each other, care for each other, bear one another's burdens if we don't know what's going on with one another? so we come to church and we put on a smile and we play the game and all is well and we praise the Lord and for some of you that's a lie for some of you that's a lie and as long as you maintain the lie you're never going to be healed you know what the first sign of life is in a believer he lays aside falsehood he takes off the mask and the one who is moving you to hide what you're dealing with right now the one who right now is moving you to cram it down so you don't deal with it is not God it's the father of lies I don't even know how to end this sermon because I'm done it's about time but you know there are some people here that I some of you need to tell the truth and maybe some of you need to tell the truth for the very first time and maybe some of you here need to tell the truth about your relationship with Christ tell the truth that the reason there's been no change is that there's been no regeneration and the reason your character hasn't changed is because you're not a new creature and tell the truth about the fact that maybe you're a professor and not a possessor.
