Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Well, hey everybody, welcome to Open Door. My name is Steve Wiens. I'm the teaching pastor around here. It's awesome to be with you, and I'd love to pray as we dive into the message. Jesus, that you would be a cold drink of water today to people who are dying of thirst. Amen. So I want to start with a question today. You know, it's summertime, as Joel said, and it's time to relax and kick back and go on vacation. go to Maple Grove days. But the question is this, if your level of stress could be displayed on the screens behind me, like an RPM gauge in a car, how close would yours be to redline? Even in the middle of summer, how close would you be to redlining it? Now, if you have trouble answering that question, I want to roll through some typical behaviors of people when they are close to or over redline. Let's see if they describe you. So if you find yourself yelling at inanimate objects like a computer whose internet connection is too slow or a car that's having trouble starting with the hope that that yelling can bend it, the inanimate object, to your will, You are probably redlining it. If you find yourself responding to the people that you love with passive aggressive guilt trips, like when you can't immediately get a hold of them even though you've called their cell phone, home phone, work phone, you've emailed them and texted them as well as posted a Facebook status update about where they are. If that's you, you're probably redlining it. If you have kids and you set up mock races at the end of the day with them, kids, let's see who can get in the bath and then get into bed fastest. That's, wow, that one touched the court, I could tell. That one was poignant. Well, if that's you, it's probably more about your own need to get through it than your kids winning a race and you're redlining it. If you find yourself obsessively making lists, and to know whether you're an obsessive list maker or not, you are one if you've ever done this. If you've ever done something and then realized it wasn't on your list, so you go back to the list and add it and then immediately cross it off. Yeah. That's, you're redlining it if that's you. and if when you're preparing a sermon for the week if you are agonizing over it worrying over it to the point that you wake up in the middle of the night wondering whether it's good or not and you call your friends the next day then you are dave johnson but Bonnie knows I'm right right that is Dave John okay well a couple more if you find yourself desperately seeking down time but once you get it you find that you can't relax and so you pull out something to distract yourself like email or tv then you're redlining it if you're abusing alcohol or other chemicals or your addiction to pornography has gotten really out of control and you say to yourself, as soon as this crazy season in my life is over, then I'll stop. Then you're redlining it. So, question. Is anybody in here redlining it? The ironic thing is that we devise strategies that will keep us at redline. When we stop long enough to catch our breath, we realize how exhausted we are, so we take a vacation. But has anyone ever noticed? A few of you see this coming. That when you get back from vacation, you're embarrassed to admit that you kind of would like another little vacation to get over your vacation. Because you're so exhausted. This is such a disappointing, depressing moment, but actually this moment is a gift because it reveals something that we believe about rest that isn't true. I think we believe rest is a strategy that we use to deal with our exhausting lives. When we get so exhausted we can't breathe anymore, we take a little rest, hoping that it will fuel us back up so that we can live at the same pace, Redlining it through life. And the question has to be, is that working for anyone? Or is there a better way to live? Well, when Jesus invited people to live according to his way, he invited them to live differently. To live differently. It's found, this invitation in Matthew 11, 28. This translation comes from the message. The words of Jesus. Are you tired? Are you worn out? Are you burned out on religion? Then come to me. Get away with me and you'll recover your life. I'll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me. Watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won't lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me, and you'll learn to live freely and lightly. Well, Jesus kept a pretty hectic schedule, so I think you'll wonder if what he actually says is actually true, because it seems impossible that anyone that lived his life could describe it as free and light. But let's assume for a moment that what he is saying about this different kind of life is actually true, that by following him, you could recover your life or even discover a life that you've never had before. one of my fears as we've wound our way through this seven year series that we're calling the way of the rabbi is that some people think i think without even saying it that that this this way is this impossible task that the way of jesus is so unheard of and nobody does it that it's actually exhausting and life-taking instead of life-giving. So we're gonna take a one-week break from doing the parables to look at how Jesus looked at rest and what rhythms Jesus had in his life, followers of Jesus have had for thousands of years. Well, my wife Mary and I used to live in St. Louis Park, and we lived in this neighborhood that was primarily Jewish. And so every Saturday, we would see families walking down the street to different synagogues. We lived in the middle of about four synagogues. And on Saturdays was the Sabbath for Jewish people. And on the Sabbath, Jewish people do not work. They don't drive their cars. They don't watch TV. They don't engage in any kind of technology. They don't cook or clean. It's a day of rest, and it comes every single Saturday. Whether it was bright blue sunny skies or 25 below zero, Mary and I would watch out our living room window, and we would see people walking to synagogue on Sabbath. So the question is, why? Why would they do it that faithfully? Well, the first thing you need to know about the Sabbath is that God practiced it. God instituted it. We read in Genesis that God did the work of creating for six days, and then on the seventh day, God rested. We read it in Genesis 2, 1 through 3. Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. And by the seventh day, God had finished the work that God had been doing. And so on the seventh day, God rested from all his work. Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on it, God rested from all the work of creating that God had done. So the question is why? Why did God rest? Was God tired? I think God was probably energized by the creating he did because God is a creative being. That is his essence. But God did rest. And I think God rested, not because God was tired, but because God was finished with the work that God had set out to do. God was finished, and so God rested. And that leads me to a question that we have to wrestle with. How often do you feel like you're finished with your work? Your work of parenting. Got that done. My kids are two and three and a half months. Done. It's giving me gray hair. How often do you feel like you're finished with your relational work, with your spouse, or your coworkers, or your roommates? How often do you feel like you're finished with your actual job? well we often feel like we're never finished and so we redline it through life but if you were at rest if your mind and soul and body were at rest it would be a time that you're not worried about anything that you're not making lists or yelling at the computer because it's too slow person who is at rest and finished with their work feels like they have room for whatever it is that they would encounter moment by moment, even if they find themselves quite busy. My son Isaac, he's two, I've told you that, he lives every moment of every day like this. I have never run across a little list that he has made about things he wants to do that day. He doesn't worry. He fundamentally lives as if he has room for whatever he encounters, moment by moment. Isaac lives his life at rest. Even though, and you have to trust me on this, he's two, he is extremely busy. The psalmist describes this kind of life in Psalm 131, verse two. Let's read this together. But I have calmed myself. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, just slow down, people. He's so fast. So fast. Let's start over. But I have calmed myself and quieted my ambitions. I'm like a weaned child with its mother. Like a weaned child, I am content. Is that true for anyone in here? I've calmed myself. I've quieted my ambitions. They used to be loud in my ears, but now I'm at rest. I'm content. You ever seen a child after he's just nursed, kind of rosy-cheeked? My kids, after they nurse, they look like this. But pretty soon, Isaac and Ben and Elijah will find themselves yelling at inanimate objects. they'll learn that their parents can't totally be trusted not every moment because we're human beings and my kids will suppose that God can't be trusted either and so my kids will forget how to trust and they'll start redlining it through life if they were wise they would do what followers of Jesus have done for thousands of years they would start learning how to calm and quiet themselves by practicing the Sabbath and in doing so, remembering that God can be trusted. So here's the deal. If you're redlining it through life, could it be that what you primarily need most is not simply rest or a break, but to learn how to trust again? that there is a God that is big enough to run your life with all of its complications to partner with you in getting done what actually needs to get done? Could it be that that's what we need? On the back of a dollar bill there's a very interesting sentence right in the middle. If you turn it over, you'll read it. And it says what? In God we trust. Isn't that ironic? That on the back of the very thing that we in America trust the most, a dollar bill, that says, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's in God that we trust. If that was true, if that was really true, we would not be redlining it through life. And as Christians, I don't even think it's true for most of us. We would say, oh yes, it's in God that we trust. I trust in God, but the level of our worry, the level of our stress, and the pace of our lives betray the fact that in fact we do not trust in God. And this is where the Sabbath comes in. Practicing a Sabbath reminds us that God can be trusted to provide what we need, and because of that, we can rest. See, I think we need to practice a kind of Sabbath or a Sabbath rhythm because it teaches us to actually trust in God. I think sometimes Christians, as Christians, we glibly say when life is getting crazy, we'll just spit out this sentence. I just got to give it to God as if it's like dropping a DVD, a rented DVD back in the collection box. His problem, right? Or every once in a while we'll ask each other, when did you trust Jesus? As if it was one moment in time and that's it. Now, I do believe there's a moment in your life where you need to say fundamentally, I am turning from this way and going toward following Jesus. But it's not just one moment, is it? I find that I am having to do that day after day after day. that I spend my life losing my trust in God and then finding it again. It's like Dave says about the sheep. You know, most sheep don't rage at God and their shepherds and say, oh, I'm going. They just smell something better and wander away. Well, so do we, don't we? Now, some of us rage at God and that's even an okay thing. But most of us wander away from God and we find ourselves in the middle of a field and we're wondering, how did we get here? I feel so lost. And then we learn to trust again. And then we lose our trust. And then we learn to trust again. And that's the story of God's people found in the scriptures. We trust and we forget how to trust and then we learn how to trust again. Let's normalize this. If what trusting means is believing that someone or something will come through. That's what trusting means, that someone or something that you put your trust in will come through. If you have one honest bone in your body, you'll admit that you wake up some days and you realize that you stopped believing God will come through for you. Because life is painful and disappointing and you'll wonder why God hasn't come through for you in the way that you had hoped God would. Now, when this happens to me, it leads me to ask all kinds of questions. Like, what can I trust God for? And what are the things that I just sort of want? They're not things that God needs to provide. They're just things that I want. What's the difference between those two things? And what are the things that really God has to come through for for me? Because if God doesn't, no one will. And what about when I do receive a gift from God that I've been praying for? and God blesses me with something that someone else is praying for and doesn't get. How do I wrestle with that? And these are all just the crazy things that my mind goes through and I'm inviting you into it in the hopes that you won't think I'm completely crazy because I think that they enter your mind as well. So believe it or not, living out the Sabbath can teach us how to live in those questions. without going crazy. Living out the Sabbath will teach us how to live in those questions without losing our minds. So let's learn some more about the Sabbath. In Deuteronomy 5, we read about how God wanted the people of Israel to live out the Sabbath and live in those questions. One day per week, God said, they were to rest from all their labor. And this is interesting. It was instituted after they were delivered from Egypt. because in Egypt they worked seven days a week because they were slaves. And so a part of the Sabbath was a reminder to them about who they were. As free people, they worked six days a week. And on the seventh, they rested. And on that seventh day, in remembering that they were free, they remembered who it was that freed them. It was God that delivered them from Egypt. But it didn't stop there, not just one day per week. In Leviticus 25, we read about how on the seventh year, the children of God were supposed to let their fields have a Sabbath rest. They weren't supposed to sow any seed or prune their vineyards. We read about it in Leviticus 25, 6 and 7. I'm sure many of you read this this morning before you came to church. Whatever the land yields during the Sabbath year will be food for you. For yourself, your male and female servants, and the hired worker and temporary resident who live among you, as well as for your livestock and even the wild animals in your land. Whatever the land produces, not what you sow or reap, whatever the land produces may be eaten. Now, if your living is based on what you grow and eat and sell, can you imagine the kind of worry that would cause you? that for one whole year you couldn't sow. You'd think, what if there isn't enough during the Sabbath year? And I'm supposed to not only feed my own family, but my servants, my hired workers, and my livestock as well? I'm drawing the line at wild animals, right? No. Well, God anticipated this worry. In Leviticus 25, 20, we read this, and this is so funny. God's words. You may ask, what will we eat in the seventh year if we don't plant or harvest our crops? Well, here's God's answer. I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years. Now, what would you have to believe during years one through five? God's going to provide. God said that God would provide in the sixth year, so I'm not going to store any extra in years one through five, though that would be the temptation, wouldn't it? And maybe some of the folks would have kind of bartered with God and said, you know, God, if you said that you would provide it in the fourth year, wouldn't that be better? Because then if you didn't provide it, we would still have the fifth and sixth year to kind of store things away. This is where God is brilliant. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You need to learn to trust that I will provide. So I will provide it, but you're gonna have to wait until the sixth year. Brilliant. The same principle is used when the children of Israel were wandering around the desert for 40 years. God provides them with manna, which translated literally is, what the heck is this? It is. Well, I'm serious. Every single morning, manna covered the ground like snow. But God instructed them to go out and gather the manna enough for one day, not enough for the week. And if you did gather it, we read in the scriptures, for more than a day, the extra would rot, except for on the sixth day. You could gather enough for that day and the Sabbath that would follow, and it would not rot. It's amazing. Why does God do this? Is it a trick? Is God capricious and just wants to see people in pain and worrying? No, I think you, in order to believe that God really will provide, you need to wake up in the morning, look out and see, oh my goodness, God did it again. God provided again. When Jewish people practice the Sabbath, still today, begins on a Friday night at sundown. And they light candles as part of the ritual. And when the candles are being lit, before they're lit, the people around the table will cover their eyes. And then when the candles are lit, they uncover their eyes as a way of reminding themselves that in the beginning, it was God that separated darkness from light. It was God that brought light to the world. And then they thank God for the faithfulness that God has shown to them through the years. See, practicing the Sabbath is a way that Jewish people have remembered God's faithfulness in the past, even when times are incredibly difficult in the present. Week in, week out, whether times are good or times are bad, they set work aside and practice these rituals as a way to remember that it was God that freed them from Egypt, and it will be God that will free them from their current troubles. We read this in Isaiah 42, 16. I will lead the blind by ways they have not known. Along unfamiliar paths, I will guide them. And I will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough places smooth. These are the things that I will do, says the Lord. I will not forsake them. And like years and years of water pouring over a rough rock, like rough rock is eventually made smooth, practicing the Sabbath year after year in good times and in bad will eventually teach you that God can be trusted. So over time, the result of practicing the Sabbath will be rest, which is not a strategy to deal with tiredness. Even though, don't get me wrong, you need rest. You need to get enough sleep and to take breaks. But rest cannot provide you with what you need in order to slow the RPMs down. Rest is the result when you've learned to trust in something other than what's making you tired. So let's get practical. If you wanted to develop some Sabbath rhythms in your life, you'd need to know that a Sabbath rhythm involves three things. Firstly, it's setting aside a regular disciplined time that nothing gets in the way of. Number two, you would decide to rest from something that you normally rely on so that you can learn that God can be relied on instead of that thing that you normally rely on, like making lists or working or creating or the technology that you're addicted to. Number three is engaging in something that's life-giving. So how would this look? If you tried a weekly Sabbath, again, you'd set aside one day of the week for a period of time and make sure nothing violates it. I remember Mary and I would talk to our alley neighbors, Mark and Julie, who were observant Jews, and we asked them about their practice of the Sabbath. And they said, you know, it's so interesting that you're so interested in it because most of our friends, it's a major inconvenience to them. Because on a Saturday, they ask us to drive, you know, three or four miles to go do something, and we have to say no. We can't. So it is something that you're going to have to ruthlessly guard and set aside. Then you need to decide what it is that you would rest from so that you can learn to rely on God instead. And for me over the years, one of the things that I've decided that I needed to rest from the most is just technology. I'm sort of a technology geek and addict. And so, you know, my computer, my iPhone, I've had to just say, no, I'm not going to check email. I'm not going to get on the internet. I'm not going to, you know, text or not going to do any of that stuff. And it's embarrassing to admit how hard that has been for me when I've decided to do that. I would go upstairs. My little office used to be upstairs in our old house in St. Louis Park, even though Mary knew it was the Sabbath. And I would kind of say, going up to go to the bathroom, sweetie. And then I would go in my office and kind of quick check it. And then I would go, oh no, this is the Sabbath. I can't do this. You know? And I would feel stupid because why in the world was it so hard? I think it's because at least for me, I used that as a way to push away the feelings that would otherwise rise up without distractions. For you, it really might be making lists. It certainly is, I think, doing a lot of work. Now, you may say, oh, what do you mean? I can't make a meal or do any laundry on the Sabbath? I can't do that. Yes, you can. Jewish people have done it every single Saturday for thousands of years, so so can you. You can set aside time to rest from the things that are work so that you can remember that God can be trusted. And you might want to, in those times, Mary, my wife, is just brilliant at these things, but do little rituals that remind you that it's God that can be trusted. On Sabbath days, we used to have three candles that we would light for dinner time representing the Holy Spirit and the Father and the Son. We would light them and do a little prayer as a way of reminding us It's God that gives life. It's God that sustains life. And it's God that breathes new life. It's God that can be trusted. Now lastly, when you do the Sabbath, you need to decide to do something that's really life-giving. The Sabbath is not meant to be in a straight jacket. What time is it? 8.30 a.m. Okay. No, play as a family. Laugh together. If you're married, have sex with your spouse. yes i said that the sabbath i mean what else are you gonna do you're not working right i i heard a woo that's great the sabbath is a time to eat really good food it's about enjoying the gifts that god has given you with the people that you love the most it's not just a fast designed to make you miserable. Now, if you decide to engage in this, I would encourage you to do it as a little group of people that you live with. That's the most important thing, because if you've got one person trying to do the Sabbath, the other person, like, doing laundry, you can get into some problems. So it really needs to be a family kind of decision. And if you do this, don't look for immediate results. Many people, including myself, who have tried this, because you unplug from all these distractions that normally keep you busy, one of the things that happens is that you get depressed because all the feelings that you've pushed aside by the distractions come up for you. So it's important that if you're going to try this, do it for a long period of time. Decide to do it for at least six months or a year so that you can get the benefit of, over time, learning that God can be trusted. You can also try to practice the Sabbath during parts of the day as different opportunities present themselves. Might be over your lunch hour at work, or even a five-minute break, where you intentionally rest from productivity, and you can just breathe in prayers to God about thanking God for all the gifts that God has given you. Because gratitude leads to trust, and trust leads to rest. And as you're doing this, you might just breathe slowly in and breathe slowly out. You can feel your pulse slowing, and your RPMs start to go down. You might practice eating your food more slowly. If you're mindful of how you eat, you'll be amazed at how fast you gobble down your food. Or you might decide, if you're shopping at the grocery store, to do the longest checkout line. And even let one person in ahead of you. Without Oh, gosh. I went golfing alone this past week. I was on, I was off this last week, and I love actually being alone. I love golfing alone, but I was stuck behind this really slow foursome, and they were stuck behind another slow foursome, and so they weren't letting me through, and I was thinking about this message, though, so I was trying to relax, and so every tea box, I had at least five minutes to just sit on the little bench, and it was a gorgeous summer day, but I reached into my pocket and pulled out my iPhone and checked email and texted a few people because I was not okay with even five minutes of just time, even though I would have said, as a father of three young children, I desperately need time alone, time where I'm not doing anything, time where I'm just breathing. Well, it's very hard to simply rest. So it will take discipline. so if you like me are redlining it through life the question is do you want to change and if you're willing if you want to change are you willing to change what it is that you trust in so that you can recover your life if you're going to do that it's going to require a kind of ruthless practicing out something like the Sabbath, where you decide to unplug from that which you trust so that you can learn that it is God in whom you can trust. And when you do that over the course of months and years, you'll feel the RPM start to slow down. And you'll find yourself beginning to recover your life. So as I close, hear the words of Jesus as an invitation. again found in Matthew 11. You might even close your eyes or not but get in a spot where you can really hear this invitation. Are you tired? Are you worn out? Are you burned out on religion? Then come to me. Get away with me and you'll recover your life. I'll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me. Work with me. Watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won't lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Here's the invitation. Keep company with me. and you'll learn to live freely and lightly. Let's pray together. Jesus, this invitation toward a different way to live. It's what we need. But man, do we need courage to accept it. Courage to turn our back on the things that we think give us life that really don't. Courage to practice a discipline like the Sabbath where we set aside and unplug from the things that keep us busy and distracted so that we can get in touch with you again and learn that you really can be trusted. So Jesus, in the quietness of this moment, I pray that you would invite each of us in unique and personal ways to come to you. That you would move among us even now, quieting our spirits, slowing us down so that we can even hear those three amazing words, come to me. As we breathe in and breathe out, Holy Spirit, breathe the life of God into us so that we can recover our lives. Amen. Amen. Have a great rest of the weekend, everybody. Thank you.
