Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Let's pray as we go to the Word this morning. My request this morning, Father, is very simple, and that's one we often make in this church from this pulpit, for eyes to see. Help us to even see where we are blind and don't know it, I pray it in Jesus' name, amen. Well, as most of you know, we've been dealing with the parables of Jesus for several months, and for the last couple of weeks, Steve Weins has been dealing with a parable that's found in Mark chapter 4 that has raised for us a number of questions. Among them was this question, are we able to see? Particularly, are we able to see all of the creative and energetic ways in which God has sown really good seed everywhere? Even in the darkest of places, he was kind of expanding our thinking on these things, sometimes in the most unlikely of places, can you see? Do we have eyes to see? Which is, as most of you know, if you've been with us in these parables, a recurring theme in the teaching of Jesus, particularly in the parables of Jesus, where Jesus speaks in a variety of ways of people who can or cannot see the truth about themselves a lot of times, about God most of all, about the kingdom of God as well, who often think they see, and this is where it gets tricky and a little bit scary, but they don't see, whose biggest problem is that they say they see. So oddly, they're blind to the fact that they're blind, which is pretty blind. You're kind of double blind, which was it, in fact, at least part of the problem for a certain rich man. In the parable we're going to deal with today that Jesus talks about in Luke 16, beginning in verse 19, who was incapable of seeing a desperately poor man who sat just outside his gate, and he sat there every day. If you have your Bibles this morning, I'd like you to open them to Luke's gospel, the 16th chapter. And as you do that, I just want to set the scene for this parable for you just a little bit, for a parable that's come to be known as the parable of Lazarus and the rich man, because it's preceded by another parable. And it's really important to catch the meaning of the parable we'll deal with today, to keep it in context with this one. And it's a parable we dealt with a couple of weeks ago, also in Luke 16, where Jesus is making clear the importance to kingdom people of putting all the resources of your life. Financial resources was the analogy he was using, but we expanded it and so did Jesus. To all the resources you have at your disposal, your intelligence, your capacities, your giftings, your money, into purposes of the kingdom so as to make friends. Remember that? Making friends of people who may just show up in heaven someday and to put those resources into play, and this was the point, in ways that are shrewd and creative and resourceful and energetic. Luke 16, 8, it was the parable of the dishonest steward. Because to whom much is given, much is required, Jesus said in response to the parable, and because the resources you have don't belong to you just for you, and because he that is faithful in that which is little is faithful also in much, and because, and this is kind of at the tail end of that parable, actually after that parable, no one can serve two masters, Jesus said. You cannot serve God and money, but the Pharisees, listening to all of this, and this kind of brings us from that parable to the next one we're going to deal with today, but the Pharisees, it says in verse 14, who were lovers of money, Jesus just got done saying you can't serve God and money, were listening to all of these things about how you need to put the resources God has given you into play for purposes of the kingdom and serving people, and they were scoffing at him. Remember back in chapter 15 of Luke, they were grumbling at Jesus because he received sinners and he ate with them as well. Here, they're scoffing at him at the suggestion that they had responsibility to use their resources, not just on themselves. That word scoffing is interesting. Literally, in the Greek, it's more of a phrase. And it literally means they lifted up their noses at him. It's interesting to get that visual. No words were involved in their response to Jesus. No words were needed. You can see them rolling their eyes, shaking their heads, as if to say, what an idiot this guy is. Dismissing him out of hand. So that's the context, the setting, if you will, into which Jesus is going to tell the story we're dealing with this morning about a certain rich man. And as we hear this parable unfold this morning, you're going to actually begin to wonder, is Jesus trying on purpose to pick a fight? Is he trying on purpose to get himself killed? Because he's talking about a certain rich man, Luke 16, verse 19, who, like the Pharisees, were lovers of money. so he's talking in this parable to and about them there was a certain rich man let's look at the text verse 19 and he habitually dressed in purple and fine linen gaily living in splendor every day in fact is in the jewish calendar there were seven major feasts because god knew it was important for his people to not get pulled down into some of the things that might depress and discourage you, so I command you. That really was true. Seven feasts a year where you put all that stuff aside and have a party and drink the finest of wines and the finest of meats seven times a year in the course of a year. But this guy, this is on purpose, this is all part of the Jewish context within which they would be hearing this, was feasting every day, seven times a year, every day. And the purple fabric and linen that he habitually wore was extremely expensive. They would have known that. Only the wealthiest of the wealthy could afford purple fabric, but he habitually, it's interesting, Jesus says that on purpose, wore this stuff, which means his consumption and his wealth was conspicuous, and he wanted it to be conspicuous. He wanted to be noticed as a wealthy person. He wanted to be seen again, just this benign little story. No, this is exactly like the Pharisees, to whom Jesus said in verse 15, just prior to the parable we're dealing with today, he says to these Pharisees, you are those who always need to look good, who justify yourselves in the sight of man. But here's the problem for you. God knows your hearts. That really is bad news for them, because they had greedy, self-absorbed hearts. And while some might be impressed. Jesus is saying in this 15th verse, by your pretentious show of piety spiritually and wealth physically, it actually makes God sick. The verse says, for that which is highly esteemed among men, and you score points there, is detestable in the sight of God. So there was a certain rich man, just picking this one out of the air, who liked to show off, and he feasted every day, but there was also a certain poor man named Lazarus, verse 20, was laid at the rich man's gate covered with sores and longing to be fed with crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. And besides that, or on top of all that, even the dogs were coming. The guy was so helpless there and licking his sores. And both of these things are happening every day. In other words, the rich man is feasting every day. And the man named Lazarus was being laid at this rich man's gate every day. A little side note here. In all the parables that Jesus ever told, it didn't dawn on me until I kind of read this in the commentaries this week. It's very interesting, though. This is the only parable where he ever gives to one of his fictitious characters an actual name. In this case, it's Lazarus. Lots of speculation as to why my theory is this, that Jesus is intentionally giving to this man who in his physical life, no one would have regarded, no one would have seen. That's the whole point of the parable. Lazarus and others didn't even see this guy. He's giving this guy on purpose a sense of dignity, a sense of identity, as if Jesus is saying with a sternness almost in his spirit. Listen, everybody, this guy's name that nobody notices and would just as soon step over has a name. His name is Lazarus. No connection, by the way, just so you get it out of your mind to Lazarus of John 12, who Jesus raised from the dead. This is another guy. In fact, this guy doesn't exist. He's making him up. Lazarus is a type of person. And the rich man, this is another thing to note here, who in this life would have clearly been seen because he wore purple every day. You kind of notice that. And highly regarded is referred to in the parable as this certain guy, this certain rich man, just this rich guy. He's just some guy, this rich guy, as if Jesus said, you know the type, dime a dozen, but that's all spinning things because in Jesus' day, the rich guy would have been wow, and the poor guy would have been yuck. The poor guy got a name. The poor guy got a name. His name is Lazarus. And all of this is on purpose. I think you know that now by our understanding of the parables, because once again, Jesus is reversing the order of things to stir things up, reversing the order of things where who matters and who doesn't gets turned inside out and upside down. He's doing it again. Let's move on now, verse 22, as the story unfolds. It came about that the poor man died, and he was carried away by the angels to Abraham's bosom. And a rich man also died, and he was buried. And in Hades, or Hades, depending on how you say that, he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried out and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue, for I'm in agony in this flame. But Abraham said, Child, remember that your life, that during your life you received good things and likewise Lazarus bad things, but now he's being comforted here and you're in agony, so na-na-na-na-na. Anyway, not quite. It's weird what people do with this. I'm going to unpack this as best I can as we go. And besides all this, between us, this is very significant, between us and you, there is a great chasm fixed in order that those who wish to come over from here to you may not be able and that none may cross over from there to us. I'm not done with the parable, but I want you to stop right there. Break this down a little bit, because this parable not only is a little weird, in fact, it's a lot weird, I think. It's a little bit... Excuse me, I hate it. I'm in that awkward age. It's so strange. This parable's a little disturbing. You know, the torment and the fire and the reversal, and if you just don't think very deeply, like rich guys go to hell and poor guys go to heaven, that's not true. Other things are going on here. let me help you see some things I think we need to see here. First of all, the rich man is behind his gate, his wall in life. And what that wall does is keep people out, particularly people like Lazarus, who you kind of want to have out. But this gate he has built to keep people out does something else. And at the beginning, you don't see the downside of this, but it also keeps him in. So the gate or the wall he's building that's designed by him to protect himself from people like that, you know, Lazarus, the Lazarus kind of person that you just don't want to have to see also, and it does do that. It protects you from that. That's a good thing. That's how you're thinking. But the downside is that it also isolates you. It insulated him. It literally cut him off in ways that on the front end, he didn't see the danger of. Cut him off in ways he couldn't feel, he couldn't see. He didn't care about, at least not in this life. But later, this nightmarish parable kind of unfolds. It's really interesting, and this is on purpose. You've got to catch the language of metaphor and parable here. the gate and the wall that this rich man built for himself in life transforms in the second life when he dies, it becomes not just a gate, it becomes a chasm. So the picture is this, that what is going on at one level in life, you just kind of see it in a small way, but it's significant and visible, is in some sense in the parable still going on after life, but at a much higher level, a bigger level, it's not a gate anymore that's separating them. It's a chasm. Whoa, when did the gate become a chasm? And it's a chasm that is fixed. Verse 26. Which means in some strange way, just kind of ask the Spirit of God even to ignite your imagination here and see the picture that Jesus is trying to paint. It means that the rich man, in some sense, got exactly what he wanted. Because what he wanted in life was to have nothing to do with people like Lazarus. He wanted distance. He wanted disconnection. He wanted isolation. He wanted insulation. And even in this life, so he built a gate. That's what he got. But then in the next life, that gate became a chasm. So here's the weird thing I want you to deal with. in some sense, the hell he's in, he helped to build. Weird. And in some sense, he wouldn't have it any other way. Here's the deal. He, in life, he didn't want to be anywhere near Lazarus. He wouldn't have wanted to be anywhere near Lazarus in the other life either. This picture of heaven would have been people just like me. That's what he got. but it was hell. This is weird thinking. I know. I'm kind of bending your brain a little bit, but Jesus is doing it, not me, so there you go. Blame him. Actually, I was fascinated by this, and I thought of, and maybe you're thinking about yourself, C.S. Lewis wrote a book called The Great Divorce. Remember that? And it's about a guy who gets a bus tour of hell. Well, is that literal? Anyway, no. But it makes you think. it makes you wonder about these things. And among the things this group of people on this bus tour observes is how the neighborhoods in hell are laid out. Well, that's a weird way to think about hell. I know. Is that true? No. Yes. Anyway, the neighborhoods are there. You're looking at this thing in hell, and you're in hell. But what you notice right off is the people are so quarrelsome that as soon as someone gets settled into a house on a street, they start to argue, And they start to fight. So before you know it, they're so angry and irritated that they decide to move. I can't stand these people. And so they do move. And they move on to another street. And in C.S. Lewis' story, they go on to another street. And all the houses are there. But they're all empty because they all had a fight. And they all left too. But soon people come and they fight and they leave. And this cycle just keeps going on and on and on. The quarrel with the new neighbor. And they hate them more than the last neighbor. So they move again. and they move again and again and again until they move so far. And this is C.S. Lewis' just wild imagination that they are entirely alone and they move so far from each other that over time in eternity, they are thousands, they are millions of miles away from each other because they just keep going away from each other. And the further they get from these people who irritated them, in some sense, the better they feel. Finally, I'm away from those jerks. Heaven. This is heaven. I love it here. This isn't heaven. You're in hell. And you made it yourself. You got exactly what you wanted. I want to read you part of this. It's so fascinating to me. I'll just read it. Millions of miles from us and others, Every now and then they move further still. That's one of the disappointments. This is funny. I thought we'd meet interesting historical characters here in hell, but you don't. They all move so far away from each other, you can't ever find them. But it'd be distance of light years to find them. The nearest famous one in his story here was Napoleon. About 15,000 years of our time it took to find him. Just a little pinprick of light and nothing else near it for millions of miles. but they got there? that's right they did what was Napoleon doing? walking up and down up and down all the time left, right, left, right never stopping for a moment no one within millions of miles of him the two chaps who finally found him watched him from outside for about a year and he never stopped muttering to himself all day long for years and years it was Solt's fault it was Nii's fault It was Josephine's fault It was the fault of the Russians It was the fault of the English Like this endlessly all the time Never stops for a moment The little fat man He looked extremely tired And constantly angry But he was unable to stop It was hell And he wouldn't have had it any other way Want to go to heaven Napoleon? No! I hate all those people Okay, good now no no no no keep in mind who it is that jesus is telling this story to because there is no actual rich man the rich man is a type of person and there is no poor man named lazarus doesn't exist lazarus is a type of person he's speaking to the pharisees religious people who like the rich man in the parable wanted nothing to do with people like lazarus the unclean and we've studied here at Open Door enough of the posture of the Pharisees relative to things like this that we know that one of the ways that Pharisees, and it's this way today where religious people tend to try to show how spiritual they are by how far they stay from people like that. Again, remember in Luke 15.1, the Pharisees were grumbling at Jesus because he received sinners and ate with them as well, and good spiritual people like that would never do that. And so instead, these Pharisees were using all of their resources, whether they be theological resources or financial resources, they were using their resources to build gates and walls to keep the Lazaruses of the world out. And in the building of these walls, to keep those kind of people out, they really thought they were building for themselves the perfect, godly community. They were creating heaven on earth. It's just us. When in fact, they were building for themselves a kind of hell. See the picture? Churches can get like this. Where instead of using the resources God has given us, our finances, our intellect, our capacities, our creativity, instead of using all those things and putting them into play and even feeling a responsibility to take every gift we have and put it into play to tear down the walls, to find the Lazaruses among us and bind their wounds and feed them food instead of putting them all into play that way. Historically, it's religious people like the Pharisees who use their resources to build really nice gates and walls to keep people out. Behind these walls, you feel safe. But while you're keeping people out, you're isolating yourself from the very people God called us to seek and to save. And you just can't do it when you have a wall. Often they're the defenders of the truth. But you see this among Christians. Always in a fight with somebody because we're right and they're wrong and as you do that, you're fighting for the truth but the inadvertent result that you didn't see when you were doing it is you're further and further and further away keeping more and more and more people out. And while you're doing that, you think you're building heaven on earth. We're right. It's so good to be right with you. There's two of us. When in fact they're creating for themselves a kind of hell, but the spin so frightening is this hell that you're creating, that you think is heaven, is exactly what you wanted. Back to the parable of verse 22. When Lazarus dies, he is carried by angels to Abraham's bosom. It says, which is nice, wouldn't you want to be there? Whatever. A couple of things about this I think matter. First is this, that in this life, Lazarus was laid at the rich man's grave every day, it says in verse 20. Apparently, by friends or family who carried him there, because it says he was laid there every day, so somebody carried him there. Again, you have this thing of something going on in life that's going on in the afterlife as well, because in death, something similar happens, only it's bigger and grander. It's not his friends. Now it's the angels. I love this. Who come and carry him, not to the rich man's gate, but to Abraham's bosom, where he will in fact be welcomed and cared for and ministered to like he should have been by the rich man. Second thing just to unpack here for you is this Abraham's bosom thing. Some of your translations say Abraham's side because they were too embarrassed to say bosom. Anyway, weird. Not that's me. but to a first century Jew this wouldn't have been the picture they would have had wouldn't have been weird it would have been to be at Abraham's side was to be at a great feast that's just what it meant to be at a banquet and a party and here's Lazarus no longer eating oh man no longer eating the crems that he hopes would fall from the rich man's table he's reclining at table with Abraham himself much like John did at the last supper the disciple that Jesus loved remember that reclining on Jesus' breast. They were all reclining. That's how they did dinner. You'd be sitting down and reclining, kind of holding each other up by leaning on each other. And again, it's a picture in metaphor of heaven. Is heaven going to be just like this? Yeah, and no. It's a metaphor. Heaven for Lazarus being marked by, among other things, your favorite meal with people who you love and people who want you there and think that you belong. No longer shut out, you've been brought near. No longer eating scraps, you've come to a feast. So what Jesus is saying here to the Pharisees in the form of this parable, just this story, he's telling, oh mercy. This is so confrontational because what he's saying here in this parable is precisely what he'd already said in Luke 13, 29 and also Mark, Mac, new Bible book, Matthew 8, verse 11, when Jesus said to the same kind of people, you need to know something, this is going to bug you, but many will come from the east and the west. We'll sit at the table of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, but the sons of the kingdom will be cast into outer darkness. And in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Gnashing of teeth, it's a picture of hell. And, you know, because there's so much torment. Listen, the gnashing of teeth in this context is not anguish, physical anguish. The gnashing of teeth is anger. They'll be so angry. Just like they were in life. I mean, you can almost, when Jesus is telling his parable, and when he says what he says, many will come from the east and the west in Matthew 8, you can almost hear the Pharisees grumbling at the thought that people from the east and the west would be at the table because they would say something. You mean publicans and sinners will be at the table? Then I don't want to be. Don't worry. You won't be. Indeed, you'll get just exactly what you want. Are you connecting the dots here? This is huge, I think. Because you'd hate it at this table. Because people in life who you hated will be there. And you'll look at it and go, I don't want to be there. And God will say, okay, okay, okay. To a number of the commentators, it was interesting. Most notably, Kenneth Bailey, who I've mentioned several times in his book, Jesus Through Middle Eastern Eyes, noted that when the rich man talks across this abyss from Hades into Abraham's bosom in this wildly, again, imaginative parable and asks for just a drop of water to cool his tongue. The noticing that Kenneth Bailey had was that he talks to Abraham. And I didn't notice that until Kenneth Bailey's. He doesn't address Lazarus. He doesn't, Lazarus, I'm sorry. I noticed you now. I wish I had. He doesn't. He talks to Abraham. And the indication there was that, and then he says to Abraham, Abraham, send Lazarus to bring me some water. And the indication was that he still sees Lazarus, even in hell, as being someone who's there to serve him. Send Lazarus. I'm not even talking to Lazarus. As one who is beneath him, whose role it would be to do his bidding to serve him. So even in hell, in this parable, the rich man just doesn't get it. Still doesn't see it. What he couldn't see or wouldn't see in life, he still doesn't see it later. That Lazarus actually had dignity. And had identity. Did you know? he had a name. He didn't know. And did you know, rich man, that as much as Lazarus needed you in this life, for you at some point to just go, wait, I have some resources that could help him. As much as Lazarus needed you to do that in this life, what you never saw was that you needed Lazarus too. Because if you could have just seen him, stopped to notice him, and ministered to him instead of stepping over him on your way to the synagogue or on your way to church, what he would have done for you is to break the spell of your self-inflicted isolation that you thought was protecting you from people like that. Instead, what he was doing was blinding you to all of the creative and resourceful and energetic, exciting and shrewd ways that you could have used the resources of your life to build and to heal and to feed and to serve and to bless and to include and to partner with God in tikkun olam. Remember that phrase? To heal the world, which is the great mission of God. You could have put all your resources into play to partner with God in his mission in the world. But instead, verse 26, There is a great chasm fixed. Because the rich man in life said, I don't want to have to see or deal with the poor man who's sitting outside the gate. So God says, in effect, okay, I'll give you what you want. But let me show you where that's going. And that's the whole point of this parable. He's trying to tell people who are still alive where the trajectory of their life is going. Because one day it won't just be a gate. It will be a chasm. And now the chasm is fixed. And all of that is why the rich man in verse 27, and now we move into the rest of the parable, says this, because he actually is beginning to see, I think, because he says this, Then I beg you, Father Abraham, that you send him, again, Lazarus, because he's still a servant to him, to send him to my father's house, for I have five brothers, that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment. But Abraham said, No, they have Moses and the prophets. Just let him listen to them. And if they did, his five brothers listened to them and hear Moses and the prophets. If they actually listened to them, they would hear Moses and the prophets say things like this from the prophet Isaiah in Isaiah 58, verse 6, saying, this is the word of the Lord. This is what I ask of you, my people, that you loosen the bonds of wickedness, that you undo the bands of the yoke, that you let the oppressed go free, that you spend the resources of your life to divide your bread with the hungry, to bring the homeless poor into the house, that when you see the naked, cover them. Just cover them. For then, you want revival, you're praying for revival. Do what I just told you to do. Then your light will break out like the dawn, and your recovery will speedily spring forth, and your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard, And then you will call and the Lord will answer. You will cry and he will say, here I am to help you in doing what I've called you to do. If you would just remove the yoke from your midst and the pointing of the finger and the speaking wicked things. If you give yourself to the hungry, just give yourself to them and satisfy the desire of the afflicted. Then your light will rise in the darkness. Verse 11. Then the Lord will continually guide you, help you do this, and satisfy your desire in these places right now that are scorched in your spirit and give strength to your bones. And you will be like a watered garden, like a spring of water whose waters do not fail. And those from among you will rebuild the ancient ruins. You will raise up the angel foundations, and you will be called the repairers of the breach, the restorers of the streets in which to dwell, to which the rich man in the parable in verse 30 says, no, Abraham, that will never work. Look at that in verse 30. But if someone comes to them from the dead, someone maybe like Lazarus, again, then they would see and then they would repent, which Abraham says in verse 31, something kind of mean. I don't get this entirely because Abraham says, no, they wouldn't. Because if they didn't listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead. Now, I don't know about you, but when I first read that, there was something in me that wanted to cry out saying, yes, they would. Yes, they would. I would. and some of you would too and maybe you would because maybe many of you and I think many of you do have the kind of heart that just needed some information that's all you needed was to hear the word of the Lord someone who would read for you Moses and the prophets and tell you hey people of God we care this is what we care about all you needed was information the kind of information you might get from going to a church where they actually do open up the book. So you can hear Moses and the prophets saying in a variety of ways, things like this, I want my people to notice the Lazaruses among us. Saying over and over in a variety of ways, don't leave them at the gate. Let's not insulate ourselves or isolate ourselves from those kind of people like we religious people tend to do. In our misguided attempt to stay clean, let's quit building gates and walls to keep them out and figure out resourceful ways to bring them in. And for some, it's true. It's all you needed. To begin doing the word and the works of God was the information, the word from Moses and the prophets because as soon as you hear it, you do it. and if it's a resurrection you want if that's what would convince you you needed more than just a word but if someone rose from the dead well actually God has provided one of those to help convince you but it wasn't Lazarus that God sent he sent his son his name is Jesus. And this is what the resurrected one said and is saying to his people. And is saying to his church. And he is saying it over and over again in a variety of places in a variety of ways. One of the first places he said it was when his ministry began in Luke 4 verse 18. The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor, which includes everybody else, but he's anointed me to preach to the poor, to proclaim release to the captives, the recovery of sight to the blind, and to set free those who are downtrodden, and to proclaim the year of jubilee. And the year of jubilee simply means all has been forgiven. You can come home. But if you listen to the rest of his message, Jesus' message, what's behind that mission is him saying to his people, I don't expect to do this alone. In fact, part of why I'm here is to call you into this very mission. Lechakarai, come, follow me. And immediately some who heard him left their nets and began to follow his way of living and loving and being. But there is a kind of blindness, beloved, that can't be cured with more information, with all the law and the prophets and hearing it every Sunday or Saturday. Indeed, when I think of this, what occurs to me is the last thing that some church people need is more information. The last thing that some people need is to listen to another sermon. Because all some people do is critique them. They never do them. Do them. I'm hating this. Last thing some people need to go is to another small group Bible study. Indeed, for some, the transformational thing in their life would be to simply start acting on and doing what we already know, what we've already heard, what we say we believe. Because there is a kind of blindness that can't be cured with more information or even revelation like somebody coming back from the dead because it's a blindness rooted in the heart, a heart that needs to be broken so that it can be open, so that finally it can see. And so we pray, come Holy Spirit, break our hearts. I love that song, Hosanna. break our hearts with what breaks yours, that'd be great. So we can see. The Lazarus is among us. One final note and then we close. Lazarus, in metaphor here, is not across the ocean in Africa, though we are involved in ministries like that and it matters that we are. Lazarus is at the gate. If there would be an exercise to enter into this week out of this, it would be to ask God to help you see not someone far away. But God, who's at the gate? In the parable, it's someone that you see every day, but you don't see him. And you just step over him. And this stepping over him may not be a physical stepping over them. This is, you know what I'm saying. Who is he? Who is she for you? Would you stand with me as we close?
