Don't you love it when the choir leads us in worship? I just love that. I like it when we hide in behind the curtain like that too. You don't see all the messy leaving. Let's pray as we move to the ministry of the word. Father, I thank you for the power of your spirit at work in the context of worship. be active now in the ministry of the word. Again, by the power of your spirit, I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Two weeks ago, in what we've been referring to as a journey of the heart, using the life of David as found in 1 and 2 Samuel as a kind of guide for this journey, we discovered that one of the critically important gifts that David got for his particular journey of his heart was a friend. But not just any old, ordinary, garden-variety, nice-to-see-you fishing buddy friend. He had a covenant friend. David had an I'll-be-there-for-you-on-your-worst-day friend, what I would call a middle-of-the-night friend. His name was Jonathan. We met him in 1 Samuel 18, beginning in verse 1 with these words. it came about when he that is David had finished speaking to Saul who was the king the context here is that David has just killed Goliath that the soul of Jonathan who happened to be King Saul's son was knit to the soul of David and Jonathan loved him as himself and Saul took him that is David that day and did not let him return to his father's house no more tending of the sheep. Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself, and Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David with his armor, including his sword and his bow and his belt. By way of reminder, let me give you again a word about covenants so we understand what we're talking about, because we don't often use the context, the concept of covenant in the context of friendship. I think we use it and understand it most often in the context of marriage. Covenant is, first of all, mutual. I think that's obvious. It is based on promise, implied or otherwise. And while it doesn't need to be ceremonially acknowledged, it needs to be acknowledged some way. Maybe as informally as simply saying to this person who is becoming, that you're discerning is becoming a covenant friend to say out loud the words. You are becoming more than a friend to me. Part of establishing a covenant friendship, we indicated a couple of weeks ago, is simply recognizing that person, noticing who already is that kind of friend, and acknowledging it. A word about the robe and the armor and the sword, just by way of reminder and getting back into this. The robe that Jonathan gave away was his royal robe. This was not just an ordinary robe used to keep him warm, symbolizing, the giving of this robe was, symbolizing his right to rule, that is, Jonathan's, as the son of Saul and the heir to the throne. And in giving this robe to David, he is saying, among other things, this to David, I recognize you as the Lord's anointed. I recognize things in you that you may not even see yourself the Lord's anointing. And While we probably wouldn't do it the way Jonathan did with David, given those circumstances, the way I see us doing that to each other in the context of covenant friends is to be in those times when your friend is wondering about their anointings and their capacities to do ministry or do life. You're looking across that table and looking them in the eyes and saying things like this that are real. I see the Lord's anointing in you. I see the empowerments of God on you. I see God in you. I see capacities that you have that you don't even see you have. And when you do that, you're giving them your robe. In giving David his armor and his sword, he is saying that what I normally use to protect myself, I will now use to protect you as well. These implements of war used to defend myself, I am now putting them at your disposal to defend you. In the vernacular, the way we would say that today is this. I got your back. David had a friend who said, I got your back. A reminder about Saul. The Saul dynamic in this story is important. Saul, whose murderous, jealous, relentless, demonically driven hatred of David created a context for this relationship between Jonathan and David, making it an important relationship, more important than it would have been had there been no hostility from Saul. So we saw it as that which created a context. But we also saw Saul standing as a symbol for the unrelenting assault by the enemy of your soul and my soul, and that which is central to our lives, our hearts. Peter said it this way, and this is the symbolism I'm using Saul for. In 1 Peter 5.8, Peter said, Be of sober spirit, be on the alert, for you have a Saul. He may not be physically embodied in a person the way the physical Saul was, but you have a Saul who is as real as David's Saul. And just like Saul, your adversary the devil prowls about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. And just like Saul, this roaring lion who is the devil is murderously, jealously, relentlessly, insanely committed to pin you to the wall, as Saul did in 1 Samuel 18, 11, at least desired to do to David. He's insanely committed to take you out, to render you impotent, primarily by assaulting your heart. Because if he can attack your heart and take out your heart, you will lose your passion, you will lose your drive, you will lose your devotion, and you will be out of the game. the reason he attacks the heart does the enemy is because in the words of C.S. Lewis there really is a glory to your life that the enemy fears and is hell-bent on destroying so he attacks your heart all of which makes this issue of covenant friendship much more significant than a wouldn't it be nice proposition for in this context of a war going on for your heart and my heart, covenant friendships become a matter of life and death, become a matter of success or failure. John Eldridge, in the book that I've been recommending to you to kind of be reading as we go through this journey of the heart and study the life of David at the same time, the book entitled Wake the Dead speaks to this this way. He says this, In light of this great battle going on for your heart, You're going to need your friends. You must cling to those you have. You must search far and wide for those you do not have. You must not go it alone. For from the beginning, right there in Eden, the enemy's strategy has relied on this simple tactic, divide and conquer. Get them isolated and then take them out. End quote. All of that, however, raises a question that we began to address and unpack a little bit two weeks ago. The question is this. How do you find a friend like Jonathan? How are friendships like this formed? Well, the first thing we discovered a couple weeks ago was this, that covenant friendships like David and Jonathan enjoyed are often found and formed in the context of mission. Now, that's not the only place they're found and formed, but often this is the place where in the pursuit of common values, common purposes, common passions, you almost inadvertently, almost as if by accident, discover people of like mind and like heart. They are your friends. In other words, it's usually in the context of pursuing your passions, not when you're pursuing friends, that you begin to discover your friends. Excuse me. Which, by the way, changes the question and kind of puts this whole thing on its ear. changes the question from how do I go out and find me some friends, which is where I kind of want to spend all my energy, to a whole different place asking this question, what are my passions? What do I care about? What is my purpose? What am I pursuing? Because it's in the pursuit of those things that you feel passionate about, not in the pursuit of friends, that you will find your friends. So what are your passions? What do you care about? Anything? Or have you lost heart? That's this journey of the heart for some of you to get back your heart so you can find your passion. So here's the question. What are you involved in? What are you pursuing that's bigger than you that just might require a Jonathan? Now, I don't know how all of you hear that, but I'm quite sure that some of you might hear that and think, well, I don't really know what that is, this passion, this pursuit that's bigger than me, because you may assume that this pursuit, this passion, needs to be some big, grand, win-the-world kind of purpose in order to count, and here I am sitting here, and all I really care about is my kids. Well, then that's your passion. And in your pursuit of fighting for your kids and figuring out how to be a better parent than you are, feeling like you're not a very good parent, you might just find some other parents, and there you find your friends who are fighting the same battle, who are in the same mission. Some of you are fighting for your marriage. And as you find other couples who are fighting for their marriage, you begin to find your friends. Some of you are fighting to stay sober. Some of you are fighting to break addictions in your life that have held you in bondage for years and years and years. and as you put your heart and your effort to the task of breaking those things and being free from those things, in the very pursuit of those things, you begin to find some other men and women who are pursuing those things and you just found your friends. Some of you are passionate about a ministry endeavor of some kind, be it a prayer ministry or youth kids, community outreach, feeding the poor. In the pursuit of those things. See, regardless of what the passion is, it's as you identify and pursue your passions not your friends that you begin to find your friends I can tell you as I just reflect on this for myself without hesitation that for me the closest friends I have ever had the closest friends I presently have are those who have partnered with me in the context of some mission some common purpose but I never found them when I was looking for a friend but notice now please this that sometimes the mission the grand mission that has helped me find some friends is simply to do life not to win the world for God but simply to do life here's why because life is hard life is really hard how many of you know that and if you would like to really live it if you would like to stay fully engaged in it and not do what many of us have done bailed out of it settled for simply going through the motions if you really want to live the life that God has called you to even the kingdom life that God has called to stay fully engaged in that life be authentically living alive to God and other people you might need a friend to live that kind of life. Paul to Timothy in 1 Timothy 4.16 says this, pay close attention to yourself. In other words, pay close attention to your life and to your teaching. Persevere in these things. Work hard about these things. Build things into your life to protect these things. for as you do, you ensure salvation for yourself and for your hearers. You know what a covenant friend is? A covenant friend is someone who helps you pay close attention to your life. I can tell you this about covenant friends. There's a part of covenant friendship that's fun. I mean, that's how you kind of identify. There's this person I have fun with. It's about love. Covenant friendships love you and they support you. Let me tell you something else about covenant friendships, if you've got one, as I reflect on the ones I've had and the ones I have, there are people who also confront you and they tell you the truth and they disagree with you when they disagree with you. You know what they do? They help you pay close attention to your life so that you can stay fully engaged in life so that you can run this race and finish this course because it's not an easy thing to do. Richard Rohr in a book that I've been reading recently entitled The Wild Man's Journey says this about this. Five things you need to understand and accept about life if you hope to survive it, to stay fully engaged in it. And by the way, these five things all kind of fly in the face of modern therapy and self-help stuff and self-esteem stuff. He says this. Here's the first thing you need to understand. Life is hard. Goes on to say this. Know this ahead of time, he says. Do not waste your life trying to make it easy for yourself, as most people do. We must be signed with the cross ahead of time. Say that again. We must be signed with the cross ahead of time, or we will spend all our lives trying to avoid the cross, trying to avoid pain. First thing you need to want to accept about life, if you're going to stay engaged in life, in real life, is this. Life is hard. Number two, you're going to die. Number three, you're not that important. Number four, you're not in control. Indeed, he says, if you want to enter into life and be engaged in life, into real life, not into just some fantasy world, you must be led into the limits of your own resources. I don't like that. You must be, at some point, led into the limits of your own resources and ability to control outcomes and people. How many of you think, how many of you are spending all your energy because you still believe that you can control the outcome, that you can control people? Some of you are. We don't like being around you, by the way. I'm not kidding. You want to move into the hero's journey, the journey of life that will keep you engaged in life. You must be led to the limits of your own resources and ability to control outcomes in people, thereby learning to rely on God. it is not a world of unlimited progress as some of you have been told but in fact a limited world god is in control not you life is hard you're gonna die you're not that important you're not in control fifth your life is not about you you are a fragment of something and someone much bigger than yourself sounds like bad news if you really let that in it's very liberating part of a much bigger story. What's my place? I'm going to play my place. I'm going to play my position. And recognize that something much bigger than me is going on. Much bigger than you and much bigger than us. Now, here's the deal about that. If that's true, that life is hard, you're going to die, you're not that important, you're not in control, and your life is not about you. To figure that out, if that's true, then to figure that out, To walk that out, to take that kind of journey into that kind of reality life, you might need a friend. All of a sudden, the stakes go up. When I really want to do real life and not pretend and just slap a happy, stupid face on my face, whatever that was, I'm going to need a friend. I'm going to need a friend. Here's the other deal, however, about that. It's in the context of authentically entering into that kind of journey that you will find your friends because they're on the same journey. And the friends you will find will be the ones who are on that journey and the ones who are playing a game and not getting down to what reality of life is. You'll be very polite and very nice, and we're going to be Christians, so we're going to love each other, but I ain't doing my life with you. leads to the second thing you need to know about covenant relationships it's that you don't so much pick these people as you notice them I got an email this last week from a woman in our church named Jean described a covenant friendship that was kindled in the context of a shared journey to recover her heart because she had a broken heart having had it torn apart by an awful divorce. She says this about her covenant friendship. We shared the most difficult days of our lives together. We would cover each other's back when one of us would call the other and the first thing we would say is help. My friend is raising three teenagers by herself. I'm raising four small children by myself. I can't describe what a gift she's been to me for the journey. But it wasn't until last weekend, she says, on a retreat at my friend's church, that we both noticed and acknowledged. Here's the key. They just noticed it. They'd been living this way for a long time. On the retreat, we noticed and acknowledged that this was the kind of relationship we had, so we said it out loud. This is covenant. You are my Jonathan, and I am your David, and I am your Jonathan, and you are my David. But the point is this. You don't so much pick these friends as you notice them, often in the context of a shared journey. so pay attention. Want to know who your covenant friends are? Pay attention. Just look around at what may already be around you now. But that issue of shared journey also leads to the next thing you need to know about covenant relationships. It's this, that sometimes they change. Because sometimes the journey changes. Early in my ministry life here at Open Door I had what I would call a covenant friend. in many ways this friend of mine and I could not have been different. We looked different, we acted different, we came from entirely different backgrounds on the face of things that would have never put us together as friends. But we found each other in the context of a shared vision, we found each other in the context of a shared passion for the gospel and for the ministry and we found ourselves out of that on a similar journey. Ten some years ago, this covenant friend of mine began to walk a different path, began to move a different direction. And the different direction wasn't real noticeable at first. It was just a couple steps this way. But he began to take a different journey. And the journey he began to take eventually led him to leave his wife and his children and his ministry. I loved him. I still love him. He called me a few weeks ago, just out of the blue, because the Cubs were beating Atlanta and were about to go to the National League Championship Series. It was great to talk to him. I loved hearing his voice. But what dawned on me when the conversation was over was this, that what we have in common now is the Cubs. And that's not enough. That's not much. Is he my friend? you bet he is do I love him? you bet I do is he covenant? no we're on a different journey we're on a different path you need to notice that too one of the things that in the first service occurred to me at this point and it's not in my notes is I think of this thing of journey and similar journey and I'm talking in a way that assumes a holiness to these covenants I think there are holy covenants that in journey call out of us and call out of each other the best. And they call us back and they call us out and they call us up to the things that matter most. But some of us are in unholy covenants. Some of us are in, there are relationships where you're walking down and you're doing a journey and because you're so needy of this person, you disagree when you don't agree. And in a covenant, in an unholy covenant, you're being led straight to hell. And I don't even mean you're going to hell. I don't mean eternal hell. I mean hell right here, right now. And some of these need to be broken. Leads to the next thing that we need to understand and accept about covenant relationships. It's this, they can't be forced. You can't just order these kinds of relationships that David and Jonathan had. You can't just order them up. There is no Friendships R Us department store with a drive-thru window where you can go and place your order. I'll take a covenant friend, please. I'll take a covenant friend, please, and supersize him, would you? I'm really needy. You know it doesn't happen like that. Six years ago, I had a covenant friend who died. Those of you who know me know that I was very close to a guy named Dave Busby, and six years ago, he died. I still carry Dave with me in a variety of ways. I honestly, I mean, I thought about this when I was writing this out earlier in the week. I really don't think there's a day that goes by. I don't think about him. I preach out of his Bible. This was his Bible. He gave it to me. I wear his socks sometimes. They're very worn and smelly. Every once in a while, I'll preach a sermon that reminds me of him. There's just something about this sermon that has a spirit that reminds me of Dave. This is stupid, but I wear the cologne that he used to wear. I think about him all the time. At his funeral six years ago, his dad, bless his heart, trying to comfort me, said this to me, Dave, you just got to go out and find yourself another friend. First thing I did when he said that was, forgive him. You know, you just got to put that on the list of stupid things people say at funerals. I mean, there's a very long list, too. Just add that one. And in my mind, I was going through my mind, I'm going, bless your heart. You know, I know you know that we were close, and I felt like what he was trying to do was give me permission to find another friend, and I wasn't being disloyal to Dave. But the thing that actually went through my mind was this. You're telling me not to go out and find another friend. How do you do that? Is there like a special at Kmart this week? Point is this. If you've ever had a covenant friend, if you're looking for a covenant friend, one of the things you instinctively know is you can't just order this up. It can't be forced. There really is some mystery to this. Where for reasons that we don't understand, when they work, it's at least at one level, this is not the whole picture of covenant relationships, but at one level, there's just this place where you click, where you connect. There's a kind of chemistry that's very similar to that of a romance, but it's a lot less complicated than a romance because you don't have all that sexual stuff turning everybody's brain to mush. It's less complicated. And if you're guy friends, it's even less complicated than that because guys, we don't have to talk. I mean, all we got to get guys, right. I mean, all we got to do is make disgusting noises with various parts of our body, and we're friends for life. It's chemical. True, right? Am I right about this? one person likened this process especially this just click this chemistry piece of covenant friendships and the fact that you can't force it likened it to falling asleep now this is kind of a weird analogy but I think it works you can't force sleep you ever try to make yourself go to sleep good luck I'm going to sleep you can't force it but there are some things that you can do to enhance the possibility you know real brilliant things like laying down helps closing your eyes turn off the light helps now how many of you know that doesn't guarantee you're going to sleep you lay down I mean a lot of times you don't sleep there's this weird thing there are things you can do to enhance the possibility of going to sleep, but there's this weird way in which when sleep comes, it comes as gift. You can't force this friendship thing, but there are some things that you can do to enhance the possibility. Take a bath helps. Brush your teeth. I learned this the hard way. Years ago, years ago, I was on the altar team. I was praying for somebody, and we went through the season where people started going down, and I thought I got the power. Found out later, brush your teeth. You're praying for these people. They're funny. Anyway, it's not always God. Anyway, seriously, seriously, there are some things you can do to enhance the possibility. Some of you, and this is a word, please just need to tell you this. Some of you need to break out of your self-imposed isolation that makes you feel safe because maybe at some other time in your life you got hurt by a covenant relationship. By the way, if you got hurt by a covenant relationship, if you were betrayed in some way by a covenant relationship, welcome to the human race. Jesus was betrayed too. I mean, this is part of the painful package that's called reality. Life is hard. But some of you, to make it even possible, have to break out of that self-imposed isolation. Join an affinity group. I don't think affinity groups are about intimacy. You don't get intimacy there, but you may find a friend there. And then the intimacy comes. Join a small group. Get into a Bible study. Get involved in a ministry, and you may find a friend. But I'm going to tell you something. Even though you expose yourself to those, and that's kind of the equivalent of turning off the light and lying down. When a friendship comes, if it comes, it comes as a gift. It can't be forced. Next thing, it can't be rushed. True covenant friendships usually take time. Again, this is something instinctively we know as I think about mine, as you think about yours. It took time to develop that trust. It took time to develop a place where I really trust that this person is my friend, that they really do have my back. While the chemistry connection is often a real significant part of these covenant relationships, and the chemistry thing often happens very quickly, the covenant connection is developed over time. There is an ease that people have who have been together for 10 years. You ever see anybody like that? Sometimes, by the way, this is experience, and I had somebody come up to me out tonight and go, can this happen in a marriage as if that didn't count? I hope it does. I hope it happens in a marriage. It doesn't always happen in a marriage. But if you've ever seen anybody or been with somebody for 10 years, there's an ease, 15, 20 years, there's an ease that comes to those relationships that, and the ease that they experience, and the exchange that they know, and the dialogue that they share and the capacity they have to enter into each other's lives, sometimes with hard words, those things do not come quick. Some of you are looking for covenant friends. That's a good pursuit. It's going to take time. They did, but by definition, they can't be rushed. So here's some advice. Go slow. Don't push. Don't demand. It can only come as a gift. Date before you marry. Start with small relational risks. If you're in a small group, here's some advice. Before you do your Bible study, before you do your book study, whatever the curriculum is that you want to use, before you do any of that, just put all that away. and tell your stories. Just go around the room, tell your stories. What's your story? After a while, take a chance. Take a risk. Any covenant relationship is going to involve risk. Disclose an area of struggle. Don't start with the most intimate. Don't start with the biggest. Just start with something. Test the waters. This isn't phony. This is wise. And as you share an area of struggle, see how they respond. Do they listen? Do they correct? Do they sympathize? Do they try to fix you? If they try to fix you, if they try to correct you, that's a real good sign. You need to find another group really fast. Learn to listen. Be slow to speak. You ever been in a group, a small group where one person just dominates? On the way home, you're even talking about, Boy, I just, boy, I can't, nobody else can get a word in edgewise. The whole group is kind of dominated by this one person. Well, let me, if you're the person who dominates your small group, let me just tell you something that nobody in your group will tell you. Be quiet! There you go, there you go. There's my little gift to you this morning. You want to enter into covenant relationship, know yourself. Know yourself. Notice how you affect people. And wonder why you affect them that way. I've been in conversations with people who go off on their spouse. Sometimes it's women going off on their husbands. It's husbands going off on their wives. And it's kind of like this. They do this. They do that. They're such a slob. They're so lazy. And I just don't know what to do. And the implication is that I'm supposed to fix them. I've heard these things quite often over the years. I remember one in particular where this man was going off on his wife, and his wife was standing right there talking to me, telling me all those things that were wrong with his wife that irritated him about his wife. And it was all, by the way, coming under the context of just being real. When he was done, I asked him, how long have you been married? He said, 10 years. I said, really? Well, this person you're complaining about must be a saint because I've been with you five minutes, and I want to run for my life. everybody wants a friend everybody wants a friend notice how you affect people and wonder why that's some hard work that's some hard work that's about the journey that's about the journey i think we tend to complicate community and relationship sometimes as a church and churches in general, we have this idea that we can program for it. I think we certainly need to provide opportunities where people can connect, but we can't get friends for you. And sometimes people have the expectation that the church's responsibilities to get me friends. We need to create connections and possibilities. I have no idea how to do that. We complicate it. I think covenant relationships at one level are very, very difficult because there's risk, it takes time, there's a chemistry you can't control. On another level, covenant relationships are incredibly simple. There's something very organic about them. That's why one of the things I tell you about covenant relationships is that you simply need to step back and notice who's already there. There are people in this room right now who know my story, and I know theirs. There are people in this room right now who know my wound and my wounds, and I know theirs. there are people in this room who know the tactics that the enemy most often uses on me that you don't know there are people in this room right now who know the lies that i am most likely to believe who say to me from time to time not every day in fact we don't even see each other every day by the way that's another thing about covenant relationship you know jonathan and david this was not about we're together every day some of you are if you're in a cup but jonathan and David, after this thing that introduces us to their relationship, if you read the rest of the story, they were separated by war, they were separated by circumstances. Jonathan ultimately dies. But they are the people who, knowing your wound and knowing the lies that you're susceptible to, they are the people who say to me and I say to them, here's my robe, here's my armor, here's my stuff. You know who those people are? They're my friends. They came as gift, and it took time. Next thing you need to know about covenant relationships is this, there will be few. While you may have a lot of friends, and you may have a lot of really good friends, covenant friends will be few. In fact, this will even, I think, help you identify who your covenant friends are, because there aren't going to be many of these. Talked about this a couple weeks ago, but Jesus dealt with the multitudes and in a very real way he loved them. He loved the multitudes. He cared for them. He ministered to them. He healed them. But he never even met most of them. After the multitudes there were twelve and in a very real way he loved the twelve. After the twelve there were three. Peter, James, and John. The Gospels make it real clear that there was a different kind of relationship we had with the three than the twelve. And after the three there was one. John. who's described in the Gospels as the disciple that Jesus loved. That does not mean he didn't love the three, and it doesn't mean he didn't love the twelve, and it doesn't mean he didn't love the multitudes, but there was a different kind of relationship with John. There aren't many in this company of covenant. I want you to just think about this with me for a minute. How many covenant relationships do you think you can have? Like at one time, you think you can have 20? how many of you have 20 intimate soul connecting deeply disclosing heart bonding spiritual friendships how many of you have 20 like that how many of you have one i've had seasons we all do where i've had none i don't like those seasons i've learned some things about those seasons one i think if you recognize that you're in a season without a covenant friend, it's very appropriate, even important to ask God, Lord, Lord, I don't want to do this journey by myself. I need this kind of friend. Help me see who they are. Help me pursue who they need to be. I need some help. Another thing you might need to see about these seasons, this is one of the things I've learned about in my journey. Some of those seasons where I've been alone, God needed in that alone time to do some deep things inside of me, to even be part of preparing me for the possibility of a covenant friendship later. God needed to do some things in me to make me the kind of friend who could be a friend. Another thing, just part of my journey, and I don't want to impose mine on yours as if they're the same because they're probably not, but I have experienced some loss in covenant friendships. I'm going to assume you have too. One of my covenant friends died. Another one took a different path. There have been times when I've been betrayed, so have you. And one of the things that I've just kind of noticed at my age, at the 50 place, about the covenant friends I have now, that early in my life, there was, I enjoyed that chemistry thing. Some of the best friends were like these guys, when we were 12, we were best buddies, and we still are, and there's just this, just ease. It was ease. It wasn't any work. And then there comes some loss, and the covenant friendships I have now have more to do with choices you've made. Say, you know, I am choosing to trust this person. It's not coming as easy as the other one. I don't think you can devote the kind of time and emotional presence that could realistically sustain more than three or four of these kinds of covenantal relationships at one time. I think it's odd, you know, I'm in church, I'm a pastor of a church, but I sometimes think that some of us in church perpetuate or do things that mitigate against the possibility of a covenant friendship. We can evolve with so many people, but we don't know any people. I have in my mind kind of a party person. You know, this person who's always going to a party, and they'll identify them. I'm just a people person, and I bless that. That's great. You're a people person, and you love being around people, and you like going to the crowd and being around the crowd, and it's great. But the problem is that sometimes that party person, who's always wanting to be at the party, doesn't know one person. No, I know everybody. I like it, but you don't know anybody. The group, the big group, the party is safe. Safe would be the operative word for the next thing you need to know about covenant relationships. They're risky. I thought you were going to say they're safe. No, they're not safe. They're risky. And they're messy. John Eldridge, again, says it this way. Having an intimate ally is disruptive. going to church with hundreds of other people to sit and hear a sermon like we are right now doesn't ask much of you it certainly will never expose you that's why folks prefer it but relationships especially intimate ones will reveal where you have yet to become holy and they will reveal it right at the moment you are so keenly aware of how they have yet to become holy don't you hate that it will bring you close and you will be seen and you will be known and therein lies the power the value and therein lies the risk Eugene Peterson in his book leap over a wall says it this way it's like a pack of porcupines on a cold night you're drawn together for the warmth you're driven apart by the prickly spines you've never experienced that have you? don't get too close don't get too real all of which leads to the last thing you need to understand about covenant friendships it's this that somewhere along the line you have to choose somewhere along the line you have to decide am i willing to take the risk am i willing to be that real that vulnerable am i also willing to be that honest or is my relationship with this person just going to be blowing smoke in their face? Oh, you're just the best. No, wait, wait, wait. You know what? I need to call you to something else. I need to call you something higher. You're going the wrong direction. See, after the chemistry, which is wonderful, and after the affinity and after the common journey is discovered and the shared vision is affirmed, after you have all of that, it is still possible to hide your heart. Right in the middle of the shared journey and the chemistry and all the good feelings, you can still hide your heart. Some of you hide your heart from your spouse. Some of you hide your heart from the people you're on journey with. So somewhere you have to choose. And I promise you it will be risk. I promise you that it might hurt. I promise you also that you will be changed and you will not be alone. Jonathan was a great warrior. He would have been a great king. But in the end, amazing thing about Jonathan, more than wanting to be called a king, he wanted to be called a friend. So he decided. Jonathan made a decision and in the decision he said to David this, here's my robe, here's my armor, here's my sword, I got your back. Let's pray as we close. Father, I pray that as we ponder this stop, as it were, on this journey of the hearts we are on as a congregation, that you would expose what needs to be exposed, that you would call out what needs to be called out, that you would help us notice what needs to be noticed, maybe about who our covenant friends are, maybe about the place we are in terms of the journey, in terms of maybe being alone right now and what that means. God, just do your work in us relative to this. I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
