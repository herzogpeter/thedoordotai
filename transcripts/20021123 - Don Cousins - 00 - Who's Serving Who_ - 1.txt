Well, one of the passages of scripture that has profoundly impacted my life over the last several years, in fact it changed the nature of the way in which I, part of which I do my devotional life, is Mark chapter 6. And normally I give a whole blown message on this, but I won't do that to you this morning, but I'll give you the quick summary and maybe you can take something away from this. In Mark chapter 6 we see the story, starting in verse 33, of Jesus feeding the 5,000. okay so I'm assuming all of you have been around the church long enough to where you have some idea what the feeding of the 5,000 was which was in reality more like the feeding of the 15,000 because they didn't count in terms of numerical count they didn't count the women and the children and so the count of 5,000 is strictly the men so probably talking more like 12,000 to 15,000 people and so Jesus tells his disciples to go and give them something to eat and they said, how are we going to go and spend 200 denarii? Basically six months wages is what it would take us to give all of them something to eat. And they said, let's just send them away to get something. And they said, well, there's no place to go. And Jesus says to them, how many loaves do you have? Go and look. And when they found out, they said five loaves and two fish. And so he commanded them, all the people, to sit on the grass in companies of 50, hundreds and 50s. And he took the five loaves and two fish, looked up toward heaven, blessed it, broke it, gave it to them. and divided up the two fish among them, and they all ate and were satisfied. And when they were all done, they picked up 12 full baskets of the broken pieces. Okay? 12 full baskets. So that each disciple had a goodie bag. All right? Which is a very significant thing. It wasn't 11. It wasn't 13. It was 12 baskets. So that every disciple had a goodie bag. Here's why that's important. Because in the very next verse, okay, that ends. And if you have a Bible that has any kind of reference notes in it, you probably have a break at that point, and then there's a new heading for the next section. That's a mistake. Because, you see, what happens next is a direct tie-in to what had just happened. For you see, in verse 45 it says, And immediately he made his disciples go and get into a boat and go to the other side. So how soon is immediately? an hour later a day later immediately is now immediately immediately after this incident's over he immediately puts them in a boat and they go to the other side and he says I'll meet you later and so he bids them farewell he departs to the mountain to pray and then in the middle of the night he sees them straining at the oars for the wind was against them at about the fourth watch of the night alright so it was about 3 o'clock in the morning and they're rowing ok across the sea of Galilee which is no small thing and so he sees them out and they're straining at the oars because the wind and the waves are against them so if you've ever been out in a rowboat on a lake where the wind is blowing against you and the waves are you have some idea and it's 3 o'clock in the morning so what condition are you in physically after the kind of day that they've been through alright so they're straining alright Now, it says in verse 48 that seeing them standing at the oars fourth watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea and he intended to pass by them. Alright, so he looks out, he sees them and he says, you know what? I'm not going to just yell at him until he came into the store because that's just going to add to their trip. So I'll tell you what, I'll just walk out and meet them. But when they saw him walking on the sea they supposed that it was a ghost. They look out, they see him. And they conclude, it's a ghost. Now, you've got to understand that in those days, people believed that demonic spirits lived in the sea. Okay? This is what they've been raised to believe. And again, they were fishermen, so they were comfortable out there, but that was what they believed. And so, literally, they look out and they say, they suppose that it's a ghost. Okay? Now, it says, For they all, they cried out, for they all saw him and were frightened. But immediately he spoke with them and said, Take courage, it is I, do not be afraid. So they look out, they say, gee, looks like Jesus. Can't be Jesus. Real men don't walk on water. It must be a ghost. And they cry out and they're frightened. That's their reaction. Well, then he gets in the boat with them. The wind stops and they are greatly astonished. Okay, now, you look at their reaction. First of all, they conclude it's a ghost, rather than saying, oh, there's Jesus just walking on the water again. They conclude it's a ghost. And they're frightened. He gets in the boat, and as a result of his presence in the boat, he calms the wind and the waves, and all of a sudden they're frightened. Now you say, why was their response what it was? After all, they had just left an event where they had watched him take five loaves of bread and two fish and multiply it so as to feed 15,000 people. Because they get in the boat after that event, when? Immediately. Well, the very last verse in that section, verse 52, tells us why, what was the problem. It says, For they had not gained any insight from the incident of the loaves, but their heart was hardened. They had not gained any insight from the incident of the loaves, but their heart was hardened. In other words, they had not taken any time to consider what Jesus had done in feeding the 15,000. And as a result, they lost sight of who he was and the kinds of things he was able to do. Therefore, when they came into a personal situation of crisis, instead of their hearts being filled with faith, their hearts were filled with fear. Now, imagine had they gotten in the boat, and as they were rowing said, hey, let's take a few minutes to talk about what just happened. And they had, you know, considered the incident of the loaves. Okay, we had five loaves of bread, and we had two fish. We had all these people, 12,000 to 15,000 people, it's like filling up a basketball arena. Jesus blesses it, and all of a sudden as we're handing it out, it's multiplying to the point where when everybody's done, everybody was ate and was satisfied, and each of us went away with a goodie bag as a reminder to us of what he just did. Now, if they had stopped to talk that through, they would have concluded that Jesus is not just any normal man. He has power over nature. He multiplies things. He controls natural forces. And when we're in his presence, he is able to take care of us and to satisfy us and to meet our needs and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Now, had they done that, then perhaps their response in the middle of the night would have been very different because then at that point, they would have seen him walking on the water and said, Oh, there's Jesus. Jesus, you silly guy, get in the boat. And then they would have probably said to him, Hey, you know, Jesus, we're tired. It's 3 o'clock in the morning. We're trying to go against the wind and the waves. Can you just like, maybe you could take the wind and maybe reverse it and send us the other way? Because, you know, Jesus, we know that you have power over natural forces. But you see, they didn't think that way. They didn't see it that way. They didn't see Jesus that way because they had not taken any time to consider the incidence of the loaves. and you say well what impact does that have on your personal life well friends all of us have times in life when we see the goodness of God poured out to us in such a way that we say in effect to ourselves I will never ever doubt again the goodness of God in my life until the next storm arises and then the storm comes and we find ourselves straining against the oars of life and we're filled with fear. And we say things like, God, where are you? Why aren't you intervening? Why aren't you stepping in? Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. My faith is weak and my fear factor is very high. Well, what I learned to do as a result of this passage starting in August of 1998, I believe it was, was I began to keep a section of my prayer journal in which I simply entitled The Goodness of God. And every couple days, Once a week. Sometimes I'll go for two weeks. And I will sit down and I will take time to record. Where have I seen the evidence of God's goodness in my life? And I'll record it. Why is that significant? It's significant because there are times in life when I find myself in the midst of a storm. Wondering whether or not God is good. And I find my heart, my faith weakening. I find my heart hardening. and I find myself filled with doubt and unbelief. And in those moments of time, you know where I go now? I go back to that section of my journal, and I start reading the pages of God's goodness to me. And as I read of God's goodness to me and God's provision to me, what do you think happens to my heart and my faith? My heart is soft and my faith grows. You see, if I asked you today, how was God good to you in August of 1998? Unless something cataclysmic happened in August of 1998, like you were healed of cancer, my guess would be not one of you can tell me how God was good to you in August of 1998, and yet, you know what? God was good to you in August of 1998. But I could tell you, I can't tell you standing up here, but I could take you to my journal, and I could read it to you, and I could tell you how God was good to me in November of 1998, and in December of 1998, and in January of 1999, and in March of 1999, and in July of 1999, and in July of 2000. And you know what? I could take you to my journal this morning, and I could tell you what I recorded just with regard to the last week and where I've seen the evidence of God. And I filled up a page. And by the time I'm done with that, I find myself overwhelmed with thanksgiving. Father, we proclaim your goodness this morning. We proclaim your faithfulness this morning. And God, whether we're on the mountaintops because the circumstances of life are good or whether we're walking in the valley of the shadow of death this morning, Father, we know that you are good and you are faithful. Your mercies are new every morning. This is a day that you have made and we rejoice and we're glad in it. And Father, we give you this day. We ask that your Holy Spirit would be poured out on us with a fresh anointing and that, Father, the attitudes we express, the words we speak, the actions that we live out, that, Father, they would be a reflection of your presence in our lives, that we would live this day to your glory and your honor. We give you this morning. Bring your word alive to us. Reveal truth to us that just increases the level of freedom that we know in you. We give you this morning. In Jesus' name, amen. Well, I want to talk to you this morning, all morning, about what it means to be engaged in the work of the kingdom. And the common ground that all of us have here, right, is we're all engaged in the work of the kingdom. Right? That's why you're here. Because you're engaged in the work of the kingdom. And I don't want to spend really any time at all. I've put up on the top of your notes just three simple verses which proclaim or speak to the fact that we are called to be involved in the work of the kingdom. In Luke chapter 10, verses 1 and 2, Jesus says to his disciples, Not only am I going to send you out into the harvest, but I want you to pray that the Lord of the harvest will send up more workers for the harvest because the harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. So we need to be not only engaged in the work of the harvest ourselves, but we need to be praying that the Father will raise up more people for the work. John 9, 4, Jesus says, Night is coming when no man can work, and so I'm working now. The end is coming, but now is the time of labor. 1 Corinthians 15, 58, Paul says, Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. I love the adjectives or adverbs, whichever they are. I'm not an English major. In that verse, listen to him again. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. So, friends, we're called to be engaged in the work of the kingdom. And I have spent the better part of the last, oh, you know, 30 years of my life engaged in the work of the kingdom. For me, it really began, and I'll give you some brief background. I grew up in a neighborhood Bible teaching church, you know, a small facility located on about two or three acres of property in the middle of a residential subdivision. Came to know the Lord as a young boy, was raised in a Christian home. And the church was not large enough to have a full-time youth pastor. So when I entered high school, we had youth sponsors. You know what a youth sponsor is? That's like a married couple who signs on for a year. The kids kill them, and then they get another one the following year. Got the idea? So we had a youth sponsor freshman year. And in the sophomore year, we had a youth sponsor. And about midway through my sophomore year, the church hired a guy by the name of Dave Hombo to come to the church. And he was really a music guy. And he was going to spend 50% of his time with the adult music ministry and then 50% of the time with the youth. Well, because music was his deal, Dave organized the 30 of us into a music ministry, into a music group. And because there was no contemporary Christian music in those days, this was the early 70s, there was no Amy Grant, no Michael W. Smith, all of these people, all these music companies now that are putting out contemporary choruses. We didn't have those. And so what Dave would do, because he knew that the old hymns weren't turning our cranks as much as they were our parents, what he would do is take secular songs and he would change the lyrics to make it Jesus music. And then because we had some talent in the group, kids who could play instruments and things, we began to sing, and we were pretty good. And so other churches began to invite us to come and sing at their evening services. And Dave was an artist, and so he began to have us put together some skips, little dramas. And again, that was an unknown thing. The church, you know, didn't do that sort of thing. And then we even had a couple guys who liked media, and so they began to put some slide shows together. You know, we've come a long way since then. But, you know, we began to put a whole kind of a concert together, and we would go and do evening services. Well, it became very clear to Dave that we needed to have someone teaching us the Bible, and that wasn't really his deal. And so he called a friend of his that he had grown up with, spent his summers at Camp with, Camp Iwana, and that friend was Bill Hybels. And Bill was a student at the time at Dork College out in the middle of Iowa. That's not Dork College. That's Dork College. Okay? Good Christian reform school. And Bill at that time had a restlessness because he was sensing the Lord might be calling him to life in the ministry as a career, which for him would mean a departure from a family business that he had been, you know, headed toward someday running. And so Bill literally dropped out of college, packed the balls, belongings in his car, drove to the Chicago area. and got a job running the shipping department at Iwana Youth Association and began to give Bible studies as a volunteer in our youth group. And he would stand up on a Wednesday night. We would have music practice for an hour. And then after that, we'd take a little break, come back in this room. He would open the Bible. He would speak for 15 or 20 minutes on a passage, kind of like I did this morning. We'd break down into small groups. We would discuss it, pray for one another, and that was our evening. And God began to move, and we began to invite our friends. And eventually, you know, more and more were coming until eventually Dave and Bill both came to us as leaders and said, you know, it's obviously you'd like to bring your friends. We want to change the nature of this evening because having a music practice followed by a Bible study, small goose praying, is probably not the most conducive way for you to bring your friends. And it wasn't because I bring my friends and I tell them for the first hour, we're going to have music practice. You know, you can go play basketball in the gym or you can go down the street and, you know, get a slopey at 7-Eleven. And it really wasn't seeker friendly. In fact, it was Seeker Hostel is what it really was. So we changed the evening. Well, to make a long story short, over the next three to three and a half years, that youth ministry grew to 1,200 kids a week. And we filled the sanctuary, which held 600 when it was jammed. We had 600 kids on Wednesday night and another 600 kids on Thursday night. And the kids used to literally be so packed in there, they'd be sitting in the window wells, the window openings up on the frames. would be so packed out with kids. And we had at the time about 150 or so kids coming from an area called Palatine, which was a community about a half hour away. It was really out on the edge of where the growth around Chicago was going. It was largely a farming community. And residential subdivisions were just beginning to blossom. They put in a mall out there called Woodfield Mall, which at that time we wondered, you know, this is never going to make it. There's no people out here. And today, Woodfield Mall is probably one of the busiest malls in America. It's not the mall of America, but it's one of the busiest malls in America. And we had one particular young man I'll tell you more about later named Mike Bourbon who kept telling us God's going to do something great in Palatine one day. God's going to do something great in Palatine. And sure enough, in the fall of 1975, that group of about 100, 150 high school students, now young college-age students, went out and started Willow Creek Community Church. And then over the next, in my case, 17 years there, the church grew to about 15,000 people attending the weekly services. And my involvement over the years through the days of youth ministry and then specifically with the church over the years had a lot to do with the staff and the development of the ministries of the church and things like that. And so I have spent a tremendous amount of time and energy thinking about, praying about, discussing, teaching, working at, etc., all of what is involved in getting God's people involved in the work of his kingdom. And friends, I can tell you, through the journey over these years, I have come to recognize that I had operated for many years based on many misconceptions and distortions of the truth that led me to a place in the fall of 1992 where I was literally just burned out. just fried. And emotionally, mentally, physically, spiritually exhausted from the journey. And it caused me to do a lot more reflecting over the last 10 years related to, you know, why does God call us to participate in his work? And what is it all about? It certainly isn't about leading people to burnout. And so the fact that I got there indicates that something was broken. What's broken? So what I want to do this morning is I want to unpack for you some of the things that I think God has taught me, revealed to me, and perhaps they'll make a difference in the way you think about your work in his kingdom. Okay? First of all, three misconceptions and deceptions. They're very important to expose these, because any time you embrace deceit or distortion, okay, that leads to bondage. Because the opposite we know to be true, and that is that the truth will always set you free. so the truth sets you free but deceit, distortion, misconceptions of the truth leads to bondage alright misconception number one God calls us to his work because he needs our help now although and I can see some of you reacted to that the minute I say it and you say well how ridiculous the fact of the matter is many of us have subtly bought into a concept that the reason in which we participate why we do it is because God needs our help and if God doesn't need our help then certainly the church needs our help because by my goodness how many times have we heard pleas from the church and from leaders of the church that you know if we don't step forward and do something it's not going to get done and what we subtly conclude is you know we got these unsaved friends all around us and if we don't go down the street and witness to them they're going to go to hell as if their salvation in some ways is dependent upon what you or I do can I tell you today the salvation of no one depends on you. And I'm really glad about that. I'm glad that I don't live with the burden every day of the eternal destiny of all of my neighbors. I'm glad God's bigger than that. But yet, I think for years, I subtly bought into that. How many of us have heard, you know, we need people to join our pastoral care team to visit people in the hospital because people are discouraged and despairing and they're lonely. And if we don't go and encourage them and they're going to sit there in their despair and in their depression and in their loneliness and not be ministered to. As if, once again, their being encouraged is dependent upon us. If you don't write the check and you don't give, it's not going to happen. As if God is wringing his hands in heaven saying, oh, please, get your checkbook out and write a check because if you don't write a check, my work's just not going to get done. As if God's bankrupt. And as I sang as a young boy, maybe some of you did too, God owns cattle on a thousand hills. and anytime he can sell one head, two head or 2,000 head God can generate funds and it's not dependent upon your checkbook or mine okay? Acts 17 24 and 25 simply say this the God who made the world and all things in it since he is Lord of heaven and earth does not dwell in temples made with hands neither is he served by human hands as though he needed anything since he himself gives to all life and breath and all things. Our God is all sufficient. Our God is self sufficient. Our God is capable of doing everything that needs to be done. The God who spoke the world into order can speak hope and encouragement into the heart and mind of a lonely person sitting in a hospital this morning without you and I. The God who said, let there be light, and there was, can go down the street and reach your neighbor or mine without our going along with him. The God who literally lifted dust out of the ground and formed it into man and breathed life and gave life, that God capable of doing that, friends, can build buildings without your check or mine. God is not calling you and I to his work because he needs our help. Our God is all-sufficient and he's self-sufficient. Now, some of you may say, well, there's a verse in the book of Romans, Don, chapter 10, I believe it is. Maybe it's 14. It's 14, no, 10, 14, which says, How then shall they call upon him in whom they have believed? And how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? Seems that what he's saying there is that we do need a preacher. Well, there's a larger context involved there. But let me also, without getting down that rabbit trail, to tell you that there's a mystery here. If I say to you, predestination or free will, which is it? God chooses you. You're predestined. Before the foundations of the world, Ephesians 1 tells us. It's God's desire that all men come to repentance. But he isn't forcing anybody. God gives people the free will to choose. So which is it? You say yes. It is. Like which one? Yes. And people much brighter probably than you and I have debated that for centuries. Some have tried to land here, some have tried to land here, but the truth of the matter is they're both true. How do you reconcile those? I don't. It's a mystery. I'm thankful that his ways are not my ways, and his thoughts are not my thoughts, and his thoughts are beyond my thoughts. And even though my understanding is finite, his is infinite. and he can obviously have those two without having a contradiction. In the same way, God says, I don't need your help. I'm not dependent upon human hands. I don't need anything. I'm a self-sufficient, all-sufficient being. At the same time, God says, how will they hear without a preacher? In other words, there is a place and a way in which God has bound himself to involving us in the work of his kingdom. Why? He doesn't need our help. we'll talk about this more later but there's a difference between needing our help and wanting our help God doesn't need it but he wants it and we'll unpack that a little bit later so God calls us to his work because he needs our help that's a lie two God calls us to his work so that we can pay him back for all he has done for us how many times have we had someone say what shall I render to the Lord for all of his benefits toward me. And what do we say in response? Well, I'll serve. I'll get on board. I've received so much that it's my time to give back. We understand that economy, don't we? God's been so good to me. My life is so good. My family, my business, etc. God's been so good for me, you know, to me, that what I'll do is I'm going to go over to the church and I'm going to volunteer and get involved and I'm going to write a check and I'm going to help out as a way of paying back. getting involved in the work of the king has nothing to do with paying god back i have a relationship with my mortgage company maybe you have one too now they call me a customer i'm not a customer i'm a debtor okay but you see if they wrote me a letter and said debtor don cousins? Wouldn't have the warm fuzzies to it. Okay? Just wouldn't create the kind of response that causes me to want to open the envelope because who wants to be called a debtor? Okay? Now, I'm a debtor because I owe them. They have this thing called a mortgage. They gave me some money so I could buy a house and I just keep paying them back. I'm in debt. Now, use your imagination for just a moment and imagine that once a month, my mortgage company took all the names of the people who had mortgages, you know, with them, and threw all their names in a big drum, and then spun it around, and then pulled one out, and every month they pulled out a winner, and then erased their mortgage. Just use your imagination, okay? And let's just say that they pulled mine out this next month, called me on the phone and said, Don, guess what? Your name got pulled out of the big drum. You don't owe us any more. So, no mortgage. Am I still a debtor? No. Debt's been paid. I don't owe them anything. I'm no longer a debtor. Okay, now there was a time when you and I, before God, were debtors, right? We had sin. But Jesus paid our sin. Are we still debtors? Well, if you're not a debtor before God, do you owe him anything? In fact, we have been taught, and it's accurate, that we live by what? Grace. Just like my mortgage company and it takes imagination to think of this because they're not going to do this, it would be complete grace for them to draw a name out of their barrel every month and erase a mortgage. You say, why did they do that for you? Did you deserve it? No. Did you do anything to earn it? No. Why did you do it? Grace. Well, friends, God treats us with grace. Now, you say, well, you know, is this really a big deal before God? Yeah, it is a big deal before God because you see, to the degree that you and I have a mindset that says, I'm going to serve so that I can pay him back. What we're in effect saying to him is, your grace wasn't sufficient for me. Follow me? Your grace wasn't sufficient for me. I'm going to do something to pay you back. And frankly, God's insulted. So friends, if any of you are on the track this morning and you say, well I'm on the works plan and I'm trying to pay God back my encouragement to you this morning is get off that because God is insulted at the fact that you would even make an attempt at paying him back and in effect saying to him your grace was not sufficient for me because would any of us like to tell God his grace is not sufficient? No. God your grace is sufficient. And friends if you never do another thing in the work of the kingdom it is not going to change God's love for you or his grace in your life one iota. isn't that freeing third truth or misconception serving God is essentially defined as doing something for him serving God is essentially defined as doing something for him you know words fail us at this point because when we think of serving someone we automatically think of doing something for someone else. And even when we talk in the confines of the church, we say, you know, where are you serving in the church? Where are you doing something, right? In the way of serving. So here's what we say. If I came to any, you know, majority of you this morning and just, you know, said, you know, tell me about, you know, where you're engaged in service, or what you do in terms of service. The answer would be something like, oh, I'm involved in the children's ministry. Or I do youth ministry, or I sing in the choir or the worship team or you know i teach a senate school class or i you know work in the office as a volunteer during the week whatever it be and you would define it that way right which then begs the question okay well then when you stop doing that thing that you do okay you stop doing it who are you then serving like you stop doing the children's ministry thing when you leave that who are you serving then well I'm serving God oh really I thought you told me you were serving God in the children's ministry well yeah I do that but then when I leave I also serve God you see what we have to do is we have defined serving God as a place and as a task of doing something for him and friends that's a distortion of truth because that's not what it means to serve God John chapter 12 Jesus says this verses 24 and 25 he who loves his life loses it he who hates his life in this world shall keep it to eternal life if anyone serves me let him follow me and where I am there shall my servant also be if anyone serves me the father will honor him now let me back up one step in Mark chapter 10 verse 45 Jesus says I have not come to be served but I have come to serve and to give my life as ransom for many I've not come to be served so he says in that verse we're not to serve him he came to serve us and yet he says in verse 26 of John 12 if anyone serves me let him follow me and where I am there's my servant you say well Jesus whoa whoa whoa whoa Jesus you're contradicting yourself which is it I have not come to be served but rather to give my life as a ransom for many I came to serve yet you turn around here and you tell if anyone serves me let him follow me and where I am there's a way to myself. Jesus which is it? And so what we have to do is we have to get a proper understanding of what he meant by serving. In order to do that you've got to look at the verse before which says he who loves his life loses it and he who hates his life in this world shall keep it to eternal life if anyone serves me. So when Jesus talks about serving him is he talking about doing something for him at a particular time and place? What's he talking about? Giving your life. He who loses his life, he who hates his life in this world shall keep it to eternal life. It's the giving up of one's life to him. You know, really, when you stop to think about it, it is a lot easier if I define my serving God as doing something for Him at a time and a place. That's a lot easier than giving Him my life and living for Him all the time, everywhere, in every way. Yet that's what it means to really serve Him. All right, so those are all distortions. So I just turn to the truth. Serving God, number one, is biblically defined as surrendering one's entire life to the fulfillment of God's will, to his glory. That's what I just spoke of. Serving God is biblically defined as surrendering one's entire life to the fulfillment of God's will, to his glory. All our time, all our money, all our energy, everywhere we go and everything we do. So you see, when you understand that, that changes your entire paradigm of service because what you begin to understand is that it is no more spiritual and active service to be involved in the children's ministry here than it is to sell insurance. Or to be at home taking care of a home and a family. Or to collect garbage. Or to be a plumber. Or to clean houses. None of that is any less spiritual than being involved in a ministry here at the church. Why? Because serving God is not a place and a task. Serving God is my life everywhere I go. Living to his glory. In fact, if you take it to its logical conclusion, what you begin to see is that my place at the insurance company is selling insurance. It isn't really about selling insurance. What it's really about is putting God on display in the context of the insurance industry. Through my life. Now all of a sudden you begin to change your whole paradigm and you begin to understand that working at the insurance company is a place with eternal implications for my life and the lives of others. And by the way, I just happen to also earn a living while I'm there. See friends, we have such a distorted view of that that what we say is, Well, I go sell insurance. That's where I make a living. That's my career. And then I serve God when I go over to the church. Well, to the degree that we do that, we have reduced our serving God to an hour or two or three or four a week. Really, that's easy. God says, that's not what I'm asking for. What I'm asking for is your life. All of a sudden now, you realize that when you're engaged in writing out an insurance policy for someone, or you're telling, they ask you the question, well, what's the best policy for me? And you're giving him an answer, but you realize is your ability at that point to speak the truth is an act of service unto God. Well, that changed the way you do business. For all of us. That's the truth. Serving God is biblically defined as surrendering one's entire life to the fulfillment of God's will and His glory. Number two, God calls us to His work in order to bring blessing to us and through us. God calls us to his work in order to bring blessing to us and through us. We are recipients of grace. We are recipients of grace. 2 Corinthians 9.8 2 Corinthians 9.8 says And God is able to make all grace abound to you that always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed. Now in this particular passage, Paul's talking about giving. He's talking about, he's in the midst of talking to the church at Corinth about bringing together an offering to give it. And he says, God is able to make all grace abound to you. He doesn't say, God is able to make all money abound to you. He says, God is able to make all grace abound to you, that always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed. An abundance of what? Money? An abundance of what? An abundance of grace. You see, the truth of the matter is, grace is not something that simply applies to our salvation experience. So that way we say, well, yeah, I received grace 20 years ago when I came to Christ. Or 3 years ago when I came to Christ. No, grace is something that you and I live in right now, and grace is something that is the key to our future, because every good thing that you and I will ever do is as a result of God's grace in our lives. And if it's not as a result of God's grace, then it isn't about Him, it's about us. You see, you and I are incapable of doing anything for His glory apart from His grace in our lives. There are a lot of people doing good things out there, but it's not about, it's really not about, it's not about God, and it's not about other people, it's about them. The only thing that enables us to do it for God's glory, truly do it for God's glory, is His grace operating through our lives. God is able to make all grace abound to you, that you may have a sufficiency of grace, all sufficiency of grace, for every good deed. Why is it important that we operate out of this place of grace? Well, here's the reason. In any serving relationship, there is always a giver and a receiver. Right? The person who gives is the server. The person who receives is the beneficiary of the service. So you could say, giver-receiver, benefactor-beneficiary. Now, in the context of a benefactor-beneficiary relationship, who gets the glory? huh now who gets the glory the benefactor gets the glory the one who gave right how many times have you walked into a building well you might see the name on the top of the hospital you know such and such a hospital I can drive through Grand Rapids and there are hospitals named after you know the DeVos family okay who started Amway or the Van Andol Arena in Grand Rapids okay not too far from me So the minute you see someone's name on the top of the building, and it's a non-for-profit kind of an entity, or it's a service agency, what do you conclude as to why that building is named after them? They did what? They wrote a large check. They wrote the biggest check. And who gets the glory? They do. Now here's the thing, and this is really important. You see, friends, to the degree that you and I are the servers and God is the recipient of our service, who's the benefactor and who's the beneficiary? If we serve and he receives, then we're the benefactor and he's the beneficiary, at which point who gets the glory? We do. You see, God must always be the benefactor. God must always be the one who gives. Always gives. We must always be the one who receives because God always gets the glory. So, Dan, what you're telling me is that in all the serving that I do, you're telling me that I should be the one who should be blessed by God as a result of being engaged in my service? That's exactly what I'm telling you. Well, God, if that's the case, then nobody ever engaged in the work of service should ever burn out, wear out, you know, exhaust themselves, because that would indicate that they're not receiving. Bingo. So, friends, God is always the giver. Always the giver. He never changes places with us. That's why Jesus said, I have not come to be served, I have come to serve. Because there's nothing that you can give to me, which would cause me to be the recipient, and therefore allow you as the benefactor to receive the glory. Now again, when you begin to understand that and you put yourself in that place, you realize that God calls us to his work in order to bring blessing to us. He's the giver. I'm the receiver. Even when I'm engaged in the work of the kingdom and I'm doing, doing, doing in some way, shape or form, I must always be in a place of receiving. Hmm. God calls us to his work in order to bring blessing to us and go a step further through us. Then, out of the blessing that we receive from him, we then, out of that filling up, are then able to be a blessing to others. See how it works? God, out of his grace, pours into my life. out of what he pours into my life, I then, out of that, am able to pour into your life. Now, as long as it continues to work that way, okay, I should never run out of gas. So if I run out of gas, and I get to a place like I was in 1992, where I was absolutely exhausted, okay, spent, what does that tell you? The degree to which I had tried to be a blessing to others had exceeded my ability to be blessed. And you see, unlike God, my resources are limited. I have an emotional capacity. I have a mental capacity. I have a spiritual capacity. I have a physical capacity that's limited. But God isn't. And so I need to tap into his unlimited reservoir of resources for blessing. And out of that, then bring blessing. Which is why Jesus said, you must abide in me and I in you. For apart from me, you can do nothing. It's a prerequisite. So God calls us to his work to bring blessing to us and through us. And by the way, if you came to the end of your life and you were able to say in summation, I lived a life in which I was blessed by God and other people have found me to be a blessing, would your life have been worth living? I mean, what more do we want than a life blessed by God and a life that results in a blessing to others? Friends, God calls us to His work to accomplish just that. To bring blessing to us and to us. That's why He calls us to His work. Bottom line number three. God displays Himself in blessing. God displays Himself in blessing for the purpose of bringing glory to His name. God blesses me, blesses you. we then are able to pass that blessing on to someone else so that both they and us are then able to step back and say where did that blessing come from? it came from God isn't God good? this is exactly what Peter says in 1 Peter chapter 4 verses 10 and 11 listen to the wording that the Holy Spirit inspired Peter to sell out. 1 Peter chapter 4, verses 10 and 11. He says that each one of you has received a special gift. Isn't it interesting that these abilities that we have, 1 Corinthians 12, we'll talk about these later, that these things are called spiritual gifts? you ever thought about that the spiritual gifts now when you give a gift to someone what are you intending to do aren't you intending to in some way bless them that's why I give a gift right to bring a blessing God has given each of us a spiritual gift as a blessing to us he says employ it in serving one another so the doing that we do we do it for each other not for him we do it for each other do it in certain employing the serving of one another but as good stewards of the manifold grace of God out of what does this gift come that enables us to do it steward it what out of the manifold grace of God. Whoever speaks, let him speak as it were the utterances of God. Whoever serves, let him do so by the strength which God supplied. If you speak, whether you're speaking like I am now or whether you're speaking just to a friend, speak as it were the utterances of God. If you're going to serve, do so with the strength that God supply. And why is that so important? The rest of the book. So that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. You know, if you get through hearing a person speak, Christian speaker, and at the end of hearing them speak, you walk away and you say to yourself, in effect, I learned more about their life than I did about God. And who got the glory? how many times I've heard oh, oh, here, here what a phenomenal communicator oh, what a fascinating life what did you gain about the greatness of God and the truth of God all of that kind of got lost they're not speaking the utterances of God because you see when you speak the utterances of God people don't walk away saying boy, what a phenomenal individual that is but rather isn't the truth of God freeing? Isn't the truth of God amazing? Isn't God amazing? Isn't God good? That's the way it ought to be. And when we serve, it ought to be by a power of peace of Christ, so it's a huge bit of glory. I have a friend who a few years ago runs an investment company and God has just prospered amazingly and he's done extremely well making money hand over fist. And about four years ago, he came to me and he said, my wife and I would like to start a foundation. And we'd like to start this foundation for the express purpose of putting proceeds from the business in this foundation and then we want to give these funds away for Christian ministries around the world as God leads. And so we'd like to help in doing that. Could you sit down and talk that through with us and help us kind of formulate that? And so I agreed to do that, and I sat down over to the house one day, sat in the family room there, took out a legal pad, and I said, okay, let's just start talking this through. Why do you want to do this? Just start right there. One of the first things that he answered that question with was, he said, we want to put the generosity of God on display. We want to put the generosity of God on display. Our God is generous, and there are many people walking around who don't believe that God is generous. And we believe that God has called us to be instruments to display his generosity. And so, over the last several years, they've given millions of dollars away. And one of the fundamental values of the foundation is, their name is not attached to that giving. So many of the ministries, if not most of the ministries, know that they get... Let me define success in ministry for you with three words. Success in ministry. How do you know if you're a success in ministry? How do you know what you're engaged in if this is working and it's really a success? I can tell you if you get a group of pastors together how they define success. Whoever has the most people wins. We go to a pastor's conference, and, you know, sometimes it's small as a pastor's. Always one of the first questions we ask is, you know, let's just introduce each other. You know, introduce yourself to what's going on with them. Tell us who you are, where you come from. Tell us a little about your church. And one of the first things that you hear from out of pastors now is, well, you know, I have a church that can put the place, and we run about, you know, 3,000 a weekend services. And all of a sudden, everybody else in the room says, oh, he's a success. And then the guy who sits there who only has 200 in his church says, I hate this because every time I do this, and I have to tell him it's 200, and then all the people in the room say, oh, he's a failure. And that's a real tragedy, because if that's the case, Jesus was a complete failure. Because the best he could do at the end of his life before the saying in heaven was was stoking together 120 people. Three and a half years of ministry, and he gets all his followers together at that time and time, and says, you know, Greg, here we are. How many? 120. In the upper room. So given that measurement of success Jesus was a failure So obviously that's not the key to measuring success Well what is the biblical measurement of success? Three words The algorithm with the letter F Number one To these psalms You know the parable in Matthew 25 The parable of the town The master gives five to one guy Gives two to another guy Gives one to another guy Goes on a journey and comes back The guy with five has done what? made it five more, it's ten. And he says to him, well done, good and faithful servant. Goes to the one who had two, and he made four. Goes to him and says, well done, good and faithful servant. Goes to the one, and who did what with it? Buried it. And what does he say to him? You wicked slave. What you have will be taken from you and given to the one who had ten. You weren't faithful. it wasn't going to be faithful can I define it for you? best I understand it doing what God's called you to do utilizing all that God has given you to do it doing what God has called you to do utilizing all that God has given you to do it you are not going to be you're not going to be held accountable before God to do what Keith Meyer was called to do or the person sitting next to you, or Billy Graham, or anybody else. You're going to be called into account, to give them account, did you do what I called you to do, utilizing what I gave you to do it. And if you were, you're going to hear the words, well done, good and faithful, sir. Now, to the degree that what I just said is true, That then has two premises to it, two questions that you need to know the answer to. Question number one, do you know what God has called you to do? And second, do you know what all God has given you to do? What has God called you to do? than what you have that He has given you with which to do it. And if anybody wants to be found faithful, you need to know the answer to those questions. What has God called me to do? And what has God given me with which to do it? Second, success is defined by the word fruitful. Fruit. is used a lot in the New Testament. It's really twofold. There is internal fruit and there is external fruit. There is inward fruit and there is outward fruit. Inward or internal fruit is best summarized in Galatians 5, 22 and 23. For the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, generalness, and self-control. These are the fruit of the Spirit. So when the Spirit of God is alive in your life, these are the characteristics that are born out of your life on the inside. But that's what it is to bear fruit. Now, to be a success, you had better be growing in the fruit of the Spirit. Not many of us evaluate our fruitfulness with regard to those nine characteristics. In the summer of 1992, I requested of the Older Will of Truth that I would take a sabbatical for a few months and first time I'd have done that. And the reason why I left for that is because I would have sensed over about the last year to two years a reference in my spirit that led me to believe that maybe God was leading me in a different direction with regard to the future and the ministry. And I've had that reference a couple of times in my life, and every time I've had that kind of reference, it always proceeded to change. and so I was familiar enough with that restlessness and there were some objective things that I could put my hand on and understand as causing the restlessness and so I said we need to get some time away time with God time to rest time to get refreshed and renewed seek God and decide what is what is what is what is what do you call me to do in the next season of life and send that away May, June, July, August of 1992 too. So in May I prayed, and in June I prayed, and in July I prayed, and in the beginning of August I prayed, and I prayed as a good example. God, what is he you want me to do? What is he you want me to do? Are you leading me? You know, my days are a little bit over. Do I need to re-engage here? Do, you know, continue to do what I'm doing, change a little bit, leave here, do something else. What is he you want me to do? What is he you want me to do? It's like praying over and over and over again. And I would listen and I would take time to listen, you know, what God is saying. May, June's a lot I heard nothing. Heard nothing. You ever been there? Heard nothing. And I was like, I was talking to the girl. So I got into early August, and I went with that, and I had a few weeks left in my break, and I got to make a decision of some kind. And I was just beginning to be exasperated in my spirit, but God doesn't respond in any way, shape, or form. And I was just doing nothing. And I was driving up a hill. I hadn't been in Holland, Michigan at the time, but I'm living now. And I was driving up a hill, and I was so frustrated in Saga, literally inside the car, screaming down, God, what is it you want me to do? Please tell me. And there wasn't an audible voice that I heard in this time, but in my own spirit that I heard coming back to me was this. I don't really care what you do. What I care deeply about is who you are. And who you are is there. And I didn't hear it as a word of condemnation. I took it as a word of conviction. I was only a few blocks from the place that I was staying at the time. I went back in there, and I opened my Bible immediately to Galatians 5, 22 and 23. But that was the verse that came to mind. So I sat down with Galatians 5, 23, and I began to do an evaluation of who I was as a person at the time, based on those one characteristics. I said, okay, love, am I a lover? Hmm, that'd be a stretch. Joy. Joy. Hmm, I didn't get these wrinkles because of my laughter. Peace. Oh my. I'm one of the stressed out people I know. Joy, peace, patience. A line of two. One person too long for me. Almost like I'm the first person. I mean, I try to go down this list. Love, joy, peace, patience. I mean, I would just... I mean, I was just, whoop, whoop. It was just like one kick in the gut after another. Finally, I got the faithfulness about, oh, no, no, no. Finally. Something to feel good about, okay? I mean, I'm a gentleman. I'm faithful. Give me a pass. I'll do it, all right? So I felt pretty good about myself. And then I hit gentleness, which is what I bombed out. Nobody would have ever qualified me as gentleness. And then I finished on self-control, which was an upper end. So I sat back, and I had had a lot of baseball drawing up, so the first thing that came to mind was I'm two for nine. So what did I do in God's starting lineup? Nope. I could have been down the bench. I could have been cut. What God said to me that day was, Don, what I'm most concerned about, So you've spent the last 17, 20 years of your life focusing your entire life on outward fruit, all about doing. And then there's standards that at least 50% of the equation is all about internal fruit. And with the guide to the outward, you're looking really good, but with the guide to the internal, you're failing. And right now, my biggest concern in your life is not what you do, it's who you are. So here's my question to you. Is working in the current environment that you're in, in the role you're in, is it going to make you a loving, joyful, peaceful, patient, kind, good, faithful, gentle, self-controlled individual? And the answer came just that quick, no, it's not. Not because there's something wrong with that environment, but because the nature of how that culture is put together, which, by the way, you put a big part in shaping, it's all about doing. It's all about the cause. That's what gets rewarded in that environment. And you know what? For you, that's like a salmon swimming up a spoon. It's going to be the end of it. And so it's time to leave. And as to what you're going to do, I'll read you. but the focus of your life and your upcoming era is not about what you do it's about becoming the person you need to be through the spirit so ever since that time I have now regularly tried to evaluate myself based on am I growing in being a lover am I growing in regard to joy am I growing in regard to peace and patience you see as a non-Christian as a total non-Christian I would have been faithful and self-controlled because that's just who I am. Any non-Christian out there could be two for nine. But the other seven it was going to take Jesus. So, fruit of the spirit. How successful are you? Fruit also means outward, Christ-like influence. That's 1038 very quickly. It says, and you know Jesus of Nazareth and how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and with power, how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil. It's a summation of Jesus' life. He was anointed with power. He took that power and he went about doing good and he worked to take back from the devil that was rightfully belonged to God. Friends, the purpose of every single one of our lives is from the time we get up in the morning to the time we go to bed at night to go through life with the anointing of God. Doing good, Working to take back from the devil that which rightfully belongs to God to his glory. That's the calling of our lot of faith. And you can't survive and you've been much food along those lines. That's exactly it. Food, fulfillment. Faithful, fruitful, fulfilled. John chapter 15 is the famous passage on burying fruit. In that passage, Jesus talks all about the importance of burning fruit. At the very end of that little section, specifically on fruit bearing, he ends with these words in verse 11. He says, these things about fruit bearing, I have spoken to you that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full. The end result of living a life that is filled with faithful fruit bearing, the end result of that, should be joy. to be joy that's why I'm telling you these things so that you would have joy and that my joy in you would be most full you know it's interesting in Luke chapter 10 where Jesus had sent out the 70 in Kings 2 we read in verse 17 70 returned and it says they returned with and you know the the other word that is used there to describe the state with which they returned Not the word you did. The Seventy returns with joy. Some word, even the demons are subject to us in your mind. When the Holy Spirit inspired Luke to write this passage and said, I want to summarize the way in which the Seventy returns after being engaged in the work of the kingdom. When they came back, what's the one word that the best pastor would have experienced? He said the best word is joy. My friend, can you imagine what the church of Jesus Christ would be like? If every believer walking around, if the plurality of their involvement in the work of the kingdom, if that could be summarized in one word, and that word were joy, what would be the opposite for the church? If everybody after their engagement and the kingdom, if they say, you know what, let me just summarize how I feel in a word. Joy. I don't even think of it. Joy. I'm just filled. In fact, I'm not just filled with joy. I have God's joy. In fact, my joy is, it's just filled. What would the trick do you have? absolutely it would be a mag and the people over there living in those in those homes over there who aren't involved in the life of the church and don't know the Lord in any personal way would just feel the magnetism that would draw them to the church because we're not to go to God and find contagious joy nowhere nowhere in front of many of us in the work of the kingdom are walking around and we're just I'm so tired I'm so drunk and I'm so worn out and I'm so ashamed. And now, what is the joy? Jesus said, for you to be a successful ministry, you need to be faithful. You need to be fruitful, internal and external. But the summation of your experience in the work of my kingdom should be joy. That should be the end result of being engaged in my life. That's what I want you to experience. Isn't that a wonderful thing? And when I require all that, and even listening to myself talk about this, I say, isn't God good? Isn't God good? Let's pray and not take it. Father, we thank you for your goodness for us, one. Thank you for your truth that sets us free. Thank you that we are recipients of grace. Thank you that you've called us to your work for the purpose of blessing us. And then giving us the ability to be a blessing to others. Thank you for still for gifts. the bounding intended to bless us through which we're then able to bless others. O God, state not our understanding, let us line ourselves at heart and mind with your truth, so that we might end up being successful, as you define it, faithful, faithful, and fulfilled to the good. We worship you today, and thank you. in the name of Jesus we pray. Amen.
