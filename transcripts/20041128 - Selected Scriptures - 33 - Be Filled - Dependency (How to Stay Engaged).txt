Let's pray as we go to the Word. Lord, I thank you the words that you gave to Gideon as you were calling him into what you were calling him to when you told him to go in the strength that he had. I come today in the strength that I have. Make up what is lacking by the power of your Spirit. Give life to this word in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, every week in a variety of ways, we try to identify and clarify the vision and the values of our church twice a year, once in the spring and once in the fall. We do it in a more pointed way. Last spring, if you were here, you probably remember that we articulated our vision as a church, six weeks we took to unpack all of that vision God was giving us, primarily because it was a fresh expression of what we believe God is calling us to do and who it is He is calling us to be. And the vision, in kind of a phrase, as concisely as I can put it, is this, that we believe God is calling us to be a people who are living as the beloved of God, experiencing the amazing grace of God. But while that's where it starts, that is not where it ends. Out of that sense of belovedness, God is calling us to be a people who are having a kingdom influence in our community and in our city, particularly among the least and the lost. And the way we desire to have that kingdom, it's part of our vision, is not by declaring ourselves to be the moral majority and because there's more of us than them we win. The kind of impact God has put in our heart to have in our community and in our city is by taking on so the character of Christ that creates an aroma that draws people into the kingdom of God, much the way Jesus did, as because of who he was, was comfortable with and drew people who desperately needed to come to the kind of life that the kingdom of God would offer them. But one of the things we recognize is that if we're going to have that kind of impact on our community, we're going to have to become different kind of people. Because you can't have that kind of impact on a community simply by sitting on a picket line. You're going to have to become a different kind of person. So central to our vision is this whole issue of transformation and how it is that we actually do take on the character of Christ and become more loving people in ways that are being fleshed out by the power of the Spirit of God. And the final piece of our vision is that this whole life of the kingdom of God that we have entered into is something we have a responsibility to give to the next generation. That's our vision. Today, we have set some time aside to identify and reaffirm not just our vision but our values. The distinction between those two things might be important to make. The distinction is this, that our vision articulates what it is we're here to do. Our values articulate how it is we hope to do. what it is God has called us to do. And our values are embodied in what we've been calling, and if you've been around here at Open Door at all, you kind of are familiar with our B statements. The first B statement we have is this, be real, because we want to do what God is calling us to do authentically. One of the highest values here at Open Door is this, no pretending, no religious posing, value number one, be real. And from there, we will do our life together. Second value, in terms of how we're going to pull off the vision God has given us, is we're going to have to be long. That's the second be statement, not two words. One, be long, sounds like permission for me to be long. It's not that. Be long is because we want to do what we do in the context of community because what God has called us to do, we can't do alone. We can't do it alone, just our little church on one hand, and we can't do it alone as individuals either. I can't live life in the kingdom of God authentically unless I'm partnering with men and women of like faith and reminding me of who I am and whose we are. Third B statement is this, become, because we believe that to authentically do what God's called us to do in this community, in this city, we have to become, again, a different kind of people. That's why our third value is transformation, which gives you a little hint that we're a bit obsessed with this transformation. thing. It's central to our vision. It's central to our values till Christ be formed in you. And the reason it's central is because all of us have been called to partner with God and others who love God in doing the wonderful works of God. That's the fourth value. In terms of how we do what we do around here, the fourth value is this, be called. What I want to do today, among other things, however, is add to these B statements, those four B statements, a fifth B statement, it's this, be filled with the Holy Spirit of God. Because we want to do what we do dependently on the life and the power of the Holy Spirit of God at work in us and through us in this community and in this city. Now, actually, even though this fifth B statement, be filled, is a new one, and I just introduced it as the fifth one, already it's being promoted because it is actually our first value before anything else, before we do anything else, before we think about any possibility we have of fleshing out the vision God has given us, we better understand that it's going to start from a place of being filled with the Holy Spirit of God. It is absolutely central to who we are and what we're called to do. In fact, as the discussion kind of evolved around this addition of this other B statement, because we had these other four for, we've had them for two years, And just noticing that something was missing. One of the parts of the discussion was a noticing that we could talk about belonging and being real and all these kinds of stuff. And those could be values of just about any organization. A good organization. And part of what sets us apart is that what we are doing, we are doing in a position of being dependent on the God who gave us life. To be filled is what sets us apart. It also is what empowers us to do what God has called us to do. Indeed, this whole issue of being filled with the Spirit is so important, I believe, that when we're done with this journey of the heart that we've been on for a year, and who knows how long, whatever, no promises there as far as when we're done. But when we are done with it, we're going to do a teaching on the Holy Spirit of God. We're going to talk about the third person of the Trinity. We're going to talk about the filling of the Spirit and what that means and how you step into that. I want to talk about the gifts of the Spirit, all of them. We'll talk about the fruit of the spirit and the baptism of the spirit. Here's why. Because we cannot do, we cannot do what God is calling us to do. And we cannot be who God is calling us to be. We cannot go where God is calling us to go without the power of the spirit. We can't do one bit of it without the gifts of the spirit, all of them. We can't do it without the baptism of the spirit, without the filling of the spirit. We can't do it without the spirit. Value number one. Value number one here at Church of the Open Door is be filled with the Holy Spirit of God. Everything else flows from that. Somebody say amen to that. Amen. Control yourself. Jeez. You do that quite well. There they go. They do whatever. I'm thinking about our vision and values this week. I wanted to do, I didn't want to just lay them out for you, but I wanted to talk about our vision and our values in the context of just some things we're talking about right now in our church, some things that are going on among us and things we're seeing and doing relative to our vision and values. The last week, in fact, would be a prime example, in my opinion, of our values and our vision. Just put on display as Tom Johnson or our reach pastor or Metro Impact Pastor. Got a new title. I like that. Metro Impact Pastor. Whatever. came and spoke to us along with Joy Schicksted, the director of Sanctuary Community Development Corporation, and Don Samuels was here as well last week, city councilman in the third ward of North Minneapolis, the Jordan neighborhood, and the Jordan neighborhood for anyone who lives in Minneapolis, we all know to be among the toughest in our city. We found out last week that it's one of the most deprived and in need communities in the entire nation. Only 20% of the children in North Minneapolis in this particular ward, Don Samuels' ward, are at reading grade level, which happens to be the lowest in the nation. Highest teen pregnancy rate in the nation is in the Jordan neighborhood. The third ward, where Don Samuels is the councilman. Dubbed by the New York Times some years ago as Murderapolis. So Don Samuels, who was with us last week in this pulpit, and his family moved into the Jordan neighborhood. They moved into that neighborhood. built a house and bought a house rather, bought a house on what's known as Gang Hill. Remember he talked about that? It used to be called Baptist Hill because there was a big Baptist church there, but they left and now the gangs moved in. So Don then moved back in with his family. See, that sounds incarnational to me. I don't know if you picked that up, but that's called incarnational. Taking a cue did Don Samuels from our Lord Jesus Christ, who became flesh and dwelt among us. John 1.14. Eugene Peterson translates that verse this way. Jesus, the word, became flesh and moved into the neighborhood. And as Don was speaking last night, I was looking at this guy, this black man in a sea of white faces, and I thought, that's what that guy did. He moved into the neighborhood that had been given over to gangs. It's called incarnational kingdom living. And God was in this. and he moved into the neighborhood. And we began to hear last week in ways that are consistent with our vision. It was our vision being fulfilled and consistent with our values. We began to hear how simple things done in Jesus' name are beginning to make a difference in places that have looked to be hopeless. Simple things done in Jesus' name. And I had going through my mind, though it wasn't a text for the morning, Jesus speaking of a cup of cold water given in his name, ripples into eternity. Simple things, human things, human touch. And I began to think even further how many of the miracles Jesus did and the ministries that he had simply touched basic human needs. He provided wine for a wedding. He provided food for hungry. 5,000 people he fed. He did that twice. Kind of important. He provided healing for the sick and deliverance for the oppressed. And we talked about coats for the cold kids in Minneapolis who didn't have coats. What's that? Just a little thing? No, you need to understand that's the kingdom of God when you do that. we talked about school supplies that were provided with us in partnership with other people two vans brought to the Willard School a school where the kids were not going to have the supplies that they needed on the first day of school every kid had the supplies they needed for the first day of school so now the principal at Willard School is open to the help the churches might give because she's finally become convinced that they want to do something beyond just preach at her we talked about sending tutors into that community and many of our people in partnership with Sanctuary Church and others have already sent tutors and we're looking for an army of tutors and all I could think of as I was thinking of that was Jesus would have been a great tutor wouldn't he have been a good tutor and then I think of our people who are becoming tutors and do you understand are you connecting the dots you need to hear the sermon it's this you're Jesus with skin on for those kids that's who you are it is Jesus being the tutor because Jesus is in you we're not kidding about that and then I heard Don talk about the vigils that he makes and I had known that before I had seen Don on the news when there's a murder in his ward and there are many in his ward murdered murderapolis is what it's called we were told that last week he goes to the spot of that murder whether it's a gang related incident and most of them are or a drive by shooting where some totally innocent child is killed. He goes to the spot where that blood was shed, and he fasts, and he prays, and here's what he said. Remember he said, I reconsecrate that ground. It took my breath away. And I'm going, this is the kingdom of God. Several things were going through my mind. As I was listening to what we talked about last week, One of them was what I just said, this is the kingdom of God, this is it fleshed out, this isn't just a sermon, this is the doing of it. But another thing that came to me, I don't know if you have these experiences, I'm sure you do, where for reasons you don't even know, you're at a moment and there's like a snapshot in your brain. And you never forget the moment, it was when I was standing up here at the end of the first service and Tom had called us up to pray for joy and for Don. And I was right behind Don and the lights were like this and there was this, just that he was behind him. What came to me as I was looking at all of you was this phrase that it's not just about me and my personal relationship with Jesus anymore. This is calling us out of me and my personal, out of my personal relationship, out of my belovedness. God is calling us to the least and the lost. And the other thing I thought was, you know, I could have done a six-week series of sermons on how it's not just about my personal relationship with Jesus. God's calling us to more. and not done a better job of demonstrating that than what we talked about last week with Don Samuels and standing vigil and being tutors and giving coats and ministering to the least and the lost. The other thing I thought of was this is our vision. Point two of our vision is to have a kingdom influence in our community, in our city, not by declaring ourselves to be the moral majority and because there's more of us than them we win, not because of that, but the kind of influence we want to have is because we have so taken on the character of Christ that we give away our life. particularly to the least and the lost. The third thing that kept going through my mind was how consistent this was with our values because the partnership oh there's a value that we do what we do in partnership in community that our partnership was something that was totally God breathed totally led by the spirit and that's our first value to be filled with the spirit to be dependent on the spirit to be a people being led by the Spirit. The reason I say all that is, you know how that partnership started? Our partnership with Sanctuary Church, with the CCDA, with Don Samuels, all these other people, and it's a partnership that's growing. It all started, beloved, in a prayer meeting. On a retreat with our staff and our elders. We had just come into the building a bit overwhelmed by the newness of it. Coming from a gym where we were used to getting splinters in our rear end, and now it was nice, and there was a real question, there was a real question, are we just going to become this big, fat, pretty, suburban church, or is there something more that we want? And we began to wonder, what kind of people do we want to be? Well, we want to be the kind, in prayer, we just wondered, we want to be the kind that are living out of our belovedness, but not to the point of self-absorption. We want to give it all away, particularly to the least and the lost. And now it's become this little thing that just flows off our tongue, but I remember in that prayer meeting how it came in the context of tears. Keith Meyer in particular, and he wasn't the only one. I'll never forget it, though. It's like it's another one of those snapshots in my mind. He said this at our meeting when we were talking about our vision and where are we going to go and what kind of mark do we want to leave in the community and in our city. He said, you know what, you guys? I can't read the Psalms anymore without hearing God's heart for the poor. And if we don't hear what God hears, we are going to miss what God is calling us to. See, here's the deal. It is out of those times of seeking God. God, what are you saying to us? What are you stirring in our hearts? And we will follow. It is out of those kinds of movements of God's spirit in our hearts and then our willingness to put our hand to what our heart prompts that these weird coincidences happen. Being sarcastic, I hope you know that. These weird coincidences happen where we are suddenly linked to the most deprived and needy area, not only of our city, but maybe of the nation. God found some people who said, we want to do it, we don't know how, and he linked us up. How does that happen? That's God. This is the kingdom of God. That's why be filled is our number one value. Be dependent is our number one value. Because the spirit of God and dependence on the spirit of God will lead us to things like that and more. And more and more and more. A little side note here. While most of us, I know for a fact, are overwhelmingly supportive of the kinds of things we're talking about these days, some of us get a little bit nervous, don't know how to even bring it up without being misunderstood. So I'll bring it up and, you know, be misunderstood. And here's what I think gets stirred in us and we don't know how to ask it. Dave, with all the talk about the least and the loss over, you know, in Africa and the AIDS thing and then in Minneapolis and what about the least and the loss right here? What about the least and lost among us. Well, here's the deal about that. We need to live in balance. I mean, for us to go to the least and lost in Africa and to go to the least and lost in Minneapolis and ignore the least and lost here would be the equivalent of me going off and winning the world for God and neglecting my own family. And that does happen. Here's the deal. We can't let it happen. And when we get out of balance, we've got to call it back. But here's what I would want to also say to my kids. Kids, you get me you get me and I love you but here's another thing I want you to know kids do you have any idea how much you have do you have any idea how much you have do you have any idea how much we have to give so you come with me let's go to the least and the lost we're going to take care of our family but we got to go somewhere else as well need to say the same thing to the church we're here we're here and we're going to meet every need we can meet in terms of the least and lost but God has given us, God has resourced us and called us to go way beyond here. Here's the deal. The primary call of God on us as a church is not North Minneapolis. It's to the least and the lost, wherever they may be. And some of them are right here. And we can't go there at the neglect of here. But some of them are there. Try to hold it in balance. See, as long as this stirring of God's spirit in us for the least and the lost continues to grow, some of you will be drawn to North Minneapolis. As this longing for the least and the lost continues to grow, some of you, even while you come here, will be drawn to do vigils when Don Samuel sends out the email. And we hear, and there's even information in the bulletin today if you want to be notified about when the next vigil is. And you can come. In fact, I loved what he said when he said, I know you're going to feel weird coming down there into that neighborhood and you're going to be the only white face and you're going to be uncomfortable. And he said, let your discomfort be the gift you give. I like that. But out of the stirring of God's spirit as you're following him, some of you will be drawn to North Minneapolis. Others are going to be drawn to something else and say, you know, I'm deciding to take less pay than I could get because I want to work in a child care center and just be with the children that parents have to leave in a child care center when they go off to work and I'm just going to make sure that this kid gets a kingdom, gets me. full of love. And I'll be Jesus with skin on it. So that's what I will do. But it's all out of the least and the lost and others of you are going to be drawn to the AIDS Project and African Prison Ministry that we make available to many of you to be involved. And others of you here are going to be involved with our junior high kids because you're going to see the least and the lost right there. You just got to be with Al Franz. Al Franz would be a good one too to be with. But that's a whole different story. Al Shuck, our youth guy, he gets tears in his eyes when he starts talking about the least and the lost. talks about kids here in Maple Grove who have a big house but they don't have parents, not parents that are engaged, not parents, and they feel they're so lost so some of you start talking about the least and lost you're drawn there at a timber house tree house, some house some of you are drawn to single moms in our church I got an email from Jeff Cassell just a couple days ago working with our Kingdom Warrior guys. Let me just read a little bit of this. Hey, guys, last month we had 16 men, bless Amy, lives in Robinsdale, and Maureen lives in Champlin. Two single moms in our families. We help moms, Amy's dad, do a bunch of stuff around the house. This month, Saturday, November 28th, I think that was yesterday, we had the privilege to bless St. Anthony's Development Learning Center in North Minneapolis, and that talks about what they do. They deal with low-income single moms providing child care for children aged six to five years. Children with developmental disabilities are provided with speech, occupational, and physical therapy. It's located in a very old building which was formerly used as a mortuary. Variety of deferred maintenance needs. So guys, let's come and fix all this stuff up for these people so single moms can have a chance. Don't forget to bring your sons, he says. Those who have attended with their sons have been blessed to see their dads interact with godly servants. I don't know where you're called. see what this is, this is about understanding the vision. This is about understanding the values that God is calling us to the least and the lost wherever they are and they are everywhere. And God has given us, even the sheer size of our church gives us numbers that we can spread out. Point. This is all part of our vision. This is all part of our values. It's who we are becoming in the context of community by the power of the Holy Spirit of God doing together the wonderful works of God that include touching people at their most basic need. They need food. They need shelter. Jesus miraculously, supernaturally dealt with people in those arenas and touched them there. Talk about being filled with despair. talk about gifts of the Spirit. A lot of us have a paradigm for gifts of the Spirit and things like that, and we're just waiting for more and more of that to break loose in our services, and that's fine. But I want to cast a different vision, a bigger vision, a bigger vision that the gifts of the Spirit, the supernatural enablements of God would be released when people do vigils on corners when people have been murdered. Do you get that vision? That's where the gifts of the Spirit are needed of healing and... words of knowledge and words of wisdom and the multiplying of bread. So come, Holy Spirit. You getting the spirit of this? Two weeks ago, I invited you at the end of the sermon to step into the fire. That invitation came in the context of our five-week series where we were dealing with the dangers of passivity as embodied in David in his interaction with his son, Absalom, and we talked about the dangers of passivity and the things that pull us into passivity, the kinds of things that cause us to be disengaged from time to time, from things we can't afford to disengage from. On that particular week, I shared with you three things that have a particularly powerful pull in my life to make me go passive, that cause me to go to disengage from things I can't afford to disengage from. The three things were these. Fatigue, number one, just getting too tired. And sometimes it's not just the kind of tired that a nap can take care of, though, remember, the advice was take a nap. But sometimes there's the dealing, and I know you have this sometimes in your marriages, in your families, in your communities, churches, where you're dealing with the same kinds of issues over and over and over, and there doesn't seem to be any resolution, and we slip into what I called acedia, that Latin term that means I just don't think it's doing any good. We go passive for fatigue. The other thing that causes us to move there is fear, particularly of what people think. The third thing that causes me to move into passivity is forgetting, number one, that the call of the kingdom and the mission of the kingdom is not to be successful. It's just to be faithful. And when I forget that and I don't see what I thought was going to be success, I figure it isn't doing any good and I bail out. You've got to remember the call is to be faithful, not successful. And the other thing we forget, and if you forget it, it will make you go passive, is that this is a war. that the kingdom we serve has a rival kingdom and when you begin to move in kingdom authority in your family, in your church, in your community you will run into opposition and if you didn't know you were going to get opposition it will knock you down right now because you weren't ready for the opposition and you're all surprised that this is being resisted in a variety of ways which is precisely why Paul's invitation to Timothy to partner with him in ministry was not the kind of invitation we would normally extend to people because his invitation was this. Here, I'm inviting you, Timothy, to come and suffer hardship with me like a good soldier which is much like the invitation I extended two weeks ago at the end of the service. Come step into the fire. Now that metaphor of fire I had borrowed from Dallas Willard, remember that? Came from a pamphlet that he had written on why movements of God's spirit, whether it be in a church or something even bigger than a single church, why movements of God's spirit, once thriving, often don't get passed on to the next generation, they die. Here was his thesis, at least as to one reason why these movements sometimes don't get passed on. He says this, most movements, and I'm obviously paraphrasing here, Most movements begin with a core of people who had what he called a fire. We'll just call it a, it's kind of a symbol of the life of God, the power of God, a compelling vision for what God wanted to do in their time, as it were. That fire produces things, it creates things, and it draws people. Now, some of the people who are drawn to the fire catch fire. And when they catch fire, that movement grows, and that movement has potential to be passed to the next generation because the fire is not contained to just a little core of people. There are people who have caught that fire and they understand what it means to carry that fire. However, many people in many movements of God's spirit over time have come to the fire simply to be warmed by the fire. If it's in a church, they would come every Sunday to the service to be warmed by the fire and never get in the fire and never ever enter into what it even takes to carry that fire because it usually takes a lot to carry the fire. And if that is the case, all you have is people who came to be warned by the fire. That movement will die. Thus the invitation two weeks ago to you to step into the fire. But that invitation came with a warning, and it comes with a warning again this week. And the warning is this, that if you and I really do step into the fire, if you and I are willing to follow Timothy when he accepted Paul's invitation to suffer hardship with him like a good soldier, that fire will burn you from time to time. It will cost you. I'll tell you what else it'll do. It will change you. It will transform you. You know what else it'll do? It will fatigue you. You'll get tired. It will scare you. It will confuse you. Those three things I said make me go passive. Fatigue, fear, and forgetting. It will confuse you and you'll forget what the mission really is and that we really are in a war, all of which raises a question. The question is this, how do you manage all that? How do you manage it when you step into the fire and you have to count or you have to, you get overwhelmed with fatigue or you get, you get, struggling with fear or you start getting confused about what the mission is and you get confused because you think you're losing the war. How do you manage all this? Well, consider the possibility, at the risk of sounding trite, that at least part of the answer to that question, how do you manage the fatigue and the fear and the forgetting, is answered for us in the values of our church. And how we have decided as a people to do our life together. you know how we have decided to do our life together? dependently so be filled with the spirit how do you manage the fear? how do you manage the fatigue? you're going to need to learn what it means to be filled with the spirit you're going to need to learn what it means to have the baptism of the spirit you're going to have to now if you're not in the fire those things will become theological questions I wonder what that means but if you're in the fire experiencing the life of God to sustain you in the middle of your fear in the middle of your fatigue it's going to be a matter of life and death for you these values aren't cute little things aren't those nice values they warm me up I'm not looking for people to be warmed I'm looking for people who want to learn how to carry the fire so how do you manage the fear and the fatigue. How do you do it? I'll tell you how you do it. You do it dependently. You do it authentically. If you're going to manage this, you're going to have to be real about this. So when you're tired and when you're afraid and when you get confused, don't pretend that you're not. Don't be slapping on a happy face and calling that the abundant life. And this is good news, actually. Don't be pretending that you're bigger than you are. Don't pretend that you're smarter than you are, that you're stronger or holier than you are. One of the phrases around here is come to God the way you are. Not the way you ought to be and not the way you wish you were. You come to God the way you are and he'll begin to work with you. Understand and know that there is no temptation. The word temptation there really gives you the wrong impression. This is out of 1 Corinthians 10, 13. The word there actually is trial. There is no trial. There is no fatigue, fear, or problem of forgetting. Spiritual warfare. There is nothing that could happen to you, overtake you, but such as is common to man. That verse is a verse that I have in the background of my mind, and it's one that's given me great freedom to sometimes even share with you things that make... Every once in a while, people come up to me and say, Dave, I just appreciate it. I say, you can't even believe sometimes how you share stuff with us about your life. And here's one of the reasons I do, because I'm absolutely convinced that there is no trial, there's no fear, there's no fatigue, there's nothing I've ever experienced that isn't common to man. Anthropos. It isn't just plain human. So I think whatever I'm experiencing, it doesn't make me weird. I'm weird for other reasons. You need to assume something. I'm serious about this. Now, if you're not in the fire, this isn't life and death. It just isn't that nice that they're like that. But if you're in the fire, you, I promise you, are experiencing fatigue. You are experiencing fear from time to time, and you're getting confused from time to time, and wondering where to warfare, and where are you going to get hit next? So if you are in the fire, and you have stepped into it, or at least desired to, you need to assume something. You need to assume that the fear, and the failure, and the fatigue, and the forgetting is common. And if it's common, it means you're not all by yourself. Sneeds, you don't have to pretend, you don't have to hide. We're all pretty frail, folks. The strong one is God, not us. Now, once again, if you're in the fire, a word like this, be real, is a lifeline. If you're not in the fire and you're just kind of playing this religious game, this word, be real, becomes a license. And I've seen it released here at Open Door. a license to just say whatever you think and be rude. You know, I think, well, I'm just being real. And that just is here in our church. If I could turn that off like a water spigot and just turn it off, I would. I can't. It just kind of grows just like tares with the wheat. I just want to say, though, that is not what we mean by being real. Rude, selfish, self-absorbed words that are that hurt people in the name of being real. It's not what we mean by this value because some people are being saved by this value. You know who? People who are in the fire. How are we going to do this vision? We're going to do it dependently. Holy Spirit, come. We're going to do it authentically. Third value, we're going to do it in the context of community. I think I've already made the point because we can't do this thing alone, Especially if you're fatigued and fearful and confused. We're going to need some friends personally. We're going to need some friends corporately. I think I've touched on this already as well, but part of our values is that we are looking for partnerships with other organizations and other churches in our city and in our nation who are given to the same vision as we are. There's a major change going on in Christendom. Maybe you need to do a study on this and talk about this. someday, that people are no longer finding their devotion or the commitments that they make in terms of partnerships along denominational lines. A lot of denominations are dying. They just are. And many of them, their unity is based on memories of what God did in the past. There's a new thing happening in the nation, actually, where men and women are rising up with a vision for the kingdom of God, and they're finding their partnerships in shared vision. it's why we linked up with Woodland Hills Church, it's why we link up with Sanctuary Church, it's why two weeks ago I was in Denver with Keith Meyer and Judy Haugen, one of our elders meeting with five other churches, just five other churches with Dallas Willard in the middle can you believe that? as we just talked to him and these churches one was a Presbyterian, one was a Nazarene, one was a cult, I can't remember, no that was us, we were the cult but it was all around a shared vision it was all around a shared vision some of those churches were small ours was the biggest one of the group but it was all around this shared vision we can't do this thing alone and God and part of the leading of the spirit is God show us who are the men and women in our city that we need to link up with who are the men and women in this nation that we need to link up with we don't have all the answers but incredibly how do you end up in I don't know if this amazes you how do you end up in a room with Dallas Willard and just get to listen to him talk. Ask him any question you want. I think God's doing that. We can't do it without partnerships. Men and women of faith, I don't care what their denominations are. I care that they have fidelity to God and to the word. Not going to get weird here. Well, not too weird. But I'll tell you the other thing. We need each other. We need individuals. I can't do this. Neither can you. without covenant people. So who are your covenant people? Who do you let into your life? I've told you this story before. I have this with my wife. She drives me crazy with this. It's a rather common occurrence, actually. I remember one very vividly, however, writing with my wife, and I'm beginning to think of something in my mind. And it's a troubling thing. It's an irritating thing. And I'm having a conversation with this person I'm kind of ticked off at in my mind. The thing here you need to remember is as I'm doing this in the car, I'm not saying a word. All of this is going on in my head. So I don't have anything to apologize for yet because I haven't, you know, been exposed. When she says to me, what's wrong? I hate it when she says, what's wrong when something's wrong? And I haven't said anything. How does she do that? Well, as I've said before, women, well, my wife anyway, has this intuitive thing. and she can sense things and see things and sense the temperature change in the room with me. I think it's standard equipment for women. It's not even an option for most men. Yes, it is. But here's the truth about her. She knows me. She knows me. She knows when I'm quiet, and she knows when I'm quiet and there's something wrong quiet. She knows. You know why? partly is because I've let her know me. Who have you let know you? Here's why. Isn't that a nice thing to know each other? No, no, no. If you are in the fire and you are experiencing fatigue and you are experiencing fear that comes with the fire and you are getting confused that comes with the fire, you cannot do it. You cannot do it alone. This is life and death, these values. And what these relationships, if healthy, will help you and me do is remember. Remember that even the fear, failure, and fatigue is all about being formed into the image of Christ. The risk of being misunderstood here, there's times I look at this church, and there's times I feel the weight of it, and there's times I want to run away from it. I just want to run for my life. And then there's other times when I'm thinking more sanely that I realize this church and all the stuff that goes with it, the good and the bad, you know what, it's all just a prop. It's all just a prop. What do you mean? is it insignificant? in some ways it is it's all just a prop to form me and to form you into the image and the character of Christ even the bad stuff it's all about God going oh you want to go away? okay Dave go away go somewhere else and I'll just get you there so I decided to stay it's all about being formed that's the third value or the fourth value I've lost count transformation it's what we're about which brings me back to what I call the fifth value because I just introduced it this week but now it's the first value brings me back to be filled because we're going to do this dependently because to move into embrace and experience what God is calling us to do as a church or as individuals here's the deal beloved you know this to do this we need more than friends I need friends and so do you we need more than friends to do this, to pull this off, to enter into this fully. We need more than good support from other churches and other people. We need more than good psychology. We need more than a compelling vision. We need the supernatural impartation of the Holy Spirit of God with power from on high. Nothing, nothing less than that will do. We don't have a prayer without that, so be filled with the Holy Spirit of God. Because God, beloved, God is not calling us to just be a big church. If that was all he was calling us to be, then maybe we could do it if we were smart enough or strong enough or bright enough or rich enough or organized enough. He is not calling us to be a big church. He is calling us to be a kingdom church, to be a kingdom people, cooperative friends of Jesus, who are more and more reflecting the very character of the king, who move in the authority and the power of the King for the sake of others, whose deepest desire it is to help blind people see and lame people walk and deaf people hear and dead people live again. So Holy Spirit, come, because we can't do any of that. We need your gifts. All of them. All of them we need your gifts. We need your power. We need your fruit, because the only way we can do what God has called us to do as a church in this community, in this city, however then far it's supposed to ripple out by the leading of the Spirit of God among us into the world. It's by the power of that Spirit. So how do we do it? How are we going to do it? We're going to do it dependently. We're going to do it authentically. No religious posing here, okay? Just save it. We're going to do it dependently and authentically in the context of community by the power of the Spirit doing the wonderful works of God in this community, in this city and we're going to do it together. And all God's people said, Amen. Let's stand as we're dismissed. I want to just take a moment to be quiet. And I don't know what the Spirit of God may be saying to you. Maybe he's speaking. The new value that I introduced today was this thing of being filled. And, you know, we're going to do some teaching on this. And you may not even have a good theology of what that means. I think this would be a good thing to do right now. Just in the quietness of your own spirit. You might even say, God, I'm not even sure what it means. I don't have the theological talk around this. But what Dave's talking about, being filled with the Spirit. Fill me with your Spirit. you can do that you don't need a pastor to do that for you you don't need to come forward for this you better not need to you might need this on a street corner someday get it? would you just say that? fill me with your spirit Lord I'm filled with fear I'd rather be full of your spirit Lord I'm filled with fatigue fill me with your spirit Lord I'm filled with lust or fill me with your spirit. I'd rather be filled with your spirit. Spirit of the living God, fall fresh on us. We do acknowledge and declare that you have called us and are calling us to specific things in our community, in our city. And we do declare that we do not have a prayer. Without your life, without your breath, without your gifts, without the impartation of your power, We pray you give it to us day by day by day until our final day. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
