Open your Bibles again this week to Exodus chapter 20. We are entering today our third week of study in the Ten Commandments. For two weeks we have been laying what I think is vital foundation for understanding. Today we begin to dig into the text itself to what we've been calling the ten great words from God for life. Read with me, starting in verse 1, these words. Then God spoke all these words, saying, I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. You shall have no one but me, no other gods, no other lovers. You shall not make for yourself an idol or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth. You shall not worship them or serve them. For I, the Lord, your God, am a jealous God. Stop right there. I'd like to pray. Father, I ask that once again in this service, by the power of your Spirit, you would reveal to us your heart of relentless love that would draw us from our idols, false sources of life. I pray that beyond any word I could speak, you would do this among us. In Jesus' name, amen. That which we are not to do in these six verses is very clear. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make for yourself an idol or any likeness that would diminish or serve as a substitute for me. You shall not worship them. worship them speaks of love, or serve them, serving speaks of devotion. What's not as clear is the variety of ways we do those very things. And no study of this text on idolatry would be complete without some revelation of and examination of the gods that we do have before him. And we will get to that. We need to talk about the sometimes subtle but damaging nonetheless ways that we carve out a redefined and thereby diminished image of God. Doing that is called idolatry. It was interesting, Webster's Dictionary, I looked up this week, defines idolatry as that which has no substance, but it can be seen. I found that interesting in contrast to faith in God, which Hebrews 11 says has substance, but it can't be seen. It struck me that that was part of the appeal that idols have for us, false gods have for us, for even though they're false, we can see them. I like that. We can touch them. We know what to expect from them. In fact, we can control them because we made them. We have taken God and redefined him, thereby diminishing him. It's called idolatry. And so it is I have a God who guarantees my comfort. I have a God who promises me success because that's what I decided he does. and that's what I decided I want. And I have a God that supports my cause and winks at my sin. He sees me when I'm sleeping. He knows when I'm awake. He knows if I've been bad or good, so be good for goodness sake. So God is Santa Claus. I reject that. God is a state trooper, barking out orders, waiting to give me a ticket. I reject that. God is a nice old guy on a porch who wouldn't hurt a fly. I reject that. God is the force. That's kind of cool. We live in a culture that basically says God is whatever or whoever you envision him to be. God, therefore, is a caricature that we have created. The fact is this, a God like that, no intelligent person should ever take seriously. I've been reading an incredible book the last couple of weeks by Donald McCullough called The Trivialization of God. He says this, Visit a church on a Sunday morning. Almost any church will do, and you will likely find a congregation comfortably relating to a deity who fits very nicely into their precise doctrinal positions, who lends almighty support to whatever their cause is, and who conforms to individual spiritual experiences. But in those same churches, the problem is you will probably not find much awe or sense of mystery. Because we've figured God out. We've pared him down to something we can explain and control. It goes on to say the only sweaty palms in most churches are the preachers who's unsure how the sermon's going to go. And the only shaky knees are from the soloist who's about to sing the offertory, Annie Dillard. In her book called Teaching a Stone to Talk, asks this question poignantly, why do people in churches seem like cheerful, brainless tourists on a packaged tour of the absolute? Does anyone have the foggiest idea what sort of power we so casually invoke? Or, as I suspect, does no one believe a word of it? We just kind of go to church. She goes on to say this, churches are like children playing on the floor with their chemistry sets, mixing up a batch of TNT to kill a Sunday morning. It's madness, she says, to wear ladies' straw hats to church. We should be wearing crash helmets. Ushers should issue life preservers and signal flares. They should strap us to our pews for this sleeping God that we've created may wake someday and take offense. she concludes with this we prefer the illusion of a safer deity and so we have pared God down to more manageable proportions doing that is called idolatry and no study of this text would be completed without some examination of the ways in which we have redefined and thereby diminished the image of God but none of that is what drew my attention first in this text for that which captured me first, quite frankly, because it startled me and made me uncomfortable was not just what God says here not to do. Don't make a graven image. Don't have false gods. Don't diminish me. He says all that. What captured my attention, however, first of all, was the energy with which he says it. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God. Jealous. jumped off the page at me. Jealous is something we're not supposed to be. If I was jealous, I'd be in trouble. If someone was jealous toward me, I'd kind of go, hey, back off, give me some space. Kind of possessive, I'm afraid. His jealousy here is what's driving the prohibition against idolatry and diminishing our understanding of who he really is, thereby diminishing our relating to him. Because if we have a smaller image of him, it's not going to require too much. Put on hold for just a moment the ways you've experienced the effects of jealousy towards you as being what jealousy is, petty, needy, insecure, and self-centered. And understand that the choice of this particular word in this text reveals to us something of the heart of God the character of God, the true image of God, and how it is that he has chosen to know us, and how it is this word reveals how it is he's chosen to relate to us, and this word reveals why it is that idolatry is so damaging. For by the choice of this word, God discloses to us this about himself toward us. I am not only your creator. I am your creator, but I am not only that. I am not only your redeemer. I am not only your deliverer, your healer, or provider. I want you to know that I am also your lover. Thus, the jealousy. That's where jealousy comes from. A lover with very strong feelings about you. For not only did I create you, but from before the foundation of the earth, I have been pursuing you. And that pursuit by God of us is recorded in Exodus chapter 3 in our story, verse 7. When God came to Moses and said, I saw your affliction, I heard your cry, so I have come down. The God who by a word of his power created this world is pursuing his people. In chapter 20, verse 2, where the Ten Commandments unfold. The same spirit of the pursuing lover is there. I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land. I came in and delivered you. I came for you. And then in my wild pursuit of you, says God, I sent my only begotten Son for you to reveal at a level that I had never revealed before my passionate pursuit of you. And that is why when you embrace another, I react. For I am absolutely, says God, incapable of being dispassionate about you. It may be that you can go to church and sit passively and not react at all. And wear your straw hat as Annie Dillard symbolized it. But you need to know that I, the creator of the universe, am incapable of responding to you the same way. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God. What I'm introducing to you is an aspect of the nature of God that some of us would kind of theologically get right and even say is a good thing, but quite frankly are uncomfortable with. The issue of idolatry. confronts, among other things, as I've already said, a redefined and thereby diminished image of God. Try this one on as an accurate definition of the character of God. God as the wild lover. Just try that on. In fact, my sermon title is that today, God the wild lover. I'm okay with God is love. God loves the world. As long as it kind of stays out there, as long as it's kind of what my father used to call an oblong blur, this thing that's just love. Can you feel the love in the room? But when I begin to personalize this and begin to image God as a wild lover, it almost feels undignified, almost sacrilegious, a wild lover. make you uncomfortable i'm a lot more i'm a lot more secure with and comfortable with god as king god is king and i am servant and in that particular role i like it and there's submission and there's good stuff and i really adore the king but basically i can just obey the rules nothing else is required of me this lover thing pulls on deeper things and i i don't know about you, but I start protecting myself right now. A little space would be nice. Just tell me what to do, king, and I'll do it. Give me a list. I'll be a faithful servant, but a lover. Keep that out here. I mean, if God is a pursuing lover who feels passion for me, well, he may want more from me than a phone call twice a week. You know, he may want more than a date on Sunday morning. See you in church, God. I'll be there. I'll meet you there. I'll pick you up. We'll talk on the way. If God is a lover who passionately pursues me, he may want more from me than a walk in the park and a peck on the cheek. And if you really let the image of this, the reality of this metaphor in, it's going to feel dangerous. In fact, if what I'm talking about doesn't feel a little scary, I'm either not saying it well or you're just not hearing me because it's scary. There's something in every one of us that's going to, whoo, to cover up and protect ourselves from someone who comes on as strong as this lover, God. I prefer the illusion of a safer deity. But that illusion is called idolatry. It's what God is confronting in the very first commandments. for we have pared God down to size to a more manageable proportion. Let me say all that a different way. The Word of God employs a wide scale of metaphors to capture the many facets of our relationship with God. If you consider them in ascending order, there's a noticeable breathtaking progression. Down near the bottom, he is the potter, I'm the clay. I like that one. and there are ways in which all God's people need to enter into that metaphor and understand it and when I kind of see myself as the clay and he the potter, my response is submission. Mold me, make me, do what you want with me and that's a very good thing to enter into. Up a notch from that he is the shepherd, I am the sheep. This is a better position on the food chain but it's still not very flattering. Sheep are neither graceful nor intelligent. Up from there he is master, I am servant. I've already kind of alluded to this one. This one is far better than clay and sheep. At least I'm in the house now. We're past a lifeless lump of clay and a dumb animal. Please understand me. In this particular metaphor, there is nobility. And every one of us have been called to see ourselves as servants, him the master. And every one of you in your spiritual pilgrimage will probably need to come to a place. or already have where you have bent your knee to your sovereign king. We've talked about that a lot around here, where we submit to God who is the king. He's the king, I am not. He's the master, I'm the servant. And when you enter into that level of walk with God, there is great joy in that. I mean, you could sing songs about being the servant of God, the bond slave of God, with tears streaming down your cheeks. It's coming out of a heart of love. But the fact is this, as a servant only, if you just stick with what a servant is, you still got to feel a little bit like this isn't my house. You better wipe your feet. Don't talk too much and don't talk too loud. Many Christians never get past this place. This is a very important place to get, but some never get past it. Some have never heard that they need to. The reason we never get past it, I think, is we're comfortable with this particular metaphor because if all I am is a servant, as I've already said, then my role is clear. I just do what I'm told. I obey orders. I do the list. I kind of clean the house and leave and hope he liked my work. And again, it comes out of a heart of love. I hope he liked my work. I did it for him. I really did do it for him. But the ladder of metaphors is about to take a quick ascent. for past clay and sheep and servants. We are called his children, and he is our Abba. And many of you I know have entered into deeper dimensions of your walk with God as you have let this metaphor in. Having had for years a very difficult time relating to God on any intimate level because of a relationship you possibly had with your physical mother or father, this whole concept of God as Abba has been life-changing for you. And you have even gone into a season, vitally important season in your spiritual pilgrimage, where you have allowed your Abba literally to reparent you. Incredibly important. And you're past being a servant here. You're a child. You're a son. You're a daughter. No longer is there any doubt that this is your house. You belong. You see, love is not something that the clay and the potter share. And the sheep might hear and discern the master's or the shepherd's voice. But I'll tell you what, there isn't a sheep who knows the shepherd's heart. Sheep don't know that. They might know the voice and they might follow. And that's an important metaphor again. They don't know the master's heart. They might enjoy the fruits of his kindness. And the master, if you're a servant, might like you. And the master might even love you. But you know what? If you're a servant, all the master really owes you is to pay you. But as a son, as a daughter, I have access. All of a sudden, I matter. But it ascends even from there. For now, I call you friend. Friendship levels the playing field in a way that even family doesn't, at least not until the kids have grown and left the house. Friendship introduces a level of knowing and being known that can even transcend family. I mean, I think you know this How many of you know that it's possible to have friends That you are much closer to than family There are times in the raising of our children When it is incredibly important that I not be their buddy I mean, some parents ruin their parenting with their kids Because they're desperately trying to be their best buddy There are times when your kids do not need that They need you to be their parent what we all hope is that our children grow up to a place where we can move past even that incredible relationship of being a parent who you couldn't love anybody any more than that but you move past that till we actually become friends and your kids grow up and sometimes that happens and sometimes it doesn't but the point is friendship offers more intimacy even than the parent-child thing One day Jesus said to his disciples, now I call you friends. But beloved, the highest and deepest, the most exhilarating, but also keep this in mind, the most frightening metaphor is this. I am the bride, he is the groom. My wife this last week gave to me a book that we have been going through ever since and it's been kind of blowing our circuits and affecting me in wonderful ways and had a significant effect even on what I was able to see in this text this week by John Eldridge. His book is called The Sacred Romance. He put all this this way. The courtship that began with a honeymoon in the garden will culminate in the wedding feast of the Lamb. I will delight in you, God says, as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so I will rejoice in you. The metaphor is a bridegroom and a bride. In Ephesians 1, the Apostle Paul lets us in on a little secret. And I want you to hear the words of the Apostle Paul directed from the Spirit of God directly to you. Let this in this way, personally. You have been more than noticed. Fill your name in there. If I knew your names, I'd say every one of them. You have been more than noticed. You have been pursued from farther than space and longer than time. For God had you in his heart since before the foundations of the world. And that is why he came for you, to woo you, and then to call you to be with him. Not just as clay with a potter. Not just as a sheep with a shepherd, or a servant with a master, or a child with a parent, or even a friend with a peer. But he has called you to be with him as a bride with a groom. Now, the upside of that relationship is obvious. I think it's obvious. It's the romance. There is something incredibly exhilarating about being noticed, about being pursued, about being chosen. If you have experienced that on a human level, at any time, maybe it's gone away, but if you've ever experienced a courtship, you know the exhilaration of being noticed. of being chosen, of being pursued. This is unbelievable. And when you begin to recognize that God is, my term, the wild lover who from before the foundation of the earth has been pursuing his creation, and then you let that lover in, you begin to experience the exhilaration of realizing that for which you have been created. That's the upside. Here's the downside. that God's love as a lover is real. It is not the oblongler. It's not love in the room. God's love as a lover is passionate. It is fully engaged. It is emotionally charged. Therefore, he is incapable of being dispassionate about you. He is wild in his pursuit of his children, and that is why when we embrace another, Idolatry, the reaction is jealous. You may be passive, but he's incapable of being passive toward you. With all that in mind, this picture of a groom and a bride, the marriage thing, the passionate pursuit of a lover, imagine now this, that on your honeymoon, your bride allowed herself to be seduced by a perfect stranger now I don't think that you can even let that in what that would do to your soul I mean what was going on in me what was going on in her that allowed her of all nights on this night to be seduced by somebody she'd never even met let this in that Adam and Eve kicked off their honeymoon with God by sleeping not only with a perfect stranger but with God's worst enemy. I don't think we can let that. I don't... Now, if all God is is the king, and he is the king, but if that's all he is, his response to that will just be, get back here and start obeying the rules. But if he is lover, if he is groom, there is something else going on here. How on earth has God put himself in a position where he could actually experience a broken heart because of us? Eldridge. Once again, in this book I mentioned, the sacred romance puts all of this painfully this way. All of us have had the poignant ecstasies of heart over a love affair that subsequently turned into immobilizing pain and shock when we realized that our lover could actually know us. and still leave us for someone else. But have you ever dated someone and you just knew from the first time you met her that she was the one you wanted to spend your life with? As you laughed and talked and marveled together, you felt your love deep into a heart bond that you knew you never wanted to be free from, only to find one day that the one you loved so deeply and who you thought loved you just as passionately had been dating other people. And to top that off was spending more and more time with your worst enemy. Have you ever been in bed knowing? Have you ever had to lie in bed knowing that she was believing his lies about you and was having sex with him every night? It's kind of a graphic thing to say. Kind of an uncomfortable image. What that is is idolatry. What that is is idolatry. Have you ever called this one, even the day after she'd been with the enemy and asked her if she was ready to return, only to have her tell you that her heart was still captured by your enemy? Have you ever watched your lover's beauty slowly diminish and fade in a haze of alcohol, drugs, occult practices, and even infant sacrifice, until she no longer was recognizable in body or soul? Have you ever loved one such as this so much that you even send your son to talk with her again about your love for her, knowing that he would be killed by her. All this and more, God has endured because of his refusal to stop loving us. End quote. Beloved, God could have given up on this love affair with mankind. He could have resorted to power and demanded our loyalty. He could have given us a spiritual lobotomy that would have taken away our power to reject him, eliminating even the possibility of idolatry. Even now, God could obliterate the enemy and force the allegiance of our heart. But he will not do it. Do you know why? Here's why. Because if he did that, then the love affair that began before the foundation of the earth would be over. And so he calls us from our idols. beloved it is only until we understand God's desire to possess our hearts to have a relationship that even goes beyond king and servant that goes to husband and wife groom and bride his desire to possess our hearts through love rather than power it is only until we understand that that we will ever be able to fathom the depths of his anguish or the fierceness of his jealousy in verse 5 when we respond to the lies and seductions of his enemy. The first word from God for life is born, we need to understand, of a lover's heart. No gods but me. I don't want to share you with anyone. You shall not worship them. speaks of loving them, or serve them speaks of devotion to them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God. For I, the Lord your God, am incapable of being dispassionate about you. And when you embrace another, I will react. We are more than clay that complies. We are more than sheep that follow. We are more than servants who obey, children who belong, friends who agree. God's intent for us from the beginning is this, that we are lovers who know and are fully known. I am my beloved's and he is mine. Here's my question. Are you ready for that? Are you comfortable with that? I am quite convinced that there are people who have been in church all their lives and aren't comfortable at all with that. Much safer. You're the boss, I'm the slave. I'll just keep the rules. This lover thing scares me to death. There are many people who don't know how to open up to this kind of love at any level, human or supernatural. the frightening thing about this I've already said is this if he really is the passionate pursuer of me then I'm not going to be able to hold him at a distance and he's going to maybe want more from me than a date on the weekend and a peck on the cheek let me wrap this up it occurs to me that for anyone to respond positively not just to God but to any lover who comes on this strong and I'm telling you God is coming on real strong and it would be you'd do well to kind of compare it to somebody who kind of came on strong and your reaction would be natural whoa back up for anybody to respond positively to a lover who's coming on this strong two questions would have to be settled for you. The first question would be this. Can I trust him? And number two, is he good? Until I know that, I'll never open up. And until I know that, I'm going to go, I'm going to have other lovers who I can maybe control. In C.S. Lewis' great allegory of kingdom life that some think is just a children's story, imagine how you can think that. It is a children's story, but it's an allegory of kingdom life that is amazing. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Susan, upon discovering that the great Aslan, the son of the great king from across the sea is a lion, becomes afraid. I thought he was a man, said Susan. Is he quite safe? I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion. That you will, dearie. And make no mistake, said Mrs. Beaver. If there's anyone who can appear before Aslan without their knees knocking, they're either braver than most or just plain stupid. Then he isn't safe? Asked Lucy. Safe? Said Mr. Beaver. Didn't you hear what Mrs. Beaver said, who said anything about safe? Of course he isn't safe. But he's good. He is the king, I tell you. By not safe, by the way, it did not mean that Aslan was going to hurt you. But rock your world? He will do that. But push you out of your comfort zone? He will do that. But demand your heart and soul? He will do that. And if you need control, this guy is not safe. There comes a time, beloved, in all of our lives, and if you would even think of your own spiritual pilgrimage, you can identify probably several times that this has come in different ways when God, the wild lover, holds out his hand and asks us to give up all our other lovers to come and live with him alone. Thou shalt have no other gods but me, just me, just me. And do not redefine me, thereby diminishing me. You're going to have to accept me. When God moves on us that way, There is part of us that is irresistibly drawn to that because there is something in this call that instinctively we know is connecting us up for that for which we've been created. But there's also something about this call that is very frightening. And again, I think if you didn't feel a little bit of fear, you probably don't have the right picture. and part of us upon hearing this kind of call would much rather return to something say let's just keep it at a date on the weekend, a peck on the cheek, a little scripture here, a little bible study there, a little service in the middle of the week problem from before the foundation of the earth this has been a love affair and this lover is a consuming fire. Is he safe? Is he safe? Who said anything about safe? But he's good. And until we begin to believe that he is good and he is trustworthy, Even though there's a danger here, because he's going to want it all, until we begin to believe he's good and trustworthy, we will never leave our idols. We'll start identifying them in weeks to come, but this is where we have to begin. I want you to stay seated. I want Mark to come. I'd like to pray. Father, I pray what I prayed at the beginning, that your Spirit would powerfully move on us, pursuing us and revealing to us your heart for us. Calling some people to yourself for the very first time, but calling some people back. What an amazing thing that we can rest in as it relates to your amazing grace who continually receives us back when we've wandered away to other lovers. and false gods that can never give us life.
