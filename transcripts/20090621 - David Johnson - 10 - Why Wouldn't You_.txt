John's Gospel. 1 chapter 14 verse says this John speaking there of Jesus Jesus full of grace and truth because as many of you know one of the primary purposes of the life and ministry of Jesus was to among other things reveal the face of God to reveal who God is, what he is like. Hebrews 1 verse 1 says it this way, that God, after he spoke long ago to the prophets in many portions and in many ways in these last days, has spoken to us or revealed himself to us in his son. And he, that is his son, Jesus, is the radiance of his glory, the exact representation of God's nature. Indeed, Jesus himself said it this way in John 14, 9, that if you've seen and come to know me, you have seen and come to know the Father. And the reason I'm telling you all of that is because today, as we continue our dealings with the parables of Jesus, we're entering into a series of them. Joel mentioned already. Three of them found in Luke 15 designed by Jesus to, among other things, reveal the face of God, the kind of God God is to people who had a very distorted perception of who God is. And among the most familiar of these three parables that we're going to be dealing with today and next week is the story of the prodigal, which I think all of us know is the story of a wayward son, but it's also the story of a wayward father, because God is like a wayward father, but he's also like a desperate woman, according to Jesus, who having lost a silver coin, lights a lamp, sweeps a house, searches carefully until she finds it. So God, on one hand, is like a waiting father, but he's also like a desperately searching mother who will turn the house inside out and upside down to find that which is lost, but it's not coins that God cares about, it's people, and he's the kind of God who would move heaven and earth to find people and greatly rejoice when he does find them like a shepherd, because God is also like a shepherd, who had his sheep that wandered off, and when he finds it, he lays it on its shoulders and brings it all the way home and he does all that rejoicing. Key word, rejoicing. When the coin is found, when the shepherd finds the sheep, when the lost son returns because the sheep of mine was lost, but now it's found. This son of mine was lost, but he's come home. This coin that rolled away has been recovered. Three parables. I think we're fairly familiar with, all designed in different ways to reveal the face of God to reveal who God is and what he's like, but there's more going on here in these parables than that, than just three feel-good lost-and-found stories about a nice little lamb and a coin that rolls away and some kid that got rebellious, because behind the scenes of these three parables, a storm is brewing, tensions are rising, suspicions were growing about Jesus. Suspicions that were in fact the catalysts. They were indeed the real reason Jesus launches into these three parables. Three parables that on the surface of things, quite frankly, look innocuous. Like a bedtime story. You tell your children about a little lamb that wandered away and isn't that nice. More is going on than that. Chapter 5 verse 1 sets the stage, reveals the problem, and the problem is this, that all of the tax gatherers, verse 1, and the sinners were coming to Jesus to listen to him. And this bothered the Pharisees and the scribes, and they began to grumble, thus Joel's song. Because these people didn't just hear Jesus, and he didn't just talk to them. This was the real problem. This man receives these people, these sinners, and he eats with them. Now, most of you know, because we've spoken of this often in the past here at Open Door, the table fellowship in Jesus' day had great significance at a number of levels. Socially, it revealed a kind of rank in the order of things, which is why in Luke 14 we see Jesus at a meal where the leadership of the Pharisees were all jockeying for position and the places of honor at the table. And just a few weeks ago, Jen did a marvelous job unpacking that parable for us, but spiritually as well, table fellowship, who you ate with, had real significance, because to religious Jews in Jesus' day, their vision of the kingdom of God almost always included a great banquet, a fabulous feast, comes out of the prophets. Isaiah says this, speaking of the kingdom of God that is coming for sure by the power of God, Isaiah 25, verse 6, for on this mountain, the Lord will prepare a great feast of rich food, a banquet of aged wines, the best of meats and the finest of wines, and he will swallow up death forever. So whatever else the kingdom of God is to first century Jews, it was a banquet, it was like a great feast. But always the question around these feasts, these banquets surrounding them was this, who belongs and who doesn't, Who's invited and who isn't, who's in and who's out. And those who were most clearly out were sinners. And they had even a broad way of defining sinners. It was people that would have included people that you and I would call sinners. But they would be just unclean people. Sometimes just common people who didn't enter into all the ritual and purification rites of the temple. Indeed, one of the primary ways that you could show how spiritual you were, how clean you were, was how far you stayed from unclean people, all of which gives these three parables much more of an edge because they aren't just three random feel-good, lost-and-found stories about a cute little lamb and a coin that rolled away and a rebellious kid, but they are in fact Jesus' explanation for why he does what he does. It's him explaining why he receives sinners and eats with them. And one of the reasons he does it has to do with the character of God. Because God is the kind of God, says Jesus through these parables, who cares about and relentlessly pursues lost sheep, lost coins, lost kids, which actually raises a question in these parables that you maybe never saw this way before. I never did until this week, that these parables actually are a confrontation because the question they raise to the Pharisees who are grumbling is this. If God is the kind of God who cares about and relentlessly pursues lost sheep, lost coins, lost kids, why don't you? Pharisees and scribes. I understand. Would Jesus be saying in this parable to the Pharisees that you're confused? I understand that you're angry, too, that I receive sinners and eat with them. You're grumbling that I do that, but I'm confused and a little angry, too, as to why you don't receive sinners. And none of what I'm saying right here is explicit in the texts. It's all hidden, though in plain sight, in the parables. For those who have eyes to see and ears to hear the first parable of which of the three begins with this question. As he told him this parable, Luke 15 verse 4, he asks him a question. It's like an innocent enough question. He's telling a story. What man among you, if he had a hundred sheep and lost one of them, does not leave the 99 in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost until he finds it? Who wouldn't do that is kind of what you sense. So at one level, he's just explaining. That's why, you guys, I receive sinners and eat with them as well, because they're like lost sheep. And who wouldn't do that? Who wouldn't go after lost sheep the way he asks this question? He's asking it right to know. Who among you, what man among you wouldn't do what I'm just saying? And the scribes and Pharisees, I suppose, are supposed to say, well, this is kind of what we expect. Oh, oh, now I get it. Yeah, that makes perfect sense what you just said, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus, for your insightful analogy that helps us see and understand why you do this thing that disgusts us, receiving sinners and eating with these people. But they don't say that, and you're all laughing because you know. And part, they don't say that because Jesus, in this analogy, is being very sarcastic, and it's not evident on the surface. Indeed, there's a huge confrontation here, but to hear the confrontation, we need to know a little bit more than maybe we do about shepherds and sheep and what they might do in situations like this. And once again, I'm kind of indebted to this Kenneth Bailey guy that I've been mentioning the last couple of weeks who wrote this book through peasant eyes. A couple of things that kind of help you get the picture and help you kind of feel what Jesus is saying and kind of maybe even feel some of the tension that's being raised when he talks about this little lamb. Well, the first thing is this, that while shepherds in Jesus' day were on, at one level, or on one hand, kind of seen as noble, as long as it was in kind of allegory, because Psalm 23 says, The Lord is my shepherd. Shepherds are good. Shepherds are like the Lord. And in Ezra, in places like Ezekiel, kings and prophets were seen as shepherds of the people. But here's the kicker. In real life, shepherds in Jesus' day, real shepherds were despised. particularly by people well-born it was menial work this being a shepherd that you'd leave to a hireling well beneath the dignity and social standing of any accomplished person you get up even one rung off the bottom don't got to be a shepherd anymore indeed it would create kind of a funny picture in your mind awkward and embarrassing if you saw a dignified person uh maybe someone wearing royal robes like a scribe might or a Pharisee might, wearing royal robes, kind of traipsing out in a pasture somewhere looking for some lonely sheep as if this one little sheep that wandered away mattered to these people because it didn't matter. And if I did, you know, want that sheep found, I'd send you. I ain't going. And it's a picture and a point that is actually accentuated, affirmed, I think, by Jesus' reference to a hundred sheep. Again, I wouldn't have thought of this. This Bailey guy kind of points this stuff out. It's fascinating historically. Most people, if they had sheep at all, might have three to maybe five. A family would maybe have a flock. Is that a flock of sheep? Yeah, yeah, five. But if you have a hundred sheep, it would mean something about you. It would mean you were rich. And if you were rich, here's the spin again, there's absolutely no possible way you're watching the sheep. Let alone look for that lost one. You'd hire some loser. Sorry, you would. Some common person from among the Amharats, from the common people, the people of the land. You'd hire somebody else lower on the social strata to do the dirty work. So when Jesus says in verse 4, what man among you wouldn't go looking for the one? The answer to that question really is none of them would do it. And they knew it. But none of that's explicit in the text. It's all hidden in the parable, but it's hidden in plain sight. And then in verse 5, the picture expands because when he did find this lost sheep, he lays it on his shoulders, and the text says he lays it on his shoulders. What's the word there? Rejoicing. So there's rejoicing. I found it! When he finds it. And then he picks it up and puts it on his shoulders. And when he considers the work he has to bring this thing home, there's rejoicing in the work he has to do to bring the sheep home. The commentaries that I read, very interesting, because they noted that. They said, you need to note there's joy on the part of the shepherd here that Jesus is speaking of in two places. He rejoices when he finds it, but then he rejoices, somehow weird, in the very work he has to do to bring this thing home. And there's a lot of work. Got to put it on its shoulders. Sheep, when they wander away, they lay down and they won't budge. So you have to bring them home. And he goes home rejoicing. What you have here, and I don't want to lose you with theology, but what you have here is literally a prefiguring of the price that Jesus is going to pay to bring people home to the house, if you will. The cross that he would endure, it's a prefiguring that would have been lost on the Pharisees, but I'm quite sure Jesus knew exactly what he was saying when he talked about the joy in finding it, and the joy in putting people, lambs, on his shoulders. And when I put that together, I hear an echo reverberating from among other places, In places like Hebrews 12, 2, where it says it was for joy, who for the joy set before him, he laid us on his shoulders. He endured the cross, despised the shame. In other words, put this together with the parable. Jesus is saying, I am not ashamed to do the dirty work of a lowly shepherd. It is not beneath me to remove my royal robes and go stomping through the mud. And when he brings it home, verse 6, he calls his friends and neighbors saying, Get happy with me. Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost. So what kind of God is God? Well, he's that kind of God. And so is his son, Jesus. In fact, his son, Jesus, is the radiance of God's glory, the exact representation of God's nature, who though he existed in the form of God, Philippians 2 verse 6 he did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped but he emptied himself taking on the form of a bondservant being made in the likeness of men being made in the likeness of a lowly what? shepherd who said yeah I will do the dirty work and no it is not beneath me and yes I'll receive sinners and eat with them as well and I will do it gladly and I know it confuses you and bothers you and even angers you when I do that, scribes and Pharisees, but I gotta tell you, what confuses and bothers and angers me is that you don't. Because I'm telling you, verse 7, still speaking to these grumbling Pharisees, I'm telling you, there is more joy in heaven over one sinner who metanoia, who repents, who turns, who comes back home than over 99 righteous persons who never need repentance or who think they don't. I've said it so often here at Open Door for 28 years. The reason people like this don't get grace is because they don't know they need it. And if you haven't heard the confrontation in this parable yet, maybe I haven't convinced you that that's what this parable is about, then you certainly heard it in this thing I just read because the 99 righteous who need no such repentance, he's being sarcastic, are clearly the people to whom he is directly speaking, the Pharisees and the scribes of verse 2, who are grumbling instead of rejoicing, which is how the real friends of God respond. When sinners get received and lost sheep get found, they get all happy about that. It reminded me a little bit of Jonah. Remember we talked about Jonah last week? We talked about chopping on this tree and how quickly we are to get rid of people and decide about people. Jonah wanted to cut down the Ninevites and God came to Jonah and said, I'm not done with them. I haven't given up on them. I don't want you to give up on them either. Quite frankly, Jonah, I love them. Jonah got mad. Remember how mad Jonah was one of the original grumblers. and, you know. It's just a huge confrontation, this parable where Jesus once again is reversing the order of things such that the lost ones in the parable, which was the lamb who went away, really is the found one, and the righteous ones, who were the 99, and the ones who were grumbling, are really the unrighteous ones, and the good guys, which would be us, Pharisees and scribes are really the bad guys and the ones who are so sure they're in. Because they're among the 99. It's even safe to be among the 99. Are we all here? Yeah, we're all here. Good. Are really out. And then this many and few phrase comes back to mind. Jesus talked about this all the time. There are many and few. And who are the many? Oh, there are these guys. And it even reminds me of Matthew 8, 11, where Jesus said to these same kind of people, and he did this over and over in a variety of ways, and you just can see how people would really get angry, religious people in particular would really get angry because he would say, you guys, you need to know, many will come from the east and the west and sit at the table. There's this table again. And they will be allowed to sit at the table of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, this table that you think you're the only one who's allowed to be at. Many from the east and the west will come and sit at that table, and some of you will be cast out of darkness. How to win friends and influence people. Jesus wrote that book. Want to be my friend? I never go, golly. And see, I think they knew that that's exactly what Jesus meant when he told this story of a cute little lamb. It wasn't a bedtime story for them, and it made them grumble even more until they eventually figured out how to kill him. But he didn't stop with the story of a little lamb. In fact, this next story, you can kind of go, it's just the same thing. No, I think he's actually up in the ante with this next story because God is not just like a lowly shepherd willing to do the dirty work to find the lost sheep. He's also like a crazy woman who, when she loses a silver coin, Let's look at the story. It picks up in verse 8. He asks the same kind of question. Or what woman? He asks, if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin, what woman would not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully to find it? I mean, that's only natural. Who wouldn't do that? And then when she finds it, verse 9, what woman that you know wouldn't call all her friends and neighbors and gather them together saying, Good news, good news, everybody. You can relax and get happy with me. Rejoice, for I have found the coin. What a relief. The whole neighborhood's happy. He's being sarcastic. What woman among you? Fact is, a lot of women, women, women, A lot of women, and she wouldn't go chasing after this coin, and especially wouldn't call the neighbors, I found my coin. Though some would, actually. A peasant woman would, or might. Because though a drachma, and that's the silver coin, it was a drachma, might not be worth much to someone who had lots of drachmas. It would be of some value to her, a peasant woman who doesn't have a lot of drachmas. Indeed, there's some speculation based on history that this coin might have been part of a necklace. It was weird, because in some of the research they did, there was some kind of discrepancy. Some said drachmas, like a drachma today in Greece, they still use it, it's worth about two cents, which is nothing. Maybe it was a dime. There seems to be more value to it than that, but it's not a lot. But one of the things that was fascinating to me was that sometimes, the history was that sometimes people, women in Jesus' day, would make coins as part of a necklace. And the coins were part of her dowry. And a dowry, she would wear it around her neck. And ten drachmas, if she had them strung together, would be her dowry. And what that would be doing would be revealing to the world what her husband paid for her. I know it's a bizarre thought, but that's what her husband paid for her. But it's also saying, this is kind of what I'm worth. And so in the parable, there's kind of a weirdness to the story. Because, oh, I love this necklace of mine. It says I'm worth about a buck, you know, a dollar and a half altogether. Because what it reveals is that she's poor, is that she's a peasant. So it's kind of embarrassing. But if that's true, that it was part of a dowry and a necklace, at least it explains maybe her attachment. It has some sentimental value, if not actual value, but then she calls her friends, okay, and all her neighbors to declare to them the wonderful news that she found a coin that means nothing to them, as if to say, doesn't this just make your day? No. Let me frame it like this. You ever lost a child? some of your moms know about this and you become a crazy woman I become a crazy man I mean you've been in a maybe a shopping mall maybe you've lost your child displaced them for you know you're just walking along and you turn them in and they're gone and you go crazy the kind of crazy sweeping looking turning over call my friends call the cops I remember this was years ago obviously Caleb was in diapers Bonnie was with a whole group of women and all of their kids and it's like you know they were all just kind of together when in just kind of everybody being together, Caleb wandered off. And all of a sudden they noticed, and they went crazy looking for Caleb. He actually walked down the block. Someone saw him call child protection. Bonnie went to child protection, and we had to prove that we weren't abusive parents. It was a wonderful experience. But she was like a crazy woman looking for this boy. And when she found him, she called the whole neighborhood. get happy with me. I found this crazy kid. Here's the picture. This woman is treating this coin almost as if it had the value of a child, which is crazy. I mean, if this woman had kids, particularly teenage kids, they would be so embarrassed. They would kind of go, Mom, Mom, Mom. Okay, you found the coin? Good. I'm glad you found the coin. Don't call the neighbors. They won't care. This is crazy, Mom. You look like a fool. So what kind of God has God? Well, it turns out he's like a lowly shepherd who doesn't mind taking off his royal robes to go stomping through the mud after a stupid lamb that lost its way. That work is not beneath. him and he's like a crazy woman who would move heaven and earth to find someone or something that most would find little value in and all of that is why I receive sinners. Can you hear this edge? And all of that is why I receive sinners and I eat with them too. And I know it bothers you that I do that. It confuses even angers you when I do that because you're grumbling, but you know what bothers me and confuses me and really angers me? It's that you don't receive sinners and eat with them. And you don't see the value of lost coins or sheep or rejoice when they're found. So don't tell me you know God because I have come to reveal the face of God and you don't look anything like him. You think it's a bedtime story still? A little side note about lost sheep and lost coins. Because when they get lost, I love this, it's not because they're rebellious or angry or defiant. I hate you. The lamb, right. It's goofy. The son in the third parable, which we'll talk about next week, is kind of like that. He's rebellious. And it's interesting because the father in that parable takes a different track with him altogether, doesn't pursue him, he lets him go. We'll talk about that next week. But a sheep, when a sheep gets lost, they just wander. They get distracted. They pick up the scent of something that maybe smells good. Sounds kind of like you and me, doesn't it? It wasn't like, I'm leaving home. I hate God. No, I love God. I never want to leave home. but whoa, that smells good. I'm serious. That's how sheep gets lost. That's how we get lost sometimes as well and you end up going the wrong direction and you don't even know you're going the wrong direction but you're further and further from home and all of a sudden you look up and wonder, how did I get here? This is not where I want to be. This is not how I want to live and some of you, quite frankly, are lost that way right now, here. And you're wondering that very thing. how'd I get here? And can I get home? And I don't know, maybe for some of you, coming to church this morning was your first step, you know, maybe I, maybe that would help me find my way. But now consider a coin, because this is where he ups the ante. This is, I just love this. See, the sheep maybe got distracted, but a coin, think about it literally, has no volition at all. I mean, the coin had nothing to do with its getting lost. Are you saying it's not responsible? That's exactly what I'm saying. It's not responsible for the fact that it's lost. If you connect that with people, some of you are getting nervous. Here's what happened to the coin. It just fell through the cracks. And if someone, quite frankly, doesn't start sweeping and doesn't start looking, searching carefully, this coin and these coins will never be found because unlike the sheep that can at least go here I am, help me the coin can't even do that if we're going to be literal about it it just sits there and in some sense doesn't even know it's lost never rejected God has no concept of God these beloved lost coins if you get a picture in your mind I'll try to help you with that are the least of the least they are the most lost of the lost they are disposable people who fall through the cracks in Jesus' day they were the sick and the lame they were the lepers remember we did behold a leper came to Jesus and what was amazing about that was that Jesus touched him because lepers and sick and lame people were cast to the side just get out of the way in my mind as I was trying to think of what do the lost coins look like today? I don't, unpleasant picture, but we see these things on CNN sometimes or on some national or worldwide kind of news broadcast of children starving into the Sudan. And you've seen the pictures of some emaciated little child with flies crawling up in their nose and the mom not knowing what to do and just sitting there looking like death, their lost coins. They're not mad at God. They don't have a concept of God. Neither does their mom. they're mentally challenged people and there are some wonderful ways in which mentally challenged people can know God but there are cognitive things that just don't connect and they can easily fall through the cracks and it kind of makes you want to pick up a broom doesn't it? and all of that is why says Jesus in these parables I receive sinners and I eat with them too and it's why I touch lepers too because I'm like this crazy woman who is sweeping the floor looking for this coin that no one seems to value, but I ain't going to stop until I find it. And I know it bothers you that I do that. But you know it bothers me that you don't. Says Jesus to these Pharisees and scribes. I was listening to a CD this week. It's fascinating. Of a sermon by a guy named Clarence Jordan. That name ring a bell for some of you. He wrote years ago. I think it was in the 60s, a book called The Cotton Patch Gospels. And if you don't remember his name, maybe you'll remember that. He was a preacher in the deep south, and he just had a prophetic voice and spoke in the context of great legalism in the Southern Baptist Church, but also a racial tension. He just spoke the kingdom of God in ways that were way beyond what many other people were saying at the time. And as I was listening to this CD of his, because I just pull a resources parable, I'm listening to that, I'm going to read it. Anyway, he just went off on this parable. And actually, particularly the part about this sweeping woman who kept on sweeping. And he kind of went off like this and said, this is what he kind of focused in on. So how long did she sweep till she wears out her broom? No, till the batteries in her flashlight go out? No, it says she sweeps. She sweeps until she finds the coin. How long is that? As long as necessary, is what he said. yeah yeah but then in the middle of i'm getting all looks like you i was going yeah yeah yeah that's good and and and right then he crossed the line because he then suggested that god keeps on sweeping even after death because he's just crazy and I just kind of went whoa whoa whoa whoa stop right there stop right there but before I could stop him completely I got this picture in my mind of lost ones of lost coins and I pictured a starving child in Sudan with flies crawling up in their nose and mentally handicapped adults or children who have no capacity to hear or to know their lost coins, but they're going to hell. And then I just listened to this guy and I started wondering, what if, but what if, what if, just what if when they die, the first thing they actually see is this crazy woman. What if the first thing they actually see is this crazy woman sweeping the floor who's been looking for them, and when she sees them, she shouts, there you are. I've been looking for you. Now, I don't know if it's going to look like that. My theology, I got a box, I can't get out of here. But if it did look like that, would you rejoice? Or would you grumble? Doesn't it tell you? Well, either way, rejoice or grumble, it kind of tells you where you are in the parable. So where are you in the parables? Because some of you are the lost sheep. Who've wandered far from home. You don't hate God. But because you wandered away, you're pretty sure God hates you. Well, I'm here to tell you, He doesn't hate you. In fact, he's looking for you. He's looking for you. A little advice if that's who you are today. Just a little advice. Make a little noise this morning. Just kind of, bah. You know what that means? That means after the service, we're going to have some people here who will pray for you. So come for prayer. And they will help bring you home. And while some of you may be like the scribes and Pharisees in this story, grumbling, truth is, I don't know. I think there might be some, but not many. Not here. We kind of have a way of running those people off eventually. I don't know. Sounds mean, doesn't it? Yeah. But if you are grumbling, Pharisee, that way, about this kind of thing, I just want to, actually I want to be kind to you here and say you don't have to be that way. You don't. So come join us. Why don't you just join us and pick up a broom? Which is actually how some of you are responding. When you hear this stuff and put it all together, there's something in your heart that rises and says, oh, I just want to pick up a broom. I want to start sweeping and looking. In fact, I want to spend the rest of my life figuring out where these lost coins are and find them. Because if we don't go looking for them, they won't be found. Still others, I think, might be feeling, I don't know, joy. And maybe not know why. well I think if you're feeling joy at this talk maybe here's why because among other things these parables tell us about what kind of God we have because we have a God who like a lowly shepherd doesn't mind doing the dirty work doesn't mind taking off his royal robes and traipsing through the mud to bring us home That work is not beneath our God. And we have a God who's like a crazy woman who just won't stop sweeping and she won't give up looking and searching. And all of that is why, says Jesus in these parables to the grumbling Pharisees and scribes, all of that is why I receive sinners and I'm going to keep on doing it. And it's why I eat with them as well and I know it bothers you that I do, but you know what bothers me? It bothers me that you don't. And he who has ears to hear, let him hear what the Spirit is saying to the church. Would you stand with me as we close? Lord I feel many things as I think we all do but I do feel grateful that you're like a waiting father and you're like a lowly shepherd and you're like a crazy woman who just won't give up on your lost creation and help us God this is so big to me to be part of what you're doing. Because that's your call, that we would become ourselves like lowly shepherds and crazy women and waiting fathers, that we would take that on ourselves. I pray that be true and more and more true among us as we continue to learn what it means to follow you. Our Lord and Savior, our Rabbi too, and all God's people said, amen. God bless you as you leave. You're dismissed. You can come for prayer if you need it.
