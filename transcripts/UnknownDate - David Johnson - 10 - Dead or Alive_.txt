Father, I thank you for the moving of your spirit already among us in the context of our worship and the sense of your presence. Pray now that as we move to the word, the proclamation of the word, that the power of your spirit would continue to be strong and even grow, particularly in the capacity of your spirit through the word to call people to a new way to live, to call people to life from slumber to an awakening, an awareness from death to life. I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Open your Bibles with me to Matthew's Gospel. If you have your Bibles, to the ninth chapter, beginning in the 18th verse, where in the broader context of what we have been calling for quite some time now, a journey with the Holy Spirit, we've been examining the gifts of the Holy Spirit, particularly the gifts of healing. Today, actually, is our 10th installment on examining the gift of healing. With most of what we're learning about healing, coming from this gospel, Matthew's gospel, the 8th and 9th chapters, where we've been examining the healing ministry of Jesus, believing that by that we can learn a lot about healing and the kingdom of God. Today we come to what I would consider the ultimate kind of healing, and therefore making it kind of appropriate to wrap the teaching on healing up with this, from death to life kind of healing. I think the ultimate kind. Let's read Matthew 9, beginning verse 18. While he that is Jesus was saying these things to them, behold, there came a synagogue official, and he bowed down before Jesus saying, my daughter has just died. From the account in Mark, we know that this little girl was 12 years old. My little 12-year-old daughter has died. Come now, lay your hand on her and she will live. And Jesus rose and began to follow him and so did his disciples, verse 23. When Jesus came into the official's house and saw the flute players in the crowd in noisy disorder making a ruckus in their morning, he began to say, get out of here. That's my paraphrase. Depart. Sounds much more spiritual than he says it, doesn't it? Depart. For the girl has not died, but is asleep. And they began laughing at him. But when the crowd had been put out, he entered and took her by the hand. And the little girl, Rose, Mark 5, 41, adds this, that he took her by the hand and said to her, Talitha Kuma, little girl, arise. And she arose. She came to life. She was, to use the sleeping possibility, she was awakened in some way with these words from Jesus, Talitha Kuma. She heard the voice of God calling her to life. I think it's fitting that we conclude our series on healing with this death to life healing because it affirms, among other things, that Jesus has authority on earth to move in this arena of life as well. Remember that? Early on in this series, we were careful to point out that all of Jesus' healing miracles demonstrated, among other things, that Jesus has authority on earth to move in these different arenas of life. So when in Matthew chapter 8, the healings began, and he healed a leper, then a centurion's slave, and then the woman taken with fever demonstrated, again, among other things, that Jesus had authority on earth to move in the physical arena of life to heal physical disease, but he heals spiritually as well. And that's why when they brought to him the paralytic in Matthew 9, verse 6, the first thing he did, the first thing he did was forgive his sin, saying this, in order that you might know I have authority on earth. There's that phrase, authority on earth to forgive sin, to do the kind of thing that's even bigger than physical healing, to bring to you the kind of healing you need even more desperately than physical healing. In order that you might know I have authority to do that, I will heal you physically as well. Rise, take up your bed, and walk. The point is this, it's not just physical healing that we need. It's spiritual. And I have authority on earth, says Jesus, through these miracles to move in that arena as well. So when he comes to this little girl and says in Matthew 9, 25 and Mark 5, 41, arise, little girl, Talitha Kuma, he is saying, among other things. I have authority in this arena of life as well. I have authority over death. And while that little girl, in terms of her physical life, did eventually die again, grew old, I'm sure, and died, we have no reports of her walking around anywhere, the message in that miracle is undeniable and it is intentional. For in the miracle, Jesus is making this statement and we need to hear the statement. It's this. I have come to break the power of sin and death. I have come to undo what Satan does. And what Satan does is at least three things. Steal, kill, and destroy. For I have come that you might have life. John 10, 10, so that all who believe in me, so that all who put their hope in me and choose to follow me will come to life eternally. Little girl, rise. To late, to kuma. Little girl, wake up. Physically, eternally, life. Eternal life. Right here at Open Door, over the last couple of years, we've been careful to refer to it when we were referred to eternal life and the offer of the kingdom that brings eternal life. We've been careful to refer to it as an eternal kind of life that people can enter into and experience right here, right now. In other words, eternal life isn't something that just kicks in when you physically die. It's not just the promise of heaven when you die. It is, in fact, the ability by God's grace and power to be awakened, The ability by God's grace and power to come to life, and by that coming to life and awakening, to enter into an entirely different kind of life, an eternal kind of life right here, right now. Which means, among other things, that there's more than one way to be alive and to be dead. Just like there's more than one way to be sick and to need healing, which is one of the points we made all through this healing ministry of Jesus thing. You can be physically sick, and Jesus can move in that arena, but you can be sin sick as well. In like manner, you can be physically dead or physically alive. In the story, the little girl was physically dead and became physically alive. You can be physically asleep or physically awake, but you can also be spiritually dead or alive, spiritually asleep or awake. The apostle Paul in Ephesians 2 says this very thing, and the analogy is real clear. It's not under the surface or hidden in any way. It speaks of people who were dead in their transgressions and in their sins. It's clear he's speaking there of a spiritual kind of death. But God, he says in Ephesians 2 verse 5, because of the great love with which he loved us, has made us alive together with Christ. In Ephesians 5.14, he says this, Awaken sleeper. Awaken sleeper. Remember, Jesus said, this girl is just asleep physically. Paul is saying in Ephesians 5.14, there's more than one way to be asleep. So awaken sleeper. Arise from the dead. Interesting, he mixes the metaphors of sleep and death in one verse. Awake, you sleepers. Rise from the dead because there's more than one way to be asleep. There's more than one way to be dead and need to be raised and need to be awakened. Let me tell you where I'm going with this. So hopefully you can go there with me. It would be a bad thing for me to go off somewhere and for you not to come. When Jesus raised this little girl, either from the dead or from a coma-like sleep, it was a really big deal. Verse 26 of Matthew 9 says that the news went out into all the land of this resurrection, but much like many of his other healings that we've been studying over the last several weeks, this healing was pointing to a much bigger deal, a much deeper truth that was and is in fact central to the gospel of the kingdom that Jesus came to proclaim, it's this, that it is possible for ordinary people in the story embodied in the life of a 12-year-old girl, ordinary people like 12-year-old girls, it is possible for ordinary people like you and me who are spiritually dead to come spiritually alive, who are spiritually asleep to come spiritually, to become spiritually awakened. And that when they are raised to what Paul calls newness of life, in Romans 6 verse 4, they enter into, by that newness of life, by that resurrection into life, by that awakening from slumber, they enter into a different kind of life, an alive-to-God kind of life, an eternal kind of life right here, right now, a different kind of life where you're able to see things you couldn't see, hear things, you couldn't hear, smell things spiritually, enter into realities of life you never even knew existed because you have come to life, a different kind of life, an eternal kind of life that will indeed result in heaven when you die, but it's a life you enter into right here, right now. That's what we mean here at Open Door by an eternal kind of life, not just heaven when you die kind of life. Now, we've talked about this before in different contexts and ways. I want to do it again this morning using this story of this little girl as an excuse to do it because I have a concern. I've shared it before. It doesn't go away. Maybe it never will. So we'll constantly be coming back to this story in a variety of ways. I'm sure my concern is this, that if you were to go into many churches today, I'm not picking on any church in particular, but just many churches today, and ask this question. It's a pretty fundamental question. What is the central message of the gospel of the kingdom that Jesus came to proclaim? I'm not convinced that you'd hear a whole lot of people talk about a different kind of life an alive to God kind of life, an eternal kind of life made possible by dead people coming alive, by sleeping people being awakened. More likely, and particularly more likely if you grew up in my faith tradition, and maybe that even explains why I have some energy around this, because in my faith tradition, more likely what you would hear if you were asked a question, what's the fundamental message of the gospel, you would hear a list of the minimal things you had to believe, give mental assent to, to get into heaven when you die. It was always about making sure you did what you had to do or gave assent to what you had to give assent to in order to go to heaven when you die. Indeed, many of the evangelical methods that we use that were used on me even as a little kid were about scaring the hell out of people so that they would make sure they went to heaven when you die. And I even remember going to camp where the whole thing was, the leader at the end of camp would go, we had 59 people, kids, except Jesus this week. In fact, they only had 40 kids in the camp because several did it several times. Because you tell them you're going to hell, but if you believe this or sign this card, you'll go to heaven. Sign me up. And the list, and just kind of give assent to this. Listen, the list would probably include something like this. And what's on the list is not bad stuff. It's just that we reduced it all to that. What was on the list often would be something like this, that Jesus died on the cross, that he rose from the dead to forgive you of your sin. And if you believe that, if you give mental assent today, I believe he really did that, that those things are true, we declare you to be saved, again, primarily from hell. You go to heaven when you die. And if you reduce that down and really think about it, what that means is this, that the gospel of the kingdom is actually a deal. Here's the deal. You say the magic words, I believe Jesus died for my sins. God waves a magic wand, you go to heaven when you die. It's a great deal. Doesn't necessarily have a lot of life. Story I've used in the past to try to illustrate this so you kind of know what I'm talking about. if I've already lost you here, maybe this little parable will help you. It's from a movie that's not terribly deep theologically, but it illustrates my point quite well. Again, I've shared it with you before. Again, one of my favorite movies, Monty Python and the Holy Grail. In the scene I have in mind, in the scene I have in mind, Arthur and his knights are on a quest for the Holy Grail. To find the Holy Grail, I have to get to the castle, but between them and the castle is a huge abyss. Not sure what an abyss is, but it's scary. It's a big canyon. You can't even see the bottom. You don't want to go there, trust me. With a rickety old bridge as the only way across into the castle across this abyss. Standing at the entrance to the bridge is a gatekeeper guarding the entrance. To cross the bridge, you have to answer three questions or you'll be thrown into the abyss. And in the movie, it's hysterical because you're not just thrown into the abyss. It's almost that you're a catapult. and they get thrown into the abyss. Now, my brother Mike is able to do this verbatim, and he actually has an English accent. I'm not going to try to do any of that, because every time I do an accent of anybody, he sounds like an Indian man, but he didn't think very much. So I don't want to do that. Even my Irish guy sounds like that. He didn't think very much. I'm kidding. Anyway, so he won't do that. I'm just telling you the story. Got to get the answers right. First nights. very nervous, takes his place before the gatekeeper's first question is this, what's your name? he states his name, second question, what's your quest? he states his quest, the holy grail third question, what's your favorite color? red thank you very much, he gets to cross over the abyss on the bridge into the castle, second night quite relieved, this isn't going to be as hard as I thought, he takes his place what's your name? he states his name, what's your quest? he states his quest, third question what's the capital of Assyria? I don't know. Thrown. No. Catapulted into the abyss. Ah! It's just hysterical. Third night is terrified. Terrified. No idea what to expect. What's your name? He states his name. What's your quest? He states his quest. The Holy Grail. What's your favorite color? Red. No blue. Catapulted into the abyss. Finally, Arthur comes, same thing. What's your name? He states his name. I'm Arthur, the king of the Brits. What's your quest? He states his quest to pursue the Holy Grail. Third question. What's the airspeed velocity of a coconut-laden swallow? That depends, says Arthur. Is it an African swallow or a European swallow? Gatekeeper goes, well, I don't know. And he catapulted into the abyss. And all of you are wondering, what on this earth does this have to do with this sermon? Nothing. I just tell this story about every three years. I just like it. Now, here's the point. There's a great point to this. Some of you are already connected to that. That the understanding a lot of people have about the gospel, the good news of the kingdom of God, It's a lot like that. That when you die, you kind of come to a gate with a gatekeeper. And the gatekeeper will ask you a question. Why should I let you into God's heaven? And what you need at that point, according to this theology that kind of has it right but doesn't, what you need at that point is the right answer. And if you have the right answer, and here's the right answer, Jesus died on the cross to forgive me of my sin, then you get to go in and not be thrown into the abyss. Now the problem with that, among many problems, is this, that there are numbers of people, I'm afraid, who have in their heads the right answers. Like the Pharisees, they know the Scriptures. They search the Scriptures, Jesus says in John 5, 39, thinking that by what they know in their head about the Scriptures and even about God, they think that by what they know they have eternal life. But they have no life. They are spiritually dead. What they needed was not more information. What they needed was a resurrection. When Paul says in Ephesians 2 verse 1, you were dead in your transgressions and in your sins, what that means among other things is this, that you needed more than forgiveness. You are more than a sinner who needed forgiveness. You're a dead person who needs a resurrection. you would at some point need to hear the voice of God say to you, Talitha Kuma, come to life. Awaken from your slumber. So resurrection is what's needed, and an awakening into a different kind of life, into an alive-to-God kind of life right here, right now. It's weird when I think about this kind of dynamic, life and death and who's alive and who isn't and how can you tell and if it's not just about having the right answer what else is involved what's what's odd about all of that's mixed to me is that quite often religious religious people are the most dead now that's a weird thing to say how can you be more dead than someone else well let's switch it from death and life to sleeping sometimes it's religious people who are in the deepest kind of sleep. And the reason is because they think they're awake. And if you think you're awake, you're not even listening for maybe something more. In fact, Jesus said that very thing, that very kind of thing to a group of religious people who, and what he said to them was essentially this, the real problem is that you say you see. We see. We are the seers. And then he said this most incredible thing. He said, if your light is dark, how dark is your darkness? Wow. If you're awake, is really asleep, how dead is your death? You know, whenever the disciples were getting too much up in their head. He would take a child and put the little child in front of them, and he would say these outrageous things to them. I just had to drive him crazy, I'm sure. But he put a child in there and said, unless you become like this child, you won't enter into the kingdom of heaven. And the disciples always said something brilliant like, what? And Jesus didn't always explain what he meant. He would just go on and confound them, and hopefully some of those things awaken them. Jesus spoke of children often And used them often It's a funny thing about a child Instinctively Instinctively Little children spot life I mean just picture A little kid A little kid Walking into a room with people Maybe people They don't know And you know where that little child Is going to go eventually No Where do I go They're going to look at They're going to find somebody's face That has some life They're going to find somebody Who's got some life And they will move to the life They'll move to the life Instinctively they spot this life But there's somebody over there And they have all the right answers and they know the Bible backwards, but they just don't. And they move over here where there's life. We talk about conversion, about converting people, which often seems to mean converting them from their way of thinking to my way of thinking and that's why we have to always, you know, kind of make sure we have the right answers and argue people into the kingdom. It's how we think it works sometimes. How would it change if you realized that while there are some things you need to change your mind about relative to what you think is true and who God is and all of those things are involved, but how would it change if you realized that it was really a lot more about coming to life? I mean, if you realize that, it might even make you wonder if you're alive. Before I go convert everyone, do I have life or just a bunch of right answers? Matthew 23, 15, Jesus said to the scribes and Pharisees, you travel about on sea and land to make one proselyte, to make a convert. But when you make a convert, you make a convert to your way of thinking, and what you end up doing is making him twice as much a son of hell as yourself. He just got in so much trouble. I would never talk like that. I'm just quoting him here. Why did he say that? Well, I wonder if it's because they had no life. They were just converting them to their set of beliefs, their religious practice. Let me give you another illustration here from another movie. This is Sunday morning at the movies. To help me make this point, and the movie this time is, Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou? The setup is this. The movie is actually an updated and quite quirky version of Homer's Odyssey. The three main characters have escaped to chain gang prison, So now they're on the run from the law, kind of trying to just stay ahead of the law there. And they come upon a large group of people being baptized in the river. That's all you need to know as you watch this clip. Take a look. Oh, mothers, let's go down. Come on down, don't you want to go down? Come on, mothers, let's go down. Well, I guess hard times flush the chump. Everybody's looking for answers. Enjoy them. Where'd he go? Delmar's been saved. Well, that's it, boys. I've been redeemed. The preacher done washed away all my sins and transgressions. It's a straight and narrow from here on out. And heaven everlasting's my reward. Delmer, what are you talking about? We got bigger fish to fry. The preacher said all my sins is washed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo. I thought you said you was innocent in those charges. Well, I was lying. And the preacher said that that sin's been washed away, too. too. Neither God nor man's got nothing on me now. Come on in, boys. The water is fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember when I first saw that scene in that movie years ago of them mocking baptism, which is what they're doing, in case you didn't know. I thought, when I first saw the scene, I thought, those guys have been to church. Who wrote that movie? Those guys have been to church. And I don't know for sure, but it's likely that what they heard when they went to church was a message that said something like this. If you know the right answer, you'll go to heaven when you die. If you participate in some religious localism, you'll be saved. And heaven after actors, you're the Lord. Anyway. I think they thought that was a bunch of baloney when they were little kids going to church. and now they're making it look as empty as they think it is in this movie. Now, I don't want to get lost in exegeting this movie, but here's the deal about Delmar. He's the goofy guy being baptized. And the deal is pretty obvious, actually. He has no understanding of what baptism means or points to, a death-to-life reality. And because of that, he has no desire or intention to come under the rule or reign of God, to put his confidence in Jesus so that he could, in fact, awaken from his slumber, come alive to God, thereby stepping into an entirely different kind of life, an eternal kind of life, right here, right now. That's why, that's why what he's doing looks so ludicrous. Because it has no meaning. Separated from the reality of life, having come to him. In Matthew 3, some Pharisees show up at John the Baptist's baptizing, wanting to get in on the latest religious trend. And John says this to them, and I'm reading from the Message Bible here, just like Bob McKenna did last week when he read this very same text when he was dealing with the issue of baptism. John says this to these Pharisees, You brood of vipers. What do you think you're doing slithering down here to the river? Do you think that a little water on your snake skins, a little religious ceremony, is going to make any difference? It's your life that must change, not your skin. I'm baptizing people here who want to turn in their old life for a new life. And this is where I just add to that. For an alive to God life. For an awakened from your slumber life. For an eternal kind of life right here, right now. To Letha Kuma. Little girl, arise. Little boy, young man, young woman, wake up. The psalmist says, if you hear God's voice, today if you hear God's voice, don't harden your heart. I would spin that this way for this morning. Today, if you would hear God's voice, Talitha Kuma, wake up. Don't roll over and go back to sleep. you can you know when you hear God's voice calling you out of the fog of your spiritual sleep you can roll over go back to sleep don't do it this morning this morning don't do it keep listening Mark 1 15 says this my paraphrase this time the preliminaries have all been taken care of the time is fulfilled so the kingdom of God is now accessible to everyone. Review your plans for living, meaning repent. Wake up. Don't roll over and go back to sleep. Base your life on this remarkable opportunity to enter into a different kind of life, an alive-to-God life, an eternal kind of life, wherein you will be awake, aware, right here, right now, to Lathakuma. Little girl, arise. Little girl, wake up. I love Todd Hunter's illustration where he explains that we have, where he explains where we all have a different kind of life. I think he gave this when he was here with Dallas Willard some time ago, and he explains it this way. Every human being has a kind of life. In fact, even plants have a kind of life. They are alive to certain things are plants. They are alive. Plants are to the humidity in the air. They are alive to the sun. They respond to nutrients in the soil. Animals have a kind of life as well. They are alive to certain things. If we had a little kitten up on the stage here, I would get rid of it as fast as I could. But if we did, because I hate cats, but if we had a little kitten up on the stage here and I had a little bouncing ball, what would the kitten do? He would be chasing the little bouncing ball. What would the plant do? It was a stupid question. The plant would do nothing to the bouncing ball because the plant is not alive to that kind of life. It doesn't have that kind of life. It's balls. Imagine if we brought a little 10-year-old kid up onto the stage and did flashcards with math problems. Four plus four is eight. Eight plus eight is 16. And we showed the flashcards to the kitten. What would the kitten do? Nothing. Because a kitten is not alive. Doesn't have that kind of life. I love that illustration. It's so easy to connect the dots. See, the reason some people don't respond to God is because they are dead to that kind of life. They're asleep to that kind of reality. and so the voice of God today is saying to some of you and I hope you can hear it in the middle of what may be the fog of sleep to Lathakuma to Lathakuma don't roll over and go back to sleep keep listening keep listening hear now the good news of the kingdom of God hear now the gospel of God is recorded in John 5, again reading from the message beginning in verse 19. I'm telling you this straight. The Father loves the Son and includes him in everything he's doing, but you haven't seen the half of it yet. For in the same way that the Father raises the dead and creates life, so does the Son. Indeed, the Son, that is Jesus, gives life to anyone who wants it. Neither he nor the Father shuts anyone out. It's urgent that you listen carefully to this, especially if you're hearing it through the fog of sleep. It's urgent that you listen to this as best you can. Anyone here in this room who believes what I am saying right now and aligns himself with the Father, who has in fact put me in charge, has at this very moment, has at this very moment, the real lasting life and is no longer condemned to be an outsider. This person, in fact, has taken a giant step from the world of the dead to the world of the living. It's urgent, again, it's urgent that you get this right. For the time has arrived, and I mean right now, when dead men and dead women will hear the voice of God. And hearing it will come to life. Talitha Kuma. Little girl, arise. Little girl, wake up. Today, if you hear God's voice, don't harden your heart. Today, if you hear God's voice, don't roll over and go back to sleep. And so I pray, Holy Spirit, come and speak these words into the midst of a slumber-induced fog. Joel Hanson, who I'm going to ask to come up right now, Joel, come on up, sang an offertory song. It's a song that he wrote this week, and he wrote it in response to the sermon when he heard the text and where we were going, and I wanted him to sing it again here at the end. Now that you know the story, but as he comes, it's really part of the message here. I want to give you some questions to just meditate on and prayerfully listen to the song, but bring these questions to your spirit. In fact, it wouldn't be a bad idea if you just kind of closed your eyes as Joel sings the song. Here's the questions. The first question is actually what the question isn't. The first question is not, if you were to die tonight, do you know where you would go? My first question is not, would you go to heaven when you die? Here's the first question that I would like to ask you. It's this. If you were reasonably sure that you were going to live tonight? What kind of life do you want? How about one that's alive to God? How about an eternal kind of life? Right here, right now. So awaken slumber and rise, awaken from your sleep and arise from the dead. Let me expand the metaphor though. Beyond life and death and heaven and hell and if you're in or out, I would like you to wonder if in all of us there aren't arenas of life where we may be asleep or may be dead. If that's true, then wonder what might be preventing you from coming alive? Not ultimately for salvation, but in an area of your life, what's preventing you from coming alive, fully alive? Maybe bitterness? A vow you made? Maybe even an unconscious vow? A deep disappointment? An unwillingness to let go of a hurt? You know, some of you don't allow yourself to feel things, like anger or sadness or grief, because those aren't good feelings. And in that arena, you're dead. Close your eyes. Bow your heads. Talae Takuma. Little girl. Little boy. Arise. Wake up. Arise, there's a new way to live. Thought we were living But that's not what we've been Breathing out Breathing in But the question remains Have we ever truly lived? There's more than one way A man can lose his life Might have a heartbeat Nothing left inside He prayed a prayer Maybe bent a knee But he never walked with Jesus He never got free Arise, there's a new way to live We thought we were living But that's not what we've been We've been breathing out We've been breathing in But the question remains, have we ever truly lived? A woman too can know the death Steals her soul, but not her breath Her heart gets broken and she grows hard And in the mirror she only sees the scars Arise, there's a new way to live We thought we were living But that's not what we've been We've been breathing out We've been breathing in But the question remains Have we ever truly lived? Arise, little girl, Jesus said Take my hand, get out of your bed Come to life, you've been fast asleep Come and live, come and follow me Arise, there's a new way to live You thought we were living But that's not what we've been We've been breathing out We've been breathing in But the question remains Have we ever truly lived? Arise, there's a new way to live You thought you were living But that's not what you've been You've been breathing out You've been breathing in But the question remains Have you ever truly lived? I want you to stand. And as we stand, I'm going to ask anybody who's from the prayer team ministry to come from where you are right now and just make your place, take a place in front of you and make yourself accessible to anyone who may come. We're just gonna dismiss, but what we're gonna do is, as the altar team, the prayer team, is here ready to receive you. I just wanna invite people who, there are times when, if you've heard God's voice today calling you out of your sleep, you often just need a human touch to greet you. You need someone to pray with you and for you, and we'll have people up here to do that. So even as we're being dismissed, without, there's no manipulation here at all. Just come this way, those of you who want someone to pray for you. Let's pray as we're dismissed. Prayer team, come. Please come. Be here. I want them to see you. Father, I don't know where this word landed in people's hearts, but I pray for those who have heard a call to come into a different kind of life from the fog of sleep that at this very critical moment in their life they would not just roll over and go to lunch Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit come and call your little ones to life for some it would be breaking breaking through a religious spirit that keeps them in bondage and a kind of blindness that has gained a false confidence because of all the stuff they know but there's just no life. Holy Spirit, come to that dear one. Call him into life. For those who are kind of hiding behind walls of bitterness and they've kind of become dead in some of those areas, I pray that you would call them out into life, into a capacity to feel, Holy Spirit, do your work. Give people courage to respond to your voice this morning. We pray these things in Jesus' name, amen.
