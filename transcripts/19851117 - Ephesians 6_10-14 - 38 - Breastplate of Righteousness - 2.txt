Ephesians chapter 6, starting in verse 13, as we are continuing our study this morning on the warfare that is the believers. Verse 13 reads this way, Therefore, take up the full armor of God that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. Stand firm, therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace. In addition to everything, take up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming missiles of the evil one, and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. And on top of all that, do everything you're doing with all prayer and petition. Pray at all times in the Spirit. I don't want to say another word before we go to the Lord in prayer. Father, this study has been very powerful and very alive to me. And I have in a real way, and I know that many of us as a congregation have in a real way sensed the sting of battle and the confrontation of the enemy in our hearts and in our minds during this time. And Father, I need to come to you this morning and bring my heart to you. And Father, ask in your name that the rest of what we're doing this morning, especially the part that you have called upon me to participate in, would be anointed of you, that I would take my fleshy, grubby hands off of this and permit your spirit to speak to us with power and authority. Open our hearts to the truth of your word, to the truth of your righteousness, so that we can be fully equipped to wage the warfare that you've called us to. I ask this in Jesus' name. Amen. The warfare continues. in Acts chapter 20 verse 29 Paul is leaving the church of Ephesus and he says things like this I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you and they won't spare the flock and from among your own selves men will arise and what they'll do is speak perverse things to draw disciples after them and draw them away from the truth therefore be on the alert remembering that night and day for a period of three years I did not cease to admonish you with tears. And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified. Those sound like fighting words, don't they? They're words that deal with the warfare. Paul had an image on his mind that the Christian life and the spreading of the gospel of Christ was not going to be easy, that it was going to be a war. in the book of Philippians he is exhorting the Philippians with all sorts of doctrine and then in the third verse the third chapter, the second verse he says this beware of the dogs beware of the false circumcision real strong language be alert, be ready you're in a war and we have discovered that fact these last few weeks we have spoken of the fact that we in fact are in a war and the first thing we discussed was our desperate need to know that fact, that we are in a cosmic conflict between the demons of hell and the power of Christ. We also need to realize and have discovered in the last few weeks, and I'm sure that many of you have seen this borne out in your life over and over again, and maybe some of you have had it awakened in your life as we've gone into this very touchy territory, and that is this, that the more you grow, And then the more you become aware of God's moving in your life, and the more victory you experience, you're also going to become more and more and more aware of the warfare, because Satan is going to move against you to get you to go back to that mediocrity and stagnation that is so very comfortable. Every time God moves in your life, the enemy is going to move also to stop you. We have discovered that we have an enemy, a very personal enemy, Satan, The one who, literally, the meaning of his name. One who stands in the way. Who would block your way to growth. The devil. Wouldn't it be nice if we could caricature him with a little pitchfork and a red face and a little, you know, the tail with the thing on the end of it. What a wonderful enemy that would be. Diabolos is his name. He is a slanderer. He is a schemer. Above everything that he is and everything that he does, he is a liar. He is a liar and the father of all lies. He lies about life and he lies about death. He lies about God.He lies about himself. He lies about the word of God. He lies about heaven. He lies about hell. He lies about joy. It's found his way, not God's way. That is his function. That's why he was a liar. That is his nature. That is his character. That is his job. It is his function in our church to move in among us and attack us at the very foundation of what makes us a church. We can be sure that he is going to attack our love for one another. He is going to eat away at the foundation of our unity in the Spirit. And when we begin to sense those things dividing us, we better know that Satan's moving against us. Resist him standing firm in your faith. Pursue love. That's why all that terminology begins to come alive for me when Paul uses such strong things like that. Pursue love. Run after it. Persevere. Do everything you can to preserve the unity. Everything he does is an attempt to divert us from the things that really matter, to divert us from focusing our attention on the grace and the love and the forgiveness of the Christ who died for us and rose again. Therefore, since we are in this war, and since we have an enemy, the call of God to the believer these last Sunday mornings has been simply this, be prepared. Be prepared. Verse 13 says, Put on the full armor of God that you may be able to resist when the heat is applied to your life. When that evil day comes, is not the day to put it on. Put it on so when it does come, you're ready to stand. That is kind of vague. It sounds kind of like a college coach at halftime pumping his guys up. Put on the armor. Get ready. Stand firm. We need more than that. We need to know how to put that armor on. We need to know what that armor is. And so he does begin in verse 14. to delineate for us the elements of the armor that's going to protect the believer, not only just protect in a defensive way, but give him the weapons offensively that he needs to go out and storm the gates of hell. The first thing we learned that this armor consists of in verse 14 is this, stand firm, therefore, having girded your loins with truth. Girding your loins with truth. we discussed the fact that this is simply the belt of readiness. The belt of readiness. Remember, the people would wear a tunic, and there was a hole for the head and a hole for both of the arms, and it would flop all over the place. And it was wonderful when you were sitting in your living room, lounging around with nothing important to do, but if you had to go on a trip, or if you had to go into battle and do something important, there was no way in the world you wanted to have this thing floating all over the place. So you would take that belt and wrap it around and pull all the loose ends of your life in and be prepared for warfare. Again, that picture that we have is a soldier doing just that. It is a soldier preparing himself for warfare. So we understand that it's a belt. We understand also what that belt is made of. Gird yourself, put the belt of truthfulness on, having girded your loins with truth. And we talked about the fact, again, I need to reiterate this so we understand that this truthfulness is not so much truthfulness as in content of the truth. It is truthfulness in this sense, without hypocrisy, without guile, undefiled. It is dealing with our commitment. Wrap around yourself the belt of an unbridled, undefiled, without hypocrisy kind of commitment. It was a call to arms, a declaration of war, a call to commitment, the time for leisurely living in the life of the believer is long since passed. We've been called to war. Be prepared. Be ready. We cannot approach the Christian life in a sleepy-eyed kind of way. We need to be fully committed to the task and alert to the wiles and the schemes and the methods that Satan will throw at us as a church and as individuals to tear down the things that God has called us to. Last week, we took that lesson that we did two weeks ago And we underlined it by just going through many of the things that the Apostle Paul said in the New Testament, specifically 1 Corinthians, where he has exhorted the believer to be alert, be awake and ready. The Christian walk is an alert walk. We discovered the fact last week that when he tells us to be alert and ready as believers, it is not so much just something that we're supposed to do. We discovered that that command is so pervasive in the New Testament that it moves over into an area where it's not just something we're supposed to do. It's something or someone that we're supposed to be. A believer needs to have as a characteristic of his life being alert and ready for warfare. Be vigilant. You have an enemy. Be aware. There's going to be temptation. be ready Christ is coming at any moment 1 Thessalonians 5 6 so let us not be among those who are sleepy sleeping remember the distinction we made this is not talking about people who are sleeping like this and others who are awake this distinction is being made here is people who are kind of walking around like this they're awake and people who are really aware we are called to be aware don't be like those who are sleeping but rather let us be alert aware ready and sober really awake. Gird up your loins. 1 Corinthians 16, 13. Be on the alert. Stand firm in the faith. Act like soldiers. Be strong in the faith. Ready? You all ready? We really blasted you for three straight weeks with that stuff. Get going. Be alert. Get ready. What do we have right now? I want you to back off that whole thing. Just in about two minutes or three minutes, I gave you three weeks' worth of sermons right there, which only goes to show you I could have done it that quick. before. You're probably wondering why I didn't. But back off that whole thing and take a look so far when we look at the enemy, the war that we're in, and how prepared we are so far. What do we have so far in our study? What we have right now is a soldier who so far has girded his loins with truth. He has put on the belt of readiness. That's all he's done. That's great. That's important. You're not going to go anywhere in the Christian life. You're not going to go anywhere in this battle with Satan unless that is the first thing you have put on. That's got to be there. But I want you to hear me now when I say this, because this is vital. And I bet you over the last three weeks, some of us, because I know I have already, fallen into the trap that thinking that having girded my loins with truth and prepared myself and I'm really committed more than anybody here. You too, more than anybody here. I'm really committed. I see those other people over there, and they're not as committed as me. That you have fallen into a very subtle and scary trap, and that is this, that having done that, you're ready for the war. You're not. When we have girded ourselves with the belt of truth, we are very much, you know, you're all committed and ready to go, and I'll fight the fight, and I'll get in the race. Very much like Peter when he was standing in front of Jesus, and Jesus said, you're going to deny me three times before the cock crows, and he goes, not me, I'm committed, I'm going to do it, I'm girded here, ready to go. Two times in this text it says this, very important, put on the what? Full armor of God. And you're not going to make it into warfare unless it's all on. And the belt of readiness is crucial and important, and I believe that every other dimension is going to tie into that. But it's not enough. what we have right now, if we were to picture this in our minds, in terms of where we've progressed in our text, what we have right now is a soldier who is willing to fight. He is eager, he is teachable, he is moldable, and if you have responded so far to what we've dealt with in the text, that's where you're at in your Christian life. You're teachable, you're moldable, you've come to the Lord and said, I'm all yours, I'm willing to fight the fight, to be yours fully, and now that soldier needs to be taught, and that soldier needs to be trained, how do I put the rest of the armor on? I'm ready, and I'm willing, and I'm eager, and I'm biting at the bit. You know, for the first three weeks of our study, we've been dealing very much so, and I don't apologize for this because this is important, we've been dealing very much so with the type of soldier or the type of Christian who isn't real sure he's willing to fight. He's really not sure he's willing to get into that warfare. We've been confronting as hard as we could with words, apathy, and mediocrity, and saying that is not the direction that we are going to allow ourselves to go. The flavor of the last three weeks has been very much a warning kind of thing, an admonishing, even, kind of thing. We are in a war, and we better be ready. We are in a race, and we better start running if we're in it. And the aim is to move us, all of us, off of the sidelines, and get us into the race, into the fullness of God, and into the warfare that God has called us to. Like a mighty army is the church of God, and that's a wonderful song, but it's a delusion unless we're all in the war, unless we're all moving toward the goal. And if we're sitting on the sidelines and sitting in the pew watching other people who are fighting the war that God has called us to, we are not at all a mighty army. We're a cripple limping along. And that is not at all what God's called us to. Today, as we move on, Our thrust and our focus is going to change. The people to whom this text is speaking is changing. Because we are not any longer speaking to those who are sitting on the sidelines. We are speaking now to those who have entered in, who have wrapped around themselves the belt of readiness, who are moving out, who are all excited, who are really concerned, who are really serious, who really love the Lord. And you were there last week, you remember? Or the week before, and you just got, oh, this is great, I'm ready and I'm willing and I'm really concerned and I'm really committed and I'm really going and I've never done this before. And you went out last week and you really got the stuffings kicked right out of you. Anybody here like that? You didn't raise your hands, but I know that there are. You know what? Sometimes we get so hurt and so disillusioned and so discouraged in the warfare, that you just want to turn around and call it quits and forget it, and maybe you even come to the brink of your faith. And if you haven't had that struggle, I want you to know one person who has, it's been me. When you begin to grow, Satan is going to move and he is going to attack the mind and the heart. And he wants you to turn around and stop and the pressure will be applied in ways you can't even imagine. But today, again, we are not speaking to the person who is on the sidelines anymore. We're talking to the person who has entered into the war and feels like they're losing, and feels like they're losing badly. We need to know some things, soldiers. We need to know some things. First thing you need to know is that while being girded with the belt of commitment gets you into the war, it's not going to help you win it. While being girded with the belt of readiness and commitment is going to get you into that war and it's going to get you into the conflict, it's going to take you off of the sidelines and get you into the skirmish, that belt is not going to be the thing that prepares you or protects you or gives you the offensive weapons you need to win. We've been talking all the way through our series here of the subtle ways that Satan will come and divert us from the things that matter. The subtle ways that Satan will come and get us to be confused and fall back and render us impotent. Apathy, again, indifference, mediocrity. There's another thing he'll use in your life, and again, I'm speaking now to those who are committed and ready to go. The next thing Satan's going to use in your life after you think you just went over this incredible, monumental barrier in your life, you really gave yourself. I'm here. I'm ready to go. The next thing Satan's going to use in your life is to get you so excited about your commitment that as you move into that new, fresh girding of yourself for warfare, that you're actually going to begin to believe that you can win the war on the strength of your commitment. The fact is, again, picture in your mind the warrior going into war. What's he done so far? He's put on the belt. you're going to look pretty silly wading into warfare with nothing but that you know I'm committed and you get in you put the belt on you go walking in you go where's your sword where's your shield you're going to get drilled and you go my commitment's going to make it you're over you just got shot you're easy money you're an easy mark you're going to get blasted and maybe some of you have how many times we come forward and we go this time i mean it you know only to go out into the warfare and get blasted because we had the belt and that's important and you can't go anywhere without it but you need more the picture i want to have in our minds very quickly and we are going to be very quick because i want to do something this morning that we don't usually do that's why i started so early we're going to sing this morning and worship the lord for the armor that he's given us when I'm done. Very quickly. I want you to picture in your mind a whole group of fresh recruits, okay? The army is beginning to be formed, and people are committing themselves to the warfare completely. Again, the recruits are ready. They are eager. They are biting at the bit. They want to get in there and feel the skirmish and get ready to go. Is that you? I trust it is. I hope every one of you are just exactly in that position. Maybe some of you are just a little bit afraid. That's okay, too. Let's go. you got the belt on here's the next piece the next piece is in that same verse after you've put your belt on the next piece of machinery of protection is the breastplate of righteousness put it on right here the breastplate of righteousness a breastplate was a common piece of equipment for a roman soldier i don't need to even describe it to you you've seen enough of those old movies to realize what they look like you know often they were made of linen, of real thick linen soaked with oil, and if you were real poor and didn't have a lot of money as a soldier, you'd hang animal hooves all over it, and that would afford you some protection. Other people would use what was called kind of a chain mail thing, where again they would have the linen, and they would hang pieces of metal off of it, and again that would protect you. If you really had the bucks, what you'd have is one of these molded metal things, you know? It was beautiful. They were shiny and gold, and Richard Burton wore them, you know? Right? And they had an eagle on the front. You know, it was great. It was wonderful. And you were protected. The place it protected in your body when you're going into war, again, you all know this, but I want to verbalize this so we get a feel for this. It was the midsection. It was right in here. All these vital organs, the heart, the stomach, this area here that is really afforded very little protection, that was where the breastplate went. Literally, it went from the bottom of the neck to the top of the thighs, covering that whole area. What it did for the warrior, get this, was it freed him up to do battle. Okay? When I've got this breastplate on, and I know that these parts in my body that are so incredibly vulnerable are protected, and I don't have to worry about anything piercing that, I'm going to go into warfare like this. You know, boom, boom, boom, boom. And I can be wide open. Something hits. It might hurt. It might knock me down. But it's not going to kill me. I can keep going. It frees me up to fight that warfare with a reckless abandon, to really do battle. And I don't have to flinch. The breastplate, if I were to give you something to hang a hat on as to what it did, what its function was, it was that which gave confidence. It gave confidence. I can just go like this, you know, my arms wide open, going nuts because I'm protected in here. I want you to know something else about what else is being protected here on a spiritual level. To the Jew who was hearing this, and as he was considering the organs that were being protected by the breastplate, you would think of the heart. The heart in the mind of a Jew was where they would do their thinking. For us, we feel with our heart. We love people with all our hearts. For a Jew, they did their thinking there. That was their mind. As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he. Thinking happens there. The internal organs, all of these other things in here, were kind of put into one category called the bowels. And that was where the Jew had in his mind his feeling. That was where things turned around. And that was where he got hit with discouragement. And he just felt sick. And he didn't want to go on anymore. And he was depressed. And he felt it all in here. And he felt hate in here. And he felt love in here. and they would write love letters to their wives and girlfriends. I love you with all my balls, you know. It's disgusting. And if they were protected there, there was a boldness. You get it? If they were protected, if their thinking and their feelings were protected somehow, there could be a boldness. But when they got hit there, and it slid through and it hit, and I just, it was debilitating, and I was just walking around like this and always worrying and gun-shy and not ready to fully fight. And so it is that the soldier begins to look around for some sort of protection for that particular dimension of his life, your feelings. Think about that. Isn't that true? When you're thinking about the warfare that you are involved in even now, think of all the different ways that sin threatened you to the brink of your faith, some sort of horrendous incident, somehow or other, not always. But those things in some ways are easier to deal with. I can look at them, I can see them, God gives grace to handle them, and I go through it. But when I get hit here, and it just takes the wind out of me, and you feel like people are against you, and the reality of God just isn't there. and Satan will attack you there where you're vulnerable. My feelings, my thinking, my feelings. Nobody loves me. Everybody hates me. I think I'll eat green worms and quit and quit. Psalm 11 talks about David at a period of his life when he was just doing that. The people were moving against him. Saul was moving against him. He wanted to quit. He was doing warfare against David, and the slings and the arrows were coming at him all the time. And he says in the 11th chapter, the 11th Psalm, I would like to flee like a bird. Get out of here and run. The foundations are shaking. It's that sinking feeling. I just can't go anymore. I need something to help me through that, and so do you. I need something that's going to give me protection in that realm of my life. And it isn't going to do any good to deny those feelings I have. I need something that's going to help me deal with those assaults. I can't just have them come and pretend it's not there. I don't feel any pain. Nothing's going on. I need something that's going to protect me and help me deal with it. The breastplate of righteousness. The breastplate of righteousness. Now, I want you to get this too as we're going through this. Not only would Satan like to get you to wade into warfare without being fully prepared and just go in with nothing but a belt. Not only would he like you to think that you can sit on the sidelines and still be all that God's called you to be. That's a delusion and you've been deceived. But there's another thing he'd like you to get. You know what? Every step of the way, there's going to be a new delusion for you. There's going to be a new deception. The next deception for the one who's ready to put the breastplate on. He's passed the part where he thinks the belt is enough. I need more protection. The next thing he wants you to do, after you see the need for it, is he's going to try like crazy to sell you a cheapie. Okay? He's going to try like crazy to get you one that's got holes all over it, or that looks real good and shiny and new and, you know, impressive to other people, but it's got all sort of holes, and when the arrow comes, it goes right through it. And he'd like you to take that breastplate and put that on and think, well, I'm prepared. You're not. The most prevalent piece of equipment, the most prevalent breastplate that I believe Satan is selling to believers today is the breastplate that is made of my own righteousness. And again, I want you to know, I'm not talking to unbelievers. We understand that whole dynamic where unbelievers somehow think that they can get to heaven by doing it. I want to tell you something else. You can't win the warfare. There's no protection in your life from your own righteousness. Lots of good intentions. it goes something like this for me satan begins to attack or let's say he hasn't attacked yet but i've been hearing these sermons on the warfare and i'm beginning to realize that i need to be prepared so i know he will and i want to get ready so what i put on to protect myself and my feelings and all those things that are going to get blasted is my personal godliness we've been talking about the worthy walk incredibly important so what i do is i i've been walking worthy i've been you know in the light, and I'm all just growing like crazy. So I take that, and I put that confidence on. Isn't that neat? When you really know you're walking with the Lord, and you really know you're in fellowship with Him, you just take that, and you put it on, and that's your protection. I can handle what Satan's going to throw in my feelings after all. Look how I'm growing. I'm doing great. And again, I am not trying to make a parody of this. I'm not even trying to make this a caricature. Let's say you really are growing like crazy. You've seen things you've never seen before and you're moving into depths of your spiritual life that you never dreamed imaginable you really are moving into maturity you're doing well you've seen victory and you're beginning to think you know i can handle this this is great i just wear this this armor that i've got and all i gotta do is look back at my past performance the last couple weeks i've really been walking with the lord put that on protect me they come no sweat i know how godly i am again i don't want to keep i don't want to be terribly redundant but we are talking here about the christian who is flat out committed you mean business with the lord you've seen so much and he's really beginning to do things but the trap is you actually begin to think that you're the one who's doing it that you're the one who's strong first kings 19 1 through 4 Remember that story of Elijah? Remember that? He trusted God. He went to warfare with the prophets of Baal. And against insurmountable odds, he believed God. And they cut themselves with knives. And I just picture him being in the pulpit one day when things were really cooking. You know, they were just falling in the place. And the words were coming. And they looked like fools. And Elijah said, God, take it up. Whammo, it worked. Victory. And he walked down the hill. And I don't know this for sure, but I just have a feeling in his mind, if he's anything like me. I know God did it, but, I mean, I really, I didn't do too bad there. I mean, you know, those other prophets there couldn't do a thing, and I'm telling you, you see that thing gets consumed? It's incredible. Incredible victory. God had moved, prevailed in a mighty way. Next thing you know, little Jezebel comes and goes, boo, and he runs to the desert, hides under a tree, and wants to die. As soon as you begin to believe even that much that what God's doing through you is because of you, you have just put on for yourself an armor that's made of paper, and the enemy's going to go right through it. Bam. That armor is made of paper. And the reason I know it's made of paper is that as nice as I can get it to look, somewhere in that righteousness that is my own, somewhere in that worthy walk of mine and of yours, and somewhere in the growth as magnificent as it is that you're experiencing, somewhere in it there is a flaw. Somewhere. That's why Paul can never say, I have arrived. I'm pressing on. I have not arrived. I am not fully there, ever. And if I'm putting on that for my protection against all those things that Satan would like to destroy in me, then somewhere that crack is going to be found, Satan's going to shine light on it. And what he's going to say when he looks at that flaw in your character, that one thing, you know what he's going to say to you? You phony. And you know what you're going to do? You're going to believe him. This whole thing is a crack. This whole thing is a mess. None of this works. and now you're in a real fix because you put on this breastplate that is your own righteousness and you showed it to everybody oh no, right? oh brother you got into that self-righteous trap again, it happens to people who care and you put that on and you showed it to everyone and you kind of have yeah, I got it together yeah I got the answers yeah I can do this pretty well I'm right and I want you to know something admittedly that armor looks pretty good doesn't it? it's shiny it's golden you can actually blind people with it you know in church after church you wear your armor that is your self-righteousness you know people come too close you can kind of get it in the sun and go right in their eyes they go whoa oh man is he something got neat engravings all over it you know little engravings like there's one up here that says 12 years board of elders pretty good huh show that to everybody got another one over here that says four years bible college it's right in the armory you know it just as soon as you get there you can see that intimidating wonderful some people put their denominations on their chest plate you know baptist general conference and we go boo but other people go cnma you know put my PhD on there I don't have one but you some of you have one how often you read the word here 12 hours a day wear that I got a good one for you pastor I put that right on my thing pastor if I'm real insecure I'll put reverend and I just wear that around you know it's great it's real impressive it's golden it's shiny and everybody thinks whoa the problem with it no matter how many things you got dangling from it and how many people are impressed by it it isn't flawless but if i put it on i got to pretend that it is flawless right i got to pretend like it is and you know what i'm getting shot all the time and so are you but if i put this on and i've showed it to everybody and it's my worthy walk i can never show you that i've been wounded and so we walk through church with the breastplate of my own righteousness on, with all the metals hanging from it, and everybody's impressed, and inside I'm bleeding to death. And my feelings are going round and round and round. And I'm so hurt and so discouraged, and you're so hurt and so discouraged that you are not only ready to leave the church, you're ready to chuck this whole thing in Christianity, because even though the armor looks good, you know in your guts this doesn't work. But you can't admit it. this breastplate of my own righteousness is the mask we talk about all the time I put it on on Sunday morning it looks so nice and shiny and clean and I do everything I can to keep it looking just like that and keep you thinking that it's all in place and just wonderful and I'll lie if I have to keep that up how are you doing this morning? great! what are you with the Lord? well praise the Lord that's wonderful if it's true you ever come to church and you're just coming and I've been here so I know you do it you come and you're smiling only you can feel it shaking because you know it isn't real dearly beloved that armor will never protect you in this warfare never you can try and maybe you need to because maybe like me I had a coach who used to say the only thing that made me pay attention was when I get hit in the head with a board. So maybe you need to try this kind of armor and fall flat on your face. Because you will. It won't work because somewhere there's a flaw. And you're going to end up being so beaten and so discouraged and so hurt and so dependent on what everybody else thinks. You know, if you're wearing that breastplate of righteousness that is your own, it matters that everybody's impressed. And that isn't freedom. And this method, this breastplate that Satan would love you to put on, this cheapie is what I'll call it, it amounts to nothing less than trying to fight the warfare on my own strength, on my own merit. Lesson number one, dear soldiers eager and ready to go who have girded yourself with an unbridled commitment, put on a breastplate that will protect you in the warfare. put on a breastplate that doesn't have any cracks. Put on a breastplate that's going to be strong enough so that when the arrows come, they're not going to destroy you. And there's only one kind of breastplate like that. And we are going to be getting, real quickly, right back to some of the most basic things of our faith. Let me say this in the words of F.F. Bruce. Tremendous Bible expositor says this. in dealing with the breastplate of righteousness. Self-reliance in any form would constitute no bulwark for my soul. It would surely wrinkle and warp in that evil hour. When it's not tough, it might work. But I have but one shield, one buckler, which no sword can pierce. He is the Lord who is my righteousness. Put that on. Put that on. It's the only one that will work. By faith, I put on the righteousness that he affords me through his grace and salvation. That is my impregnable rampart and buttress, which no volley from the pit can destroy. My protection, my breastplate, is the ark of God itself. Nothing else will work. Not the gallantry of my commitment. 2 Corinthians 10, 2-4, Paul says this. When I was with you, and again, remember in Corinth, he was under all sorts of personal attack. They didn't like his preaching. They didn't accept him as an apostle. And he, in this second verse, confessed his strong tendency to want to come in there and be real strong and just kind of blast him out and flash his credentials and get tough. You know, there's two things that happen when you're wearing that breastplate of your own righteousness and Satan attacks. One, you get so defeated that you run away. The other thing that happens is you get real tough. You know, you get real strong, and you start fighting it in the flesh. And he said, when I am with you, I will not be strong in myself as though I walk in the flesh. Going on, verse 3, for though we do walk in the flesh, and because of that, there's a real tendency to try to fight the battle with my intellect and my ability. But we don't do warfare on that level. And if you try to do a spiritual warfare with physical kinds of attributes, you're going to get blasted. Then he says this, the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh. You can try them if you like, but you'll get beat. The weapons of our warfare are mighty through God. They are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. 1 Corinthians 5.21 says this, he who knew no sin became sin on our behalf that what? that we might become the righteousness of God in him. Put that on, believer, soldier. Put that righteousness on that is his. That's the only one that's going to protect you. He has accepted, forgiven, received, adopted, sealed you. Put that on. Believe it, accept it, receive it, wear it, bathe in it. You know what? When we first started this whole series, we talked about the fact that Satan is beaten by what? By believing. By believing that what Christ said he would do for me in salvation, he has done. Put that on by faith. Ephesians 1.4 says this, He chose us in him before the foundation of the world. That what? That we would be able to stand before him holy and blameless. Stand before him holy and blameless. Do you believe that? Put it on. By faith, put it on. That's your breastplate. Psalm 91, 2 says this, I will say to the Lord, Lord, you are my refuge and fortress. You are the only one, my God in whom I trust. Put that on. Psalm 144, verses 2 and following says this, Blessed be the Lord, my rock. That's the only rock you've got. You train my hands for war. You train my fingers for battle. You are my loving kindness. You are my fortress, not me. You are my fortress. You are my stronghold. You are my deliverer. You are my shield in whom I will take refuge. Put that on. Put that on. Even this morning as I speak, put that on. Take that other piece of paper off. It'll never work. Believe it, put that on. Take that other piece of paper off. It'll never work. Believer, you are the righteousness of God in Christ. Put it on, believe it, wear it, bathe in it, and bring that breastplate into warfare with you. John Wesley translated a song. Give it a minute. It goes like this. Jesus, thy blood, and lift thy head. Both my touch shall lay. Fully through thee absolved I am. from sin and fear, from guilt and shame. How? Jesus, thy blood and righteousness. Wear it. Believe it, soldier. Bathe in it. Bring that into battle. And right now in these closing moments, we're going to sing about it. And even as we sing, I want you in your mind before the Lord, if you need to stop singing and just ask the Lord, if you've been fighting this warfare, like that, you are just getting blasted. I don't have to tell you you're going to get. You already are. And you know it. Take it off and put this on by faith. Believe what it is that God has given to you. And walk out of here ready for warfare. Thank you.
