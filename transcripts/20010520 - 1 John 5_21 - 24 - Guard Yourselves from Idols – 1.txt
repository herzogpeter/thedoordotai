Open your Bibles with me to 1 John 5, chapter 5, verse 21. 1 John 5, 21. We come today to the final verse of John's epistle, but not to the final message. This verse is going to kick us into an arena of important application that I think is going to last a while. All it says is this. Little children, guard yourselves from idols. Now, among the things that caught my attention about that phrase, even months ago as I looked at the end of this epistle, was what a strange way to end. Just strange enough to catch my attention and to make me wonder, what does he mean by this? Why does he close with this? It feels kind of abrupt to me. No goodbye, no God bless, no greet each other with a holy kiss or something like that. Just this. Little children, guard yourself from idols. Well, let's begin to break down phrase by phrase. The reference to them as little children is familiar and consistent with John's love for the people to whom he is writing. As was evidenced throughout this epistle, he is their spiritual father in the faith. 3 John, verse 4, John says, I have no greater joy than this, that to see my children walk in truth. The picture we need to get is that this guy's invested in these people more than time. They are the children of his heart. My little children, guard yourselves. Those two words, guard yourselves, has in my mind a carryover effect of the father talk that I said last week's text was. You remember last week if you were here. Actually, the father talk kind of paradigm began the week before in chapter 5, verse 1, where John said this. You guys, the people who are authentically born of God are just not that hard to spot. Three undeniable and consistent characteristics, in fact, mark them. They are believing. That's how you can tell. They are obeying. They are loving. They are not perfect, but they are in the process and moving in the direction of obedience, faith, and love. Indeed, it is by those things that you can know you belong to God and that you have entered into and are living an eternal kind of life. So the exhortation of the last couple of weeks was this. So keep on believing, obeying, and loving. Particularly keep on doing that when you've lost your confidence as the people to whom he is writing had. Particularly it's important when the lights go out, when the shade is drawn, when it's hard to see his face and it's hard to hear his voice. Keep on believing, obeying, and loving. But with that exhortation, John fully knows that it's hard to do that, especially when the lights go out. And you can't see his face or hear his voice so much like a father. He sits down with them in this epistle saying essentially this. If you hope to keep on believing, obeying, and loving, especially in this context of having lost your confidence and feeling a bit in the dark, then there are some things you need to know. There are some things you need to remember that you already know, and among them are these. You need to know that you belong to God, and that the God you belong to loves you with an everlasting love, with a tender, protective, paternal love. For, beloved, now we are the children of God. But given also the reality of the particular heresy that the people were fighting against, specifically the Gnostic heresy that was undermining their faith in who Jesus really was. John also says this that maybe more than you realize you also need to know that the one in whom you are believing that the one you are obeying that the one who you are loving you need to know that he is true. That this business about Jesus being the fullness of God is not pretend. It's not a fabrication. And that is why he says in verse 20, which is one of the verses we landed on really hard last week, he says this, We know, and you need to remember that we know, that the Son of God has come. That He has given us understanding in order that we might know Him who is true. Operative word there, true. That word shows up three times in verse 20. That's a tip off that something is significant. And that we are in him who is true, in his son Jesus Christ. In other words, he is not a vapor like the Gnostics are trying to tell you. And he is not belonging to some feathery realm, disconnected somehow from the world and the realities of the world with which we must deal. No, this Jesus is the one true God, he says at the very end of verse 20. He is the one true source of the eternal kind of life that I have been inviting you into since chapter 1, verse 1. Therefore, little children, verse 21, keep yourselves from idols. He is the one true God, verse 20. Guard yourself from subtle substitutes like the Gnostics are trying to sell you. In other words, what verse 21 says is keep yourself from not just general idolatry, though that's included, specifically he is saying keep yourself from false Christs. Jesus is the one true God. Keep yourself from false perceptions of who Christ really is. False perceptions that are not true about the one who is true. Why is that a big deal? Why does he end the epistle with that? Here's why. Because a false perception of Christ undermines and mitigates against the three foundational characteristics that mark people out as being truly born of God. Obeying, believing, and loving. They mitigate against that. How does a false perception of Christ mitigate against obeying, believing, and loving? Here's how. Because if your perception of Christ is that he isn't truly God, or that he isn't really true, or that he has no relevance. You know, you might have some, oh, I think he's God. But in terms of how you really perceive him, he has no relevance to your life situation and how you live it. Then why on earth would you obey him, believe him, or love him? Why on earth would you take him seriously when he calls you to this or that? Why on earth would you take him seriously as having anything to say about how you live your life? If you think just for a little while about this issue of taking him seriously and why sometimes we don't, I think it becomes pretty clear pretty quick that most people, quite frankly, don't take Jesus very seriously. More troubling than what most people do in terms of their response to Christ is the fact that I am quite convinced, having been in the church pretty much my whole life, that even many people who call themselves Christians, quite frankly, don't take him very seriously either. As being the one true God who has anything to say to them about how they live their lives. These are people who maybe have, in their own words, accepted Jesus as their personal Savior. They have prayed some prayer. They have walked some aisle. They have maybe signed some card. They think their place in heaven is secure. Because they signed some card, they prayed some prayer, they got saved. They throw that, I got saved. They don't take Jesus seriously. I don't care what your words are, in terms of how you live your life, taking the words and the life of Jesus serious so they don't take them seriously, as the one true God who has anything to say about the everyday realities of life and how they live it. And so often, without knowing it, they have created for themselves a false Christ. A false Christ that simply wants to magically save them, but he doesn't want to change them, interact or partner with them. a false Christ who in their mind, because they've developed this little Christ, in their mind doesn't really care much. Even if people who claim to know him do obey him, believe him, or love him. I think it's more prevalent in the church than most of us would like to think about, would like to look at, would like to admit. Annie Dillard in her book I've referenced before called Teaching a Stone to Talk affirms all this when she says this. Why do people in churches seem like brainless tourists on a packaged tour of the absolute? Does anyone take this seriously? That's a good question. I mean, I can see her just kind of looking over churches, just looking at how people respond to the worship or the word. They're just kind of bored. Does anybody take this seriously? Does anyone have the foggiest idea what sort of power we so casually invoke? Or, as I suspect, does no one believe a word of it? We just kind of come to tip our hat to God, make sure we're kind of going to go to heaven, but we don't take him seriously. That's what she's driving at. She goes on to say this, churches are like children playing on the floor with their chemistry sets, mixing up a batch of TNT to kill us Sunday morning. It's madness, she says, to wear ladies' hats to church. We should be wearing crash helmets. Ushers should issue life preservers and signal flares. They should lash us to our pews. For a sleeping God may wake someday and take offense. But we don't take him seriously. We prefer, she says, the illusion of a safer deity. So we've paired God down to a more manageable proportion. A proportion that neither demands anything of us nor stirs anything in us. We have recreated for ourselves God. We have made him to be the way we want him to be. And what I would add to that is this. We have done the same to Christ. Who John says is the one true God. Verse 20. Creating for ourselves false Christs. Idols. You always think of idols. Do you ever feel like when any verse, maybe you don't, but any verse that calls about don't have idolatry, and I go, well, I don't have any statues on my desk or in my office. I'm clear on that one. Oh, boy. You don't have a clue. False perceptions of Christ is the explicit idolatry that John is telling his beloved children to guard themselves from. False perceptions of Christ that are primarily designed to serve us and to endorse what we already think and how we already want to live. I can just come up with a Christ that says, oh yeah, what you think is true. And how you live, oh, it's okay, it's no problem. How did you come up with that? Well, you created the Christ that says, that's true, that's okay. Now, there are many false Christs, false perceptions of Christ. In fact, I just got a little overwhelmed. I kind of even hit a stuckness in my writing this sermon because I felt so overwhelmed by all the different directions false perceptions of Christ could bring us and I needed to kind of bring it down and make it simple. But what I want to say, just on this front end of this, is that any perception you have of Christ that is false ultimately undermines and mitigates authentic believing, obeying, and loving. Because even if you are in your own mind obeying, believing, and loving Christ, If your Christ is a false perception, then what you're really doing is obeying, believing, and loving the Christ that you created. But you're not obeying, believing, and loving the Christ that really is the Christ. And so we have the Christ who guarantees our comfort, who promises us wealth and health, We have the Christ who is the gumball machine in the sky that I spoke of last week. We have the Christ, obey, believe, and love the Christ who supports our cause. And winks at our sin. My little children, John the father to his beloved children, says, guard yourselves from false perceptions of Christ. And there are many. And every single one of them undermine and mitigate against authentic believing, obeying, and loving. And the reason that's serious is because it is by believing, obeying, and loving that you can know you belong to Him. Now, many false Christs, we could get lost. I'm bringing it down to two. In fact, we're only going to talk mostly about one. And I need to talk about the second at the end to kind of bring some balance to the one I want to spend the most time with. But the reason I've chosen these two false perceptions today is because they are the two false perceptions that John speaks most of in his epistle. And I believe them to be the most dangerous or right relating to God. The first false perception of Christ is this. And this is just kind of my best shot. And just kind of come with me as I unpack this a bit. It's seeing Christ as what I would call a magic wand, specifically as it relates to our salvation. Now, this perception comes from another perception that sees the sum total of what Jesus came to do in his death and resurrection as being to wave the magic wand when we say the magic words. So when we say the magic words, he waves the magic wand and we have eternal life and go to heaven when we die. Now, in some ways, it might sound like, well, isn't that true? Well, let me say something. There is something in there that is very true. When we put authentic faith in Jesus Christ, place our confidence in Him for our eternity, for our very life, we have, we are entering into eternal life. And when we die, we will go to heaven. The false perception that I am trying to expose this morning, and that John has spent this entire epistle trying to expose, The false perception that sees this eternal life only as a commodity, a thing that I possess that kicks in only when I die. In other words, this false perception sees Jesus as nothing more than fire insurance that guarantees I won't burn in hell when I die. And what I want to know, what I'm concerned about, and it's one of the ways I know that this is my perception. One of the things I want to know when I perceive Christ this way is this. Do I have it? I've got all sorts of concerns. I don't know if I have it. Do I have it? I don't know. Do I have it? Am I covered? Do I have my ticket? Do I know what I need to know? Well, if I don't know, I'll go to confirmation. And that will guarantee it. Have I prayed what I need to pray? If I haven't prayed it, I'll pray it again. Maybe, oh, if somebody else says you should pray it a different way, I'll pray it that way. Have I, here's the deal, said the magic words so he can wave the magic wand so I can have eternal life. Whew! I'm covered. I'm saved. And my whole perspective here is if I say the magic words, I'll wave the magic wand and I'm covered. The eternal life I'm now getting is something that will kick in when I die. Till then, you're kind of on your own. John, however, makes clear right at the beginning of this epistle we have spent a full year unpacking this reality. chapter 1 verse 1 is this that the eternal life that he was talking about that was made possible by the Christ that he knew by the Christ that he had heard and seen and handled with his hands chapter 1 verse 1 was not just about a future hope that kicks in when we die though it does include that the eternal life he was speaking of and inviting people into was also a present reality that we could taste and touch and see and feel now that would continue on until we go to heaven and be with God eternally in a life that is consistent with the eternal life we're living now. The way we've been saying it this entire year has been like this, that what God is inviting us into through His Son Jesus is not just into eternal life then, but He is inviting us into an eternal kind of life now. indeed the reason at the beginning of John's epistle that he is so excited about what he has seen and heard and handled with his hands declare I unto you he was so excited the reason he was so excited is because verse 2 of chapter 1 the eternal life of God which was with the Father in the beginning what is the eternal life of God which was with the Father in the beginning well here's the news flash it isn't a what this eternal life that was with the Father is not a what it's a who the eternal life that was with the Father is Jesus himself. And the reason I'm excited is this. This eternal life that is Jesus is something you can know, experience, walk in, and be transformed by now. And that's something to get excited about, says John. Entering, beloved, by faith into this eternal kind of life, hear me now, is what salvation is. what salvation brings is in fact the promise of heaven then but it also brings with it something more the process, the prospect the power of transformation now in other words the good news of Jesus Christ the gospel that we preach is not simply that he waves a magic wand when I say the magic words. It's that he doesn't just save me, he changes me. Part of what it means to be saved is to be by him effected. As he invites us into this eternal kind of life now. But there are people, More, I think, than we would like to acknowledge, we have a perception of Christ that all he is is a magic wand. He says, I say the magic word, he waves the magic wand, I have eternal life, and it never touches me. Dallas Willard in his book Divine Conspiracy that we have been referencing pretty consistently all through this study, 1 John, I think as well as anyone demonstrates the danger of this false perception of Christ as magic wand that saves me but doesn't change me when he speaks of what I told you of before that he calls the barcode faith. Remember that? Kind of gave you that early on in our study. Let me just remind you of what he says about that. Think of the barcodes now used on the goods that we buy in most stores. The scanner responds only to the barcode. It really makes no difference what is in the bottle or package that bears it or whether the sticker is on the right one or not. The scanner only responds through its electronic eye to the barcode and totally disregards everything else. If the ice cream sticker, for instance, is on the dog food, then the dog food is ice cream, so far as the scanner knows or cares. False perception of Christ as one who saves you but doesn't change you says that there's something about the Christian life that works, like the barcode. A little ritual here, some belief over there, an association with a group of Christians, maybe a magic prayer you pray. That's my insertion. All of that affects God the way the barcode affects the scanner. Perhaps there occurred a moment of mental assent to a creed. Or an association was entered into with some friends who know God. Or some church that preaches Christ. God scans that. Forgiveness floods forth. An appropriate amount of righteousness is shifted from Christ's account to your account in the bank of heaven. All your debts are paid. You're saved. You're saved. Question. How do you know? Here's how you know. I prayed the magic prayer. He waved the magic wand. I have eternal life. I walked the L. I signed the guard. I joined the group. Dallas Willard goes on to say, the payoff for all this comes when you die. Because in your mind, eternal life is what kicks in when you die. The payoff is when you die. When God scans the barcode of our right belief, life being lived right now has no necessary connection to being authentically born of God as long as the barcode does its job. End of quote. So the barcode, the scanner goes over you and God sees you as peanut butter. Peanut butter. Even though the only thing that's inside of you is jelly. Which, by the way, reveals another interesting perception of God because if you think that external, Here's what I think. That God is not fooled by what's really inside of you. The perception you obviously have of God is that he's not very bright. Because he can't tell what's real. This is a perception of God that sees him as, you would never say this, but you see him as a bit of a chump. A bit of a pushover, easily fooled. He said the magic word. He waves the magic wand. And all he does is change the label on the outside, touching nothing on the inside. And I walk around declaring, I'm saved. He said the magic words. How do you know you're saved? I said, the magic words. He waited the magic one. I have eternal life. I'm not so sure. I'm not so sure. What you may have, and I fear, again, that more even among us than I would feel comfortable knowing about. I have a false perception of Christ that all he does is somehow magically, poof, save you. Change the label on the outside and he doesn't change you. If you have that perception of Christ, one of the things I can tell you about you is this, that things like obeying, believing, and loving won't matter much. You might acknowledge, oh, yes, that should matter. And you might even kind of admire people who take it seriously. Like there's this group of people who are authentically saved, and they don't really take God seriously. And then there's this other special super-duper group who kind of takes God seriously. They're a little weird, though. I don't take God that seriously. I got my barcode. I said the magic words. He waved the magic wand. That's what I got. I got the barcode. You know, every once in a while you'll hear something, or a paradigm will come to you. This is nothing new in some ways, but this is kind of a new way to see it and look at it, where I'll hear something, and it'll connect the dots for me. You know what I mean? It'll explain something to me. This perception that may be bigger than we think in the context even of the church, maybe even ours, among some, explains some things. Explains things like this, that we live in a country that according to some of the latest studies, 94% of the people in it believe in God. Doesn't that bless you? I mean, I just feel hopeful now, don't you? Don't you feel more, I mean, don't read the paper today that would kind of give evidence to the contrary. 94% of the people in our country believe in God. Well, my question is this, what God is that? What God is it that you created that you believe, obey, and love? I don't... That's not actually the percentage that disturbs me. The one that bugs me a little more is this one. 74% according to some of these latest surveys. This is one that was quoted in Dallas Willard's book. 74% of the people who live in our country claim to have made a personal commitment to Christ. And I think, really? so what Jesus is that what evidence is there that 74% of the people in our country have made a commitment to Christ well they prayed the prayer they said the magic words and if they said the magic word God waves the magic wand and they have eternal life really so is that how you know you have eternal life that you said the magic words? That's not what John says. Here's what I think, in case you want to know, even if you don't want to know. You can leave really quick and you won't have to know. I think 74% of the 74%, and I really should back up, I don't know if it's 74%. It just kind of rhymes a little bit. I think more people than I would like to admit of the 74% who say they've made a commitment to Christ have made a commitment to a Christ that they made up. they have made a commitment to they believe, obey and love a Christ of their own creation a false Christ who said to them one day let's make a deal here's the deal you say the magic word I'll wave the magic wand you'll have eternal life you're covered and you know the best part this false Christ says it's all cosmetic you won't have to I won't call anything out of you at all I won't touch any part of your real life I'll save you but I won't change you I won't touch your believing, obeying or loving I will not affect how you love your wife You can love or not love your wife any way you want Says this false Christ I won't affect or call out of you a love for your husband That transcends your ability to love Nah, you can love him any way you want I won't have any effect whatsoever on how you treat your kids or how you handle your money because it's your money. Oh no, I wouldn't impose one thing on you relative to the lordship of the God who made you. It's all yours, says this false Christ. And your sexuality? Make it up as you go along. You can do pretty much anything you want, says this false Christ. I think it's a bigger issue than we know. in the church at large and here at Open Door. My words this morning are strong. So strong and coming even forcefully, I'm aware that it may be hard for some to hear. He sounds angry. You know what? I'm really not. I am afraid. I am afraid for some of you. that you are believing, obeying, and loving a Christ that you have created. And I hope the energy you feel for me today is the energy of a father who's fighting for his children. I remember times Bonnie and I, we have, I tell you times of our family, and we sit our kids down every once in a while. Our kids are so great, they're so great. But you have these moments. You know, you can't have them a lot. You just can't do this a lot. But I remember a time sitting with our kids, And I have a very vivid memory of Caleb once. And this was years ago. He was like 12, 13 years old. And he was being, you know, the total idiot at the time. Yeah, he knows, he knows, he knows, he knows. And he was talking about his friends. And, oh, my friends, they love me and you don't love me. And I remember looking at him and saying, I'm the best friend you've got. I'm going to pin your ears back right here, but I'm the best friend you've got. And that's the spirit I'm coming to you with today. If you've created a false Christ, my calling you away from that today with some force, I'm the best friend you've got today. Reverend, the late Reverend James Boyce, pastor for years at the 10th Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Out of anguish, it was in his own soul as he looked at his church and the church in America. He asked this question. Why is the church in America and our own church so weak? why are we able to claim more conversions and enroll more church members than ever before but have less impact on our culture than ever before why are so many christians indistinguishable from the world well i'm sure i can't answer every nuance of what those reasons are but maybe at least in part in a bigger part than again we'd like to admit it's because we are obeying believing and loving a false christ that we have created to serve ourselves maybe it's because we are obeying believing and loving of Christ who saves us but doesn't change us. This last week I got the most amazing letter, and among the things that were amazing about it is not only what it says, but that a letter like this would come on this week when I'm preaching this sermon. It came from a woman in our church, been here for quite a while, and I think from the letter she assumed that we were done with 1 John, with last week's sermon, we came to verse 20. I think I could understand why people would think that was it. And so she was reflecting in the letter just some of the things that she had gotten from the study and what we had talked about. Among the things she said, she said this. I grew up, Dave, in the evangelical Christian culture that said, walk the aisle, say the words, and you have just done the magic formula. So you're in for eternity. No one dared question whether the Spirit of God had been involved. Just get them in, manipulate the emotions, sing 11 verses of Just As I Am until they succumb to the pressure, walk the aisle, and presto, they're in. We called it evangelism. How many got saved this weekend? Well, but many of the people who took that walk and made that profession remained even to this day entirely unchanged. But they had their fire insurance, so we did our evangelistic job not to worry, they're going to heaven. How do you know? Well, they prayed the magic prayer. God waved a magic wand. she goes on I don't mean to sound like the church lady and quite frankly my concern is not so much to judge the behavior of the masses but to reconcile in my own mind and heart the behaviors and lack of evidence of the spirit's activity in the lives of people that I love and then this turns very poignantly and painfully in my immediate family of brothers and sisters my own husband and children and in-laws I know of 30 people who have all made professions of faith over the last 30 years, but only six of them have any visible, discernible evidence of the life of God in them. All of them were brought in under the assumption that walking the aisle and public confession is what saves you. And at once saved, always saved. I believe that once saved, always saved. But what is saved? None of them seem concerned. in the least at the lack of life in them, for they've all done what they thought was required of them to get into the kingdom of heaven. Some from the younger generation who attended a very fundamentalistic school frequent now strip joints and gay bars just for laughs and regard any form of piety as foolishness. Recently, one of these young people at a family gathering was beginning to verbally, out loud, feel and express conviction for that behavior, which, by the way, is a sign of life. But was told quickly by her Christian sibling that, hey, there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ. You're forgiven before you even do it. They then began to make plans for another excursion to the strip bar. Oh, by the way, they all attend church here. Really. then maybe it's time we have a father talk. And if the analogy of me being a father and you being a child feels at all condescending, then take off the father imagery as applying to me and let me come to you as a brother, to a brother or to a sister in the faith. I need to tell you something. You need to know something. what you need to know is this that for people to think and live the way that that letter I just read describes requires a false Christ a Christ that you have created to serve you a Christ that winks at sin that maybe even thinks it's funny a Christ that endorses how you already think, what you already value what you already love and blesses how you already live it is a Christ that promises to save you but doesn't change you. You have a false Christ. You are believing in an alternative to the real deal. And you may be more lost than people you think are pagan because they didn't say the magic words. And the reason you may be more lost than them is that you think you have the real deal. the pagan at least knows I don't know God so talk about God would be a new thing for him you are obeying, believing and loving a Christ but it's the one you made up to serve you but you already think believe, love, value last week in verse 16 we moved into that kind of troubling weird verse where John speaks of seeking of seeing people who are committing a sin not leading to death. Remember that? And what we need to do with people who are committing sin not leading to death is help them and pray for them and get in a ring with them and give them grace and call them to holiness. But that's not a hopeless case, people falling into sin. That's not. But then he says this weird thing. It was troubling. We had to deal with it. There is a sin that leads to death. In light of what I'm talking about this morning, Could I tell you what the sin leading to death isn't? Sin leading to death isn't going to a strip bar. Whoa, you think that's okay? No. No, it is sin. Verse 17 says, for all unrighteousness is sin. But it isn't necessarily the sin that leads to death. But you know what might be the sin that leads to death? That has the mark of death? The sin that has the mark of death might be going to a strip bar and thinking God just thinks that's funny. The sin that leads to death isn't sleeping with your girlfriend on Friday night. It might be sleeping with your girlfriend on Friday night and thinking God just goes, oh, that's great. Why is that the sin that leads to death? Because what it tells me about you is that your perception of Christ is the perception that you have created. And what that means is you are obeying, Believe you are living consistently with the Christ that you've made up. And what that means is this. The Christ of Scripture, who is the one true God, has no access to you because you're worshiping, obeying, and believing a whole different Christ. Follow that? That means you are in a very dangerous place. My little children, guard yourself from idols. Keep yourself from false perceptions of Christ that are not true about him. Why? Because a false perception of Christ undermines and mitigates against believing, obeying, and loving, which just happen to be the three fundamental characteristics that mark out people who are truly born of God. First, false perception of Christ that he's kind of a pushover. You say the magic word, he weighs a magic wand. He's not very smart. He doesn't know what's really inside. He just reads the label on the outside. The second false perception, and I do not have time to unpack this, but I cannot give you that first false perception, as strong as that is, without coming back with this other false perception, that quite frankly might hear what I'm saying this morning and go to this other false perception. And that is this, no, Christ is not a pushover, he's a tyrant. That's a false perception too. It would sound like this, oh yes, Dave's preaching right today, Jesus really is God, and because he is God, you better obey him. And it comes with that stern kind of you better obey him. In fact, the spirit of Christ toward you is like the abusive father or mother you had. It's kind of like this, one false move, you're dead. And you know what? Here's what dawned on me about this analogy of a human father or mother. If you had abusive father or mother, you know what I bet about you? I bet when he came home, you worried a whole lot about whether you were obeying or not. Whether you were doing anything that was going to make him mad. And so, even if you had an abusive parent, they probably got you to obey. But why did you obey? Because you were scared to death. You didn't want to get smacked. One false move, you're dead. And you might have been the best little girl there ever was. But you lived in fear. Three marks of those truly born of God is obeying, believing, and what? Loving. You don't know a thing about the loving because you've got a false perception of Christ too. See, you may believe he is that dominant, strong, scary parent But you don't believe he's good You believe he's God Because he's God you better obey But you don't believe he's gentle You don't believe he loves you With an everlasting love And you don't believe his heart toward you is tender and the reason he disciplines you is because you bother him not because he wants to call you into life and if your perception of Christ is that he's this tyrant this abusive father or mother the whole spirit you have around your Christianity is I better never blow it, I hope I don't blow it and there's this fear thing and if you ever do sin, you can't even go back home you can't even go back home because he'll just smack you good. And I'm here to tell you that if that's your false perception of Christ, if that's your perception of Christ, you could never trust, I could never trust that Christ with my heart. And if that's my perception of Christ, I promise, this is what my relationship with a Christ who's just going to smack me is, I will guard my heart, I will hide my heart, I will anesthetize my heart, I might do my duty in church, and I might do my duty. But I will develop what we talked about a few weeks ago, a false self that looks good on the inside, and I'll be dying on the outside. I will obey, but I won't know a thing about love, to which John says, Oh, little children, you have a false Christ. For God, as revealed in Christ, is love. And that this God who is love has set his love on us, He loved us first. And driven by His love for us, He has pursued us, was willing to pay an enormous price to win, reconcile, and redeem us. All of that coming with this amazing promise that if you have the courage and faith to open wide your heart to the furious love of God, that love will come into you and change you. It will change who you are. It will transform how you live, who and what and how you love. So open wide your heart to the furious love of God. But just know this. The kind of love that God moves into people with will not leave you alone. It will not passively accept your false perceptions of him or rival gods or rival lovers. so if you accept Jesus as your personal savior I hope you do but here's the deal get ready for the ride of your life get ready for the adventure of a lifetime an adventure that is going to be marked by obeying, believing and loving and quite frankly the picture I have of my walk of faith with God has been one of obeying, believing and loving and he's constantly calling me into what looks like a forest. Abraham was called by God into a land he didn't know. And I'm constantly feeling like God's saying, okay, come a little further. Go into this place. And he'll call me into something that I'm scared of. I feel ill-equipped to do. I don't know how to do. And he'll say, just come. You come. You follow. Put one step in front. But it's dark. Trust me. Believe me. Obey me. Love me. And I will change. Oh, I will change you. I will give you an eternal kindness and you will know me now. Heaven then, yeah. Life now. Why would you bother? Obeying, believing, going into these arenas of life where he calls you for sanctification. Arenas, and by the way, when I say arenas, well, you scary places. You know, I'm talking about something very practical. Here's the scariest place for me. Not the scariest. I will teach you how to love your wife. No, I want to tell you what that really looks like. You ready to go? Yeah. Okay. Then walk into this. You ready to lay down your life for her? Let's talk about love. And I'd like to teach you how to love your kids. And I'd like to show you how to treat your... And I'd like you to come with me into this forest scary area and talk to you about your anger that you have a hard time controlling. I would like you to come and look at that. And this addiction over here, you think, I'd like to talk to you about the thirst you have and bring your thirst to me and start drinking. Why would anybody bother to do that? Here's why. Here's why. Because we believe that the Son of God has come. That's why. Verse 20. He has given us understanding in order that we might know him who is true. And we are in him who is true. In his Son, Jesus Christ. And he is the true God. The gateway into this eternal kind of life. So little children, guard yourselves from idols. Keep yourselves from cheap substitutes. Why? Because if you don't, you'll miss the adventure. You'll miss the eternal kind of life now. All three services have changed. Well, this is the third service, so how to close. How to close. How do we wrap this up? I'm going to give you a word. I've given both two services before. It's an old-fashioned word that needs to be resurrected. It's this. If you have a false perception of Christ, the word around that is repent. Change your mind about who you believe Jesus to be. Beginning of the first service, when we were in prayer, Scott Bernstein had a picture that he got from last night's service that he was at. He shared it with the group, and I feel compelled to share it with you. He said, you know, when Moses was up on the mountain in Exodus and he was getting the law, The people grew weary of waiting and decided that God wasn't good, and so they decided to fashion their own God. And they made a false God, and they made one that would be their own creation and fit their needs and do what they wanted. And when Moses came down, he confronted that and said, you need to destroy this idol and grind it up, grind up the false idol. And then he did this thing. He told them to do this thing that's really kind of mean. it just sounds so mean. He says, and they ground it up, they ground up the false God and then they drank it and they said drink it and it made them sick. So I think our false perceptions, you know, I want to leave people feeling really warm and gooey and wonderful but I think, I think we need to let our false perceptions of Christ make us sick. because we're missing the eternal kind of life. I want to close by inviting you into a prayer. And this was early in the week, middle of the week. I was by myself. This sermon wasn't fully prepared yet, but I knew where it was going. And I was alone with God, not about the sermon, just about me. And I did this thing that when I prayed it, I just got to tell you, This is going to help me be gentle with you around this. It just scared me, what I prayed. I began to just notice a shaking in me as I prayed it. It was this, God, I want you to show me. No, I don't. Yes, I do. No, I don't. Yes, I do. I want you to show me my false perceptions of you. I want you to show me the things, the ways that I have recreated you to fit what I already think and what I already love and what I already value and how I already want to live and how I've just kind of stuck you into my own idolatry. I want you to show me my idols. And then I said, oh, God, be merciful. Don't do it all at once, because if you show me all my false perceptions, I don't think I'll be able to get off the floor. Do you know that's true? Do you feel even a fear around that? If God right now this morning revealed to you, Boom! All the false perceptions you have of Christ. If he did that, I don't think we'd be able to get off the floor. We're all in this, folks. Here's my invitation. Would you pray that prayer? Could I lead you in that prayer? I mean, I have no way of knowing who is and who isn't. And so you're totally on your own. But I want you to close your eyes. By your head. And I'm going to say some words, and you can just repeat them if you want, but there's no magic in my prayer. You just take it to God. You're Jesus. John, under the anointing of your spirit, through this word has been telling us that you are the one true God. We just acknowledge, we have to acknowledge, we just know it's true that in ways we don't even know, we have recreated you with great disrespect. have formed you into being the way we already think and created you so that you endorse what we already do and what we already value. And I pray that you be merciful to us and give us doses of this that we can handle, but we bring our heart to you right now and say we want to know you. So reveal to us all of our false perceptions so that we can be obeying, so that we can be believing, and that we can be loving the one who is the true God. Guard us, Father, from a perception of Jesus, of you that is the tyrant. Guard us from that perception that keeps us from opening wide our heart to you. But guard us from this perception of you that you're some kind of pushover who doesn't see what's real. Bring us into the light and the life of who you really are. So we can live. We pray these things in Jesus' name who is the one true God. And all God's people said, Amen.
