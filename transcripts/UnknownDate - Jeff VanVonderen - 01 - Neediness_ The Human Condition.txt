We're going to be talking about some of the messages that we've gotten in our lives and some of the ways that we've adjusted ourselves to try to overcome them. I really believe that it's important to understand our families of origin and the relationship systems that we've come from. Not so that we can blame other people for how we are, but more like understand some of the places that we've come from. The issue for us is not what people did to us or didn't do for us. The issue is how we learn to respond to that and survive that and make the best of that. And probably the ways that we have learned to live with those kinds of messages and relationship patterns worked at that time. But now we're down the road a ways, and some people still are using old relationship skills in their new relationships, and they don't work. And so it's a matter of getting unstuck for some people or just learning some new ways of doing things and moving on from there. So that's what we're going to be talking about over these next two weekends. The first session is about our neediness as human beings. And so that's what I want to talk about. I want to talk about the fact that we as human beings are needy, and that's not a good or bad thing. It's just a true thing. I think that there is basic kinds of needs that everybody has in terms of every area of their life, physical needs, spiritual, emotional, psychological needs, and everybody is equally needy. There is no one who is more needy than anybody else. Everybody is the same amount of needy. It's just that some people look more needy than others because they haven't had relationships in which those needs have been met. In terms of food and shelter kinds of needs, people in Ethiopia don't need food more than we need food. They need food the same as we need food. But they look like they need food more than we need food because they don't have food and we have food. So the same thing would happen to us if we didn't have that need met as it happens to them. And in the area of spiritual, emotional kinds of needs, it's the same thing. Some people look like they need love more than other people look like they need love, but it's not because they need it more. It's because they haven't had relationships in which they've gotten those needs met. Other people don't look like they need love as much as others, either because they're good pretenders or because they have had relationships in which the needs are met. So everyone is equally needy. It's not a good or bad thing. It's just a true thing. And even though we talk about it's okay to be needy, I don't think that a lot of us are. You know, in churches, we talk about verses like, when I'm weak, then I'm strong, and his power is perfected in my weakness, and we pay lip service to those kinds of concepts. But the truth is you just don't see a lot of weak people in churches. Church is kind of a place where you go to be put together and stuff, and we'll talk about that a little later. so I want to just suggest that everybody is needy and it's okay and I also want to suggest that a lot of us feel indicted for being needy and that's not necessary, it's okay to be needy about two and a half years ago I had back surgery on my back I had a disc rupture and it was my L5 S1 disc anybody know about that disc? the rest of you will find out about that disc But what happened was it was a very, very serious surgery, and the doctor compared it to trying to remove the tar paper off of a roof without touching the shingles. That's kind of what it was like, so it was a very big, big deal. And when they wheeled me up from the recovery room up to my room, I was on a dolly, and the nurse went over and pushed a button, and I said, what are you doing? Now, you have to understand, I'm barely awake. It's like I'm just finally awake enough and far enough away from the surgery, maybe an hour, hour and a half away from the actual surgery, that I can just kind of open my eyes and look over at her and see what she's doing. And I see her pushing this button. I said, what are you doing? She said, well, I'm getting some help to move you from the dolly onto your bed. I said, no, I can do this. And she said, no, you can't. And I said, yeah, I can. And before the nurses actually even got there, The way they do it is they take a big plastic board, you know, and then they grab the sheets and they slide you off onto this board, and then they move the board over here, and then they slide you back this way and kind of just dump you off of the sheets onto the bed. Before they could do that, I rolled myself, physically moved myself off, you know, two turns, like a double gainer or whatever that's called, okay, off of the cot onto the bed, and there I was. What a guy. But, see, that was about, for me, not being okay to need help. Do you understand that? Now, I didn't have this kind of insight at the time. I didn't know where that was coming from at the time. But that was one of the things that I learned about myself during this time of severe neediness. People told me when I was getting close to my surgery that this is going to be such a great thing. You know, I mean, yeah, surgery is bad, but you're going to have so much time, you know, and you're just going to get so close to the Lord and pray all the time and read your Bible. And I, frankly, was just too sick to pray and read my Bible and was kind of angry at the Lord, actually, because didn't he know how important I was and how could he let this happen to me? Kind of that's what I was thinking. Plus, I was the Midwest Regional Headquarters for Information on the Gulf War because it happened right during the Gulf War. Actually, I was watching CNN when it happened, and all I did all day long was sit and watch CNN. I wasn't supposed to lay flat for six weeks and not move, so I just watched CNN, and I watched the Beverly Hillbillies once in a while. but mostly I watched the Gulf War. And then people would call me up at the end of the day, and they'd say, what happened today? And I could tell them because I, you know. But I did learn some things about myself and about God during the time, and one of the things I learned is that I'm the guy who goes around telling everybody it's okay to be needy, but I hate being needy. I hate it. It's the worst thing. Asking for help. It's murder. I hate it. Five years ago, if I was carrying a bunch of boxes and I came to a door, and you came up and said, can I open the door for you? I'd say, no, that's okay, and I'd open the door. And you've seen people do this, you know. Four years ago, my back's starting to feel, you know, a little sore and stuff, so if you came up and asked me if you could open the door, I'd say, yeah, that'd be great, thanks. And three years ago, if I saw you coming in the region, you know, I'd say, could you please come and open the door for me? And now I'd have to ask you to carry the boxes. But that's because I hate this. I hate being needy. I hate needing help. So even though I think it really is okay, theoretically, to have needs, it bothers me a lot to be needy because of messages that I have gotten in my life. I'm the firstborn child son of a dysfunctional family, and I learned that if something needed to be done, I just do it. And I'm self-sufficient, and I can handle it, and just ask me. So for me to need help is really a hard thing. But what I've learned in this is that it really is okay, and you really don't lose points with God for needing help. The three needs I want to talk about this evening, three basic needs, there's lots of needs, I think that God has created us with needs that only he can meet. And I think also that he is the source then of meeting those needs, and he gives us resources through whom those needs can be met, but they still are resources from the source, and a lot of times what happens is that we try to turn our resources into sources, and then they fail, because we have needs that only God is big enough to meet. And the first need that we have is the need to know that we're loved and accepted. But in order for this need to be met, in order for this to really get in and build us and strengthen us, it has to be without strength. So this is love that's based on the fullness of the one who is giving it and not on the performance of the one who is getting it. This is not love if you do something, when you do something, because you do something, if you stop doing something, then I'll accept you or then I'll approve of you. This is just a gift, and it's regardless of performance. It has nothing to do with it. That other thing, love and acceptance, if, when, because, that's what I would call earned love. And earned love is an oxymoron. Now, if you know what an oxymoron is, it's like two words that contradict each other rolled up into the same word. So an oxymoron would be sanitary landfill. That's actually one of my favorites. There just is no such thing as a sanitary landfill. Do you understand? So those two words don't belong with each other. And another one would be that I went over to this copy center over in Wayzata the other day, and you walk in, and right above the desk, there's a sign that says original copies, okay? There's no such thing as original copies, do you understand? Jumbo shrimp is an oxymoron, and those of you who diet slim fast, you know that slim fast is an oxymoron, and my favorite all-time one is country music. But the point is that these are two words that don't belong in the same phrase, you understand? Because they're a contradiction. And so earned love does not work. Now, I'm not saying that you can't try to get this, and I'm not even saying that if you do try to get this, you won't get something for trying. I'm just saying that it's not this, okay? If I know that you'll love me when I do something, if I do something, because I do something, because that's a need that I have, I might figure out what it is I need to do to get that from you. And so let's say that this marker represents the behavior that if I know that if I do this behavior, you'll love me and accept me, then I do the behavior and then you'll love me and accept me. But you see, your love will never build me or strengthen me or set me free because it's not about me. It's about my behavior, which means I really still don't have it. But I still need it, and I know how to get it, I think, anyway, which is to do more behaviors, and I happen to have a whole bunch of them here tonight. So I start cranking out all these behaviors, and you keep approving me. Of course, then I have to worry if you don't like green as much as you like black here, and also if this blue one falls off, then maybe you're going to withdraw the approval that I got on the basis of that. And so I do all this stuff, trying to earn this love and acceptance from you, and when all is said and done, I'll be more tired from having a relationship with you than when I started. Because not only did I not get your love and acceptance, but I paid a lot to not get it. You understand? Love and acceptance that's based on performance makes you more tired. Think about the relationships that you have in your life. And if you have relationships with people where their approval of you either blatantly or at least seems kind of waiting for you to perform. Okay, so their approval, their acceptance of you is based on something that you do. If you pay attention to that, what you'll notice is that you get more tired as time goes on, not less tired. Or you get tired just being with them for the weekend or something like that. Because you never get what the promise is, but you put forth a lot of effort to not get it. Relationships that function the way that God intended them to function in our families and in our churches, relationships that function the way that God meant them to function make us less tired, not more tired. Because they affirm on a horizontal level, they affirm here what's true here, which is that our acceptance and our being loved is based on someone else's performance besides ours. And we need to know that. So it's not based on our performance. And I'm not even saying that our performance doesn't matter and that it isn't good to act certain ways and it isn't good to avoid acting other ways. I'm just saying that our approval as a person, our value or acceptance as a person is not based on how we act. And for those of us who are believers, it's based on how someone else has acted on our behalf, and it's settled. It's not for grabs over and over again. Tomorrow, if you don't perform, you don't lose it. So this kind of stuff I'm talking about here is like a carrot out here on a stick, and then you're always trying to get it. And some families and some people, I think the employment situation for a lot of people is that there's this thing out here that you have to get. And so what it does is it actually generates most of our behavior, you know, because we're always trying to get this thing that we never get. Those of you who have family relationships where it feels like somehow you're supposed to perform well enough to finally earn somebody's approval, you just need to pay attention to that because probably if you had been able to do that, if it had been within your power to actually pull it off, you'd have done it by now. Understand this? So the issue isn't that you haven't tried hard enough. Those of you who have been in those kinds of relationships, the issue isn't that you haven't tried hard enough. The issue probably, in spite of the fact that you tried very hard, is that this isn't something that you can earn. Either it's free or you don't get it. I had someone in counseling several years ago who, when she was 20 years old, she had a relationship problem with her mom where they had a big split in their relationship. It kind of took a fork in the road when she was 20, and when she was 30 years old, they stopped talking completely, so they didn't talk to each other. Now it's 20 years down the road still. So she's 50, her mom's 70 or however old, and they haven't spoken for 20 years. So her mom calls up the daughter and says, I'm dying. I have like six weeks to live. She caught something, and so she doesn't get to die of old age. She's going to die of some weird deal. And she says, it's not okay for us to end this way. We need to solve this. And so she's going to fly from New Jersey to Minneapolis, this mom, 70-year-old mom. And so the woman's in my office, and she's panicky and also very hopeful, but this is a big deal. And she's worried that they're not going to say everything and that she's going to get intimidated or that she's going to get mean or that the mom's going to get mean or something like that. But it's very important to her that they say everything and that they don't hold back and that they say the nice things and the hard things and the whole bit. So the mom comes into town, and this woman in her life is pretty laid back, pretty kind of a modest person and non-pretentious in her dress. She wears sweatshirts and blue jeans, that's about it, you know, her standard dress, and lives in a modest, you know, small, modest house. But her mom is coming into town, this is a big deal. So she goes out and buys three new outfits of clothes, one for every day that mom's going to be there and have some friends come over and redecorate the house and all this stuff, you know. And then mom comes into town, and they do the deal, And they say it all, and it's great, and it's awful. Any of you who ever had a conversation like that know what that's like. It's like terrible and wonderful both at the same time. And then Mom leaves, and 10 days later or 12 days later, this woman's in my office, and she's telling me this story about how everything happened the way she wished it would. It was great, you know. But then she starts to cry, so she's sobbing, just like gut-wrenching, horrible, sobbing tears, you know. And so when she was able to answer, I asked her, can you tell me what these two things are about? Because here's this really neat story over here, and then over here is all this sobbing and stuff. And they don't match, you know, so what's that about? She said, I still don't know if my mom's okay with me, because I didn't give her me. I gave her clothes that I don't usually wear, and I gave her little knickknacks that I don't usually have on the wall. I don't know for sure that if I had come to the door and said, okay, here is me, you know, if she would have been okay with me, she would accept me. Well we need to know. One of the things we need to know is that. That people would accept us. We don't need to know if people would accept us if our house was clean. Clean your house. You know it's okay. But we don't need to know if people would accept us if our house is clean. We need to know if people would accept us even if our house isn't clean and even by the way if they're not okay with how not clean our house is they still accept us. I have counseled people who spend most of their life trying to get a clean house so someone will accept them on the basis of the clean house. So they work their buns off all day long to get a stroke at the end of the day because somebody's going to come home and walk in and go, oh, and give them a yes based on what they're looking at here, or they're bringing somebody over, or somebody's coming next weekend, and so they work like crazy trying to get this a certain way so they can earn somebody's approval based on this. And so what happens is that they get it done, and then the person walks in, and they look around, and they go, oh, wow, I don't know how you do this. Well, I know how you do it. How you do it is you take bags and boxes, and you scrape off the flat areas into these things, and then you hide them in closets. So, like, do you think that I make this stuff up or what? And you hide it in places, you know, and actually the best place to hide it, if you have one, would be the master bedroom shower, because even if they find it in there, they can't admit that they were in there looking. So what happens is that you finally get what you've been trying to get all day long, but even when you get it, you don't let it in. Even if you get it, you don't let it in, because you know if they knew what you knew, which is that the stuff is in the closet all along anyway, that they wouldn't be giving you the stroke. See, this doesn't work even when you do it. And people that live in a way where they're trying to get someone else's approval based on their performance, you know, sometimes they don't give up, and they get really good at it, and they even get what it is they're striving to get, and when they get it, it bounces right off because they know that that person doesn't really know all the facts like they know, and if they knew the facts, they wouldn't be given this approval in the first place. And other people, they give up. You know, they try for a while, and then they finally say, forget it, you know. I mean, it doesn't work to try hard anyway, so why try? I remember one time when our oldest daughter was about five years old, we asked her to get some brettes and put them in her hair to go to church. And so now, you know, it was about two minutes, and we're heading out the door to leave, and she didn't have the brettes in her hair. And we said, well, we asked you to put the brettes in your hair. How come you didn't do it? And she said, because you just take them out and put them back in anyway. so I thought I'd save the energy now this is a five year old kid figuring this thing out that's a very big confrontation on us because it's like if you try really hard and when you're done it's not going to be good enough anyway why try and some people process that and get stuck in whole patterns of behavior that grow out of that kind of thing so the first need that we have as human beings is to know that we're loved and accepted But one other thing about this need is that you aren't going to find most of the people that are going to do this for you. If you're into taking polls, okay, like if you need 100% of the people that you have relationships with to give this, you're going to be very disappointed. If you need 51%, you're going to be disappointed. My feeling is that you're going to have three or four or five or half dozen people in your whole life that are going to really do this for you. And if you're taking a poll where you need more people to accept you than not, you're going to miss the four or five that are right there, you see. But if you're not taking a poll and you're just looking for relationships where this happens, then you'll notice when it does happen, and those will be the relationships that set you free and help you become who God made you to be, you know, just allow you to grow and be in your process and stuff. So don't take polls about this, because if you take a poll, even if you, you know, When you're in a relationship setting or some kind of setting with a bunch of people, even if everybody likes you and one person doesn't, when you drive on the way home, who's the one that bothers you? It's like the one even weighs heavier than the 99% that still are okay with you. See, that's what happens when you take polls. But very seldom you're ever going to get 99% anyway. You might get 5% or 10%, but if you're taking a poll, you'll miss them. So don't take polls about this. Just pay attention. and the relationships in which you get less tired are the ones probably where you're accepted regardless of how you perform. And those are very rare and very great. That's what I think. Second need is that we need to know that we're worthwhile, that we have worth. This, another way of saying this would be that we have value, that we're capable, you know, that we matter, that our life has meaning, that we're here for a reason. There's a teaching in Christianity that says that we are unworthy. And the thing about this concept of unworthy is that this is a true thing. What this communicates in the context of Christian theology is that we don't deserve what God did. When God sent his son, when God gave us redemption and all that, we didn't deserve it. And that's a true teaching, and that's okay. And if I was going to give a teaching on how unworthy we are, it would sound like good news. It wouldn't sound like bad news. It would sound like good news, because the issue with gifts is not about deserving. Do you understand this? Deserving gifts is an oxymoron. You don't have to deserve gifts. Gifts are free. There's no such thing as deserved gifts. But a lot of people have a problem with receiving or giving gifts for free, because they feel like they don't deserve them. And maybe you have someone in your life, when you give them a gift, they go, oh, you shouldn't have. Well, see, gifts aren't a should have. Do you understand this? Gifts are just a free expression of love. Oh, you shouldn't have. Oh, you didn't have to do that. Or what can I do for you? Or, okay, I'll let you do this this time, but I'm going to do it next. You can pay this time, but I'll pay next week. And because they just have a hard time receiving something for free because they're really aware of not deserving it, and plus it's not okay to not deserve it. I'm saying it's okay to not deserve it, especially in terms of God's grace. God's grace is about us getting what we don't deserve, and God's mercy is about us not getting what we do deserve. And they're both kind of on the same coin, different sides of the same coin. Mercy and grace is about not getting what we do deserve, and getting what we don't deserve. And it's okay. So when my brother got divorced, my grandmother went and took back all the presents that she gave him because he didn't deserve it anymore. Understand this? But see, he didn't deserve it in the first place. I mean, she didn't maybe realize that or know him that well or I don't know what was going on because he really was kind of a stinker. But it's like all of a sudden he's this divorced person and now he doesn't deserve this expression from my grandmother, so she went to his house and actually physically took back stuff from him. This is somebody in your life who gives you a present, and then two years later they want to know where it is, and they want to make sure that's not hidden, and you didn't give it away or sell it at a garage sale and all that kind of stuff. See, if someone gives you a present, a gift, you can even sell it at a garage sale, because it's yours. Do you understand? If someone gives you something as a gift, it's yours. But if it doesn't feel like it's really yours, then it wasn't really a gift. There was a string on it all the way back to Wichita, and now they're tugging on it. You want to know where it is. One of the ways that this unworthy teaching, though, has been mistaught, I think, is in that a lot of people have really been beat up with how unworthy they are. So they've just been reminded and hammered on about how unworthy they are, that what it does is it gets them looking at themselves and they go, oh, no, it's true. And then they try to get worthy in order to deserve the gift, which you can't ever do anyway, and plus you don't need to do. And so think about this. When you goof up or you stumble or you sin or whatever you want to call it, if you are rebellious or you hit the wall or whatever, is your first inclination to run back toward God as fast as you can or is your first inclination to clean yourself all up and get everything all straightened up and then go back to God because right now you kind of really don't deserve it too much. So you kind of try to deserve it. And that's because we've had this taught incorrectly to us. It's okay to be unworthy. And we don't have to be worthy. And that should set us free. But the other way that this teaching has been mistaught or taught incorrectly is that worthiness has gotten mixed up with worth. Unworthy does not mean worthless. There are two separate kinds of concepts. Worthy is about deserving. Worth is about value as a person. And actually, as human beings, we have incredible worth to God. You can tell what something is worth by what somebody is willing to pay to get it. And so if any of you have bought a car recently, when you write a check for the car and hand the car person the check, it's because you believe that you're getting as much car for the amount of money you're paying for the car. Right? I mean, if you thought you were getting less car than the amount of money you were paying for the car, you'd get a different car. Hopefully you would, or you try to talk them down in price. So now whether you actually are getting as much car as the amount of money you think you're paying for the car, that's another thing. But you think you are. Same thing when you buy a house. You think you're getting as much house. You can tell what something's worth by what someone's willing to pay to get it, and you can tell what we're worth by the price that God was willing to pay to have us in relationship with him. Not because we were worthy, but because we were worth a lot and he loved us. Understand this? Now, this kind of sense of worth and value and those kinds of things, that kind of all is hard to separate, that we matter, that we have meaning. I'll give you an example, though. I had a woman in counseling who loved to paint, and she would rather paint than eat. Actually, when she was a kid, her parents would have to go drag her out of the bedroom and say, you can't paint anymore. You've got to come and eat supper, you know, because that's what she'd rather do. and when she was about 14 she entered a painting in a state fair contest or something like that and she won a blue ribbon. So her parents threw a party and invited all the grandmas and grandpas and aunts and uncles and hung the painting on the wall and put a light on it and stuff and had three beans out and had the lime jello with the carrots on the bottom and the mayonnaise on top. It was a gala event. But anyway, But see, halfway through the party, the dad was over looking at the picture, and he said, sweetie, come over here. So she came over, and he said, this is really great, but don't you think it would have been better if you just would have moved this over here? And she said, you know, when he said that to me, I thought to myself, I thought I was finished with that picture. And the judges thought I was finished with that picture, understand? Because they gave me a blue ribbon. But what he said to me was that I wasn't really finished with that picture. And come to think of it, that's mostly what he ever said to me. And not only did he tell me that I wasn't finished with that picture, and not only did he mostly ever tell me that I wasn't finished with what I did, that I wasn't good enough, but he also was telling me, by telling me this, that I wasn't even capable of telling if I was finished with the picture. Like I always needed someone out here to come along and say, yes, now it's okay because inside I wasn't capable of telling, even though she was the artist and he wasn't. Do you understand this? And she said, now I'm an adult and it's really hard for me to finish things because, you know, when I'm doing this project, it's really hard for me to say, okay, now I've invested enough in this and, yeah, it's not perfect, but I've worked hard and that's good enough and now I'm going to do this, okay, that's finished, now I'm going to do this, that's finished, do this, that's finished. She says, I'm doing this one and this one and this one and this one all at the same time, keeping them all unfinished because I'm not sure they're really finished, even though probably they are. Do you understand? They probably are good enough because if she were going to err, she would err on probably investing too much instead of not enough based on where she's come from, you see? See, I think that some people keep their whole lives in a state of unfinishedness as a defense against criticism, even if the criticism isn't even coming, okay? Even if they're just anticipating the criticism and even if the voice of criticism, They're never actually going to hear with their ears. They have it in their head. And so what happens is that they keep the projects unfinished, and then if someone comes up and says, well, that's not good enough, they can say, well, it's not finished. And then they can finish it. Try writing a book sometime. I have some books out, but try writing a book sometime, because when you write a book, and then there it is, it's a book, it's finished. And if someone looks at it and says, well, that stinks, it's finished. I mean, there's nothing you can do about it. Do you understand? It's the way it is. The book that I wrote about this kind of stuff was called Tired of Trying to Measure Up. When I wrote my first book, Good News for the Chemically Dependent, the publisher did not edit it. In other words, they just kind of published it almost word for word the way I wrote it. And actually, I wrote it on a yellow legal pad. That's what I wrote, and I sent it in. And I interpreted that as like, oh, I'm a pretty good writer. I mean, they didn't even have to even touch this thing. Okay, well, when I got my second manuscript for my second book, Tired of Trying to Measure Up, I sent it in to my publisher, and I got back the first ten pages of this book, and there was more red marks on the book than my typing from the book. Do you understand? It was marked all over the place. And then there's a letter from the senior editor, and she said, We like your project, And, you know, you're probably going to be around for a long time as a Christian writer, so you should figure out how to write. And we want you to do with the rest of the book what we did with these first ten pages. And I looked at this thing, and I put that back in the envelope and did not touch it for six months. Because I could not look at that, because that was so much about me, do you understand? Even though it wasn't about me, because after about six months. Now, you have to understand how ironic this is. I'm the guy who goes around saying it's not about you, okay? But this was about me. It felt like it was about me. And after about six months, I got brave enough to open up this thing, and I looked at it, and you know what? They had not touched the content. The content was exactly the same. What it was was all form and sentence structure and things like that. And I went, wow. So I said, okay, this is great. I can do this because it's not about me. Now, see, even if it had been about me, because of what Christ has done, it's still not about me. But the problem is that you can't see Christ and you can see the red marks all over the book. It's really hard. See, that's the fight of the Christian life is to keep getting our sense of identity and value from a source we can't see. When all this tangible evidence is right there in our face and we can see things and hear things and remember things, you know, that say you're not okay. And then we've got this other thing that says we are and that's the fight. Well, so I wrote back and I said, you know, you're asking me to fix my book and I don't think it's broken. Okay? It doesn't mean it's not. I just don't think it is. It's like I look at it and it looks great to me. Okay? So you need to give me an editor. And besides that, I'm too old to learn how to edit. And plus I broke both of my arms. And I gave them this whole list of all these, you know. Seriously, I did. I made a big list of all the reasons why I'm not going to edit this book. And they gave me an editor. And it's okay. It's great. It was great. And the last book that I wrote, Families Where Grace Is In Place, the person sent back my manuscript with 150 pages less than what I sent and never touched the content. And you see, but I had learned a lesson the first time because otherwise it's like, there it is. And now that's my project and it says you're not okay. And I had to sort through some of these things to realize that it's not about that. It's about my performance as a writer. And, you know, maybe I could use some less run-on sentences or something like that. Okay, so we need to know this too. I'll give you another example about a painter. When I was counseling over at Passages, I had this teenager come in, 14-year-old guy, and he loved to paint, same deal. Could hardly get him away from painting. And in his family, they had a rule that you were supposed to try as hard as you could. You're supposed to do the best you can. And so he was doing the best he could. But then when you finished it, even if it was good, you weren't supposed to think it was good because that wouldn't be what? Humble. Yeah, that wouldn't be humble. So you're supposed to try as hard as you can to make it be good but then not notice if it's good. Okay, so then what would happen would be that the father, who had these rules, would bring company over, you know, and then he would bring the company over by the pictures and he'd say, look at this, isn't this great? Isn't my son a great painter? so it was okay for him to suck value off the painting for himself, but his son had to be humble and not notice that the painting was good. Of course, the company thought the painting was good because it was good. So they'd go, oh, this is really a good painting. Oh, you are really a great painter, to which he was supposed to respond. What? Oh, no, it's nothing, no big deal, which he did. And then the company would leave, and then his dad would holler at him for insulting the taste of the company. Understand how tiring this is? Doesn't this get tired? How would you like to do that for 18 years? And because there's a standard that you have to live up to, but when you live up to it, it moves. Or it's like trying to put your finger on a piece of mercury from a thermometer. You just can't quite nail this down, and you get more tired as time goes on. And the third need is that we need to know that we're not alone. We need to know that we're not the only ones that struggle with the things we struggle with or have the issues we have, other people have them too. Or even if somebody doesn't have exactly the same issue that we have, that they would come alongside of us and stand with us and support us through our issue. We need to know that. My experience is that churches tend to be so performance-oriented that church is not the place that you go to bleed on Sunday. Church is the place that you go to look the best that you looked all week long. So it doesn't matter what Monday through Saturday really was like, and it doesn't matter what Sunday morning really was like or even what the drive to church on Sunday morning was like, but when you get to the door and the greeters say, how are you doing? You say, fine, even if you're not fine, and you end up walking into a room full of 40 or 400 or 4,000 people and feel absolutely alone because you don't know for sure that you could say out loud what you really were going through and they'd still be okay with you, and we need to know that. And actually, if our value and our acceptance is based on someone else's performance besides our own, what can we not talk about in church? Church should be the place that is the most easy place to talk about stuff. But unfortunately for a lot of people, it's not. I remember about nine or ten years ago, and some of the people that are here from Open Door who worked here or were around then will remember this person, but my secretary came in one day wearing a button and said, I quit smoking. Now, you have to understand that in order to wear a button, in order to admit to having quit smoking, you are also admitting that you did smoke. You understand? And there were people in the church here at Open Door that were more upset about the fact that she had smoked than excited about the fact that she had quit smoking. You understand? I worked in a treatment center from 1977 to 1980 and saw all these kind of people getting well there. It was a secular treatment center. It wasn't about Jesus. It wasn't against Jesus. It was a 12-step program. You could have your higher power, and mine was Jesus. But people didn't have to. It wasn't their assignment to get Jesus as their higher power. But I just saw these people get well and families get well. And I thought, this is kind of weird, you know, because I've been in a church my whole life and never saw anybody get well in church. Now, see, that doesn't mean that people don't get well in church. It just means that, it might mean that, or it might mean that even if you do get well, it's not okay to talk about what you got well from in the first place, which means that you're going to take longer to get well, is all it means. You know, if someone loses their job, we say it out loud. You know, now maybe we wouldn't in a big church anymore like this, but we'd find a way to tell somebody about it, understand? You know, in a smaller church, we'd say, Brother so-and-so lost their job. Let's all pray, you know, anybody have a job for them? Or let's pray that God gives them a job. Or if they're going to have gallbladder surgery next Tuesday, we say so-and-so's having surgery. Let's pray. And then the surgery goes okay, and we say, the surgery went great, thanks to the Lord. But would you ever hear someone stand up and say, so-and-so just figured out that they're an alcoholic and they decided to go to treatment, and let's all pray for them. I mean, wow, see, I think that's a praise God for sure. So-and-so just came back from six months of counseling to figure out how to quit beating up his wife. Well, see, I think that's really good news. That's great news. But could you ever say that out loud in some places? No. And so you end up feeling alone in one of the places that God gave us to not feel alone in. That's why there's 51 and others in the New Testament that talk about the relationships among and between Christians. There's a not alone verse. There's lots of not alone verses. The one I want to tell you about is 1 Corinthians 10.13. It says, no test, no temptation, actually in the Greek it's test. No test is overtaken you, but such as is common to man. So right on the surface, what this is saying is that the thing you're in is common to man. You're not the only one that ever had this. Other people have had this too. Lots of people, as a matter of fact, it's common. But the word test there is really the key point here because a lot of us don't understand this word test, and so we handle tests incorrectly. I was reading an article in Christianity Today about maybe eight years ago, and it was lamenting the fact about how we as Christians have become easternized in our way of thinking about Scripture. And I thought, easternized? You know, that's kind of weird because the Bible was written east of here. Do you understand this? It was written in the Middle East. And actually some eastern thinking would maybe be helpful in understanding the Bible because that's how they thought when they wrote it. And I think our issue for a lot of people is not that we think about it in an eastern way but that we think about it in a Western way, and so we can't understand some of the stuff that is in there. We assume that the Bible is kind of an American book, which it's not. And one of the ways that we think Western is when we think about God and the Trinity. So when I say God the Father, or God, Moses said, who shall I say sent me? God said, tell him I am. That's a verb. You understand? I am is a verb. How do you put your arms around I am or pin that down? You can't. When we think about God, we think about God in noun ways. So we think God the Father. Now picture God the Father right now. Do it. And most people picture this really old guy, like old as dirt guy. And he's sitting on a throne, and he's got a white robe on, and a white beard, and he's really old. And then Jesus the Son is younger. Picture him. He's younger. Which he isn't, but we think he is. We picture that he is. and then the Holy Spirit's like the speedy delivery guy who goes around. It's all very Western ways of thinking about stuff. And another way, I heard John Wimber give an illustration of this where he was saying that when Paul got bitten by a snake on the island of Malta when they shipwrecked on the way to Rome, he was gathering some sticks and he got bit by a viper. And the viper attached itself to Paul, which is different than rattlesnakes. You know, ralusnakes just hit you, but vipers actually latched on and didn't let go, which is really interesting in light of the fact that Jesus called the Pharisees a brood of vipers. Okay, so you have to kind of get the picture of what Jesus is trying to say about people that latch on and don't let go. And plus there's a ton of them and they multiply like crazy. But that's a different seminar. But the natives looked at this guy and they said, he must be a murderer. So when they said that, that was because in order to get the kind of deaths you're going to get from a viper bite, which absolutely was the worst way to die, you must have done the worst thing. So they're already assuming that there's some kind of supernatural intervention happening here. And then, of course, Paul doesn't die. And then they say this man must be a god. So what they were saying is that something supernatural happens when someone gets bit by a viper and doesn't die. And then Paul says, well, no, I'm not god. It is about God, though, but it's not me. But you're right, it is a God thing. But I'm not God. So their first impulse was to interpret this in a supernatural way, which is kind of Eastern. Even if the supernatural assessment is a little bit twisted, it's still a supernatural. Do you understand? Now, if Dave, who was running the sound, if he leaves during the break and walks out on the cement out there and a viper crawls out of the bushes and bites him and he doesn't die, we'd say he must not have been a viper. right or we'd say it must have been a really old viper or it must have been a bunch of people earlier in the day and didn't have time to get his venom back and that's why Dave didn't die which is all very western way of thinking about stuff but it's the same thing with the word test now think about this no test has overtaken you in western thinking in America what's the purpose of a test what's the goal of a test to get an A to look as good as you can test or pass or fail and the object is to look as good on a test as you can possibly look. That's Western. Eastern, tests are just something you go through. That's all. Tests are what they did to gold. When they would heat up the gold into liquid form, they would test the gold and some of the stuff that was embedded in the solid gold, once it was melted, would rise to the top and they'd scrape off the top so the gold was a little purer after the test than it was before the test. Tests don't cause anything. Tests find stuff. That's all. and so if I was to give you a calculus test right now it wouldn't make you not know calculus you already don't know calculus it would just find out how much calculus you don't know or if you knew calculus it would just find out how much calculus you did know that's all tests can do so the test is something that overtakes you in this verse it comes up and grabs you from behind the phone rings at 7 o'clock in the morning and you pick it up and your dad died. And all this stuff comes to the surface. The test has found you. It's come up and grabbed you. That didn't make that stuff be there about your parent. It just found what was there about your parent. That's all. And if you were close, it found the closeness. And if you were distant, it found the grief for being distant. But it didn't make it be there. It was already there. If you're in the grocery store and your 3-year-old is tipping over apple juice gallons and breaking them on the floor, it's not going to cause your parenting skills. It's going to find your parenting skills. that's all tests do no test has overtaken you but such as is common to man God is faithful who won't allow you to be tested above what you are able but with the test will provide the way of escape that you may be able to endure it the way of escape is through the test and the way I know that is it says he'll provide the way of escape that you may be able to endure it which means you can't endure a test that you haven't gone through. Do you understand? The escape is through the test. It's through the test. And God is faithful who has given us himself and the cross and the Holy Spirit and one another to help us go through the test so we can come out at the other end a little bit better than when we went in the front end. But in the meantime, we don't look so good. But what happens because of the way we think is that when a test comes, all this junk comes to the top and then we push it all back down and say, praise God anyway, you know, and then miss the point of the test because we're trying to pass. And tests aren't about passing, so we end up all alone again instead of taking advantage of all these resources that God, our source, has given us, primarily for us, our families, and the body of Christ. So these are three needs that we have that everybody has, and these are not negotiable. In other words, it's not negotiable whether people come out of our families or churches understanding or having a sense on the inside that they're loved and accepted and that they're worthwhile and that they're not alone. The best book that I know on parenting is a book called Self-Esteem, A Family Affair by Gene Clark. It's about affirming people, even at the same time that you might be disagreeing or disciplining behaviors that you hate, it's still about sending these kinds of messages to people. But you know, what about this book? It's not a Christian book. if you wanted to make a Christian book if you're a Christian all you'd have to do is turn to the very last page and write a line write a sentence write your own ending and all you'd have to write is and by the way where all this specialness comes from is a gift because of Jesus and you got a Christian book right now because this book is all about sending these messages to people that people need to have regardless of how they perform and see I almost think that we as Christians pastors and teachers and parents, we're afraid to give away this stuff too freely because if we do, then what's going to motivate people to keep doing good stuff? And so we want to motivate people by helping them feel bad instead of by building them up on the inside and then calling forth to the outside the lifestyle, the behaviors that are consistent with the strength and the fullness that is on the inside. So with that, I think I'll end this session. next session we'll talk about family systems and what shame and guilt is and what a shame-based system is. And at this point, are there any questions? Does anybody have any questions? Anything that you'd like me to clarify or that you didn't quite understand? Yes. Yes. The last book that I talked about was called Self-Esteem, A Family Affair. And the author's name is Gene, J-E-A-N Clark, with an E on the end. Winston Press. Yes? What was your statement on tests caused and tests fined? Yeah, the question is, what was my statement about tests causing versus test finding? What I said about that was that tests don't have the power on the outside to cause anything to be real on the inside. They just find what's real on the inside. And, you know, I've had people who have lost a child to death. You know, their parents and one of their children have died, and they say, ever since our child died, our relationship went down the drain and we lost our marriage. Well, see, the way they think about it is that the death of their child kind of caused the broken relationship, and my opinion is that the death of the child more found how disconnected they were in the first place, and because the reality of a strong relationship wasn't already there to deal with the loss, then it came to the surface. And I have other people talk about the same phenomenon and say, you know, we were never as strong as when that happened. We were, that was, that just brought us together like crazy. And see, I don't think it brought them together. I think it more like found how connected they were. And it provided an opportunity for the closeness that already existed in the relationship to come to the surface and be used in this incident. So tests don't cause things. Tests just find things. Any other questions? Yes. Just briefly, the guy that sucked value from the child, why did he do that? The question is about the guy who got a sense of value from the child's paintings is probably because in his life he didn't have relationships where he got a sense of value already, and so out of a sense of not being okay, You know, he's robbing the future relationships from what he's supposed to be there to provide. He's taking instead of giving that. And that's an example of this kind of dynamic passing down through generations. That would be an example of a family in which the children were there for the parents instead of the parents being there for the children. And, you know, in our family, somebody's supposed to be the adults, and hopefully it's the adults, right? but for a lot of people it's not the adults and then the kids have to perform to fill up the adults and the system passes on. Yes? How do you break that turn to earn when your relationships have been based on that, that earned love? How do you break that and turn it? Yeah. The question is how do you break the sense of or the pattern of trying to earn love in relationships when you've tried to do that a lot and how do you get out of that? And probably the first thing that needs to happen is just to realize that the fact that it hasn't been successful is not because you haven't tried hard enough, but it's more because you're trying to do something that's impossible in the first place. Because once you realize it really isn't possible, then you can give up trying to do it. And if you don't think it's impossible, then you have to keep trying to do it. So if you still think it's possible, and the fact is that it didn't happen because you didn't try hard enough, No, this is not just to you, but to everybody. If you still have relationships in which you think that you can finally one day do it good enough, and then finally you're going to earn this thing that you've been trying to get for 30 years and never did get, I suggest that you go try to do it on purpose once. Because most people who do that don't do it by trying hard to do it on purpose. They do it more like a standard operating procedure. Do you understand? So I'm saying if you're trying very hard to try to get a sense of okayness from the opinion of someone else, make it your life-consuming goal for the next six months. Do it on purpose. Don't just do it by accident. Don't just do it naturally. Do it on purpose. Go for it. And probably if you're not tired now, you will be by then, and then we'll have another conversation. A lot of people don't realize that the reason it hasn't worked is because it can't work. They think that the reason it hasn't worked is because they haven't quite yet found the right combination of things or the right big enough way to do it yet, and so they just keep trying over and over again. But when you realize that the problem is that it can't work, then you're a little freer than when you started. Anybody else? Yes. Then how do you have that need met? And it all starts with you, you need the love or acceptance. Yeah. So then you realize that you're not going to get it this way, but you still have that person, you know, to... Yeah, the question is, then how do you get that need met? Because probably maybe, I'm going to paraphrase what you said, probably what's driving you to keep doing that is because you have a sense in yourself of that need to be loved and accepted. And even that is about realizing that maybe this person isn't giving it to you because they don't have it to give to you, and then you need to include them in the 90% or 95% that you're not going to get that from, and then notice more clearly the 5% that you are, and ask them for it. Say, go to the people in your life, the few people, however many there are, that do accept you and that do give you affirming messages, and just say, you know, I'm going to need to have some real clear reminders here of who I am, and that I'm okay, and that I'm accepted, because I'm kind of burning some bridges over here, and it's a scary thing for me. And so I'm going to need you to be more aggressive about reminding me and finding out how I'm doing on my level of knowing I'm okay right now. It's going to be a difficult time. And if they are these people for you, they'll do it, especially if you ask clearly. Yeah, but my question is if you want to rebuild a relationship or like if it's a parental relationship or even work situation, either way, I mean, you want it to become whole again? Yeah. You want it. Yeah. Are you saying that there's no hope for that? Okay. No, that's a different question. That question is if this was a parental relationship, for instance, how would you be able to start rebuilding it? But the way you'd have to do that would be you'd have to tell the truth to this parent. You'd have to say something out loud about what you've been trying to do and how this isn't working. Because as you try hard all these years, all these times to do it, you're giving them the illusion, first of all, that it's better than it really is, and second of all, that you're actually powerful enough to pull it off if you just try harder. And it's almost like going on strike. It's almost like making a sign and saying, I'm not performing for you anymore. Now, you can say it however you want to say it, but we're going to have a relationship, but I can't do it anymore, and I've tried, and it didn't work, and so I'm not willing to jump through hoops for you. I'm just going to be real, take it or leave it, and then they're going to take it or leave it. But that's, even though it's a scary thing, and you can use nicer words than what I just said because I'm kind of conserving on time here, you know, but what's ironic about it is that that really is the only hope, the only hope to build a healthy relationship is for the relationship to look as bad as it really is, even though it seems like that's no hope. A relationship can start building on something that is really terrible if the really terrible stuff is all out here on the surface. But if it's under the surface and it's all covered up by a facade, then your pain and your tiredness is covered over by self-effort, and they don't know it's as bad as it is, and they think that you're probably okay with it. So...
