Amen. Amen. Thanks, Stephan. It's good to have him with us, isn't it? Amen. And the band. Thanks. You know, normally phone calls that wake you up in the middle of the night are not welcome things, But Saturday night, Bonnie and I got a phone call in the middle of the night that was from my son Caleb calling us to tell us about this. Yeah, baby. Oh, mercy. Preston David Johnson. His name came in at 8 pounds 15 ounces. Caleb's an avid fisherman, told me that's the slot size that are keeping him. Wendy, Caleb's wife, is just great. She's just doing great. Exhausted, as you can imagine. Caleb is thrilled, and so are we. You guys, it's just a weird thing when your kids start having kids. Bonnie and I were talking about this, being in a hospital room and seeing Caleb and Wendy with this little baby boy as dads. You remember. You remember like a movie the day that Caleb... Caleb was born two months after we came here to Open Door. We were 27 years old. Now he's having kids. This boy, he's gone now. He's a good man, and he's going to be a really good daddy. So we are very happy. Yeah, it's good. One little odd thing. It was a little strange. I mean, I just put together things, and I think it's interesting. Just something to watch. Bethel University won yesterday their second game in the playoffs. And, you know, wait, wait, wait. No, that's exciting. But on the same day Preston's born, come on. Come on. Come on. Oh, just keep your eyes out for that. Let's pray. Lord, I thank you for the work of your spirit and the context of our worship and the words of those songs that called us, actually, to what we're going to talk about this morning. And so what I pray for is that we would have eyes to see and ears to hear, but even more feet to follow you and your way, Jesus, our Rabbi. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Assuming that the most important things we need to know, if we're serious about being followers of Jesus, is the teachings of Jesus. We began several weeks ago, actually a few months ago in early September, to examine what some refer to as the greatest sermon ever preached, the Sermon on the Mount, because we just couldn't think of a better place to go to become familiar with the teachings of Jesus relative to life in the kingdom of God. It actually begins, as most of you know, in Matthew chapter 4, where the context is set for the sermon by Jesus in verse 23, as he's going about in all of Galilee. His ministry had just begun, and as he's going about in all of Galilee, he's proclaiming the availability of God's kingdom right here and right now, and demonstrating in a variety of ways the kingdom's power, such that news about him spread. Verse 24 in chapter 4, And great multitudes began to follow him. But when he saw the multitudes, chapter 5, verse 1, now we're into the Sermon on the Mount. He went up on the mount, the mountain. And after he sat down, his disciples came to him and opening his mouth, he began to teach them, saying, essentially this, I've got some good news and I've got some bad news. The good news is this, that all that stuff about the availability of God's kingdom right here and right now is real. and true, and it's available to you. But the bad news is that none of it is going to come the way you think. None of it is going to come to or flow through who you think, because it won't be to the rich and the powerful, to the put-together. It won't be to those who know they can, which is bad news For them instead, it's going to come to those who know they can't, which is good news to them. Blessed are the poor in spirit. For theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn. Blessed are the meek who, we found out last week through Steve Weems, aren't weak, but are in fact the kind of people who know how to use their strength and even their anger at the right time, in the right place, at the right measure, which brings us today to the fourth beatitude, to the fourth descriptor, if you will, of the kind of person to whom the kingdom comes, through whom its power flows. Who would have thought? Hungry people. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst, particularly for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. Righteousness, which obviously at one level speaks to moral virtue. It's kind of what most of us think of when we think of righteousness, a personal piety. But I want to expand your mind in terms of what it fully means, because it also speaks to a term that may be new to some of you, restorative justice. Righteousness, which is moral virtue that expresses itself, quite frankly, as restorative justice. Restorative justice then moves me beyond me. Moral virtue is kind of about me, my personal piety. That's important. But from that comes restorative justice, which is about us. It's not just me. It's we, a concept that I want to pack. a little bit this morning. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for those kinds of things, for they will be satisfied if they can stay hungry for those things. Let me explain that just a little bit, because the first thing I want us to notice about this beatitude as we get into it, and this is very important, is that the blessing in this beatitude is pronounced upon, and the promise of satisfaction is made to unfulfilled aspiration, to unfulfilled aspiration. In other words, this beatitude does not say, blessed are those who are righteous, or who think they're righteous. Indeed, those who think they're righteous are almost always self-righteous, but rather the beatitude says, blessed are those who are continually, perpetually, hungry for what is righteous, be it moral virtue, personal piety, or restorative justice. So the subtle spin here, again, really important, I think, to get, it needs to be discerned, is that the key to being satisfied is staying hungry, which at first sounds a little odd. I mean, I think it does, because if you're perpetually hungry, it sounds like you're never satisfied unless dissatisfaction actually is somehow found in the hungering and in the thirsting, which still sounds a little odd, but it isn't. Indeed, as I explain this, you're going to go, there's aha stuff all over this. Luke 18, actually a classic example of this kind of hidden in plain sight, a parable that many of you are familiar with. We've referred to it often here. Luke 18, verse 9, where Jesus is telling a parable to certain ones who trusted in themselves. It says in verse 9 that they were righteous. And the implication there clearly is that they were already righteous. So he's speaking to a group of people who were, in effect, satisfied. They thought they had arrived at the pinnacle of moral virtue and personal piety. Satisfied would be the word that applies to them. So he is about to speak to people like that, and he tells them this parable, verse 2. I want to tell you about two men who went up to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee, like you guys, who was satisfied with himself. The other was a tax gatherer, which in that culture was synonymous with sinner, a scumbag that no one likes. We've done some history on tax gatherers. You know that they were collaborators with Rome. They were also collaborators with the perverted temple system that was putting incredible tax burdens on people. So it explained even it was the cause for much of the poverty, the hunger and thirst physically in the land. Tax gatherers were cruddy characters. No one, you would feel very justified in despising him. Okay, there were these two people. The Pharisee stood and was praying thus to himself. Interesting that he's praying to himself. God, I thank you that I'm not like these other disgusting people, swindlers, unjust adulterers, or even like this scumbag over here, tax gatherer. For I fast twice a week, pay tithes of all I get, which served as proof to him that he was righteous, that he had moral virtue, personal piety, and indeed beyond satisfied, this guy was full. To use the hunger metaphor, he wasn't hungry. He was full, particularly of himself. And he was also full of contempt. And quite frankly, those things go together when you see religious people who think they have arrived at moral virtue and personal piety. They will be full of themselves, and they will be full of contempt for people like, you know, that. but the tax gatherer standing some distance away too ashamed I suppose I don't know to even go into the temple to come even into the gathering place let alone into the main auditorium where church was going on was unwilling even to lift his eyes to heaven no one would want to be in a place like that but was beating his breast saying God be merciful to me the sinner It's weird, the sinner. It's almost in the story. Jesus is going to public and was aware of the Pharisee. And even before God, he's going, yeah, God, no, I'm not. He's the good guy. I'm the sinner. And I'm the one who needs grace. And I desperately need mercy. Truly, then, Jesus says, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other. Why? Obviously. Why? Why? Because this guy was desperately hungry for what he didn't have. He was not satisfied with what he did have. He was hungry. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst. They will be satisfied. But if you really want to be satisfied, you're going to have to stay hungry. It's interesting because in many ways, this guy in Luke 18, this tax gatherer, embodies all the Beatitudes. Let me think about it. Blessed are the poor in spirit. There he is, beaten his breast. Blessed are those who mourn. There he is. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for what they do not have. There he is. Even the next Beatitude, blessed are the merciful. My guess is that he would embody mercy as well, because usually those who give mercy, you know this is true, those who are merciful are usually people who are intensely aware of their personal need for mercy. But for that to be true, this guy would have to stay hungry for mercy. He'd have to be the kind of guy who after he got mercy, having beaten his breast for being, you know, a sinner or whatever, and got forgiveness and stood up into the fullness of who he was, would one day in his life, maybe later in his life, come to God and say, you know, God, I look at the law and I look at Matthew 5, and he wouldn't say that, but maybe some of us would say, I look at Matthew 5 and I hear the word that says, you shall not commit adultery. And I don't, I haven't. But God, I'm so full of lust. Be merciful to me, I said, God, I've never ever committed murder. I never would. I know it doesn't even come into my mind, but I'm so full of anger. I just blew up right over, right over. Oh, God, be merciful to me. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for more. They shall be satisfied. But if you want to be satisfied, you're going to stay hungry. Paul did actually stay hungry. In fact, he's a great example of someone who is perpetually hungry in the way I'm describing, in this dynamic I'm trying to describe this morning, Philippians 3. Again, you probably know the text, maybe familiar with it to some degree. Paul is identifying the overriding passion of his life, He's consistently hungry for verse 10 Philippians 3. It's this, that I may know him. That's kind of all I want, to know him. Intimate knowing is what he's speaking of here. And the power of his resurrection. I want to experience that in my living and in my dying. And the fellowship of his sufferings, the things he suffered. I want to suffer in being conformed to the image of his death. And then he says quickly, not that I've arrived. Oh, my goodness. Verse 12, I have not obtained this. This is just what I want. It's not that I've obtained it. I am, and I'm not perfect, but here's what I do. You want to tell, let me tell you what I do. I press on. In order that I may lay hold of that for which I was laid hold of by Christ. Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet, but one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind, reaching for what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ. Beloved, those are the words of a hungry man. But please note, and this is a very important note to make, this is not speaking, those words of Paul, this is not speaking to some performance-driven treadmill where you're forever trying to do enough to win God's favor, but it's never enough. No. That's not what Paul is doing here. That's not what Paul is saying here. Indeed, what I think he's doing and saying here is a lot more like the New England Patriots. Sorry. Who last week went 10-0 after pounding the Buffalo Bills 56-10 and at the end of the game said, in fact, I think it was Tom Brady who said, I think if we're going to run the table, we need to get a lot better. Which doesn't mean I don't think we're any good. I just wish we were. Uh-uh. It simply means he's hungry for more. The text says the key to being satisfied relative to righteousness, be it moral virtue or this restorative justice, is staying hungry for righteousness. Which brings me to this question where I want to unpack a little bit of this definition. What kind of righteousness can satisfy? If we stay hungry for it, continue to desire and pursue it. Well, we already know it's not self-righteousness that can do it. The kind we see embodied in the scribes and Pharisees, the scribe in particular that we met just a moment ago in Luke 18, who actually reduced true righteousness. It's weird because religionists who are at one level, like Pharisees, and even church people quite often, who look very, very righteous, and the whole world looks at them and goes, I guess they're righteous and I'll never be like them. The truth is that these religionists actually reduce righteousness to a self-serving show that looks good on the outside but has no interior strength or reality. These Pharisees and religionists historically throughout all of time simply appeared to be righteous. This is the particular sin of the religious in our day, in Jesus' day, among us as well. Jesus, I think, identified and confronted this well when in Matthew 23, he said, you guys are all about, and you're really good at cleaning the outside of the cup and of the bowl. And I look at you, wow, what a cup, what a bowl, incredible. You're bright and shiny, it looks good, shiny, clean. But inwardly, you've got a problem because inside that bright, shiny, clean cup, that says praise the Lord and holds your Bible all day long, you're full of robbery and self-indulgence. You rip people off and don't care. You're careful, Jesus says, to tithe dill and mint and cumin. Those are little seeds, giving a tenth of all they had, and they would get right down to the little, oh, this tiny little seed. You'd be careful about those little things that, quite frankly, don't matter, but you don't seem to notice. It's not even on your radar screen, and this is what's so bizarre, especially when you're talking about righteousness, you don't seem to notice or even care about weightier provisions of the law like justice, mercy, faithfulness. So hungering and thirsting for righteousness, as we're trying to dial into what righteousness is, would be to hunger and thirst for more than that, for more than a religious show that looks shiny and clean on the outside. Indeed, Jesus, in Matthew 5, 20, went so far as to say that unless your righteousness exceeds or surpasses, has more substance than is more real than that of the scribes and the Pharisees, unless you have a different kind of righteousness than theirs, you clearly haven't understood or even begun to enter into this kingdom of God thing that I have said is available to you right here, right now. He's not talking about heaven when you die. You simply have not this kingdom that I'm saying you can step into now, you're not in it unless your righteousness is fundamentally different than religionists. So the righteousness we're talking about would be real, not just an external show. It would be internally real, but it would be made externally. It would have an external manifestation as well. Jesus blows up the external only, so we go, it's internal, but it also would have an external visibility made visible by things and manifesting itself by things like justice, mercy, faithfulness. So blessed are those who have an abiding hunger and an unquenchable thirst for doing justice, for loving mercy. Think on that. Sounds a little Old Testament-y, doesn't it? Actually, it's the word of the prophets. Micah 6, rather, verse 8. The prophet reduces it all down to this. You know, you're all about your sacrifices and all your solemn assemblies and all your other things. Here's the deal. Let's bring it down. Let's bring it all down. What does the Lord require of you but to do justice, love mercy, walk humbly? That's righteousness. Indeed, when that kind of righteousness, that kind of care, lifestyle, was missing from the community of God's people, the anger of the Lord would burn against His own people, historically. Saying, in effect, things like this, God, to His own people, I hate your personal piety. You go to church all week long, it makes me sick, says God, to His covenant people. What you call moral piety, what you call righteousness, makes me sick. I've had enough of your burnt offerings. Isaiah 1, verse 11. I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls and goats. In other words, your religious ceremony that you're totally absorbed with doing just right. Bring your worthless offerings no longer, verse 13. Incense is an abomination to me. I love Richard Rory talks about this verse applying to the priestcraft. And everybody who is religious gets all involved in the priestcraft. And are we doing the liturgy just right? He calls it smells and bells. And it's all about that. That's an abomination to me when I don't see justice and mercy. I hate your new moon festivals, your appointed feasts, even your solemn assemblies, your church services. You may go to church. I don't, says God. Yeah, think on that. I'm serious. These services of yours, where you sing all your songs and do the liturgy just right, I've become a burden to me, says the Lord. I am tired of bearing them so much so that when you spread your hands in prayer, I hide my eyes. Indeed, even though you multiply your prayers, oh God, oh God, oh God, I will not listen because your hands are covered with blood. You don't care about justice. You don't care about mercy. So what do we do? So what do we do? Say the people of God throughout history. What do we do? Verse 17, Isaiah 58. It's really very simple. One, quit doing your solemn assemblies and learn to do what? Good. Learn to do good. Seek justice. Reprove the ruthless. defend the orphan, plead for the widow, get a little less religious and a little more compassionate. How about that? That's righteousness. Interesting, James in his epistle identifies righteousness as simply true religion. True religion. Don't give me any of this baloney religion. True religion and undefiled, real simple, widows orphans. Justice, mercy. Isaiah 58 verse 6 goes on Same thing Righteousness is when you're actively involved Not making sure the church service goes just right Or that you have personal piety And are disgusted with everyone else who doesn't Righteousness is when you're actively involved In loosening the bonds of wickedness And undoing the bands of the yoke It's when I see people letting the oppressed go free dividing your bread with the hungry. That's righteousness. It's when you bring the homeless poor into the house and close the naked. It's when you give yourself to the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted. Then, verse 8, your light will break out like the dawn. That's an incredible verse because what it's saying is that you will become what I designed. This is the plan of God. You are the light of the world. He said that to Israel. He's saying that to the church. but it's about a lot more than personal piety then your light will break out like the dawn and you will be who i've called you to be the light of the world and your recovery and your recovery will speedily spring forth and your righteousness will go before you and the glory of the lord will be your rear guard then you will call on the lord and he will answer you will cry and he will say here i am in other words he he will say if you start doing justice and do mercy, and you start actively involving yourself in those kinds of things, I will be with you in that. Here I am. So you want revival? Everybody does. So let's have a weekend of meetings. I'm not against it. But here's the word of the Lord. If you want revival, quit just going to church. Go to church. Go to the weekend thing. But quit just doing that. And quit just singing songs and lifting hands in prayer and start doing justice because that's righteousness. Amen. It's interesting because this definition of righteousness that I'm giving you today is probably the definition that first century Jews would have heard. That would have been their understanding, rooted as they were, and we know this from our study in this rabbi series here, rooted as first century Jews were in the Torah and in the law and the prophets, just like Jesus was. Indeed, a couple of weeks ago I told you that most of Jesus' teaching in general and his teaching in the Sermon on the Mount in particular was drawn from the prophet Isaiah. Isaiah 61 in particular, many believe, is kind of the fundamental text that Jesus used for the Beatitudes, which is why New Testament scholars like N.T. Wright, Glenn Stassen, Eugene Peterson, all translate the word dikiesune, righteousness, as meaning, among other things, justice. So blessed are those, put that in the words, blessed are those who have an abiding hunger and an unquenchable thirst for that. Justice. Let me clarify that even a little bit. The justice I'm talking about is not just judicial justice, which is what most people think of when they think of justice, declaring someone guilty or innocent, drop the gavel, you go to prison, but rather what could best be referred to and called this phrase I'm introducing to you today, restorative justice, which brings deliverance to the oppressed and freedom to those in bondage. I think one of the best pictures and quickest I can give you that would contrast judicial justice and restorative justice is the woman taken in adultery. Remember the picture? The Pharisees are ready to stone her and kill her, and that's judicial justice. Guilty, die. And Jesus came in with restorative justice and said, okay, yeah, you're right, you're right. Judicially, you're right. That's just. But here's the deal. Whoever among you is without sin, you cast the first stone. and they all put down their stones, and the woman was saved. That's restorative justice. What he did was righteous. Remember Luke 4? I love this, because this is about restorative justice, and it's the mission of God. In Luke chapter 4, Jesus came into this synagogue and announced his ministry and his mission, and he read from the prophet Isaiah, again, saying this, I got news for you. The spirit of the Lord is upon me, And the way you can tell that the Spirit of the Lord is upon me is this. He has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. And he has sent me to proclaim release to the captives, the recovery of sight to the blind, and to set free those who are downtrodden. Blessed are those, therefore, who have an abiding hunger and an unquenchable thirst for that. For this restorative, delivering justice, which is what righteousness is. So blessed are those who deeply desire to make my mission their mission. And my mission, says the Lord, bring justice. Bring righteousness, which is, among other things, restorative justice. Actually, this concept just puts a spin. It's made me read my Bible different. Matthew, later, Jesus says this kind of famous phrase, seek ye first the kingdom of God and his what? Righteousness. Which, be and more morally pure. It certainly means that. Seek first the kingdom of God and his program. Just think, I think of Stephan a while ago talking about wondering, what if the church became the church? What if we were abidingly hungry and unquenchingly thirsty for this kind of righteousness to make his program our program in the world. Change the world. Stassen, Glenn Stassen, I mentioned him just a moment ago in his book on the Sermon on the Mount, says it this way, and I'm quoting him here, Blessed are those who yearn bodily. I love that. They have a bodily ache for the kind of restorative justice that brings the powerless and the outcast, the unclean and the untouchable, back to their place in the covenant community where they're welcomed to the table so they can eat and drink again, so they can come to life anew. Because if you're cut out of the community, if you're not allowed to the table, you die. Let me use language more familiar to us, at least more familiar to me, feel theologically. Graciousness is manifested in restorative justice when those far off are brought near. When those outside are brought inside. When those who have been excluded are now included. Included not just by God, but included by me and us. And welcomed to our table. Invited into our lives. Jesus, and one of the most disturbing things he said to religionists of his day was, many will come from the east and the west and sit at the table. Remember that? Of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and it's just going to drive you crazy. But I'm all about bringing those far off near. That's the mission of the kingdom. It's the mission of our rabbi. That's why he came to seek and save. Now, in the larger context of redemptive history and language relative to salvation, this restorative justice thing is at least part of why Jesus was willing to endure the cross, despise the shame. Why? Well, because he hungered and thirsted for those who were far off to be brought near. And if you're in Christ, it's already happened to you. You who were far off have already been brought near. Ephesians 2.11 says that very thing. Therefore, remember, It's important that you remember where you're from. Because if you don't remember, you won't stay hungry for this kind of restorative justice. Therefore, remember that formerly you were separate from Christ. Excluded, key word, from the commonwealth. Strangers to the covenants having no hope and without God in the world but now. You who were formerly far off have been brought near. That's not just a nice little verse for Sunday school. That is the message and the mission of the kingdom and of our Rabbi Jesus. And if we're going to follow the Rabbi, his mission, our mission. And it's why Jesus came preaching peace in Ephesians 2, 17, to those who were far away. And he preached it to those who were near. In other words, he just preached peace to everybody. Come to the table. all you who want to come to the table. Why did he do that? Because he had an abiding hunger and an unquenchable thirst for righteousness, for restorative justice. But it's also why, in more down-to-earth, flesh and blood, ordinary human ways, Jesus invited to his table sinners, real people. Remember the Amha'orats? Remember that group? We call them just common people. And Jesus probably got in more trouble for who he ate and drank with than any other thing he did. He had table fellowship with the wrong kind of people. You know why he did that? Because Jesus had an abiding hunger and an unquenchable thirst for righteousness, for restorative justice, for those who were far off to be brought near. And it's why he confronted the temple system in Matthew 23. The temple system that was designed by God one day to provide a way for people to kind of have access to God had become big business. Like religion is today. It had become big business. And instead of providing access to God, it actually was making it hard for people to get to God. And that's what Jesus said when he came into the temple, among other things. What I'm angry about, he said, is that you're shutting off an experience of God's kingdom from the very people who are trying to get experience with God's kingdom. He literally put his own life at stake to confront that huge monster system. Why would he do that? Here's why. Because Jesus had an abiding hunger and an unquenchable thirst for those who were far off to be brought near, for those who were being shut out to be included. I mean, Jesus would literally give his life away for that to happen. You know, it was weird. It was in the middle of, you know, I write these sermons and so I ought to know them. But it wasn't until the middle of the sermon last night that this dawned on me how this hungering and thirsting for restorative justice, for people far off being brought near, is a fundamental characteristic of God himself. You know how hungry God is? for left out people to be included, for far off people to be, you know how hungry he is for that? He's so hungry, he emptied heaven of its dearest treasure and became a man. That's how hungry God is for this. And we as people, responsibility, how about privilege? We get to partner with God in this. So let's get busy. anyway it's why I touched the leper why? because somebody excluded needs to be included so I'm touching him remember that story? I love that leper him touching the leper is an incredible picture of restorative justice and that real righteousness please make this distinction is more than personal piety the Pharisees and many religionists today have the personal piety thing down But all their personal piety does is isolate them from the very people who need them. In Jesus' day, it was that way. They were so bent on staying clean, personal piety, that they never went near lepers. So when Jesus stretched out his hand to touch this guy that no one else would touch, people were aghast. And when later in the Gospels, he healed the man with the withered hand on the Sabbath, which broke a rule. People were angry. Jesus, not a big deal, but connect some dots. Jesus didn't get in trouble. He wasn't hated because he was so moral, because of his personal piety. He was moral, okay? I'm sure he was. And he had personal piety. But, hey, so moral, I hate all that moral. No, that wasn't why they hated him. They hated him for stuff like this. because his real righteousness made their personal piety look as pathetic as it really was. I hate people like that. So why did he touch the leper? Here's this phrase you're probably going to get sick of. Here's why. Because Jesus, our Redeemer, our Rabbi, our God in heaven, had and has an abiding hunger and an unquenchable thirst for righteousness, which means, among other things, restorative justice, a hunger for those who are far away to be brought near, to be made whole. So let me just close with some questions. What are you hungry for? What are you, seriously, seriously, what are you hungry for? How would you know? Well, what are you chasing? What are you spending the juice of your life on? As Stephan talked, what fountain are you drinking from? Let me ask you another question. Do you notice in your spirit, even as I'm saying some of these things, a hunger in you for any of this? Some of you, I don't know, could hear some of this and just be weeping, going, this is what I'm hungry for. This could maybe remind you of something you've forgotten that you really care about, but you forgot. Let me ask the same question in a different way. Do you have a stomach for this, using the hunger metaphor? Do you have a stomach for this kind of righteousness that would actually be including at your table people that right now, you know? Fact is, I think you do. I think, quite frankly, more and more, and I don't know every individual here, but I know this, that more and more we have a hunger for this as a church. I see it, I hear it, and maybe the way I know it's a hunger is because I certainly know we haven't arrived. But I see it, and I hear it, and I can smell it. And I think some of you can too. I see it and smell it in our prison ministry, in Beyond Our Doors ministry, our Metro Impact ministry. People who, when we give you opportunity to tutor in our community or in our inner city, you just go as quick as you can or AIDS ministry to Africa and on and on. Why would any of you do that stuff? Maybe it's born of a hunger and a thirst to see those who are far off brought near. And maybe you never put it together like that, but that's why. But the key to being satisfied is staying hungry for that stuff. I've had a lot of conversations with other pastors, sometimes church leaders, sometimes just friends of mine, you guys, about a phenomenon in many churches in our day, most notably a characteristic of megachurches, like our church, called the consumer church. You ever heard that phrase? Consumer Christians, consumer churches, where people come primarily to consume religious goods and services. And if we all buy into that, it makes the ministry of the church, the goal of the church, therefore, is consumer. Consumer? I hate that. The goal of the church is consumer satisfaction. So we're just kind of wringing our hands, hoping you're satisfied with everything we do. For real? What if, what if What if, what if, what if It wasn't about Being satisfied What if it wasn't Not at all About that What if that wasnít The goal You all being satisfied What if the goal Was being hungry Really Really Hungry for more moral virtue absolutely the kind of moral virtue that surpasses the baloney of the scribes and pharisees who just policy outside of the cup keep it home with you go home with it now but if you're willing to look at your robbery and self-indulgence and the stuff on the inside so the outside could become clean as well we might actually be a light around here not satisfied hungry for restorative justice that is marked by an unquenchable thirst to see people who are excluded, included far off, brought near this is the gospel of the kingdom a couple of weeks ago a group of us went to California here on staff to do something we've been able to do for the last few years it's just an incredible honor I think we meet with one other church and they bring a small group of people as well and there's maybe 15, 20 people in the room where we get to sit with Dallas Willard. Now, you know, it's like, ah. Anyway, I just, you can't believe it, but the whole time I'm there with him, I just, I don't say nothing. And I know you can't believe I do that. I just want to listen to this guy talk. I just want to listen to this guy talk. And we talked about many, many things. And some of it was teaching he had, but a lot of it was just dialogue. So it was just a wonderful thing. And among the things we talked about that week was this whole thing of when people in ministry fall in a variety of ways. fall in such a way around things like moral virtue, such that their families are devastated and their ministries are destroyed. What's that about? And so we talked. And Dallas said a number of things, and so did we. But among the things that I remember Dallas saying is that one of the reasons he thinks that people fall is because they get bored with God. And what I didn't immediately think, but as I think, somewhere along the line, they lost their appetite for God. And I don't know what it became. Maybe it was, you know, the business. Maybe it was getting big. I don't know what it was. But they lost their appetite for God and his righteousness, restorative justice, bring whatever. you ever lose your appetite yes you have so have i sometimes it happens when you're full sticking with the hungry metaphor of thanksgiving at the end of the day you lost your appetite why because you were full church in laodicea jesus brought this ringing indictment here's your problem You are rich, increased with goods, in need of nothing. Remember when you were desperate for God? Remember when you were hungry? But now you can handle it all by yourself. You're the biggest, you're the best, you're the richest. Used to be hungry. Satisfaction comes only if you stay hungry. Sometimes it happens when you're sick. Again, the physical You know, people don't eat Because they're full They don't eat sometimes Because they're sick I just lost my appetite I don't feel good today Maybe you're sin sick So to recover your appetite You might need to repent Like today The reason you've lost your appetite Is you've been eating garbage And it's made you sick You know what's ironic? sometimes what can give you a real hunger and thirst for righteousness is that you did eat some garbage. Is that you did fall into sin and you go, oh God, I'm eating this crap and I hate it. God help me. I want to eat something else. Some of you are so sick of what you're eating, it's time to eat something else. Starting today. Scary part about eating garbage though, is some people can eat it so long. They like it. I know somebody who's so hooked on junk food and sugar stuff. You can put a steak in front of this person. I'll eat the ho-ho. Okay, fine. I have no idea how to get the ho-ho out of your hand if that's where you are. Sometimes we lose our appetite because we're dead. Seriously, if you have no appetite for any of this that I'm talking about today, maybe it's because you're still dead in your sin. Because dead people don't eat much. Dead people don't have much desire. If you feel some desire stirring in you today for this, it's a sign of life. It may not be where you want to be, but maybe you're getting hungry. Blessed are you. who get hungry. So we pray, Holy Spirit, come awaken us, stir in us, rekindle in us what I would call holy hunger. Amen? Amen. You know, last week, Steve closed with a benediction and not to be outdone. Yeah. No, I like that. I like that. I want you to stand and I want to speak a blessing over you. relative to this word. Blessed are all of you. Blessed are all of you who didn't know what it was, this longing you so strongly feel that it was and it is an abiding hunger and an unquenchable thirst for righteousness. you didn't know that that's what it was. For restorative justice, for those far off being brought near, for those excluded being included, here's the promise. You will be satisfied. This is a satisfying life. But you have to stay hungry. Father, I pray that you would move among us and stir in us more and more and more this holy hunger for righteousness, which so clearly is your heart and your program. And we pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. I'm going to ask the prayer team to come and receive anybody who needs prayer for things maybe stirred up this morning around this word. The rest of you are dismissed. God bless you as you leave. Thank you.
