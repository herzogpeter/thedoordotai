Father, as we come now to your precious word, I pray by the power of your spirit that you would reveal the truth of it to us in ways that transform how we think and how we live. I pray that in Jesus' name. Amen. I'd like you to open your Bibles with me to the book of 1 John, the first chapter beginning in the fifth verse. 1 John chapter 1 verse 5. This far in our study, just to get you up to speed, we have identified three major themes of 1 John, extended two invitations off of those three themes. The themes are these, that God is life, that God is light, and that God is love. The two invitations we extended off of those themes are these. Number one, I extended an invitation two weeks ago to desire, to desire the life and light and love of God that John says that we can hear and touch and experience, know for ourselves. the second invitation I extended this was last week was an invitation into that very life was an invitation into what I referred to as an eternal kind of life that doesn't just kick in when we die but it's a kind of life that we can experience now this morning as we move on through our text into the fifth verse through the second chapter the first couple of verses of the second chapter I want to extend a third invitation the invitation is this an invitation into light we read about it beginning in the fifth verse through the second verse of chapter 2. Now, I just want you to know on the front end, we're going to spend at least two weeks on this. So this is kind of to give us a feel for where we're going. It begins with these words. And this is the message we have heard from him and announced to you that God is light. And in him there is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship, stop right there. The word fellowship, we already know because of two weeks of teaching is partnership, participation with. If we say we are partnering with God and yet walk in darkness, we lie and don't practice the truth. But if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of his son Jesus cleanses us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we're deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, however, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make God a liar, and his word is not abiding in us. My little children, I am writing these things to you that you may not sin. But if you do, we have an advocate. We have a friend with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. And he himself is the propitiation or the atonement, the atoning sacrifice for our sins and not for ours only, but also for the whole world. One of the primary questions that all of us must answer in life, whether we know it or not, is this. Do I want to live in the light or do I want to live in the dark? You get to choose. And believe it or not, you choose every day, sometimes in ways that are very subtle, even imperceptible. But every day we choose. You may not think you do, but you do. And it becomes clear when I ask that same question a different way. Do I want to live my life in the light of what's true about my life? Do I want to live my life in the light of what is true about my family dynamic, the one I grew out of and the one I'm in? Do I want to live my life in the light of what is true about my character, my finances, my work? Or do I prefer to live in a kind of denial about the same? Do I want, in other words, to live in what most of us would call reality? Or would I prefer illusion? The fact is this, I believe that we all know someone. Maybe you're thinking of them right now. certainly not yourself, who consistently seems to choose illusion, consistently seems to choose denial. It's kind of how they do their life. And we say things like this about people like that as we look at how they do their lives. They just don't have a what? Clue. What kind of fantasy world are they living in anyway? And if you're saying it to them face to face, you'd be saying something like this, you know, I get so frustrated, I love you like crazy, but you seem to make the same bad choices over and over again, creating all sorts of problems for yourself, for people around you. Can't you see, operative word, can't you see? Well, they can't because the light is either not on or they're blind to it. Can't you see what you're doing to yourself? Can't you see what you're doing to your family and your friends? What color is the sky in your world anyway? That's what we do when people aren't connected with reality. Now let me bring that back to a more palatable place just for a moment. There are certain levels, at certain levels, this unwillingness or inability to face reality can be funny. As long as everyone knows you're kidding. We have a long-running joke in my family about what we've come to commonly refer to as Dave's world. Dave's world is my world. What Dave's world is, is a fantasy world that I enjoy visiting on a fairly regular basis, actually. And this fantasy world that I live in from time to time, you need to know this, it has absolutely no basis in reality. But the reason it's funny and you left is because everybody knows it. It's Dave's world. It manifests itself in a number of places. One of the places it manifests most regularly is when I go to the gym to work out. I enjoy working out. I lift weights. I know you can tell, can't you? Yeah, well, that's part of my fantasy world. You can tell. Yeah, right. That's part of it. I just did it for you right in front of me. Well, the fact is you can't tell. I lift weights. And I don't do much, but you know what? There are people at this gym where I work out that do lift really heavy weights. They're huge guys. They wear T-shirts with no sleeves. In fact, I think there's like this law or something. When your guns are loaded, you can't buy. The store won't sell you T-shirts with sleeves. They will always bury them. Bench pressing four plates of 45-pound plates on each side, making all sorts of incredible noises like they're going to have a baby. It's unbelievable. The noises they're making. The fact is, I've been in this club a long, long time. I've worked out there for... And the truth is, most of these guys are really nice guys. I've gotten to know a few. Every once in a while, I walk over. And they're doing this, hey, hey, hey, thing. Making all this noise. Huge amounts of weight. And I'm right next to them. Use your imagination. With this little weenie weight that I have. You know? And then what's really sad is I'm making the same noise. You know, I'm like, ah, ah, ah. But one of the things I enjoy doing the most is after they're doing that, and if I'm real close to them, I walk up to them. After they've just expended all this energy, and I look at them, I put my hand on their shoulder, and I go, hope I'm not intimidating you over here. It's a true thing. I did that Friday, that actual thing Friday. There was a guy right next to me doing dips. And not only was he doing dips, this guy was unbelievable. And he was doing dips, but around his waist was a chain, and attached to the chain were three 45-pound plates. With that, doing... Screaming like he was dying. He got done. Takes the thing off. The plates fall. He grabs the bench. He's about to pass out. I walk over to him. Look at him. Are you okay? And I did that intimidation thing with him. I'm hoping I don't intimidate you over here. He's looking at me. Can't hardly stand up. And the guy just about split a gut laugh. What is called is Dave's World. And in Dave's World, I'm an intimidating weightlifter guy who cares about the little guy. Totally disconnected with what's real. What color is the sky in your world? Any color I want it to be. It's very fun. Now, in small doses, that can be funny. Consider the possibility that my assessment that that can be funny is also part of Dave's world I think it can be funny actually As long as everybody knows it's a joke But past the joke part People's inability or unwillingness to face reality isn't funny at all At best it's very irritating Often quite damaging and hurtful I'll give you an example If you are a controlling person if you are an angry, selfish, arrogant person but you are living in the dark about that meaning you really don't see yourself as controlling, arrogant, selfish or angry then you have absolutely no idea how your selfishness, anger, control and arrogance damages the people you're around you don't have any idea how it affects the people you work with the people you live with, none whatsoever and when they come to you and try to provide for you a mirror protesting to you how it is that your arrogance or anger or whatever it is, that you've got all sorts of reasons that it's okay, how those things affect you, you actually believe that it's their problem. That it's not your problem. You know why? Because you are absolutely in the dark about what's real about you. You have no clue. You really don't. At the extreme, people's inability or unwillingness to walk in the light of what is real about life is called insanity. That is the extreme. It is mental illness where we get separated from what is real. Extreme neurosis, even psychosis, for a variety of reasons. People develop and live in a reality that is not based on what is true or what is real. They live in a fantasy world, and so distorted is it for some. So separated from what is real isn't for some, that for their own protection they need to be in a hospital, that sometimes for our own protection they need to be in a prison. Now, with all of that kind of established, developed, if given a choice and you had time to think about what you wanted, do I want to live in the light or do I want to live in the dark? Do I want to live connected to reality or do I want to live in an illusion? I am convinced that every single person in this room would say, I want to live in the light. I want to be connected to reality. Of course I want to live in reality. Well, of course I want to be connected to what is true. I don't want to be living my life in the dark, walking into walls, falling down stairs. That would be crazy. Well, if that's true, but that really is your desire, it really is your choice to live in the light of what's real, then I have some very, very good news for you. The good news is this, 1 John 1, 5. God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all. In him there is no illusion. There is no pretense. There is no trickery, no falsehood, no games. Let me say it this way. God is going to tell it to you straight. Why? Because there's just no baloney with him. We admire people who talk straight, don't we? We always say that anyway. If you have somebody in your life who talks straight to you and they love you, you may be talking about your best friend. Somebody who loves you and speaks straight to you is safe, secure. You know where you stand. Take any one of those. You take one of those elements away, though, and you've got trouble. Somebody who loves you but won't speak truth to you doesn't love you very much. I mean, it's just this needy thing. They're always wanting to make sure you're okay. If they loved you and they saw you in danger, they would tell you the truth. Take away the love. Now, have you ever had anybody in your life who was really committed to telling you the truth about you but they didn't love you? Stay away from me. People who are giving you the truth, but they don't love you, are generally giving you the truth, and you know it, to hurt you, to beat you up, to win, and to feel superior to you. Please stay away. God's going to tell you to straight. God is light. God is also love. He's the best friend you ever had. And if you are really interested in living in the light of what is real, then here is the help you need. then this is really good news. God is light. In him, no pretense, no pretending. He'll tell it to you straight. James 1.17 says, Every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father of lights. There's the light thing. And with him there is no variation or shifting shadow. Variation, shifting shadow. Think of both of those words and what they speak to. Variation makes me nervous because it moves. Some of you have been in families and are in families right now that are characterized by variation. variation what I mean by that is this that it's this way one day it's that way the next I don't know where to put my feet I don't know where to stand and if you were raised in a home like that or you're living in one right now like that it is a horrible way to live variation shifting shadows makes me nervous because shifting shadows deceive you know if all it is is a shadow my eyes can adjust I just look at it long enough and go okay I see what that is now but shifting shadows keep me off my feet. I'm never sure. I think it is, and then it shifts, and then, no, no, it looks like something else now. I'm not sure. I'm never quite sure what I see. I'm never quite sure what I'm looking at. Is it real, or is it not? Is it safe, or is it not? And it creates in your whole life, if you're in an environment of shifting shadows, and you never know where you are, creates an environment where you just don't know. The good news of 1 John 1.5 is that there is none of that with God. No shifting shadows, no variations, pretense, or falsehood. You know why there are no shifting shadows? Here's why, first part of the verse, because God is light. I want to talk about what light does this morning. You can, you know, figure some of this out yourself. And there are many things that light does. I don't want to go into all of them. I just want to kind of focus on one this morning. Because what light primarily does is reveal. what light primarily does is expose the truth about what is real it reveals the truth about what is hidden in the shadow now sometimes what light reveals as it comes and and casts pushes the darkness away and the shadows away sometimes what it reveals is magnificent sometimes it's beautiful i've told you several times before that i love to go to the mountains bonnie and i both do one of our favorite places on earth and one of the things i love to do when i go to the mountains is get up really early in the morning. I love to get up while it's still dark, make my pot of coffee, get out on the porch, put on a jacket, while it's dark, and while it's dark, I can't see a thing. I can't see a mountain. I can't see a thing. And I love to sit there and watch light reveal what's there. And what gets revealed is good. It's beauty. Beloved, living in the light, the value of living in the light is that it's going to help you see what is good and right and pure and healthy. And the value of that is when I see what is good and healthy and right, I can choose it. If I'm in the dark, I can't even see the good thing that I need to choose, that I would choose if I could see it. The light comes, shows you what is good, now I can choose it. Another thing that light does, however, and this is the part of light we're all familiar with, and it's really the emphasis of the text as he talks about sin and confession, and that is this, that light also reveals what is wrong. What is ugly, what is dangerous. While admittedly this aspect of light's purpose is not as pleasant as seeing beautiful things, it is every bit as helpful because when light reveals dangerous things, I can avoid them. When light reveals good things, I can choose them. When light reveals dangerous things, I can avoid them. Life is a gift. Our light is a gift. Helps me stay out of danger, helps me move toward life. A couple of weeks ago when I introduced this for the first time, talked a little bit about the value of light. Spoke of getting up in the middle of the night, that thing we've always done, you know, in the middle of the night, you've got to go to the bathroom, something like that, and the night lights are out and one of your kids left something in the middle of the floor and you step on it and you goug your toe. Oh, that's so much pain. Simply because you couldn't see it. For lack of light, we fall off cliffs. For lack of light, we step in holes, we walk into traps that if we had light, we'd never walk into. And if light never comes, or if light is there and we never open our eyes, we might step into that same hole, we might walk off that same cliff over and over and over again. The good news about God who is light is this, that if we choose to walk in the light that he provides, that is, if we choose to believe that what he says about life is true and real, then, beloved, the good news is we can avoid enormous amounts of pain because here is what the God who is light will do. The God who is light will shine light on dangerous places. He will tell the truth about wrong directions. He will show me where the snakes are. He will show me where the rocks and the holes and the robbers and the turns in the road are. Psalm 119, 105 says it this way. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path. And if we choose to believe that light is telling us the truth and walk in the light of that truth, he will bring us to places and lead us into directions where we can live abundantly, where we can live joyfully, where we can live safely. Bottom line on what light does is this. It helps me see things as they really are. Dallas Willard, in his book Divine Conspiracy, that we have been mentioning quite a lot lately around here, begins his book with a very interesting illustration of a fighter pilot who's flying upside down, but he doesn't know he's flying upside down. He's in the dark. His hands are on the control. He moves into what he thinks is a steep ascent, but he's upside down. pulls the stick and because he's upside down but doesn't know what he drives his plane right into the right into the ground i kind of think of that illustration in light of what i was doing here in first john and i wondered about the pilot i mean this is weird but i started thinking about the pilot i thought you know he drove it into the ground and made all that mess he wasn't a bad guy if he's a pilot he certainly isn't a stupid guy stupid guys don't get to be pilots wouldn't call him evil but he did a lot of damage to himself I mean killed himself a multi-million dollar airplane got ruined simply because he didn't know simply because he couldn't see the information that he had entrusted his life to was false after the service last night a guy came up to me a friend of mine I've known for many years he's been here at Open Door for many years he's a pilot. He used to be a pilot. And he was in the Navy as a pilot. And then he flew for Northwest for many, many years. And he came up to me and he says, you know, that story about the pilot driving the plane into the ground, it really stuck a chord with me. But I need to tell you, Dave, no pilot would ever do that. I'm being in the dark. We're trained to be in the dark all the time. And what we do is we watch the instruments. And the instrument tells the truth. And you've got to watch the instruments. And he went on to tell the story. And I thought it fit in really well. He told the story of when he was being trained in the Navy. They were on the west coast of California. And part of the thing they would do would be training in the fog, you know, around San Francisco and how it would get so dense. And you'd just be in soup. And he told about how you'd be in formation for a while and I'd be, I'd have a wingman and my job was, or I was the wingman. And I would, I would just literally be feet away from the wing of my partner. We're in soup, but I can see his wing and that's okay. That's cool. It doesn't, I'm okay. But there comes this point where we're approaching the time we're going to have to land. And what happens then is we have to break off. So what happens is I'm really cool. Everything's cool watching this guy here. That's my frame of reference. But he breaks off, and I break off. And immediately, when I'm by myself in the soup, immediately vertigo sets in. And I have this overwhelming sense that I'm leaning to the left. I'm leaning to the left, and I need to correct. And then this order comes in my thingamabobber. That's what he actually called it, a thingamabobber. Right there. And it tells me to turn left. Well, my body's saying you're already left. If you turn left, you'll be upside down. But I look at my instruments, and it says, you're not left, you're right. And so against every instinct I have, I decide to believe the truth, the information that I'm getting on the gauges. And so I go, ha, ha, this is crazy, I'm already feeling left. And I turn left, and I go left, and I feel like I'm upside down. And then the order comes in again, turn left again. But the instruments say, you're still not level. And against every instinct I have, I decide to believe the instruments, the information that I'm getting, and I pull it left again, and I'm feeling like I'm just going to die. But I believe the instruments. I believe the information. I believe the information. And it's the craziest thing. All of a sudden, you break through the fog, and instantaneously, boom, the vertigo is gone, and you see it all the way it really is. Here's the deal. I believe that an awful lot of us are flying upside down and don't even know it because an awful lot of us are entrusting our lives to information that is false, information about how we can do life and how we can live it to the full. I want you to think a little bit about how we and where we get the best information available on how to do marriage, on how to do sex, on how to do finances. I'm talking to Christians. This letter was written to Christians. Where do you go to get the information on how to do that stuff? This is not a big shame thing. But just simply because of the culture we live in, most of the information, the best information we get about how to do our sex life and our marriage and our finances and our job comes from the culture. So if you really want to know about spirituality, talk to Oprah. If you want to know about sexuality, read Cosmo. If you want to know about relationships, it's the best possible information to Ann Landers. really I mean I this would be an interesting thing could you stop my sermon right now let you all go home and think about who it is you pay attention to who it is who's giving you the information who you think is the wisest person on earth to help you do your life I think most of us are flying upside down and don't even know and now this is precisely where the light becomes a problem for us because if we are, and maybe you aren't, but if we are in any area of our life flying upside down the light that God is, when it comes on is going to tell you that. It's going to say, it's not going to be very polite it's going to be very loving, but it's going to say, oh hello, you're upside down and if you pull the stick now, you're driving your life right into the ground here's the deal about me when I'm flying upside down and it feels like I, you know, remember when he was leaning left, but he wasn't, but it just felt like it. When I'm flying upside down and it feels like I ought to be there and the light of God's word comes and says, you're flying upside down. You're going to drive your life right into the ground. When I hear that, I don't like hearing that. See, I felt just fine about my life. I felt just fine about my marriage, my finances, my part, my parenting, my sex life, my relationships before that stupid light went on, I felt fine about all that. So the light's the problem. What do you do? Turn off the light. Why? Solve it. Now we've got some tension with the light. You see, the very thing I love about the light is what I hate about the light. What I love about the light is that it reveals what is true. It reveals what is good so I can choose it. It reveals what is dangerous so I can avoid it. But what I hate about the light is that it reveals what's true, particularly about me. And when what's true about me is about to be revealed, especially if what's about to be revealed is that I'm angry, arrogant, controlling, selfish, I start looking for dark places where I can hide those things. I start looking for shadowy places where I can conceal those things. In fact, better than shadowy places, I start looking for shifting shadows. Those are the best. Because if I can provide, if I can create shifting shadows for you, as you look at me, if I can create shifting shadows that are always moving, what I can pretty much be guaranteed about is this, that you will never know what's real about me. And I will feel safe. Or you won't. a very scary thing is this even sometimes God's people learn to live in the dark we learn to live in the dark with insincere smiles with half truths with inflated stories and maybe among Christians the best the most effective tool most commonly used tool for living in the dark and creating shifting shadows is what I call religious God talk. God bless. You just have all these religious God talk things. And what it provides, if there's something going on in my character that needs to be corrected, the more religious God talk I can throw up at you, the more shifting shadow it produces so you don't have a clue what I'm really like because I've just got this big illusion. It's like flack. Look at that. Look at that. and we hide when we were children we couldn't hide our soul we had not learned yet to cover our soul the way we do now as adults I want you to think about children about maybe yourself as a child maybe you can't remember that think about children little little ones really little ones you know think about a child when they're happy they look what happy when a kid is sad they look what sad if a kid gets sad and crabby in church you know what they do they just let it rip it's just you know you're gonna know well little kid lies you know it's actually it's really hard for a little kid to lie but they learn that too and when they lie what's funny about kids who lie when they're little is they look like this did you do that no they haven't learned to mask it yet it's one of the precious things about them it's one of the god-like things about them they haven't learned to mask their soul give them two years, they'll learn if you're a parent, you know how frightening it is you can't even reach your own kid because they've learned how to mask their soul and they're learning to live in the dark I ran this by Keith, this whole concept and we were talking about it and we're both reflecting on how when we were kids, we were afraid of the dark. Remember when you were a kid, you couldn't mask your soul, but then you learned. When you were a kid, you were afraid of the dark, but you learned not to be afraid of the dark. Kind of mixing these metaphors up here. In light of what it means to live in the light, where we're out here authentic and honest, open-faced with God, can't mask our soul, would to God that we would be, again, afraid of the dark. God's people, how about that for an aspiration, that we would be afraid of the dark, afraid to hide from God, from each other, from ourselves. I'm inviting you into light. I'm inviting you to come out of hiding. I'm inviting you into the kingdom, is what I'm inviting you into. We are able to make ourselves appear a certain way. And if I have invested in this appearance out here, whatever you do, don't turn on the light. And if you turn on the light, I will hate the light. And I will try to hide. We came by all of this honestly, believe it or not. It all began in Genesis, the beginning chapters of the Bible. Adam and Eve sinned. And when they did, they had two choices. They could, number one, go to God with it, confess it, bring it out into the light where it could be healed and something could be done about it. Or they could do another thing. could cover it and they could hide it. What did they choose? Well, you know the story. They covered it, first of all, with their little fig leaves. Nice try. And they hid it. In fact, they hid from God. You know what? We have been covering and we have been hiding ever since. We have been learning to live in the dark. John 3.19 says this, Men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil. Flip that around a different way. You get the meaning a little more clearly. Because our deeds are evil, we love darkness rather than light. In other words, the reason I love the dark is because it helps me hide my evil deeds. At least give me some shifting shadows where maybe I can blame you. That's a good way to create a shift. Whoa. Or excuse it away. struck the event altogether, so I didn't tell a lie at all. It didn't even happen. And every time we cover and every time we hide, we're learning to live in the dark. And if you learn to live in the dark long enough, you will get used to the dark so that not only is your sin hidden from others and hidden from God, at least that's our attempt to hide it from God, he sees, but we hide it from God, we hide it from each other, and ultimately your own sin will be hidden from you. You have a separation from God, you have a separation from people. It is impossible to have an authentic, intimate relationship with someone who's hiding, who's showing you an image. It is absolutely impossible. I am explaining to you why some of the relationships you are in right now are so incredibly satisfying, unsatisfying, because the people you're in relationship with are hiding. Their whole manner of life is to cover. You can't have a relationship with someone like that. But ultimately, if your mode of operation is to cover, you ultimately will become hidden from yourself. Think about that. To be separated from God, separated from people, now you're separated from yourself. Now you're talking mental illness, separated from yourself. What do you mean? Verse 8 is separated from yourself. If you say you have no sin, you are what? D.C. You don't see it. you don't even know yourself. We come to 1 John now. I want to bring you back to the text. I did all of that work because it's exceedingly important as we wade into this text that you understand that the references to darkness we read of in these verses are not references to evil deeds directly, but are in fact references to hiding evil deeds, to covering, concealing, and denying them. In other words, when we read in verse 6 of people who walk in darkness, you need to understand that walking in darkness does not just mean walking in sin. I used to always think that these people walk in darkness, and these walking in darkness people are these evil people in the world. No, walking in sin is to be walking in denial about your sin. The darkness is not the sin, though the sin itself may be dark. The darkness is the hiding, concealing, shifting, blaming, redefining. Now with all of that as background, let's just read the text. One more time, kind of pull it together. Start in verse 6. If we say we are partnering with God, if we say, oh, yes, I love God, and we're participating together in the life of the kingdom and doing my life, And at the same time, our walking in darkness, now we know what walking in darkness means now. So if we're saying we partner with God, participate with Him, but at the same time we live in such a way that keeps what's real about our life hidden, concealed, and covered up. And that's the way we do our life. We lie. And what are you lying about? What you're lying about is this idea that you think you're partnering with God. No, you're not. You couldn't possibly. Here's what it means. You couldn't possibly be participating with God in your life and living in cover-up mode at the same time. Do you know why? Because here you go. God is what? God is light. And what does light do? It reveals. That's just what it does. And if it's revealing, and that's what it is, and you're cooperating with the light that's being revealed, the truth that's being revealed by the light, you'd be confessing, agreeing with God about what's being revealed. If you're covering up, you're not cooperating with God at all. Matthew 10 26 says something interesting and this is speaking of final judgment in the final day and it's given as a warning you need to know that nothing hidden will not be revealed everything one day will be revealed so hide all you want go ahead and you will fool a lot of people but one day everything hidden will be revealed and everything which is whispered in the dark will be one day shouted from the rooftop the invitation into kingdom life is to say this don't wait till then step into this revealing of who you really are and discovering of who you are in the light of God's grace no how can you tell if someone's walking in the light or partnering with the father some of you would answer that question by saying you can tell by the fact that they never sin well the fact is you probably will sin now i'm writing this so you don't he says in chapter 2 Verse 1. Indeed, if you say you have no sin, you're deceived. Now, the way you can tell that men and women are walking in the light and partnering with the Father is that when the light of his truth shines on the truth about their arrogance, selfishness, envy, anger, evil deeds, people who are walking in the light don't cover it. They confess it. To confess, 1 John 1.9, if we confess our sins, to confess simply means to agree with God. the light goes on I see my anger I see my arrogance I don't like looking at that instead of covering it I go oh God oh boy I agree with you but that is wrong and that's in me and when you agree with God now you're partnering with God now you are participating with the light in your life you know what I think all of us know what this feels like on both levels. I know what it feels like for God to shine a light on something in me that is hurtful, wrong, just plain sin. And I know what it feels like when the light comes on to cover up. I know. I've done it. You've done it. I know what it feels like. There's some real bad news for those of you who as a way of life cover. It's this. That if God shines his light on stuff in your life that needs to be dealt with and corrected and brought to him so you can receive his grace. But what you do is cover it up Here's the bad news for you. You get to keep what you cover. It will not go away. You get to keep it. But when the light goes on and you see it and you agree with God about it, guess what? You get to be free from it. You get to get cleansed. You get to experience forgiveness and grace. I work on a team here at church. We call it the weekend event team. just formed a few weeks ago, but I know everybody on it, and so we've done this kind of thing before together. We're just doing it a different way. We meet on a weekly basis, three hours a week, once a week, to pray about and kind of plan our services and plan out into the future what kinds of things we want to do around the Word and worship and things like that. But in addition to the work we do around the task, what we do is make it a practice to have what we call check-in. We do that at the very beginning of our meeting, four minutes each. We even have a timer so people like me don't go on and on and on. but basically it's about you're just going to check in and how are you coming to the meeting what's going on in your life so we can come around with you and pray for you and even kind of give you some room if you're having a rough day and just will help us understand you know some of your responses and things like that just a very good thing last week uh we had our check-in it's pretty normal stuff everybody was sharing things they were happy about sad about encouraged and discouraged about but three in particular in this group about i don't know 10 or so shared in a fairly detailed way at a fairly deep level how in the last few days God had shined a light on some things in them that they discerned to be pretty ugly. And by the way, we hadn't gotten to the sermon. They didn't know that it wasn't about that. They were just sharing their stuff. One of the guys in particular, as he was sharing the thing that God had put a light on in him, actually it was a response. It wasn't even anything he did. It was something that he noticed on his inside about an event that happened and how he responded to it. And his word to describe what was inside him about it was evil. He goes, it was just evil what I felt. And as I was listening, I was right next to him. And I just thought, bless your heart for you to come out like that. But, you know, with the behavior you just described and stuff, it just felt kind of normal. I mean, you need to confess it. And it was wrong, but evil is a bit strong. I didn't say that to him. And I'm glad I didn't because that was his word. That was his word. That was how he felt. You know what he was letting himself feel? He was letting himself feel what the light revealed. And all three of those people who just came out with, and you know what they didn't, none of them thought a thing of it. They did. Nobody said, oh, the great confession. I thought of this after, you know, when I was doing this sermon. It dawned on me later was that all three of those people had a choice. When they saw what God showed them about their heart, they had a choice. they could cover it, hide it, rationalize it, deny it, and they could even get support. They could go, oh, yeah, I mean, we could go around the circle if they even gave their attitude and said, but here's why, and we were all going, yeah, I guess I can see that. That would make sense. Or they could agree with God about it, put down their defenses and confess it, and then they get to leave it, and then they get to feel cleansed about it. And those people are walking in the light, see. Walking in the light does not mean we never sin. It means that when we do, we allow it to be seen for what it is, and don't call it something else. We confess it, agree with God about it. Walking in the dark is when we take the very same sin, no bigger sin. But instead of confessing it, agreeing with God about it, we hide it, cover it, redefine it, create an illusion about it. Read now the text, verse 8. If we say we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not abiding in us. Verse 9, but if we confess, if we agree with God about what he puts his light on, he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins, to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. My little children, I'm writing you these things that you don't sin at all. That's the ultimate freedom. But if you do, we have a friend with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. I'll say more about that next week. He himself is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world. And because that's true, you don't have to hide. Because when you come to God and agree with him about what he put his light on, he will forgive, he will cleanse. because that's true you don't have to cover you don't have to live in the shadows anymore this is the gospel that we preach beloved you don't have to create illusions you don't have to pretend anymore you can walk in the light because in the light is cleansing healing forgiveness and grace. This morning, I invite you into the light. It is the safest, healthiest place on earth to live. I'd like you to stand as we close. Father, I thank you that you are light. And in you there is no darkness at all. No games, no pretense, no illusions. You're going to give it to us straight. And because you are light, we can have great confidence in life. Because your light will reveal what is good so we can choose it. And it will reveal what is dangerous so we can avoid it. But Father, in all honesty, the place we struggle, even as believers, with the light is when you shine it on stuff inside of us. And our tendency, Father, is so to cover, so to get defensive. We have such a hard time believing that there will be grace. Whatever else is required, Father, for us to walk in the light, it occurs to me that we're going to need courage. I pray, Father, that we, by this word, would be called out of the dark into your marvelous light. Father, call your people out of the dark, out of hiding. God is calling you out of hiding. He is calling you out of pretense. This is a life where there is rest. This is a life where there is grace. This is a life where there is healing. Father God, I pray that people would have courage to come out into the light, to receive this kingdom life experience that they can taste and touch and see and know an eternal kind of life now. I pray this in Jesus' name. All God's people said, Amen.
