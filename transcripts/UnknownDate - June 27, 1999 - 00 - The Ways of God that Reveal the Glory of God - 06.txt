If you've been with us these last several weeks, you're aware that we have been dealing with an issue in the course of our study in the book of Exodus that actually began in Exodus chapter 33, where Moses and the people of God were presented with the most extraordinary of possibilities. It was this, that they could procure for themselves what appeared to be the promise and provision of God without the active presence of God being involved in this at all. Chapter 33, verse 1 said this, Moses, you can enter the promised land flowing with milk and honey, but here's the catch. I will not go with you. To that possibility, you undoubtedly remember if you've been with us, Moses had three responses, all of which revealed his core values. The first response was this, God, if your presence does not go with us, then do not lead us up from here. We don't want to go to the promised land. He said that in verse 15. Why? Because we are a people of the presence. That is who we are. That's part of our identity. It's all we've got. Without your presence, Lord, the promised land, the milk and honey, as much as we want it, has no point. And it provides no joy. What I really want is this, said Moses. Verse 13, number 2, to know your ways. and number three, to see your glory. We want to know your ways and see your glory. Those are three desires put together. Stir in us a question that has been driving our series for several weeks now. The question is this, what are the ways of God that reveal the glory of God, the manifested presence of God to and through the people of God? What are those ways? Now this question, I believe, obviously, is worthy of exhaustive pursuit. It's obvious because I've been doing it for several weeks. But among the reasons for this, chief among them is this, that we too, like the Israelites of old, are people of the presence. It's who we are. It's all we've got. The unveiled glory of God, the manifested presence of God revealed to us and coming through us is critical to the understanding of our identity as a people, our identity as a church. It is critical to the discovering of our purpose as individuals and as a church, and it is critical to our experience of transformation, becoming more and more like Christ. 2 Corinthians 3.18 says it this way, for as we with unveiled face behold as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, we are by that revealed glory transformed from one degree of glory to another. Manifested presence is also critical, however, to the fulfillment of our spiritual reproduction. What I'm talking about there is evangelism. I haven't touched on this in this series at all. I am going to today. I want to bring that in. The reason is this, because the manifested presence of God at work among the people of God is by far our most compelling draw, the most potent argument we have to an unbelieving world. Our methodology matters. Our creativity matters, but know this, Church of Christ. It is not ultimately our methodology. It is not our personality. It is not our creativity. For it is not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord, that I will build the house, that I will draw the people, that I will change anybody's heart, that I will transform their lives. The Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 14, 25 said this. it's my paraphrase, you have pretty much hit the ball out of the park spiritually. If when unbelievers come into your midst and because of what is said or sung or experienced, what happens to them beyond them simply maybe being impressed by how well you do it, that does very little good. Beyond that, what happens to them is this. They find the secrets of their hearts disclosed. That's a life-changing experience that they weren't expecting when they came to church. They fall on their face and worship God, and then they declare this. God is certainly among them. You know why they said that? Because they experienced manifested presence. They maybe didn't fully understand it, couldn't possibly adequately explain it, but they have experienced a God encounter. Manifested presence. The glory of God revealed. And by the way, what's interesting about that 1 Corinthians 14, 25 thing is that that's the report of an unbeliever, not somebody who's already sold on the deal. All of that, by the way, raises for me a question. It's this. What do you experience when you go to church? Do you experience manifested presence? Maybe a better question is this. Would you even expect to experience manifested presence? Maybe a better question than that is would you even desire that? Would that be something in your mind? Boy, I hope when I go to church today I experience the presence of God. Another question a little closer to home, harder to deal with from me. What do you experience when you come here? What do you talk about when you leave here? In your car on the way home, a day like today, you may be talking about the heat. If you were here last night, I promise you, you think this is hot today? You should have been here last night. This is nothing. Maybe you're talking about the splinter in your rear end from the bleachers. If you're talking about how far you have to get to your car, maybe the sound was too loud, the sound was too soft, the service was too long, it was probably too long. Let's just say this. Let's say that on this particular Sunday, just for fun, it was perfect. Just pretend, okay? Use your imagination. Music was great, the sound was right, the speaker was compelling, the band was hot, the gym was cool, the seats were comfortable, announcements were smooth, offertory was stirring, the presentation was slick, the methods were creative, I was so creative. They're such a creative church. Here's the deal. I hope we have Sundays. I really do. I hope we have Sundays where people walk out saying things like that from time. It was really great. It was fun. It was like it all fit together. Made me laugh, made me cry. Here's the problem. While all of those things are good, methodology, smoothness, good music, compelling message, and while all of those things are worthy of pursuit, none of those things by themselves have the power to change people. None of them have the power to transform people. The best our slick presentation can do is impress people. See, here's what has the power to change people. When by a miracle of God's grace, beyond anything you physically do, In ways that stagger you, the secrets of people's hearts are disclosed, moving you to fall on your face and worship God, causing you to declare this, that I don't know what else went on in that crazy church that day, but God is certainly among them. Beloved, it is the glory of God, the manifested presence of God at work among the people of God that has the power to call and transform people who don't know God. And that is why we have spent several weeks pursuing this question. What are the ways of God that reveal the glory of God to and through the people of God? Because it is the glory of God. At work among the people of God has the power to reveal the secrets of people's hearts and open them to produce true worshipers and transform people. with all of that let's get back to the question at hand what are the ways of God that reveal the glory of God specifically today to people who don't know God we've considered nine of them so far there will be eleven in all the tenth today is this that one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God especially to people who don't know God is when the people of God demonstrate in authentic ways the love of God when God's people demonstrate this very simple but often hard to do thing of simple demonstration of authentic love that demonstration is more compelling than a sermon it is more moving than a song it is more impressive than any creativity and it is more convincing than a creed by this shall all men know that you are authentic followers of the Christ if you have what? Love. One for another, John 13. That's what has the power to move even unbelievers to declare God is certainly among them. Want to experience the manifested presence of God? It's what we've been talking about for several weeks. Well, hold off on the signs and wonders conference and love each other. Let me clarify something I just said. Some of you will think, I mean, don't go to a signs and wonders conference, like signs and wonders don't matter. Let me tell you what the 11th way of God that reveals the glory of God, the 11th that I'm going to deal with, way of God that reveals the glory of God is when God's people move authentically in the power of God. Signs and wonders, gifts of the Spirit. I want to touch on that. Before you get to that, move in this. Paul in 1 Corinthians 13 gets at it this way. When he says this, If I speak with tongues of men and of angels, move in all sorts of gifts, power of God flowing through me like crazy, signs and wonders are all there, but have not love. I'm a noisy gong and a clanging cymbal. Eugene Peterson says it this way, I'm the creaking of a rusty gate. If I have gifts of prophecy, know all mysteries and knowledge, faith to remove mountains, give my possessions to the poor, deliver my body to be burned, but I do not live in love. Profits me nothing, it gets me. Nowhere hears the deal. Our oratory, our philanthropy, even our faith, if seen by people, might impress people, but it will never change them. It does not have the power to reveal the secrets of their heart, to cause them to fall on their face and worship God, and to cause them to declare, certainly God is among them, but when the people of God demonstrate the love of God, especially to people who don't know God. It has the power to reveal the glory of God, to make manifest the presence of God. And that is why the Apostle Paul in Philippians 1, verse 9 said this, and this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in real wisdom and all discernment, that you may be able, by that abounding love, to approve those things which are excellent. And what that means is simply this, that you may be able to discern the things that matter most, that by the love that is bubbling up inside of you, getting all over everyone who you run into, that by that love of posture, you would be able to discern not just between what is good and what is bad, but you would even be able to discern between what is good and better and best. If you read the scriptures at all, you will find this is what is best. The most excellent way is what? Love. Beloved, it is the most potent tool we have in revealing the glory of God to an unbelieving world, potentially bringing them to faith. And what's amazing about this, I hope very encouraging, quite frankly, about this, is that you don't need to be real smart to do this. A lot of us have this feeling, and it kind of keeps us on the bench of spiritual activity very often, that in order to have any impact on unbelievers, we just got to know all sorts of stuff. I would encourage you to know things. And we give training. I am not eliminating that reality. But you don't need to be smart to love somebody. You don't need to be creative. You don't need to be particularly clever. You don't even need to be trained. for love is a language that the dumb can speak and the deaf can understand John Stackhouse Canadian theologian, article in Christianity Today entitled Why Our Friends Won't Stop, Look, and Listen says this our problem in evangelism is not lack of training the problem of evangelism is lack of love do you need training to talk about your grandchildren? Do you attend workshops that teach you how to talk about your hobby? Your collection of beanie babies and Barbie dolls is always on the tip of your tongue, ready to come tripping off at the first hint of interest. Our problem isn't primarily training. It's primarily love or lack of it. End quote. Sheldon Van Auken wrote a book called A Severe Mercy. Now, this book was a compilation of letters that he wrote back and forth to C.S. Lewis, and it was at a time in his life when he was searching for truth, had not yet become a Christian, and he was having a significant struggle with Christianity as to whether it was viable. He said this to C.S. Lewis, The strongest argument I have found yet for Christianity is Christians. Their love, most of all, their joy as well, their certainty of things to come. The strongest argument I have found yet against Christianity is also Christians. When they are somber and joyless, when they are self-righteous and smug in complacent consecration, when they are narrow, judgmental, and repressive, lacking love, then Christianity dies a thousand deaths in my mind. End quote. And that is why the Apostle Paul, in Philippians later, chapter 4, verse 5, says this, my paraphrase, while there are many things, beloved, that people need to know about you as you walk into the world and they see you, Let your forbearing love be known to all men. Let your forbearing spirit be known to all men. Let that be the first thing they see about you. Let your forbearing love be the presenting issue of your life. Lead with that. Let that be the first thing they know about us. Yeah, it was probably about three years ago. I did a series on Philippians 4. We were going through Philippians, and we did a whole series on forbearing love and what it looks like. And I remember at the time I introduced you to a guy named Reverend Fred Phelps. Remember him? He's a guy, he's a pastor, Christian, who goes, among other places, he goes to funerals of AIDS victims and stands across the street with placards saying things like this, faggots burn in hell. And I'm thinking, oh, I don't know, maybe that's not the best approach. And I'm wondering why he's doing that. And I'm quite sure if he were here, he would tell you, because I know some people have corresponded with him through email, that he's warning them about their lifestyle and that if they keep doing that, they're going to burn in hell. That's what he's convinced of. But I want to ask him, how many have you won? I could just see him walking out of the funeral going, Bagot's burning hell. Oh, I'm going to go over there. I'm going to be by him. I don't know if you're watching the news about things like this. It's made some splash recently, but Jerry Falwell came out a few weeks ago and told us about Linky Winky Dinky. Remember him? Nobody's paying attention. I can't get a rise out of any service on this one. Tinky Winky, the little doll purple thing with the symbol on top, and we're told now that Tinky Winky is promoting the gay lifestyle because of some symbol and because he's purple. Well, what if it's true? Well, then I'm against it. But wouldn't it be something if that wasn't the first thing they knew about us, that we're fighting the Linky Winky Dinky, whatever the name of this thing is? read the paper this morning gay pride weekend what a day to talk about this and I promise you I'm going to see some pictures tonight on the news that are not going to make me feel good that might even make me mad probably will make me mad and then I'm going to have to ask myself do you have any can you even find compassion here? Could I call you to do something? I just thought of this. I didn't do this in other services. When you watch the news tonight and you see the gay pride parade and you see something that makes you just angry, whoever your eye lands on, pray that God's life would come to him or her. Pick the one you find the most distasteful and ask God for some picture of his love for them. Just do that little discipline. I'm going to do it. Why? Because one of the most effective ways of God that reveals the glory of God, especially to people who don't know God, is when the people of God demonstrate the love of God. One of my good friends, he's a pastor in Cincinnati, Steve Shogun. We've had him here, and we kind of got affected quite a bit by this servant evangelism. where we go to public places and we hand out water or pop. The whole idea is to serve people. You're not blessing their lifestyle. You're blessing them. I could just picture Steve going to the Gay Pride Parade or Steve or us going to Lilith Fair or some place and instead of placards, it's tell everybody who's going to burn in hell and who isn't. Just hand out buckets of water or cans of pop and say, you know, we just wanted to serve you and give you something in Jesus' name. Well, you've got to give them the gospel sometime. Yes, you do. You absolutely got to get to the gospel, and you're going to have to confront the sin somewhere along the line. Paul says, however, let the first thing they see about you, the presenting issue of your life, be forbearing love. Three stories. Just kind of help you think this stuff through and just go with it. Story number one. Two high school students are dating. Guy decides it's time to take it to the next level of this relationship. I'm going to kiss her tonight. This is so exciting. So at the end of the evening, brings her home. The porch light is on. I don't know if he does what I did, but when I was dating, the porch light was on. I brought Bonnie to the front. I would unscrew the light bulb. Take care of that stupid thing. So he walks into the door. As he's saying goodnight, he asks her a question. He's a very polite person. Can I kiss you goodnight tonight? Well, her eyes widen, her face lights up with a smile, but she doesn't say anything. He's confused by that. This is the guy we're talking about. He wonders if he said it wrong, maybe bad grammar. Like in fourth grade, you raise your hand, the teacher calls on you, you make your request. Can I go to the bathroom? And she says, of course you can go to the bathroom, but you may not. You didn't say it right. Okay, I'll try it again. Grammar corrected. May I kiss you goodnight? Her eyes grow even wider, her face is even brighter, but she still says nothing. Past confusion, he's now frustrated and blurts out, Are you deaf? Frustrated as well, she blurts out back, No, I'm not deaf. Are you paralyzed? Here's a question, church. Are we paralyzed? Are we able to read at all the signals from a culture that, yes, is lost in sin, but desperately needs somebody to say, I love you. I'll care about you. I do believe we live in a culture that is lost in sin and I will preach this evil men and imposters are growing from bad to worse and it is frightening but can we read the signals at all of a culture that is in a desperate need to be loved and will respond more positively than we think sometimes if we have the courage to love them so here's the word out of that story kiss somebody for heaven's sake kiss somebody what do you mean by that well that is a kind of a risky metaphor to use we live in a culture that is saturated in sexuality and so that is where we go with that I don't mean that I think you know I don't here's what I mean by kiss somebody invite somebody over take somebody fishing fix somebody's car, mow somebody's lawn, buy somebody dinner, make a friend. Here's the deal. Most of us are not going to do Billy Graham. You know, let go of that dream. So maybe we can do Jared Carl. Jared Carl, let me tell you about him. He's one of the kids who shared at our annual meeting. We had many highlights at that annual meeting. We kind of just celebrated what God was doing among us. And one of the things the high school department did was had a number of kids come up and talk about what youth group has meant to them and what Christ means to them. And Jared was one of those kids. And he got up and shared about a friend of his who had come to Christ that he had met at school. And now this friend of his is coming to church. And as he told his story, it all boiled down to this, that all Jared really did was make a friend. And then in the course of their friendship, Jared lived and spoke about his joy and the reason for his hope. Jared, not particularly articulate, kissed this kid with the gospel of Christ. And what his friend felt most was loved. I'm here to tell you that one of the primary ways of God that reveals the glory of God, especially to people who don't know God, is when the people of God demonstrate the love of God. Jesus said it this way, let your light so shine, let it shine in such a way that they will see your good works, that unbelievers will see your good works, and by what they see glorify, there's that word again, manifested, they will glorify your Father who is in heaven, and they don't even know God yet. story number two heard this one from leonard sweet who got it from gene greidenbach it's a story about charlie and sarah charlie doesn't really like sarah very much doesn't like how she looks how she lives or who she is but it suddenly occurs to charlie that one way to help sarah would be to date her certainly my struggles strengths my strengths would rub off on her she would be much better off if she dated me and eventually she'd even be grateful so Charlie marches up to her door with a pamphlet in her hand entitled 100 Things You Need to Change to Become a Real Person rings the bell, she answers the door he gives her the book saying this I really believe it would be in your best interest if you date me read this pamphlet, when you're done I'll be waiting in the car he probably waited a long time and was probably shocked why she didn't come. Didn't she recognize what a gift I'm giving her? Greidenbach then asks this question. Is there any better picture of the church's attitude to the culture than this one? We are Charlie, the church is Sarah, and if you were able to identify at all, as I was telling that story, with Sarah, then you get a taste of how this culture often experiences us. Condescending at best, angry and hostile at worst. Joseph Aldrich, in his book Lifestyle Evangelism, writes this, all too often, unbelievers are viewed by us as the enemy. Spirituality sometimes by us becomes defined as disdained for and separation from, not just sin, which we need to separate from, but people, which we can't separate from. New Christians are often told that they have nothing in common with unbelieving people. Quite frankly, says Aldrich, I have a lot in common with them. I have a mortgage. I have a car payment. I have kids who misbehave, a lawn to mow, a car to wash, a less-than-perfect marriage, an interest in sports, and I have an ache in my heart that can only be touched by God, just like them. We do well to remember, Aldrich says, that Jesus was called a friend of sinners. A friend. So much so that he was accused by the Pharisees of being a drunk and a glutton himself. A friend of sinners. Hey, Zacchaeus. Yeah, yeah, you, up in the tree. Let's do dinner. I want to be with you why? well I have many reasons but one is I care about you so come here Caden Robinson president of Denver Seminary said this Jesus wouldn't get elected to the boards of many churches why? he ran with the wrong crowd he didn't reject the caress of a prostitute as she washed his feet with her tears the Pharisees were horrified when he allowed that. He touched the untouchable lepers. Lepers undoubtedly were the AIDS victims of their day. He scandalized the religious community of his day by meeting with riffraff. He was often found where beer cans and poker chips were present, not because he loved beer and poker, but because he loved them. So Zacchaeus, yeah, yeah, you, up in the tree. Let's do dinner. I'm coming to your house. I want to be with you. Luke 19, 7 says, The Pharisees began to grumble at this, but Zacchaeus got converted by this, eventually saying, Lord, half of my possessions I will give to the poor, and every one I've defrauded I will pay back four times. The man repented. At a level, I think the Pharisees not only wouldn't have even, the Pharisees wouldn't have even taught that kind of repentance. They wouldn't even understand. but he met God. See, one of the primary ways of God that reveals the glory of God, especially to people who don't know God, is the demonstrated love of God. Jesus showed us that. Story number three. Last one. It's a cartoon in the Wall Street Journal. A guy is calling home for his wife. She isn't there, but she's left this message on the recorder. To find out what's for dinner, press 1. To apologize for something you said, did, or didn't do, press 2. To say, I love you, press 3. Beloved, there are many in our culture who are hostile to the gospel. I'm not going to be naive about that. There are many in the culture who will be hostile toward you, no matter what you do. But there are many more who are desperate for someone like you to press three. It is so important that we do that, not in word only, but in deed. You know what, as I look across this crowd, I see faces. And you know what? I know people who do this. I know people who do this. I want to tell you something. It matters that you do this. Why? Well, you can say it back to me by now. Here's why. Because maybe the most effective way of God that reveals the glory of God, especially to people who don't know God, is when the people of God demonstrate the love of God. You see, there are very few things that have more power to open the hearts of men and women, revealing even their secrets. There are very few things that have more power to generate real worship, causing them eventually to fall on their face and worship God and to declare, God is certainly among you. Very few things have power to do that more than the demonstrated love of God coming from the people of God. Next week, we're going to come around the table. And I'm going to stick with this same theme. But I'm not going to talk so much about how we need to love out there. I'm going to talk a little bit more about how we need to love in here. And sometimes, that one's even tougher. to love one another. People on the same team. Don't you think it's fitting that we come to the table with that one? Be here next week for that. Let's stand as we're dismissed. Father, I thank you for what I think is just a gentle but penetrating, important reminder of how we live our lives before men, men and women, the culture, humans, how we live this out. And in a culture where evil men and imposters are growing from bad to worse, we grow afraid and wanting to protect ourselves from sin as we need to. We wall ourselves off from people in fear and that is not from you. perfect love casts out fear we pray for an anointing I pray for the very work that we wondered about manifested presence reveal glory the work of the spirit in our hearts that would banish our fear to love our neighbors to have the first thing people see about us not just this week but as a way of love a way of life that our way of life would be a way of love for bearing love that it be the first thing they say about us. I pray these things be ever more real among us. In Jesus' name, and all God's people said, amen.
