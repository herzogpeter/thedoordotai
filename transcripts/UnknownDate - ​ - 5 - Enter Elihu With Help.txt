That spirituality is not consistent with you, but partially he really didn't hear him because he was so busy thinking of something else. There is no way for me possibly to emphasize how important it is to learn how to listen. And again, we're not talking about learning how to be therapists. We're learning how to be good friends, how to be a good caregiver and a lover of our mate or our children or someone that we know. Learning to listen is something that I think is going to require of us some discipline, some choosing to do it, because I don't think for everybody it comes naturally. Maybe for some of you it does. Then I think you have a gift. But many of us are so busy trying to fix people, and we're so busy trying to defend ourselves, that really listening to what our kids are saying, ooh, there's a biggie, is very difficult to do. I went over this with Jeff a little bit, and one of the things that he deals with extensively when he trains people for counseling, and one of his focuses right now is specifically getting people and training them to counsel and minister to people in our church, that literally half the therapeutic process is giving people permission to say whatever it is they need to say. And that means he has to learn how to listen. And we have to learn how to listen to what people are saying without correcting it, without making them stop it, giving them permission to say it. A biblical precedent for this is one that you're familiar with if you've been at Open Door very long in the Beatitudes. It said, blessed are the broken, blessed are those who mourn. Remember that word? And the Greek word, there are nine Greek words in the New Testament for being sad or mourning or that kind of heavy feeling. The specific Greek word of the nine that was chosen in the Beatitudes was a word that indicates not just feeling sad, but it is specifically a word that means you get out here externally express the internal sadness. Blessed are those who get out here and express out here the internal sadness or reality, even if it isn't sadness. Whatever is in here, when it gets out here, you're the one who gets comfort. You are the only one who gets comfort. Half of the therapeutic process, half of the healing that takes place is simply allowing people to get it out. And a lot of what comes out is not appropriate. But when it comes out, and again, we said this either last time or the time before, when it comes out, all of a sudden you can begin to sort some of those disjointed, angry, inappropriate feelings. You can begin to sort them out once they get out here. One of the phrases that Jeff uses a lot when we're talking about these kinds of things is that somehow when this feeling that you thought was so scary and so damaging and so evil, when it finally gets verbalized and it comes out here, Somehow that thing that had so much power in here loses its power when it comes out here. It's not all that big. It's not all that scary. It's not all that terrifying. Nobody went away. The building is still standing. Two people by the name of Kharkov and Truex did a study. It was dealing with basic helping skills, and they did some experiments. First of all, they did some experiments with people who needed some counseling, and with the control groups, they sent a portion of those people to a psychologist and a portion of those people who needed counseling to interns of the psychologist. So, you know, a licensed psychologist and then people who are learning to be psychologists. In those two groups, what they noticed was that there was basically the same amount of recovery, the same amount of help was given. Both groups reported about the same percentage of help. Then they did it again and they did it with a group of psychologists and some people went to the psychologist. And by the way, the people didn't know who they were talking to. They all figured that these were all trained professionals. and they sent another group to housewives. Now, they didn't send them to their kitchen, but they brought the housewives in, gave them an office and a clipboard, and they let them talk to housewives. And in this study, anyway, the housewives did better. Now, there's no way I'm going to say, and this is not about women, that housewives are going to be better counselors. What I would say is there's no way I would say that automatically a layman or someone without professional training is going to be a better counselor than someone with professional training. What I would say is that might point to the fact that an awful lot of people who think they need therapy don't. You know what they need? Someone who will listen to them. And I think that's why this kind of talk is extremely appropriate in our church because an awful lot of people who think they need extensive therapy or counseling might. But an awful lot of us, you know what we need? Someone who will what? Listen. You know, we can get real big about all sorts of grandiose, godly things, and I do. But I wonder what kind of revival kind of thing would be attending us if we learned how to listen to each other. To just be quiet, and not talk, and not fix, and not correct, and just listen. incredibly freeing. Zophar couldn't do that. And so I think he missed an enormous time to minister and maybe even short-circuited some of the healing that Job could have gone through at that time. It might have shortened the process. Let's move on to some of the things Zophar said. Verse 3, I listened to the reproof and it insults me. Again, I listened to the reproof, Job. Again, he didn't hear the statement of faith. He just heard Job's reproof. And the spirit of my understanding makes me answer. And in verse 4 through 7 and other verses, we just hear Zophar's theme again. His theme is this. Do you know this from of old? From the establishment of man on earth, this is the truth and it is undeniable that the triumphing of the wicked is short and the joy of the godless is momentary. Everybody knows that. Though his loftiness reaches the heavens and his head touches the clouds, he perishes forever like his refuse. Those who have seen him will say, where is he? Because God took care of him. He does it every time. Verse 15, he swallows witches but will vomit them up, I guarantee you. God will expel them from his belly. Verse 20, because he said no quiet within him, he does not retain anything he desires. The bad man, the wicked guy, doesn't get to keep anything he gets. When he fills his belly, God will send his fierce anger on him and will rain it on him while he is eating. You know what that means? Bad people will have a picnic, and God's going to rain on their picnic. They won't even be able to have a parade. And it's always that way. God always gets the bad guy. They go have a picnic, and it's going to rain on them. He's sounding kind of stupid. Have you ever tried to convince people who were moving in the wrong direction, and they were getting their life from something that couldn't give life, that they were unhappy? Have you ever tried to convince wicked people like Zophar's talking about here that they weren't happy? You're not happy. Yes, I am. No, you're not. Yes, I am. No, you're not. It's great. It's really a fun experience. I told you this a couple weeks ago on Sunday morning. We talked about one of the problems with Israel, according to Jeremiah, was that they had begun to dig their own wells. Remember that? And light their own fires and make their own life. One of the things I told you at that time was, and then God warned. He says, what you need to know is the well you're digging and the life you're making for yourself and the places you're looking to get life are going to leak. They're not going to give you water. I am the only source of life. But what I said at that time, and I just want to reiterate it here, is when somebody's beginning to dig their well, when they're on the front end of that, they're pretty convinced it's going to work. So you trying to convince them that it's not going to work by telling them, evil ones never prosper, it's not going to work. It'd be like somebody who just drove up in a brand new Porsche, and I'd go into a big, long speech about how they can't get their life from the Porsche. It's not going to work. Not then anyway. Maybe in a few months when he can't make his payments. Then we'll talk. But he's talking silly now. He's talking in a way that doesn't make any sense. They never get away with anything, and the bad guys always have the rain on their picnic. Job answers in chapter 21, and Job answers with something that he sees quite differently. You see, I think it's the opposite, Job is about to say. I think it always rains on my picnic. Listen carefully to my speech, verse 2 of chapter 21, and let this be your way of consolation, meaning be quiet and let me talk for a minute. Bear with me that I may speak, and then after I have spoken, you can mock again. A little sarcasm. Verse 7, why do the wicked still live, continue on also, and become very powerful? Now this, I'm going to read some verses here that we could skip through, but I don't want to do that without intersecting with some of your hearts, because the verses I'm about to read might just be the echo of some of your hearts. And you need to know that if it is, you're not the Lone Ranger. Job felt just like this. This is coming from Job, this blameless, godly man. Verse 8, What I see among the wicked is that their descendants are established with them in their sight, their offspring before their eyes, meaning this, their kids grow up, they enjoy their kids, it's a neat family thing. Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God on them. These evil people that you're talking about, Zophar, and you say it always rains on their parade, what I see is that their ox mate without fail. His cow calves and does not abort. They send forth their little ones like the flock, and their children skip about. Again, I see them enjoying their kids. They have this wonderful family. They're all around the pool. They sing to the timbrel and harp and rejoice at the sound of flute. They're dancing and having a riot. They're having a ball. They keep me up at night with their party, and it's driving me nuts. They spend their days in prosperity, and suddenly they go down to Sheil. Now that, suddenly they go down to Sheol, is not God judges them finally and he gets them. That is not what that means. What that means from Job is this. When they die, they die like that. They just go quickly. They die without a struggle. You know how I'm dying? Slow. Boils. No money, no nothing, no respect. When that wicked one dies, he has a heart attack in the middle of the night, and that's what I see. Again, he's being a little bit ridiculous on the other end, but that's what he sees. And they say to God, God depart from us. We do not even desire the knowledge of thy ways. Again, they're digging their own well and they like it. And I don't want the water of life and I don't want the bread of life. So stay away. I like what I got. And I don't see lightning bolts falling on those people. Verse 15, who is the almighty that we should serve him? That's what they say. And what would we gain if we entreat him? They just keep going right on, living their lives the way they want. And by the way, that is one of Job's questions. What would we gain if we entreat him? Remember way back at the beginning, one of the things that Satan said to God, you know, is he good for nothing? Is he being good for no reason? I should say it that way. Job's asking that question now. Chapter 22, Eliphaz begins to respond. Eliphaz, again, this whole thing is beginning to escalate a little bit. Eliphaz is going to get a little bit wild in his accusations and desperate in his attempts to shut Job up. Verse 4 of chapter 22, Is it because of your reverence that God reproved you? I mean, what's the deal, Job? Do you think that this is all happening to you because you're so holy? Is this like some gift that God's given you? I don't understand. that he enters into judgment against you because you're so reverent? Verse 5. Is not your wickedness great? Obviously. Don't keep defending yourself, Job. Obviously you are in sin. Again, that's their theme. If you do good things, God likes you and does good things to you. If you do bad things, bad things happen to you, and that's the formula. Good things happen to good people, bad things happen to bad people. When I see bad things happen to good people, My assumption is they weren't really good people. Is not your wickedness great and your iniquities without end? Verse 6, For you have taken pledges of your brothers without cause and stripped men naked. When did he do that? To the weary you have given no water to drink? When did he do that? Well, who knows? I'm just assuming he must have done this. And from the hungry you have withheld bread, but the earth belongs to the mighty man and the honorable man dwells in it. You're obviously not honorable. You have sent widows away empty, and the strength of orphans has been crushed by you. Therefore, snares surround you, and sudden dread terrifies you. Job, you are a bad guy. Dollar is to it. Verse 21. Yield now, and be at peace with him. Thereby good will come to you. Are you getting tired of this? It's the same thing over and over. They've got this little formula, and they are just hanging on to that tenaciously. Please receive instruction from his mouth and establish his words in your heart. Verse 21, Yield now, be at peace with him, therefore good will come to you. What that means is this, Job, get right with God. Point number two, please receive instruction from his mouth and establish his words in your heart. Get into the word. So if you get right with God and you get into the word, all this, your boils will go away and you'll get your money back and you'll get your status returned and all this stuff is going to be great. Should you get right with God? Yes. Should you get in the Word? Yes. Does that guarantee it's all going to be great? No. That's a lie. And many of us have been lied to. And even this kind of mentality that if you do good, it panders to even our selfishness because our real commitment to God has nothing to do with love and devotion to God. It has to do with almost like a rabbit's foot relationship with God. If I do the right thing, I'll be protected. It has nothing to do with absolute devotion to sovereign God, no matter what. It's using God and manipulating Him to get what I want. It reminds me of Jacob when he said, I don't remember the text. I hate this when things like this come. I can't remember the context or the text. but he came and he said, God, if you protect me on my journey and if you do this for me and you do that for me, then you will be my God. And I'll tell you what, I'll do all these nice things. If you do this for me, I'll do this for you. It's a deal. It's not a relationship. And ironically, these three guys with all their godly answers look real spiritual and the truth is they have no relationship with God. They have this arrangement. Again, verse 23, same thing. If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored. If you remove unrighteousness far from your tent, everything is going to be great. Verse 28, chapter 22 is where we are still. Verse 28, you will also decree a thing, and it will be established for you, and light will shine on your ways. Now he says something that has the potential for some truth. There's something here, when you are cast down, you will speak with confidence. Now, he's making a promise here. What I'd like to do is back off that and ask a question with that. Here's my question. I want to rephrase it. He's making this as an absolute thing. The question would come like this. Is it possible to have confidence when you're cast down? Is that a possible thing? Is that a thing that we can ever experience? I think it is. And what I think we've got here is an example of someone who's saying some right words with the wrong purpose, with the wrong motive, but he's saying some right words. It is possible for people to experience an inner settledness and an inner kind of peace and an inner confidence in the midst of things going wrong. Turn to Philippians chapter 4. I don't have any Pollyanna wonderful thing on making it all go wonderfully nice and warm and gooey feelings, but Paul had a secret here. Paul understood something about this, and Job had yet to learn it. In chapter 4, verse 11 of Philippians, he says, I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am. Verse 12, I know how to get along with humble means and also how to live in prosperity. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret. It's like, I like that. It's like there's a secret to this. I have learned the secret of being full, having a lot, having my kids there, having the barn full, and of going hungry, having nothing there, both of having abundance and of suffering need, verse 13. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. What that means is this. In everything I do, whether I have it all full, whether my kids are all in order or my kids are a mess, whether my barns are full or my barns are empty, either way, I'm hanging on to Jesus for dear life. That verse has been pulled out of context for all sorts of weird things. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. It means we can do anything we want. In the name of God, you can conquer and win and da-da-da-da. What this really means is you could even be poor and God would give you the strength, give you an inner confidence, give you an inner strength in the middle of all sorts of tumult to somehow experience a peace. That does not mean it feels, isn't this a good day? No, not like that. But a peace that passes understanding, hanging on for dear life to Jesus, in the middle of bounty and in the middle of nothing. I can do both those things. That's the secret. Hanging on to Jesus as my only hope. I don't want to get off on this, but sometimes it's harder to hang on to Jesus as your only hope when you have a lot because there's a real strong tendency to hang on to that. And it's more painful when it's all taken away, but the instinct is to hang on to Jesus. We're crying, we're bleeding, we're hurting, we're scared, but we are hanging on to Jesus. What Eliphaz is saying here as something is a possibility. And the reason I'm bringing it up this way is that he is giving Job right words the wrong way. And that's another counseling help. You can say right things and brought the wrong way can do incredible damage. Verse 29, brought with love, could have had a tremendous impact on Job. Job, I know you're hurt. Job, I need to get down with you here and just grab you for a minute. I want you to know I see your pain. I want you to know I care about you. And I know that you love God. And I know a lot of your words are coming off real sideways and weird. But maybe now more than ever before in your life, you just need to hang on to God and I'll help you do that. I'll hang on to you while you hang on to Him. How about that? Let's do that. But that is not the way this is coming down. What we hear out of Eliphaz here is, Job, you're a bum. Get right with God. Be quiet. If you were doing it right, you'd have confidence right now. And more than we'd like to admit, I think sometimes that happens in Christian circles. Chapter 23, Job replies. Need to keep something in mind as I go into this. Job has watched all the formulas fall. He is past having any confidence whatsoever in any of the one, two, three things that his friends are giving him having any hope. Intimacy with God is beginning to grow. He is asking all sorts of very scary questions, although the thing that's scariest while he's asking some very real questions, his real question is, I'm not sure who God is, but he's coming right toward God. Chapter 23, verse 2. Even today my complaint is rebellion. His hand is heavy despite my groaning. Oh, that I knew where I might find him, that I might come to his seat. That I might come to his seat. Do you hear that? In Hebrews 4, there's a talk about a seat. There is something coming from the heart of Job here. There's a yearning for something here that he doesn't even know is available. One of the things you need to remember is that this book is the first book that was ever written. Obviously, it's in the Old Testament. There's no way he could have read Hebrews 4, where it says that we do not have a high priest who is untouched by our feelings, but one that we can come to, and one that has been touched with all of the pain we've ever felt. Therefore, draw near with confidence to the mercy seat. He's saying here, I would that I could find the seat, that I might come to his seat. He had a yearning before he knew about the mercy seat for the mercy seat. It's almost like, if we could catch this as a drama, you almost feel like interrupting it and going, Job, there is a mercy seat. Even now there's a mercy seat. And while you think you're being incredibly inappropriate with your charging toward God, you are okay to be charging toward God. He has not heard the lesson out of Hebrews 4.13 like you've been able to hear. He has not heard about the verb being in the present tense. That means not only can you come to the mercy seat, but the verb in the present tense means you can keep on coming and keep on coming and keep on coming with all of your pain and all of your anger and all of your frustration and don't stop coming. Keep on drawing near. As often as you need to draw near, draw near. And when you do, you know what you're going to receive? Grace and mercy to help in time of need. Do you get the paradox? He thought, while he's coming, I'm being bad, but I'm going to do it anyway. At worst, there was a seat. There isn't a seat. I'm going in. But there was a seat. He was going where he ought to be going, right through all sorts of blockades. If there was a mercy seat, I would present my case. I would fill my mouth with arguments. I would learn the words which he would answer and perceive what he would say to me. Would he contend with me by the greatness of his power? Know what that means? When I came to him with what my feelings were, would he get real big and go, kaboom! God's going to nail him. We'll deal with that next week. He says, verse 6, No, surely he would pay attention to me. There was something, this is weird, but there was something resonating in Job's heart without ever having a Bible lesson about the character of God that there was a mercy seat, that I could be heard, that I could go, and I could be sloppy and messy and inappropriate and wrong, and he would hear me. As we leave chapter 23, we leave Job kind of hanging by a thread. There's believing there. There's some measure of hope there. I think he would hear me. I'm not sure. I kind of don't know about a mercy seat. I wish there was one. I think if there was, he'd hear me. But as we come through chapter 24 and 25, as the rallying back and forth goes on, something snaps in Job. In fact, he begins, when we come to chapter 26, in a final desperate attempt, I think, to find peace somewhere, he abandons a lot of his honest, open, vulnerable protestations. no longer a vulnerable spirit. He begins to adopt the tactics of the three. He begins to get real aggressive, pompous, arrogant, and religious. And his talk as we move into this is designed to shut these guys up just like their talk was designed to shut him up. Let's begin. Verse 2. I paraphrase verse 2 and 3 as this. Bark at the moon. That's what he's saying. I want you guys to go bark at the moon. What a help you are to the weak. How you have saved the arm without strength. What counsel you have given to one without wisdom. What helpful insight you have abundantly provided. I just get this feeling that he's not being very sincere. Chapter 29. In chapter 29, we begin to get a panorama of Job's life. But what Job is really doing here, as I said a little bit ago, It's like he snaps here. He's beginning to build his defense. And while a couple minutes ago, or just seconds ago, I talked about him yearning for a mercy seat, where I could come and he'd hear me, and he wouldn't blow me up. Now, however, he's coming, and rather than, I really think he'd hear me, like a gentle, I don't know how to say it any better than just this, I could pour my heart out to him. Now he's kind of thinking, I'm going to come into God's presence, and I'm going to present a case. Because I got a case. I have been good. And this really ticks me off. I have been treated unfairly, so I am going to build my case and I am going to start to gather the evidence that what has happened to me is not fair and God owes me. That's what's going on here. Let's look at it. Oh, that I were as in months gone by, as in the days when God watched over me. When His lamp shone over my head and by His light I walked through darkness as I was in the prime of my days when the friendship of God was over my tent, when the Almighty was yet with me and my children were all around me, when my steps were bathed in butter. Isn't that great? Everything was smooth. And the rock poured out for me streams of oil. Everything was great. Verse 7, When I went out to the gate of the city, when I took my seat in the square. What that means is that he was probably a city official. He had status in the community. Went out to the gate of the city, took his seat in the square. He was an alderman or something like that. Position of respect, rank, and influence. Verse 8, the young men saw me and hid themselves. I intimidated people. I like that. An old man rose and stood. The princes stopped talking and put their hands on their mouths. The voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue stuck to their palate when I walked in. It was like when E.F. Hutton talks, people listen. And Job walked in a room and everybody, here's Job, be quiet, let's listen to him. I remember those days. Verse 13, a little sarcasm, the blessing of the one ready to perish came upon me. I got the blessing of the one who was ready to perish. I made the widow's heart sing for joy. I put on righteousness and it clothed me. I was really great. I was a righteous guy. My justice was like a robe and a turban. I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame. Don't tell me I messed up the widow. I was wonderful. I was a father to the needy. I investigated the case, which I did not know. I broke the jaws of the wicked and snatched the prey from his teeth. Then I thought I shall die in my nest. Security. I'm going to die in my sleep, just like the one I was yelling a little bit ago about the wicked one who goes down to Sheol like that. That's how I'm going to die. I had my life planned. Verse 21. To me they listened and waited, kept silent for my counsel. Verse 25. I chose a way for them and sat as chief and dwelt as a king among the troops, as one who comforted the mourners. But now those younger than I mock me. Stop right there. Again, he's building a case, he's adding it all up, and at the end he's saying with the way I've lived my life, what's happening to me now is not fair. what I expected at the end of my life was a gold watch and a banquet I expected that I should die in my nest with everybody applauding but it's not working out that way I had an experience this last summer that shook me a little bit I wouldn't call it a job experience it wasn't as extreme as that but it shook some of my little paradigms of if you do everything, you're going to get kind of paid off. And it had to do with my dad. Some of you know that in the middle of summer, I don't even remember what it was, somewhere in July or something like that, I wasn't here one Sunday. And I think it was announced that I was home because there was some sort of kind of crisis in my family and I don't know how much they explained about that. It wasn't anybody dying or anything like that. But my dad, who has been in the ministry ever since he was out of seminary, and in the church he's in right now for 25 years, was going through a very difficult time. I don't have time to go into all the details of it and how it all happened, just suffice it to say that there was an enormous power struggle going on. He was seeking more and more to move into the reality of the kingdom, experience the power of it, bring some worship things into this Baptist church, and also confront some legalistic things that had crept up. It's amazing to me. It kind of serves as a warning. Just because you talk about that stuff doesn't mean it goes away. And some real firm and scary legalism had come, even among the leadership. He had come to the point in the middle of summer where he confronted that, and things were just crumbling all around. A church around 2000, a real solid church, and it was just coming all down around him. They had had a public meeting just a few days before where I called home, And I heard my mom on the other end crying, and I couldn't hardly hear her. And again, you know, I grew up in this church, and I couldn't hardly hear what she was saying. And she said some things like, I just didn't think it would end like this. I didn't think it would end like this. Because we went up against some wolves on this one, and I have all these little cliches. I've preached this stuff. You know, it's like I was ready to say them, and it's not the right time. Like, Mom, when you unmask a wolf, don't expect them to lick your hand. Remember those? if you were with us in Galatians, you heard that all through Galatians. When you unmask a wolf, they nail you. And they had just gotten nailed. But this was after 25 years and maybe they weren't expecting it or it doesn't matter what. And I didn't expect it to end this way. And I think I'm pretty much above thinking you got any guarantees but I remember getting really angry and feeling like this guy is close to retirement. He's 64, 65 years old and he's going through the biggest battle of his ministry. This isn't right. This isn't fair. And then I gave her some truth that I thought was real right and real helpful. And it dawned on me, and it's not a real happy thought, but I said, you know, if we've got this little paradigm that the way we finish is the verifier of our life, then the disciples didn't do very, very well. Every one of them got hung on a cross or tortured or chopped their head off. People didn't like them at the end. They didn't finish real well. They didn't get a gold watch in a banquet. If that's your paradigm, you better fix it because you don't have the guarantee. Well, we went home and there was some neat ministry and a lot of love in there and praying together and hanging on to each other. It was really a fun thing. And God protected them and protected that church. God loves his church. And so through that whole thing, they've wobbled a little bit, but they're still there, and the people who got confronted, who looked like it was going to overwhelm, have left, and God's beginning to raise some life there. So I have, oh, it's all good. Well, there's a lesson there that I'll never forget, and that is you've got no guarantee that it's all going to end great. Yeah, and neither do I. I went through a real personal thing as this Job thing. Then I thought I shall die in my nest. But again, we've got these paradigms, and it was a weird thing. I went through a real personal thing on this whole thing, and I couldn't figure it out because it came out of left field. And you might go through something like this, but I'm in the ministry too, see? And I have a real neat relationship with my dad. Since God brought some brokenness into our family, and I told you about some of those incidents before, God bonded us. And for my whole life, I really feel like I hang on to Jesus, but there's this weird security I get from my dad that anything I ever go through, he's already gone through it. And there's always been this comfort in talking to him, and his big line was whenever I call him and something's blowing up, he goes, hey, you haven't bled yet, have you? Okay, that's good. But there's a way in which, and it's not entirely healthy, as his life would just continue to progress and he would mature, and I would just see substance in him, and I would think, you know, I'm kind of going the same way. you know i'm still moving in the same directions and i like that but now he stumbled and it wasn't sin it was he got he's not and i began to i i was i came home and this was like a week or two after i came home and what were the behavior that that emerged in me was seemingly totally disconnected from this incident and the behavior was i was really angry around the house i was really short with the kids. I was real angry with Bonnie about things that didn't matter, and something was bubbling and boiling inside of me. And one night, I mean, in the middle of the night, I just couldn't sleep, and I, you know, Bonnie, get up, we got to talk, I don't know what this is. And when I do that, I start pacing back and forth. And one of the things that began to happen to me, and I just began to weep, because I had to grieve over a stupid dream that I didn't think I even had. And it was something that Job's going through right here. It was, I was looking at my dad and I was going, so that's what you get after you pour your life out. You get dumped on. And I was not doing this intentionally, okay? And what was going on inside of me was, you know what it was? Ain't gonna happen to me. Nobody's gonna dump on me. I was getting bigger and bigger and bigger. And the bigger I got, the more feeble I really was, you know, and the more trying to protect my life. something even went through my mind was you know those kind of things won't ever happen to me how can you protect against it how can you make sure you never get hurt how can you do that well there's a couple ways one you can be so good nobody can touch you you can always be right you can always do the right thing you can always make the right move fat chance nobody's that good you know and so when i so i think about i'll just i'll just i'll just handle it better than he did fat chance you you can't that if your protection for going to long haul and never getting hurt is being so good you got no protection because you're not that good nobody here is then what's the other thing the other thing is i can just withdraw from everybody i can withdraw from the ministry. I can withdraw from my wife. I can withdraw from my kids. And you know what? If I do that, I won't get hurt either. That's what was happening. It's not real pretty, is it? I think it happens all the time. See, I thought I'd die in my nest. I thought I'd die and get a gold watch. So did my dad. You don't have that guarantee. If you've got that paradigm that if I just do it and faithfully serve. It'll all be great. You know what? An awful lot of people faithfully serve the Lord and get a gold watch. They have a banquet, and it's incredible, and it's fun. I do remember an Awana magazine, and you guys don't know this guy, but Lance B. Latham was the founder of the Awana Youth Association. I grew up in Chicago, so I knew that guy, and he was a grand old man, just just a grand old guy. And when he died, he was an example to me of somebody who fought the fight and finish the course and he went out with everybody cheering. But you don't have that guarantee. If you've got that picture in your mind, you're going to get tripped up. I think, again, of Hebrews 11. Some, by faith, conquered kingdoms, put foreign armies to flight. Others, by faith, were sawn in two, didn't receive their reward. You've got to let those silly things, if you're serving God and obeying him because this is what you have to do to make it turn out right in this life, you've got a wrong motive. And hopefully God will blow it up in a real nice, gentle way like he did with me. But see, he's going to have to blow that up again and again and again because it's going to come up again in me. I just learned it for this month. Chapter 30. He almost gets silly in his defending of himself. In fact, let's move on to 31. This is where it gets funny. His defense of his integrity becomes absurd. I like this. Verse 1 of chapter 31. This is how holy I am. I have made a covenant with my eyes. How then could I gaze on a virgin? I don't even look at girls. What a guy. It's great. He really does have something coming here. Verse 5. If I have walked with falsehood and my foot has hastened after deceit, Let him weigh me with accurate scales and let God know my integrity. Come on, God. You've got nothing on me. Just weigh me on the scales and you will find I come out righteous. Verse 9. If my heart has been enticed by a woman or if I have lurked at my neighbor's doorway, may my wife grind for another and let others kneel down before her, but I have not done that kind of thing. Verse 13. If I have despised the claim of my male or female slaves when they filed a complaint against me, then I would have a reason to be punished, but I haven't done that. Verse 16, If I have kept the poor from their desire or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail, then they would have a case, but they don't because I haven't done that. Or have eaten, I'm in verse 17, my morsel alone or the orphans has not shared it. Verse 19, if I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing or that the needy had no covering. Verse 21, if I have lifted up my hand against the orphan because I saw I had support in the gate, let my shoulder fall from the socket and my arm be broken off at the elbow. That's really colorful. We are so boring. We say, may I be struck with a lightning bolt. These guys are colorful. May my shoulder fall off from the socket and my arm be broken off at the elbow. I don't know how that would look, but may the fleas of a thousand camels invade you. Whatever. These guys are great. Verse 29. Have I rejoiced in the extinction of my enemy or exalted when evil befell him? I even love my enemies. I am incredible. Verse 38. I'm even a good ecologist. If my land cries out against me and its furrows weep together, If I have eaten its fruits without mercy or have caused its owners to lose their lives, let briars grow instead of wheat and stink wheat instead of barley, the words of Job are ended. I deserve better. I've done it right. And I, again, this is no longer that kind of I want to pour my heart out to God at the mercy seat. He's coming to God with a real strong self-righteous tone now. I have a case, and you've done me wrong. I deserve better. I've been in the ministry for 25 years. I've been raising my kids and doing it to the bone and da-da-da-da-da-da-da. And this isn't fair. Job's words end. The sad thing is he's still up a tree. Nobody on the table will know what we're laughing at, and I'm not even sure. I just heard her laugh. You're totally humiliated. He's still up a tree. He's still in a lot of pain. He's hurt and hostile, and he's still very defensive. Chapter 32, some helpful help finally begins to come. His three friends, by the way, have left. Verse 1, Then these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. They are out of the picture. Enter Elihu. Elihu is a guy we haven't heard from. He's been here, but we haven't heard from him. We are going to now. One of the questions I left you with last week as you were dismissed was this. If we've been learning from Eliphaz, Zophar, and Bildad all the things you're not supposed to do, what are the things we're supposed to do? What are some helpful things that we should do to give people helpful help? And in learning what not to do, we've learned a lot of things as to what to do. But if you've been here these weeks, you might even get the impression that maybe the way we're supposed to handle people who are coming off with all the kinds of things that Job is saying is we're just supposed to be quiet and receive it. And if I were to apply this to my life, when my kids start to scream and get totally out of whack and they're rebellious, I'm just supposed to smile and go, okay, well, that's just fine. These three counselors were hurtful and offensive. So I don't want to be like that, so I'm just going to go, oh, if that's how you feel, that's just great. Well, the problem is these three guys were hurtful and offensive. But what we also need to understand is that somebody who's just got their head bobbing you is hurtful and offensive as well. And it's not as hurtful and offensive as it is not helpful help. It's just not helpful. There's no strength in it. I don't know if you've ever had that experience. You've had the experience because there are people that instinctively you go to when you've got stuff, you've got to vent. There are people you go to with happy feelings. They can handle happy feelings, life feelings, and now it's really easy to go. but you know that I don't talk to them about the venting stuff. You don't talk to two people. The one person you're not going to give your venting feelings to is someone who's going to bash you in the face and tell you to shut up and push you down. That's one person. You're not going to go to them with your venting things. The other person you're not going to go to is someone who's a marshmallow. They just kind of, there's nothing. You might go to them when you want to get somebody on your side, and we manipulate people that way, but when you really want some help, It drives me crazy, and I think you too, when you bump up against something and it's just mush. There's nothing there. They don't push back. They don't fight back. It's just blech. You don't need a yes man. I think of these little statues in the back of these cars that people used to have like that. You don't need that. That doesn't help. Elihu is going to be interesting because, and it's going to be so encouraging because he doesn't do everything right. There are going to be things that he says that are wrong, but there's something about Elihu's spirit and some things that he does right that somehow Job allows him to say even things that are inappropriate, even things that sound like the other three. But because of some relational things that are going on, it's somehow okay, and Job even hears it. One of the things Elihu does, that the other three did, but he will do it as well, is confront him. It will not be a yes man thing. It will not be, oh yeah, that's okay, no problem. You want to say, I hate everybody? Well, that's good. He doesn't do that. He's going to come up against Job. Elihu has the courage to confront. Confrontation is something I just want to give a little note on real quickly. What do you think of when you think of confrontation? When you think of, well, I really need to confront that person, or you think of, well, that person's going to confront me, generally kind of warm and gooey feelings and bright sunny day and kind of relaxing, loving, encouraging, supportive. No, when we think of confrontations, we think of glowering stares and a bowed head and a stooped shoulder and a pointing finger. Most of us, I think, have a connection with confrontation and anger. By the way, I don't think confrontation is ever easy, ever. But I think a lot of us have connections with confrontation that are almost always angry. And the reason is, and this is my theory here, so I don't have a big, long thing on this, but I think that the reason confrontation is so terribly difficult for us is that most of the time the confrontations we've received have been in the form of anger. And the reason they've come in anger is because the thing that gave the person the courage to finally say what they wanted to say was that they got mad enough. Do you understand? They needed to say what they were going to say. And they needed to say it two months ago. Okay? You've done that. You've received that. You had something that you needed to confront, you needed to say, and if you would have dealt with it on the front end when it happened, you could have brought it and said, you know, I really love you, but there's this issue we've got, and can we just talk about this? That's okay, and I can hang on to you while I'm doing that, but you don't do that because you're so loving. See, the reason you don't confront isn't because you're so loving, it's because we're scared, it's our own self-protection more, that I don't want them to not like me. So I say it's because I love you and I don't want to hurt you, so I won't say anything. That's not the real reason, I don't think. For me, it's because I don't want them to not like me. That's why I don't. So I save it and save it and save it and save it, and I really want to say it and I don't want to say it, and it's true, and it is true, maybe. At least it's a true perception that I have. I may need to get that perception cleared up. That's what happens a lot, by the way, isn't it? When you talk to them and you go, oh, that's not what you meant and that's not what you feel. Oh, okay. But you save it and you save it and you save it. And finally what gives you the courage to confront is that you get mad enough. That's why very often confrontation comes like this with anger. And most of us have connotations of confrontation as being with anger. And so the whole concept as a valuable thing is something we honestly don't even see. You can't see it as being valuable because it's always destructive. It doesn't have to be. sometimes confrontation not only is angry but I'm using confrontation in right words to get you away from me because you threaten me somehow and so I'm going to blast you just to get you away from me. It doesn't have to be that way. It's really neat to see that Elihu is going to confront Job. He's going to come at him and say some ba-boom kinds of things. But it is not with the venomous, frightened, self-protective anger that the other three come with. Job's honesty scared those guys. It doesn't scare him. Elihu is going to be an example of a good friend, a breath of fresh air, a model, if you will, for us, of what it means to be a good caregiver. Let me give you five characteristics of Elihu's caregiving. The first thing about Elihu that allowed him even to maybe do it wrong in some situations was that he was genuine. He was real with Job. He was not a yes man, But he was genuine. He said what was true without partiality. He's going to come to Job with an understanding of who Job is, and he's going to be honest with Job about what he sees. I see some things here, Job, that are not good. I'm going to tell you that. But he fits things together. The first indicator of his honesty is in verse 2, chapter 32. It says in verse 2, the anger of Elihu, the son of Barakal, the Buzite, the son of Barakal, the Buzite, of the family of Ram, burned. It burned against Job, his anger burned, because he justified himself before God. The three were angry at Job. He is angry at Job as well. His anger burned, however, also against the three friends because they found no answer and yet condemned Job. Job, I have something to confront you with. We're going to go head to head here. What you said has made me angry, and I want to talk to you about that, but I also need to tell you something. I'm not on their side either. I have seen what they have said to you, and they have given you absolutely no help. They've given you no answer. All they've done is X'd you off. They've just condemned you, and I'm angry at them as well. So I am not coming to you the way they are, but I am going to be genuine with you. I'm going to tell you what I'm really thinking. He's not terribly tactful. So being tactful is not the answer, necessarily. He is not totally tactless, either. I think both of you guys are wrong. He wasn't terribly worried about offending Job. He wasn't terribly worried about offending the three, either. He wasn't looking for a bad guy. One of the things that I think is really significant about Jeff's ministry and counseling with people, and I just know this about him, is couples come in scared to death because everyone who comes in is not wanting to go to a counselor because they know they're going to get beat up because I'm going to be the bad guy or I'm going to be the bad one. And one of the foundational aspects of his counseling is there aren't any bad guys here. There's hurt people. You've done some bad things and you've done some bad things, but we're going to operate on this. There's nothing accomplished by finding a bad guy. Let's just kind of put that away. Looking for blame is not a big deal. Believe it or not, even though he's coming and saying, I've got some things I want to talk to you about, Job, and there's some things burning in me, this guy is a comfort already to Job. At least he's not going to take sides. At least he might be honest. He won't lie for God the way these other three guys did. Maybe there is some help here. Another indication of his genuineness is in verse 6. He's transparent. He's going to come to Job and say, here's what kind of how I feel. Verse 6. So Elihu, the son of Barakal the Buzite, spoke out and said, I am young in years and you are old. Therefore, when this whole thing began to happen, I felt shy and afraid to tell you what I think. He's not coming in like a big he-man. Yeah, I got all the answers and you guys are really goofed up and I was openly, he is openly admitting here what could be interpreted as weakness. And a lot of us, when we think we're going to be caregivers, we've got to be in a position of strength. We've got to be in a position where I know the answers, you don't. I'm above you. That's the position these three guys took. He's saying, listen, I'm not sure I have all this stuff, and you are older, and I was timid and shy. Verse 7 and 8. I thought age should speak. Increase years should teach wisdom. But there's something else about his genuineness, and I like this, and I don't even know how I can communicate this well. I hope you just grab it somehow. His genuineness, I think, was his ability to be transparent and just say, I'm kind of shy about this, and I kind of want to move tentatively here. His ability to be vulnerable and honest about what was really going on was really coming from a position of confidence. He was really okay with who he was. See, I know something. Wisdom is in the spirit of a man. It's in his heart. And see, I know something about my heart towards you, Job. I don't hate you. I love you. And I have some things to give you, and I can come confidently, not because I'm old, not because I'm wise, not because I've got an education, but because I know what's in my heart. I know what's in my spirit. I genuinely love you. It isn't years that teach wisdom. Those three guys had years and there wasn't any wisdom. It's the spirit of the man that gives wisdom. And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding. The abundant in years may not be wise, nor may elders understand justice. So I say, listen to me, and I'm going to tell you what I think. Another indicator of his genuineness was that he was emotionally straightforward. He was confident. He was not cocky. He was confident in himself enough, and he knew his own heart enough to be transparent and say what he really thought. I'm shy. I don't feel terribly adequate to do this, but I'm going to tell you what I think. Another is that he's emotionally straightforward. Verse 11. Behold, I waited for your words. I listened to your reasonings while you pondered what to say. I even paid close attention to you. Indeed, there was no one who refuted you, Job. Not one of you who answered his words. There were not one of those three guys who answered your words. 18 to 20. Job, I am full of words. The spirit within me constrains me. Behold, my belly is like unvented wine. Like new wineskins, it is about to burst. Let me speak that I may get relief. Let me open my lips that I might answer. I want to get everything out. I want to get everything that I'm thinking out here. I have felt like that I think that there's a dynamic that's going on here where he's saying I need to get out here what's in here I don't think it's going to come the way the other three did because they vented too but I need to tell you honestly what's going on inside of me and I need to show you what's really going on in my heart I'm a little bit scared about doing this but I'm going to do it anyway just a little back off here on this whole thing of transparency and vulnerability and as you go into it, kind of being in a vulnerable position and not in this position of strength. I had a professor in seminary who, I never forgot this, who gave a word about vulnerability and transparency from the pulpit. And what he said was this, don't ever show your weakness to people. Don't ever do that. Tell your weaknesses to God and to God alone. Show people your strength. because what people need is an example. And what his paradigm was was the example they need to see is strength. He was a great man, and I respect him a lot, but in this he was just wrong. And by the way, every pastor who you ever met got told that in seminary. Unless they went to some seminary I've never heard of yet. See, we have this idea that to be vulnerable and transparent, number one, we don't like that because we don't want to be wrong. The other reason is we feel like we're going to lose credibility if we ever show inner struggle. See, I think the example that we need to give is not of a paragon of absolute, always strength. The example you give is of someone who's in process, just like everybody else. That's the example, and that's the thing I want people to follow. Someone who's in process, just like everybody else. Paul said it this way, I have not arrived. Remember that in Philippians? Not that I've arrived, I haven't arrived. I'm pressing on. And then the very next verse, after that verse, I think it's Philippians 3, that's another one of these that I just, I have this little paraphrase in my mind. He says, as many of you as are mature have this attitude in you. What's the attitude that you're going to have that proves you're mature? The attitude that is the mature attitude is this, I have not arrived, but I'm pressing on. I'm in process. That's a mature attitude. So he comes opening up his heart. He comes as a genuine person. He's real, and that's the example he's going to give. And somehow, even though he's coming on pretty strong, that dispels a lot of the tension. Okay, the first thing is genuineness. Genuineness. The second thing is this. He identifies with Job. He identifies with Job personally. Look at chapter 32, verse 11. I already gave you this one. Behold, I waited for your words. I listened to your reasonings while you pondered what to say. I even paid close attention to you. Indeed, there was no one who refuted you, not one of you who answered his words. Job, I want to identify with you. I want you to know that I agree with you. I was here and I listened to what you said and I agree with you that those people did not give you good counsel. And I don't know if you can feel what it must have felt like to be in Job's shoes at this time. And you've been here these weeks as he's been thrashing against these accusations, all of a sudden he's hearing somebody go, I agree with you, they didn't give good counsel. It was like he could just go, oh my. He can put his dukes down. He's identifying with Job. It's a great relief. Verse 22. Let me now be partial to no one, though. While I don't think they gave you good counsel, I'm not going to flatter you. For I do not know how to flatter, else my maker would soon take me away. Chapter 33, verse 5. Refute me if you can. Array yourselves before me and take your stand, Job. Behold, I belong to God like you. I too have been formed out of the clay. Stop. Did you hear those words? Again, I'm reading so many verses, they're probably buzzing right by you. Behold, I belong to God just like you. I too have been formed out of the clay. You know what he's doing there? This is way different talk than the other three. I belong to God, and you know what, Job? So do you, and I know you do. What is that? That's respect. I recognize you, Job, as someone who is a child of God. I recognize you as someone who loves God, who walks with God. I am just, we are this, we're no different. You got boils right now, and you got a lot of pain, but you and I are the same. There is an identifying with Job. Not a flattery of speech. but an identify. I too am formed out of the clay. I'm a man, you're a man. I love this seventh verse. I got this underlined and all sorts of junk all around it. Behold, Job, no fear of me should terrify you, nor should my pressure weigh heavy on you. I got some good news for you, Job. I have not come to beat you up. I am not going to drop guilt bombs on you. I am not going to manipulate you. There is no pressure from me. It's not going to weigh heavy on you. You don't need to be afraid of me. I'm not here to intimidate you and get big. But I'm not going to flatter you either. Helpful help is coming. He's not going to deal with him on the basis of fear and manipulation. I don't want to get off and do all sorts of meddling here, but I just know that this is a real issue in a lot of churches, in church, in the evangelical arena. churches very often are run on the principle of fear and manipulation the guiltier we can make people feel the more afraid of judgment we can make them the more we can get them to give their money and the more we can get them to teach their class the more we can get them to be involved by making them guilty and fearful the truth is this in the new covenant God does not control his people by the fear of a broken law he does it by the filling of his spirit and we are not to be motivated by that kind of fear behold no fear of me should terrify you and no pressure should weigh heavily upon you we're going to get you well from the inside so you can serve for right reasons he identified with Job next thing is extremely important he brought with him an atmosphere of acceptance of Job that didn't necessarily approve of his behavior he accepted Job without necessarily approving of his behavior or his words again I'm not going to flatter you you've already seen the dynamic of acceptance and yet not approval already and proving of what he's saying necessarily chapter 33 verse 8 surely you have spoken in my hearing and I have heard the sound of your words that is another powerful verse that could just kind of blow by Job I have heard every rebellious thing you've said I have heard every obnoxious thing you've said I have heard every angry and hurtful thing you've said and you know what Job there's one difference between me and the three other guys what is it? I'm still here he hung in there with Job the three friends abandoned him you know I have this thing about overstating you know this is the most important thing listening is the if there's one thing and this is something that somehow is maturity somehow it's a work of the spirit think about bringing this into your home an atmosphere of acceptance and loving of that child and loving of that friend that doesn't necessarily approve of the behavior, but at the same time instruction is given, there is an embracing at the same time. And maybe because that dynamic has never happened to us, we're at a loss as to how to have that happen. And the issue to me is that healing needs to take place. Sometimes that's a process. Hopefully a lot of that can happen here as we just walk with God and learn more about His grace. But hanging on to people and loving and receiving them and drawing them to ourselves, even though behavior is stuff that we're needing to deal with. I gave you an episode a couple weeks ago of my own family with my sister, and the piece I didn't give you was that I was told about the incident with my sister and my dad when I was going into the ministry, and it became apparent to my dad that that was going to happen. He pulled me aside, and he told me about my sister and him. And you probably remember that. I'll tell you very briefly what happened there. My sister was going through some enormous pain. My dad related the experience of how they were sitting in a psychologist's office fighting for my sister's emotional life, literally. And she, at some point in the therapy, expressed some real flagrant hostility. The psychologist asked my dad, how do you react to that? And my dad told me that he said, what I said was, I think I'll just have to leave Sherry with the Lord. And Sherry, my sister, began to cry when he said that. And the psychologist looked at my dad and said, maybe what you need to do is quit with all these spiritual sounding words putting your children on God's doorstep and draw them to yourself. You need to start wrapping your arms around your kids even when you don't like what they do. And you don't know how to do that, Mr. Johnson, Reverend Johnson. And what he told me was, Dave, it was the first time I saw how I was using that phrase to insulate myself against her pain, how I was using that phrase to insulate myself against her hurt, her frustration, her questions, and the way she pointed her finger at me. And I just kind of pushed it all away by sounding very spiritual. It sounded real spiritual, he said. Dave, it sounded real spiritual and I got away with it for a long time. But now I realize that I really used it as a way to abandon all of you kids on God's doorstep. And David, if you're going into the ministry, I want to make sure that you pick your kids up off God's doorstep and bring them into your heart, even when they do things you don't approve of. Accepting, receiving them, even when the behavior isn't okay. Very few of us know how to do that. But when that happens, there's something about God that gets released. Because, see, that's the relationship we have with Jesus. There's something godly about that. I just came back after the first of the year from a Larry Crabb conference. I told the story of a pastor friend of his who had a son who was in deep sin. The pastor lived in California. His son was 21 years old. got involved in drug trafficking, real serious kinds of sexual immorality, group kinds of activity. Had been going on for a long time, hadn't heard from his son in a long period of time, six, eight months. Lived in the same city. One night in the middle of the night, this pastor got a phone call from the police department saying that his son had been arrested and he was at the police department and would you come down and, I don't know, you pick him up or something. Put on his clothes, got in the car, drove to the police department. When he got there, there was absolutely no record of any phone call, and his son wasn't there. To this day, nobody has any idea where that phone call came from. Got back out in his car, puzzled, confused, didn't know what to do. It was the middle of the night, streets were empty, and he thought that what he would do, just kind of on an impulse, was drive by where he knew his son lived. Old rickety house, all sorts of drug pushers in there, didn't even know what to expect. Sat outside the house, just looked at it, knew his son was in there, decided to go in. As his eyes adjusted to the dark, he saw the drug paraphernalia all over the room, bodies kind of strewn here and there in various states of undress. People either sleeping deeply or in some sort of a drug-induced stupor, and on the couch he saw his son. He quietly walked over to his son, And he knelt down and he kissed his son on his cheek. His son didn't budge. He looked at him for a moment, got up and walked out. Just wept all the way home. It was four months later that he got a phone call from his son. His son said, basically, Dad, my life has changed. It's turned around. It happened a while ago. But I wanted to make sure that this was a legitimate change in me before I told you. But I'm clean and I'm different. And he said, what? What happened? how did this happen? And he said, well, Dad, that night four months ago, when you came in that house and kissed me on the cheek, I wasn't asleep. Why am I telling you that for? What I feel like that feels like to me is I love my kid. I hate what they're doing. I love my kid. And he walked into that stupid room and kissed him on his cheek. I mean, that's a real melodramatic story. It's a true story. I don't even want to tell you that to make you think it always turns out that wonderful. But that's part, a little piece of what it means to receive and love and actively love no matter what, even though the behavior is real inappropriate. I'm going to invade your life. Who can do that? I don't know how that can happen unless Jesus does it in us. My only hope is you. That's how that gets released. It needs to get released. It needs to get released in our families. Some of us are driving our kids right out the door. I'm not saying that his rebellion was because his father even drove him out. You could be a perfect parent. You could love absolutely appropriately and your kids could still go and go through pain. But that kind of spirit that Elihu brought, an atmosphere that accepted Job. I love you, Job. And I've heard every stupid thing you've said, and I ain't going away. But we're going to go at it here. But I ain't going away. I think you know the difference. I think you can tell the difference even in your family. I've had conversations with my kids. Conversations. I've had debates. Where in the course of the conversation, I can tell it switched. From me being the dad. big and bigger and bigger and bigger, and it's getting nowhere, because my 12-year-old is moving into this adolescent place where she's as big as me. And all of a sudden, something will switch. We had a thing just a week ago. I don't want to go into all this stuff, but just a week ago where I was doing my big dad thing, and I'm just going to, you! You don't talk to me like that! And all of a sudden, it just switched, and I thought, get, come and do something here, because she's really driving me crazy. and then we began to talk but it changed, it was a weird thing I don't even know how to say this quite right but it changed and I looked at her and I said, okay it was Drea I love her but she's just like me that's the problem she's real big and real emotional and real volatile it's great but I said at one point Drea you need to understand that the world doesn't revolve around you and she looked me right in the eye and says you need to understand it doesn't revolve around you either don't you talk to me like that and what has something switched and i and i looked at her and i says okay okay let's talk about that and i and i consciously words came out of my mouth i said drea i want to fight with you okay i'm gonna have the ground rules here i'm gonna you tell me and i'm gonna listen to what you say i'm gonna listen to your complaint but then i'm gonna come but let's go at And she gave me her thing, and I did. I listened, and I gave it back. And then she gave me one, and I gave her back. And as it came, she started to cry, and then she started to laugh. And I did too. And then I grabbed her by the neck. And it all had diffused. We had our little moment. And I grabbed her by the neck, and I got down to bed with her. And I said, this was a fun fight. This was a good fight. Because you came, and I listened, and this was a good fight. And I says, but you need to know something, Drea. I said, I didn't know something. no matter what happens, I am never going away, you little monkey. I'm going to be in your face your whole life. But I love you. I'm never going away. I won't always do it right, but I ain't going away. Head on a headlock. You're going to do it wrong. Every once in a while you'll do it right. But what is right is not the words you use or the right. It's more the atmosphere. Identifying with, listening to, an atmosphere of loving and accepting them even when the behavior is not appropriate. And all that, if it's real, gets communicated. And if it's not, that gets communicated to us. Father, I thank you for, again, this book that is so incredibly practical and real and where we live a lot. I thank you for people like Elihu who don't always say it right and, as we'll even learn next week, come on a little strong sometimes. But because the spirit of the man is what ministers and it's the inside reality of the heart and the love we have for people that is what transcends whether we say the right thing or not. I thank you that if our hearts genuinely are by your spirit loving people, then ministry can happen. We don't even need to know all the ways to do it, that you can by your spirit draw people back. And I pray you release that among us in little small ways and big ways in our families, in our body, in our kinship groups, in our interactions with people in the hall. Just energize us for these kinds of things. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
