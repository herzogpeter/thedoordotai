It was a big day. Days like this sneak up on me. I'm not really, you know... Last night, I went to the Crystal Building for the last time. Well, that's where it started for me, that Crystal Building. We walked in the door, my wife and I, and walked in the auditorium, and the Cambodians getting ready for their service this morning. I didn't know they were going to do this, but they set up the pews. And it took my breath away, because it was like, that's how it looked 22 years ago. Bonnie and I were ambushed with some memories and feelings of the things that God had done among us. We got there a little early. She had gone down into some different rooms and remembered the room where we had a congregational meeting the day that we candidated and asking questions. I mean, it came back to her. And when she gave me that memory, I had a memory of the first sermon I ever preached to her. I mean, how do you do that? I don't think about that. It just came back to me. There's a candidate, I remember the text was 1 Thessalonians something. It's in the Bible. My sons asked me, what are you going to talk about today? God. But I remember one line. I remember one line from that sermon for some reason. And it was somewhere along the line, when God takes the temperature of a church, he puts the thermometer on the inside. He wants to know about your heart. That's the first thing I ever said here. And we've been fighting for people's hearts ever since. And I think we're ready to go. Let's pray. Father, as we enter into this wonderful day, particularly of consecration, which marks an end to some, the culmination of something, and now an entering into a new thing. I just pray, Father, that we would just be aware of the dance that you dance over us, the song you sing over us, And maybe we are aware of the dance we have with you. And that we would be in it with you. In Jesus' name. Amen. To consecrate means at its most basic level to set apart. To take that which I have acted as if it belongs to me and set it apart to consecrate it as belonging to God. I think the best definition of consecration, however, is this. to take that which has been formerly used by me in common or maybe even profane ways for common or profane purposes and offer them to God to now be used in the service of that which is healthy and holy and altogether good to now be used in the service of God and His kingdom and then begin to wonder what will happen to those things that I have finally given to Him in terms of their benefit and their goods. If you've been with us these last few months, you undoubtedly remember how poignant it was when in this room. For many, it was life-changing when in this room, in the context of our dealing with the issues of money, sex, and power, we corporately consecrated as belonging unto God, first of all, our sexuality. And then we consecrated as belonging unto God our money, our finances. Today in service of consecration, on the eve of probably the most significant physical move in our church's history, we corporately come to God to consecrate to Him our use of power, both personally and corporately as a church. Now, having spent several months examining the issues involved with disordered and rightly ordered power and acknowledging that there are many things that God has spoken to us about this issue, meaning there are many directions we could go today in terms of kind of recreating some of the teaching that we had around power and disordered power. There is one symbol that we believe embodies what rightly ordered power in the kingdom of God really is. That symbol is the basin and the towel. So the basin and the towel, beloved, this morning will serve as the focal point of our consecration. To become a people of the basin and the towel, I believe, is God's call on our life relative to where it is we're going. It's drawn from John 13. It was just before the Passover feast that Jesus knew his time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. knowing that Judas would betray him knowing that Peter would deny him knowing that all of his disciples would leave him and flee at the moment of crisis he got up from the meal wrapped a towel around his waist poured water into a basin and washed the disciples feet as if to say without words this time something that he had used words to say many times before you guys you need to understand that I came not to be served but to serve and to give my life a ransom for many. For the path to power, if you're really interested in power, and I have a lot of power for you and for my church, beyond what you can even imagine, but the path to power will not come in your grasping for it. Who's the greatest? The path to power will not come that way. Please pay attention as I wash your feet, for the path to power in the kingdom of God is the way of the servant embodied in the basin and the towel. but there are actually two symbols of note this morning that we are acknowledging entering into and even embracing the first symbol is one that we enter into on a monthly basis so we're kind of used to it and the meaning of it is not lost on us at all the first symbol of the morning is that of the table the bread and the wine and this table speaks to us and monthly as we come to it we hear it say things to us It's often, in different ways, the same thing. If you listen very carefully this morning as you take the bread and take the wine in just a few moments, you can hear very clearly these words, among many other words, I came not to be served but to serve. To give my life a ransom for money, because that is indeed what, exactly what, the bread says, and that is exactly what the wine says when you take it. It says this, I came not to be served but to serve. but if you keep listening even past that you might just be able to hear the music that comes from this table the music that we spoke of last weekend that comes from the dance floor of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit it is the dance that began before creation was born as the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit dance the dance of mutual servanthood submission love and delight and from that dance creation was born we talked about that last week God wasn't bored when he created the world he wasn't lonely when he created the world the creation of life came out of this incredible dance between the father and the son and the holy spirit and breathed into man and woman the breath of life and then said to them come dance with me and they did. Adam and Eve walked with God in the cool of the day enjoying this mutual submission, servanthood, love and delight but the dance didn't last long. But by Genesis chapter 3 we had left the dance. For jealousy and pride and envy and anger and even hatred and murder we had left the dance. Then, knowing full well what it would cost to invite us back into the dance, to include us in this incredible dance that the Trinity continually enjoys, God the Father said, I'll tell you what I'll do. In order to invite my people back to myself and enter into this dance, I will give everything I have. Why'd he do that? Here's why. For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. And God the Son said this, You will give and I will go. I will take the form of a slave, become obedient unto death, even death on the cross. And God the Holy Spirit then said, You will give and you will go and I will pour. For I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh. So if you listen very carefully this morning, beloved, you might just be able to hear the song of redeeming love as in the bread and in the wine. You hear the song of the Father and the song of the Son and the song of the Holy Spirit singing this over and over again. I will give and I will go and I will pour out everything I have to bring you back into the dance of life with me. But hear also this as you listen to the music that comes from the table, from the dance floor of God, an invitation. it's kind of near the end of the song this invitation because he wants to overwhelm you with his amazing grace first because you can't go anywhere unless you enter into the dance that way recognizing what he has done for you but near the end of the song there comes an invitation and the invitation is this don't just worship me I love that don't even just remember me I really want you to join me come dance with me says the groom to the bride come dance the dance of mutual submission servanthood love and delight with me first of all he says but experience that come into the dance of experiencing mutual submission servanthood love and delight with your brothers and sisters in the faith as well the body of christ come into the dance that i set into motion this dance of giving and going and pouring it out. And as he invites us into that dance, he hands us a towel. And that's the second symbol of the morning. And it is in this morning the symbol of our consecration. It is the symbol of a servant. It is the symbol of someone who says, I will give as I have been given to. And I will go. And I will pour it out. It is the symbol of rightly ordered power. We believe. For this is what we do with our power. We use our power to serve and to build. And to heal and to create. Two symbols this morning. The table. Which speaks to what we have received. The towel. Which we're going to get in addition to the table. Which speaks to what we now give. and how we now live. One concern. That the symbol, especially the symbol of the towel, because that's kind of a new one, could be reduced in our thinking and in perception to mere sentimentality. As if to respond to it by saying, oh, isn't that sweet? They gave us a towel. A visual aid. I mean, you might even react the same way to the story of Jesus washing the disciples' feet. You see him putting on the towel and pouring the basin, and he's about to die, and he washes their feet. Isn't that sweet? What a guy. Well, I think it is sweet. I think that's in there. And it is the kind of thing that could bring a tear to our eye. But if you just leave it at sweet sentimentality, you become oblivious to the cost of this. So let's just pause. before we even enter into this and let this in. When God the Father and God the Son and God the Holy Spirit said, I will go and I will give and I will pour it out, it cost them everything they had. Beloved, to tape the towel is not to engage in a sentimental symbol alone. It is not to engage in some quaint religious stuff this morning. Maybe quaint religious stuff that you're used to doing in church. That's not what this is. It is to say, I want to enter into and live this kind of life. I want to live the kind of life that the one who dances over me lived. It is to say, I want to give. I want to go. And I want to pour it out. having received that at the table I want to do it with the towel to take the towel this morning is to say Lord teach me how to dance the way you dance to take the towel this morning is to say Lord teach me how to live the way you live knowing that giving the way you give dancing the way you dance living the way you live could cost me everything I am and everything I have, but everything I am and everything I have in your hands is the safest place on earth. It is the most glorious dance you have ever danced. And by the way, you're going to dance this dance forever and ever and ever and ever. So let's learn how to dance now. When we landed on this symbol as being what embodied our consecration and spoke to in visual powerful ways what rightly ordered power looks like, this towel, I'm putting my hands like this because we're going to put your hands this way and wrap a towel around it and send you out. Scott reflected on this whole thing this way by saying, you know, this towel that we're going to wrap around people's hands at this service weighs three, four ounces, it's very light. but the truth is if you feel the weight of this of entering into the life of Christ by saying like you gave I want to give like you went I want to go or like you poured it out I want to pour it out if you really feel the weight of that it will drive you to your knees but the beauty of the kingdom life is the weight of this is the weight you can't carry by yourself and the spirit of God comes and says you are not alone in this I will carry this with you and in ways you can't even imagine I will use your submission to this towel to the furthering of my kingdom purposes through you in ways that will stun you. And so beloved we consecrate ourselves this morning in the arena of power by the taking of a towel. It's very, you need to notice that we're talking about power and we're sending you out without a half time pep talk we're giving you a towel for the path to power in the kingdom of God is the way of the servants let me explain how we're going to do this service of consecration like the last two times we had a service like this the first thing we did and are going to do now is pray so those who are going to pray I want you to come up onto the platform at this time the prayer of consecration has four parts the first is confession we're going to confess the ways we have used power in disordered ways to hurt people and use people, manipulate and take things from people because we were bigger and stronger and used our power that way. The second prayer is a prayer of intervention. This involves our out loud desire to intervene on or to break away from that which we just confessed. The third prayer is the prayer of consecration. This will be a prayer stating our desire not only to leave old ways, but to enter new and living ways of rightly ordered power. It's important to get the flow here because this is a proactive. I'm leaving this, but I'm embracing a new thing. Fourth prayer is a prayer of affirmation, or what we could call a prayer of blessing. And this is asking God by his spirit to now bless our desire to leave the old and live in the new to join the dance. each prayer has been carefully prepared can be found in your bulletin with opportunities to respond at the end of each prayer indicated with this cue and together we say and then respond as indicated in your bulletin when we are done with our prayers we will then enter into the symbol of the table and the tile let's pray the biblical concept of confession has as its meaning to agree with God and so what we're going to do is begin by agreeing with God about our sin and just a word that we are doing this collectively as a group of people it in no way takes the place of individual work that you have to do around some of these areas the fruit of repentance of which may look like asking individuals for forgiveness and making amends and that's just the personal work we need to do but we're going to do this together would you join with me as we pray we declare that you Jesus are Lord and by your life you have set the example for us in word and deed. Your dependence upon the Father and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit offers us the model and the hope to live as true disciples. As an obedient response to your Spirit's prompting, we desire to consecrate ourselves to you today, specifically the power that you have given us to possess. We confess that we have misused the power you have entrusted to us. we confess that we have allowed ourselves to be influenced by the world's definition of power more than by the way you taught and modeled it through your life we confess that we have used power in self-centered ways and at times have even attributed this misuse to you we confess that we have within us an unwillingness to accept that your power is perfected in our weakness, and we resist relinquishing power when it is appropriate. We are guilty of using power for selfish purposes by controlling situations, manipulating and abusing others and ourselves with our attitudes, words, and actions. We are guilty of failing to use power rightly by relying upon our own resources rather than depending on your provision, by failing to honor our commitments, by avoiding needed confrontations, by withdrawing from service to others, and by choosing not to repent from our known sins. We confess that our unloving use of power has caused serious harm to others and to ourselves. We have often been an ungodly example for people around us and have established or contributed to strongholds of the evil one that exist within our own and our loved ones' lives. We confess that we have failed to set a godly example for our children and our children's children as we seek to pass on a legacy of righteous living. Together we say, All this we do confess. Lord, forgive us. Prayer of intervention, which focuses on repentance. And again, we're doing this corporately, but individually, if you would like to respond in a way physically by kneeling, you can feel free to do that at this point. Father, thank you for sending your son to die for our sins. Thank you for the cleansing power of his blood, which is promised when we confess our sins. It is our desire to repent from all the ways we have misused power. And so now we declare that it is our heart's desire to reject and leave our sinful use of power. Holy Spirit, come and empower us to leave our disordered view of power, which influences our attitudes, motives, and desires about grasping power and using it to serve ourselves. Holy Spirit, empower us to lead the ways we have used the power of our words to tear down, crush, and even curse others. Holy Spirit, empower us to leave the ways we have used power to manipulate and abuse others. Holy Spirit, empower us to leave the ways we have used power to get big and avoid confrontation and win through intimidation. Holy Spirit, come. Empower us to leave our use of power to strike back and even use it to get even. Holy Spirit empower us to leave our passivity and fear and embrace our responsibility to use our power for the good of others and now Holy Spirit empower us to leave the unholy destructive love of power that has no place in your kingdom of love together we say all this we do leave Lord empower us prayer of consecration I don't remember when it was but I think it probably was almost two years ago that we began this journey I can't remember anymore and I stood up here for prayer and I asked you to take off your shoes if that seems appropriate at this moment I invite you to do that as we enter this prayer Holy God, by the power of your spirit, we now choose to set apart our use of power to you. On the night in which you were betrayed, submitting yourselves to a lowly servant's job, You washed each of the disciples' feet. Like you, we now take up the towel. We take up the towel in our thoughts. We choose to recognize ourselves as your beloved son or daughter, chosen and called. We set apart our limitations as well as our giftings to you. Empower us to live with humility the life you have given us. May we always remember who we are in you. We take up the towel in our words. May they build up and not tear down. May our words reflect your gentleness and compassion, as well as strength and steadfastness. We take up the towel in our actions. May they be used to demonstrate your love and establish your kingdom. We set apart our obedience to your Spirit's call to demonstrate the truth of who you are through loving one another. May we be made worthy of the power and authority you have entrusted to us. We take up the towel in our hearts. May they reflect your character. We set apart our desires and needs to your greater plan and purpose for our lives. We set apart our lives for each other as you laid down your life for us. We set apart our pain and suffering to you so that you may bring us to deeper places of relationship with you. We take up the towel in our relationships. May the way we live together reflect you to others. we choose to submit to each other lifting one another up giving one another honor and respect we set apart our loving for your glory and kingdom we take up the towel in all our use of power like Jesus we seek to be about the father's business doing what we see the father doing together we say all this we do desire Lord strengthen us now the prayer of blessing and now dear father having heard our confession and strong desire to leave cursed patterns of power that seek to win and crush and manipulate and control. We ask your blessing on the rightly ordered use of our power to serve. As we partner with you in the living of our lives, we recognize that power can be used for good or for evil. May the manifestations of power among us be embodied in the symbol of the basin and the towel. May the strength that you do give be used in your service to heal and to help and to build and to create and to serve and to protect and to bless and to reveal the grace and truth of your glorious gospel. Bless in Jesus' name every cup of cold water, every helping hand, every kind gesture, every gentle word, every dollar spent, every prayer prayed in such a way that their effect to the good would exceed our greatest expectations and wildest dreams. May the power be indeed supernatural power, the kind that has the capacity to help lame people walk, blind people see, deaf people hear, And dead people come alive again. In the context of consecrated rightly ordered power. We pray this blessing would be marked by a baptism of power. By your Holy Spirit. To the eternal benefit of thousands in this city. And to the glory of God. Bless also future generations. Who in ways they may not see or understand today. will be the beneficiaries of this, our consecration. So together we say, all this do we request. Lord, bless us. I'm going to ask the communion stewards to meet me in front of the table. I have a word of instruction, and then we will go to our symbols. Thank you.
