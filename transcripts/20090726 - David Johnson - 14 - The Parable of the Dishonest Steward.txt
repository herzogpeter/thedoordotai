Open your Bibles if you have them. to Luke's Gospel, the 16th chapter, as we come today to what may be the strangest parable that Jesus ever uttered. At least on the face of things, it looks that way. Indeed, it's a parable that some scholars, this is true, believe to be a mistake. Some contend that Jesus never really said the things that are recorded that he said in Luke 16. Rudolf Bultmann, regarded by many to be the master commentator of the 20th century, declared this parable to be insoluble, to be incomprehensible. In the 4th century, Julian the Apostate used this parable as proof that Christianity was an inferior religion, because on the surface of the parable, it appears to be the story about a steward who cheats his master and then is commended by Jesus for doing so, for being a liar and a cheat. Good for you is what the parable sounds like on the surface. Indeed, this last Wednesday at Message Team, as we collectively scratched our heads in confusion, actually, as we read this thing and began to wonder what on earth it could mean, in the middle of that we found some relief in Al Shuck's suggestion, and Al Shuck's humor also, that maybe the explanation for this parable is that Jesus just had a bad day. And we should give him some slack, because we all have bad days. from time to time, and maybe that should even be the point of the sermon this week. All of us have bad days. Even Jesus had bad days. Open your Bibles to Luke 16, exhibit 8. A suggestion that I kind of dismissed out of hand, because as we all know, the very suggestion that Jesus got it wrong is heresy, so I'm here to make sure everything's on the up and up, because I think it was Luke who got it wrong. Anyway, and round and round we went, as we got goofier and goofier by the minutes. But here's the deal. Because while on the surface of things, there are elements to this parable that I haven't even read you yet, that to some seem confusing and even to others disturbing. I believe that this parable's meaning is actually quite clear and brings with it a challenge that people who live in the context of the kingdom of God need to see and understand as it relates specifically to how we spend the resources of our lives. And when I talk about resources, I'm going to clarify this all the way through the talk, but it does include money, and the parable is kind of about money, but when you think of resources, go beyond that to think of the capacities God has given you relative to anything. Resources, money, but capacities to do things, and to put them into play, not in just responsible ways, which is what you would expect to hear when you hear about the managing of our resources, but to put them into play in shrewd, creative, and resourceful ways, with a kind of whatever-it-takes spirit related to how we use the resources of our lives to further the purposes of the kingdom and to build what Jesus calls in Matthew 6, treasures in heaven. Here's how Jesus tells the parable. Beginning in verse 1, Luke 16, he's speaking to his disciples, which is significant. I'll kind of explain to you why a little bit later. He begins to talk about a certain rich man. Verse 1, who had a steward. And a steward was reported to him to have squandered his possessions, that is, the rich man's possessions, that were squandered by the steward who had responsibility over the rich man's possessions because in Jesus' day it wasn't unusual for a wealthy landowner to hire someone that he trusted to give them charge of all their holdings and their land, their vineyard, and their money. So he, that is, the certain rich man, calls the steward in verse 2 and says to him, What is this I hear about you? Give an account for yourself, for you can no longer be my steward. In other words, you're fired. So the steward, knowing he's busted, verse 3, says to himself, what shall I do? Since I just lost my job, my master is taking the stewardship away from me. And here's my problem. I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm too ashamed to beg. But then this thought occurs to him, verse 4. I know what I shall do. Light bulb goes on. A scheme is formed, designed to get him out of trouble. Now stop right there. Before we move on, I want to make a note of something. And it'll help you kind of unpack and even know why this parable to some is so confusing. It's this, that Jesus told a lot of parables. Parables that involved a debt of some kind. So he told a lot of parables like this. often revealing some kingdom principle related to repentance, forgiveness, grace, mercy. Matthew 18, for instance, is one that comes to mind. There was a slave who owned a debt to a certain king, much like this steward who had squandered the stuff that he had, and it was an insurmountable debt. That was the whole point of the parable and the debt. He had a debt he couldn't pay, and the point of the parable is this, that if you forget you had a debt you couldn't pay and were forgiven because this guy was forgiven of his debt in Matthew 18. If you forget you had a debt you couldn't pay and were forgiven, you end up not being forgiving or showing mercy to others, which is what happened in the parable. You might remember this, that he was forgiven this enormous debt, and then somebody came to him only owing a little bit, and he strangled him and threw him in prison. And the whole point of the parable was that we not only need to receive forgiveness and receive mercy, we need to become the kind of people who are giving mercy and giving forgiveness. And one of the ways you do that is by remembering you had a debt you couldn't pay. Point is, lots of parables about people who had debts. And the point of them were about mercy and grace, forgiveness. Luke 15, parable of the prodigal that we just did. When the son who had squandered the inheritance of the father came to his senses, he said, just like the steward in the parable we're dealing with today, I know what I shall do. In other words, he came up with a plan. I will arise and go to my father's house. This is his plan. And I will say to my father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. So his plan to deal with the debt he had incurred because he had squandered his father's inheritance was to repent. Because the parable was ultimately about repentance and forgiveness and mercy and grace. And that is precisely what we expect from a parable. some principle of the kingdom related to repentance, forgiveness, grace, mercy, some virtue like that. All of that in mind. Now come back to the parable. Let's look at this steward's plan to get out of trouble, to repay the debt. Verse 4, again, I know what I shall do, so that when I am removed from my stewardship, I lose my job, there will be people who will receive me into their homes. They'll take care of me. Let me explain that real quickly. Because what he's doing is he's coming up with a plan such that when he's thrown out into the street because he lost his job, he will have built some goodwill on the part of a few in the community toward him so that those people will take care of him because he took care of them. That gets explained in verse 5. Let's look. Verse 5. And he summoned each one of his master's debtors. And he began saying to the first, How much do you owe my master? And he said, A hundred measures of oil. which, by the way, is an enormous amount of debt. You couldn't pay the debt. 100 measures is about 900 gallons worth, about 1,000 denarii. And last week we found out that a denarii for a day worker was about a day's wage. So this is an enormous debt. And this steward says to this guy, back to verse 6, take your bill, sit down quickly, write 50. So he cut the debt in half. Wow, very exciting if you're the person who owes the debt. Then verse 7, he says to another, how much do you owe? And he said, a hundred measures of wheat. And he said to him, take your bill and write 80. So he knocks off a fifth. Stop right there. What do you think of his plan? Of his response to his debt that he couldn't pay. Because here's the first thing you notice. If you're used to other parables, it doesn't look like repentance. Repentance isn't his plan. He's not seeking nor expecting forgiveness either, nor does it look like he's trying to pay it back in any way because he's collecting only a portion of what was owed. So that's obviously not his plan. Indeed, none of what he's doing here has anything to do with what you'd expect from a kingdom principle parable because it has nothing to do with repentance, forgiveness, mercy, or grace. Indeed, what he's doing here is cutting a deal that in the end will leave these guys grateful because they got half off or a fifth off. So when he's in need, they might want to help him because he made friends with them. That's the language of the text. And hopefully they'll welcome him into their home when he has no home. Something else is going on here that I just didn't see right away, but it just kind of makes you go, wow, this steward really had kind of a good plan because the debtors, as the steward is coming to them and going, how much do you owe? Make it half, make it a fifth. All of them, they don't know yet that the steward is out of a job. So they're assuming that the steward is coming to them by the authority of the landowner. So they maybe have some good feelings about the steward, but they have some really good feelings about the landowner as well. So lots of goodwill is being generated toward him as it's being spread through the community. How generous. He just comes to us out of the blue. And the landowner, the steward did it, but the landowner is the guy who authorized this half off, a fifth off. This is wonderful. So now if you do the math here and just kind of figure out the picture, the landowner's kind of stuck. Because now if he's going to go back and rescind, no, no, no, you've got to pay the whole thing. Even if that's lawful, even if that's right, he can't do that and look good. He can't do it and look good. You're going to look like the bad guy and all the PR, the good PR that you got will be lost, which is brilliant. this steward is brilliant it's creative it's resourceful indeed indeed i think if you're watching it you'd be well he's lying what a conniver is no why doesn't he repent but there's something in you if you really catch a picture you kind of got to hand it to the guy and and you can almost see the grin on the landowner's face as he mutters under his breath you little so-and-so you know you you really did it uh you weaseled out of this thing and there's a level of which i gotta admire this. By the way, you're still fired, but good job here. So what was the steward's plan? What was the steward's plan? To seek forgiveness? No. To come repentant? To try and repay? No. No, his plan was, and here's the, he always had the same plan. I mean, it would come out a different way, but his plan was always the same, because his plan was to do what he always did, and that was to scheme, connive, and deceive. And so he used the same scheming, conniving, and deceiving that he, that got him into trouble. He used the same stuff to try to get him out of trouble. And just when you're expecting Jesus in the parable to drop the hammer on such despicable behavior, Jesus in verse 8 then says that the master, the landlord, praised the unrighteous steward because he acted shrewdly, creatively, resourcefully, indeed. And this is my paraphrase of this verse. I kind of hear Jesus saying, what kind of bothers me, you guys, is that actually the sons of this age are more shrewd in relation to their own kind than are the sons of life. Verse 9, for I say to you, this is my application of the parable, as Jesus is saying, make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness that when it fails, and it surely will, they may receive you into eternal dwellings. And it was right about there in that verse, at message team on Wednesday morning, that we all started scratching our heads in confusion, going, what in the world? I mean, that's even some weird language. Make friends for yourselves by means of mammon of unrighteousness. When it fails you, whatever, it's weird talk here. So let me give it a shot as to what this means, because what I think it means is simply this. Again, my paraphrase of this, that I want you, my disciples, to learn how to shrewdly use all the resources of your life to win for yourselves friends, like the steward did by cleverly cutting deals. But these friends, or these people that you're winning, will be showing up in heaven. They will be welcoming you in eternal places because you've stored up treasure in heaven. Treasure in heaven, that's not very familiar. Matthew 6, we dealt with that in the Sermon on the Mount. Don't store up for yourselves treasures on earth. Moth and rust destroys. Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven. This is the same kind of principle. Come at it in an entirely different way. Let me say it this way. Again, kind of my paraphrase. I'm trying to get my arms around what he's saying here. To his disciples, if you want to practically and actually lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, if you're really serious about wanting to make friends who might actually welcome you one day in eternal dwelling places, then you're going to need to think about how you use the resources of your life a lot more creatively, a lot more shrewdly and resourcefully than you do. Because right now, a lot of you are squandering those resources. And it's not because you're bad, but often it's squandered simply because you haven't thought about it shrewdly. You haven't thought about how you spend the resources of your life, not just your money, but your capacities in a variety of ways. You haven't thought about how to put them into play for purposes of the kingdom creatively, resourcefully. Another picture came to mind that helped me kind of get my arms around this parable because the obvious thing is, again, the trouble that people have is that Jesus is commending this bad behavior, which he's not doing. But here's the picture I got. And it comes in the context of being a teacher. I know we have a lot of teachers in our congregation, and I think you're going to get this one. If you are a teacher, you have undoubtedly had, and maybe you have one of these every year, I don't know, who is like this steward? And what I mean by that is that he or she is always into trouble, always into mischief, always conniving and cheating. In fact, this kid, he ate one a year maybe, but if there is a way to cheat, they found it. always working angles, they're always up to something such that you don't trust him or her at all. And if you could, you would do what the master in this parable did to the steward. You would fire him. You would get them out of your class. But every once in a while, at the end of the day, after you caught this girl or boy again, for the 15th time, in the middle of one of their latest schemes, You're just kind of halfway exhausted. Think to yourself, wow. You know, if this kid would use just a little bit of his ingenuity and creativity and boundless energy for something good, he could change the world. You know what I'm talking about. That's the steward. That's the point. Now, teachers, you have another kid in your class as well. Maybe one of these a year. who's entirely different. No trouble at all. This little boy, this little girl, never breaks the rules. Assignments always on time. They always draw inside the lines. But they're boring. They're just so boring, provincial. They do the math. One plus, one plus, one is two. You're right. You're so boring. I mean, they would never survive the streets. This kid who's making all the trouble is probably going to be the president of IBM someday or something. Or in jail. And every once in a while, you just kind of think to yourself, Wow, what if we could combine these two things? Where again, all that creativity and ingenuity and capacity to think outside the box, to lead was being used not to destroy, not to disrupt, not to steal, but to build and to restore and to heal and to serve. Well, I don't know if that picture helps you get a handle on what Jesus is using this parable of the steward for, or what it's like, but it helped me. to kind of see it and get it, because he's speaking here to his disciples in verse 1, not to the Pharisees. In the context of his mentoring them, it's kind of an inside conversation, his discipling them and saying, among other things, this. You guys, if you're really serious about wanting to partner with God in this kingdom of God on earth thing, then you're going to have to go way past nice. You're going to have to go way past appropriate and responsible because I am calling you to shrewdness and creativity and to the kind of street smarts that the sons of men have, particularly as it relates to their resources. I want us to have that kind of shrewdness as it relates to our resources, putting them into play, to win friends who might just greet us one day in heavenly dwelling. Eugene Peterson and the message, his translation of the Bible, takes Luke 16, 8 and translates it this way, that streetwise people are smarter in this regard than law-abiding citizens because they're on constant alert. They're looking for angles, surviving by their wits. Fact is, I want you to be smart in the same way, but for what is right, using every adversity to stimulate you to creative survival so you'll live, so you'll really live, and not complacently just get by on good behavior. Something wrong with good behavior? No, but it's boring. You get the point. And all of that, however, raises a question, and it's a question that got raised from me after I kind of figured out the parable, and the question is this. Where does all that shrewdness, that creativity, that ingenuity come from? How is it generated? Because I'm guessing that not all of us feel like we have that stuff. I mean, you might even be hearing this and going, yeah, I get it, and it's cool, and be resourceful, and stuff like that. But none of that comes natural to me. I don't feel very creative, and I'm certainly not shrewd. So let me try to help you with that. Because I think that this is shrewdness, that Jesus is calling for here, is much more accessible to all of us than we might think. So in light of that, just consider with me a few things that I think can help generate this creative, energetic, whatever it takes, spirit as it relates to how we put into play all of the resources, the capacities of our lives. The first is this. To realize and believe that who we are and the resources that we have really do belong to God. They came from God. We are the manager of what he gave us, and they belong to him. Now, here's my point. If we really did believe that, that every resource we have belongs to God, I think we'd be, quite frankly, a lot more shrewd about how we use them, even maybe a little fearful. Though fear is generally not a good motivator, but a little splash of it right here isn't going to kill you because it would be coming from an awareness that this stuff, isn't mine to use entirely on me. And I'm going to have to explain one day, if I believe in God, how I used it. You've heard the phrase, necessity is the mother of invention. In other words, you come up with stuff when you have to. I think that's how this works right here. See, the first thing I noticed about the steward in the story was that when he got busted for squandering his master's possessions, he knew all the way down to the ground something that I don't think we completely believe, and it's this. He knew without being told that what he'd squandered wasn't his. And that's why he was in so much trouble. And when he realized that, he got really creative really quick. Why? Because he had to. See, if what he'd squandered belonged to him, it was all his stuff, he would feel regret maybe what a waste and he didn't maybe lose a couple nights sleep i just wasted all this stuff and wonder how am i gonna get blah blah blah but it would be regret but most of his energy here his creativity's ingenuity was generated by the fact that what he wasted wasn't his and he knew it so i got to figure this thing out he thought and nobody gave him a map nobody told him well you do these three things he just did it and here's the deal so can you i think it would stun us how creative we would get with the resources of our life if we really belong they if we really believe they belong to god see every talk i ever do on stewardship one of the points is our stuff belongs to god and we all go yes it's true it's so true yeah we don't believe that that one day all the gifts god gave you all what money too but the stuff the stuff. It's just not all for you. I gave you that. How do you put that into play to build and to serve and to love other people? One of the things I've been trying to emphasize here that these resources that I talk about putting into play, it's not just money, even though he's talking about money in this passage. And with that in mind, I think of Samson, the biblical character, Samson in the Old Testament. Samson, picture it this way, a man to whom God had given incredible resources. But the resources God gave to Samson, they weren't money. God gave Samson strength for the purpose of him strutting around looking like a tough guy. No, that's not why God gave Samson strength. God gave Samson strength to use his strength to lift and redeem and deliver the people of God. That's why that strength, I gave it to you, but it doesn't belong to you. Manage that well. But Samson squandered the strength. You know the story. I'm kind of banking on that because I don't have time to tell it. And he squandered it in part because he thought the resource, his strength belonged to him. So he spent his strength strutting his stuff. He spent his strength entirely on himself when he could have used his strength to serve and to deliver and to build and to restore, what a waste. But what's really scary is it wasn't his to squander. What'd you do with that, Samson? So think about it. What if, what if we really did believe that all the resources of our lives, all of our capacities really did belong to God and that one day we would explain how we put them into play, how we spent them, used them. I just think a lot of us would get really creative, really quick, if we really believed that. Again, just think, if we could marshal all the shrewdness that the sons of this age put into play around their physical resources for personal gain, just imagine all that ingenuity, creativity, energy being put into play for the purposes of the kingdom whereby we were making friends with people who one day may just greet us in eternal places. Shrewdness. To be shrewd. Yeah, as I think about that, I don't know if I've ever heard a sermon on being shrewd. Most of us, most of us good Christians would settle for being responsible, even obedient, particularly in a message about our resources. Be responsible. The Bible says you need to give, so obey. You know, every once in a while I'll have someone ask me, Dave, do you teach people to tithe at Open Door? And tithing means to give a tenth of your salary to the work of God. And my response is, yeah, yeah, I teach that. But just between you and me, you know what I'd rather talk about? so much rather talk about. It's this, that every resource and capacity you have belongs to God. And one day, we're going to explain how we use those resources. So open door. How about we blow right by responsible? And we blow right by even be obedient. How about we start getting real creative and shrewd and extravagant and crazy and begin to wonder together? And by the way, this is how you do. You really need some help to do this, to figure out how to be shrewd with these resources, to begin to wonder together and get some help from people. If I'm a business owner, or if you're a student, or a coach, or a stay-at-home mom, or a songwriter, or an airline pilot, or a CEO, or a pastor, or a therapist, or a checkout line clerk, or a salesperson, get together with some people and wonder together, how can I use whatever resources I have, be they large or small, to make friends with people who one day may greet me from a heavenly dwelling. And to figure all that out, how to, like a businessman, could put this into play for purposes of the kingdom. That would require creativity. But you'd have to actually start thinking about that. Some of you do this without thinking about it. Some of you do this better than you know. It just comes out of your pores. Which actually leads me to the second thing that I think can help generate this creative, energetic, whatever it takes spirit. It's this. And this is really good news, I think. It's this, that whatever it is that you have to creatively and shrewdly give is consistent with who you already are. Let me say that again. Whatever it is you have to give, creatively and shrewdly, for the purposes of the kingdom, to build and to serve, is consistent with who you already are. It's something that you already have. Which means you don't go looking out there at what anybody else is doing. This is in some ways harder than you knew, but simpler than you knew, because the things God has given you to give, for many of us, are kind of hidden in plain sight. We've gotten so used to who we are and what we have to give that we have a tendency to think, now that can't be it. You know, when I said it that way, the first thing I thought of was the story of David. We touched on David last week in the story of David and Goliath. And one of the features of that story, when David faced down Goliath, was that after David convinced Saul to face Goliath and that he could do it, Saul did something that was well-intended. And it was this, David, let me help you here. Wear my armor into the battle. Now, that wearing of Saul's armor is real symbolic of doing something that may be very difficult, but doing it the way someone else would maybe do it. Saul would do it that way. He would wear armor. and there's nothing wrong with Saul's armor. But here's the problem, and David knew it, and he was instinctive enough to kind of call the shots right. It wasn't David. Saul's armor didn't fit David. So what David did, you know the story, was to grab something that probably no one else would have even thought of. Five stones, remember that? How creative. He's a genius. he's not a genius everybody thought he was crazy when he was doing it you know why he grabbed five smooth stones because he was really good with stones he'd been throwing stones at bears and lions since he was a little kid the point is this the thing God gave him to give it was sitting right there and he threw those stones as hard as he could. He gave them all away for free. The obvious question is, what are your five smooth stones? Because what you have to give, this is what I like about this, it's what are you supposed to do? Well, you should go pick up five stones too. No, you shouldn't. That would be stupid. It's a metaphor, obviously. What are the things that are sitting in your hand. These glasses, I should actually just put them on. That's what my wife is saying right now. Just put them on, Dave. Quit playing with them. This is interesting to me because, isn't it funny? Because I think we think of these things last. Isn't it weird? But it's like this obvious thing. Like, what is your way? Quit reading books about other people's way. How they did it. What is your way? What have you loved doing? Love it since you were a kid. There's a little tip-off as to what the stones are. Those are the resources God's given you to give away. And then you start getting out, wow, I never even connected that. How could I use that to build maybe more than I do? Because I just kind of think it's nothing. It's because you're too familiar with yourself even in some ways. See, part of what makes the resource you have to give creative and shrewd and unexpected is that what you have to give won't be like anyone else's. And in some sense, it's obvious you already have it in your hands. It's you. It's what you love. It's what you have. Which leads to the third thing that I think can help generate this creative, energetic, whatever it takes spirit. It's simply this. To remember that the field of the kingdom of God into which we sow our seed, into which we invest the resources of our lives, is a very fertile field. Such that, according to Matthew 25, 26, you can reap where you did not sow, and you can gather where you scattered no seeds. I love that parable. It's one of those that just keeps getting bigger. You can reap, sorry, where you can reap where you didn't sow. Isn't that, what an incredible thing. You know, I don't know if this is weird, but I thought of Andrew coming here this weekend, and I thought of the fact that I go speak other places, and all over the place, outside of Open Door from time to time, and I'll go there and I'll give something, and there's some fruit, just like right away, but I always remember, Dave, you just reaped something that other people sowed. And Andrew comes here and he sings these songs, or so deep and he reaps some things that other people have been sowing. It's why the connection was so immediate. But at the same time, he sows some things and he won't see the fruit. And I go somewhere else and you sow some things where you don't see the fruit. But the cycle is consistent and there's this confidence that even if I sow and don't see the fruit, the fruit's coming, I don't have to see it because sometimes I reap and I didn't sow at all. And this is a very fertile field and all of that is something that would generate, I think if we would get it, I've got to keep giving what God gave me. I've got to keep giving it away. Why? Because it's a very fertile field. In fact, it's such a fertile field that even a cup of cold water, I can do that. You can do that. Kindness, given in Jesus' name, can ripple out into eternity. Even a cup of cold water can help you make friends. The kind of friends that might just greet you one day in eternal dwellings. So here's the word, open door. Let's go. And let's give and let's serve. And let's do it shrewdly, creatively, resourcefully, energetically. Why? Because it all belongs to God anyway, first of all. And because it's sitting right there in your hand. And because the field into which you throw it is a very fertile field. You can't lose in doing this. So he who has ears to hear, let him hear what the Spirit's saying. And he was eyes to see. Let him see what the Spirit's saying and calling us to do and to be. And all God's people said, amen. Amen. God bless you as you leave. You're dismissed. Thank you.
