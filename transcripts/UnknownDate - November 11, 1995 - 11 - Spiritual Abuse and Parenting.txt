My name again is Polly Niederlo. I am a wife and mother of three. I have three teenagers. There are 17, 15, and 13, two girls and a boy. I am a licensed psychologist. I have a private practice in St. Louis Park. And I have been a facilitator of Parents Anonymous. I don't know if you're familiar with that, but it's a group of parents who meet together who have abused their kids or are afraid that their anger is escalating to the point that they might. Many of them are court-ordered. I've been doing that for about five years. And I also do parent education workshops, seminars in churches, schools, and other groups or organizations. I've been a STEP trainer facilitator. STEP is called Systematic Training for Effective Parenting. I've been doing that for about nine years. Now, I tell you all that because you're supposed to hear all that and go, wow, she's going to really know what she's talking about. She's really credible. But what is going to make me credible is if I give you something today that you can go home with that will change your family system, maybe change the way you look at yourself or change the way you look at your family, and this makes doing parenting a little more enjoyable than you may feel like it is now. I don't know how you left your homes when you left, if you left feeling good about what you were doing or not so good about what you were doing. Here I am, I'm coming here today, and I'm going to do a workshop on encouragement, basically, right? So I leave my house. My two daughters are on the computer. I've changed clothes twice. I just thought I'd share that. And I'm like, I could use a word. I could just use a little word from someone like, go mom, or pick up, or something. I could do something. And I walked out of the house. I said, well, I'm leaving now. Nothing. So I went on into the garage, and I started my conversation. I said, well, bye, Mom. Have a great workshop. We hope things go out. Yeah, great. I hope you guys are doing well. Yeah, you're doing good, Mom. Hey, Mom, you're a really wonderful mom. And I just kind of talked to myself as I pulled out of the driveway trying to slack myself up because I don't always feel encouraged. And so, again, I hope today you will be feeling more encouraged. And maybe, like, this is a job you can do. And it might not have been fun. But maybe you felt like this. I don't know if you can see that. Parenting, are we having fun yet? Maybe not. Or maybe when you left, you felt a little like this. You wanted to just kind of pack it in, pack it up, and go. Just leave them because they're out of control. Or maybe you've been kind of feeling this way about your parenting. In the pits. Or you've been to a class like this before, a program like this before, and you went home and you tried some things, they didn't work, and so you feel like you're kind of back to square one. Or maybe you're not doing so bad. I mean, you're doing okay, but you're kind of like this guy, fit to be tied. Too fit to lose, but not fit enough to win. I mean, you're hanging on by your fingernails. That does happen. Or, this is my favorite, every once in a while the handles of responsibility feel slippery to Helen. Can you see that? I don't think Helen is feeling very confident. You can put this body in overalls and have it be a guy. So this isn't a sexist cartoon. It's just the only one I've got right now. So like I said upstairs, if you were up there, parenting is the most important job that we have. And it's the one that we're the least trained for. I don't think that instills a whole lot of confidence. I mean, God's been said that confidence is what you have before you understand the situation. And I think, yeah, yeah. And I actually, believe it or not, on tape, want to take, what do you do when you disagree with someone? With God's been to say that I really believe confidence is something you can have after you get some information and are armed and equipped to do the job that you have to do. So I think you can have confidence, and I think that taking, you know, a piece of what you're going to work with today, that should give you more confidence in what you're doing. Now, what I'm going to be talking about is a little tiny slice of a bigger pie. The program that this comes from, basically, is called Systematic Training for Effective Parenting. I don't know, has anybody gone through that, know anything about it? Okay, okay. But it's a multi-level course. They have for parents with children under 5, and then for parents with children like 5 to 12 or 13. I can't see. I know this poll. Or for parents with teenagers. And that can be anything from 12, 13 up to they're still in your home or if you're still dealing with them. They can even be out of the home, but you still have issues. This would work. It's an 8-week, 16-hour program. So I know we're going to attempt the impossible event and try to cram in one week's session into about 45 minutes. And I want to leave us time at the end so if you have questions, we can answer those. And if you have anything about how do I really apply this with the certain situation I'm thinking about. And it doesn't have to be yours. You can always start it with, I have a friend that has a kid too. And that will be okay, and I'll let you go with that. So it's a piece of a larger pie, or it's a ring on a key ring of many keys. I mean a key on a ring of many keys. and as parents we need more than one key. A past key is just not enough. And kids are made up of many doors, if you want to call it. And to have keys, as many keys that work with as many doors, is what I'm trying to help you get today. But this is only one. And the STEP program is something that's not the parenting program of the 80s or 90s or 00s. But it is a program that works well and can give you some practical, concrete ideas on how to do those little things you've got at home, how to do them more effectively. Because oftentimes what happens is we come to the table with so much baggage that we get them in our lives before we've really dealt with all our baggage, and so we're parenting with baggage. And sometimes you have to just say, whoa, I need a plan. I don't get it. I don't even know how it's going to be enough. I believe it. but I need to do something I know will be effective with my kid, and you pull out of this, and you use this key, and it works. And the more successful you get at it, the better you become at it. So, okay, so that's kind of the intro part. And I'm going to start by talking about what do you think our main goal, or what if, actually, if someone is this strong, they can make this now, because that was kind of the beginning, and I won't need it anymore. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you very much. That way I can see you over here. Main goal. If you thought, I'm not going to have you raise your hand, I'm not going to have you tell me, what if I ask you, what is your main goal for your child? Think for a minute. Several things may come to mind, but as you're thinking about it, would what came to your mind go under the goal that you want a responsible child that grows into a responsible man or woman? Does that kind of cover pretty much what you were all thinking in a generic kind of way? That's what we want for our children. We want responsible children to grow into responsible men and women. And we need to look at five areas that we want them to be responsible in. The first one is we want them to be responsible and healthy physically. That means that what they're injecting and what they're around is good for them, that they're using their head and they're doing what's best for their bodies. that they're taking care of themselves physically and acting in healthy ways. We want them to be responsible intellectually, that they are achieving their potential, they are using their gifts, gifts to the best of their ability, and are out there applying those in ways that are appropriate. Emotionally, that they are not users of people or abusers of people, nor are they used or abused by others. We want them to be making responsible, healthy decisions when they get to be adults. And also we want them to be responsible socially, that they can live within the laws that we have, that they know when they're little, they know that when they're going out to check out the stand and they want that candy bar, that if you don't have the money, you don't get the candy bar. And they need to learn that early, and we want them to be responsible then. Also growing forward when they get older, they may want that bike, they don't have the money, they need to wait. They want that car or whatever, they need to wait. So they need to learn that all along, and we need to be training them all along. But by the time they're adults, we want them to be making responsible decisions in those areas. And the last one is spiritually, and I think that's really what this conference is all about. That they have an appropriate and healthy view of God, and that they understand how God views them. And that we understand how God views us. And so if we were to draw on a board a graph, you know, where the line goes like this, and then the other line goes out this way. And if you put 100% right here at the top, and age 18 is out here, okay? 100% when they're born, there's zero right here. When they're born, you are 100% responsible for them. Everything they do, they can do nothing by themselves. By the time they're 18, over here, or 19, 20, 21, wherever they are, they're not exactly 18. They need to be making their own decisions. So this line that starts up here needs to be coming down over those 18 years. so that they begin to take more responsibility for what they're doing, and you begin to take less responsibility. And you'll notice, I mean, if this was a thing, the line starts here, you are decreasing in responsibility. Another line is starting here. They are increasing in responsibility. It crosses right here. I'd like to say that's some dark day in February, where you give up the last vestiges of power. They take them on responsibly, and your life is complete. And that's called adolescence. And it takes four or five years at best that that push-pull back and forth goes on for many, many years for most of our kids. But we want them to be out there 18, responsible, like I said, physically, intellectually, emotionally, socially, and spiritually. And so the question we want to ask is, how do we get them out there looking like that? And you can have a kid anywhere on this continuum. They could be 18, and you could be going, you're really, really, I'm really behind. That's okay. You can always change. You can always do something different. And as long as there's breath, there's room for change. So wherever you are along this line, you just need to start today doing something different if what you're doing now isn't working. So one way to teach responsible children, to teach responsibility, is through a relationship. So we're going to be talking about the relationship you have with your child. Now some of you maybe have okay relationships. Some of you might squirm at that and go, I am in big trouble because my relationship with my food is not good. And if it's not good, then I'm never going to be able to teach them responsibility. No. We are going to learn how to do relationships because one way to improve your relationship is to encourage them. And if you learn how to use this, it's a tool, it's a skill that can be learned. It's not something you're born with. You're like, he's got it, you don't. Oh, you've got it, you've got it, you don't. It's not like that. We can all learn it. Sometimes it's a little harder and we've got to practice, but it is something that you can learn. So one way to improve the relationship then is through encouragement, which is what we're going to talk mostly about today. We are the rule givers, the choice givers, the limit setters. I mean, that is our job as parents. We are told to train up a child, and so that is the responsibility that's been given to us. However, rules without a relationship is going to get you rebellion. Anybody kind of have a kid, you've tried to flip, have all these rules, but you didn't work on the relationship, they're in your face? My oldest one was like that until I kind of got this straight. Rules, though, with a respectful relationship is going to give you responsibility, which is what you're looking for. So how can we be in a relationship? How can we work on the relationship that we have so that they can feel respected and neutral? And this program, again, there's kind of two key premises or key tenets to it, and it's equality, and equality in the sense of human worth and dignity. Just because I am over 40 doesn't mean I have that much more value or worth than my kid who's 10 or my kid who's 2. And it doesn't mean because they are 2 they have less than I do. There's an equality as far as human worth and dignity goes, and I think the scriptures really bear that out. Again, we are still the choice givers. We are the parents, and we have to do that. But as far as work goes, we all have the same wrong work. Okay? And it's not because of anything we did. It's because of what Jesus did for us. So oftentimes what we do is we get this thing called kid, and we had some ideas about what we wanted, and as it begins to grow up, it's not what we had in mind. It's not doing what it was supposed to do. It's not acting like it was supposed to act. And we're kind of left with, how do we do this? What do we do about this? When we try to make them into then something that we want, they become confused and discouraged. And then when they don't turn into what it is we're trying to make them into, we get angry and resentful. This is my story. I should probably just talk to just a minute and tell you how I got into this. It was because of my oldest daughter. When she was born, I knew a mistake had been made. Probably two weeks into it, and I'm like, this is not going to work. I shouldn't have been a mother. This isn't going to work for me. But I thought, oh, it's just a stage. In fact, that's what my husband used to do. Pat me on the head. I mean, it's just a stage. I was like, great. We'll be out of it soon. Well, by the time she was two, I should have remembered that I thought I was a cutout from motherhood, but I was already pregnant with my second one when I was going, isn't it working? You know, this isn't working, so let's have another one. You know, this is really good. She's a bright woman. And then, of course, by the time she was four and I had a two-year-old, well, that wasn't working well either, so let's have another one. So two years later, we had another one. We didn't stop there. But the oldest one is, was, and forevermore shall be a challenge. That's what we call her in public, is a challenge. And I had to learn how to do her, but that was not what I wanted to do originally. I wanted to change her. She needed to act in a certain way in order for me to be okay. And so I said about 7, and I mean, it's like, I'm surprised I have her left, because I was pulling it out a lot then, crying a lot at night. It wasn't working. My husband had been right kind of partially. It was a stage. He thought we'd get through it, but it's going to last a lifetime. It's a stage that lasts a lifetime. She came wired the way she is, and she and I just kind of like this. Not because she's a lot like me, and I don't have seen that in other people. But I said, I have to go to a parenting class. This isn't working. I need to know how to do this kid. So we went, and we were in a group. And they had some major problems. There were some parents there who had adolescents, and they didn't know where one kid. We didn't know where he was. He had run away, and another one had a kid in juvenile detention. And, I mean, I'm a 7-year-old, and when they get to me, I say, what is your major concern? What is it you would like them different? I mean, I had to kind of make up something that sounded as bad as everyone else's. Because if I had told the truth, we just wanted her to empty the dishwasher with a smile on her face. I mean, she had an attitude problem. That was really all it was. But it was big to me. And it was different for them. But that still is important, and it was big. She still has that attitude problem, by the way. So we didn't change her, but I did change the way I look at what's going on and learn to accept her according to her bent, which I think is what that verse is all about, that we need to train them up according to who they are, not who we want them to be. And sometimes that's hard to let go of. But they become discouraged when we're trying to make them do and be what it is they aren't. They also don't feel real accepted by us because they think we're not pleased with who they are, which is right, but we need to learn to convey we are pleased with who you are, so your behavior sometimes stinks. So, as we look at our role as a parent, then we need to look at what is it. I mean, if you've got kids that don't have licenses yet, one of your roles is driving them everywhere they want to go. We have them involved in a lot of activities. Providing food, providing shelter, providing guidance. And there's a lot of things when you look at what your role is, it's multifaceted. But what I want to suggest, and it's probably something we've heard maybe today, or if you go to this church or in this area a lot, because it's pretty much Jeff Van Bond and Scott, we as parents, actually all of us have three basic needs. I want to look at it from the parent-child standpoint. Our children have three basic needs. And they are that they have unconditional love, they know they have unconditional work and value, and unconditional support. And unconditional love says, I love you no matter what. Please note, it does not say, I love your behavior no matter what. Unconditional worth and value says, you have worth and value that is not dependent on your performance. It doesn't mean I'm going to support your performance no matter what, but you have worth and value that's kind of separate from what you do. And then, unconditional support says, I accept you, you belong, I won't abandon you, I won't give up on you. And you feel like I want to, but I won't give up on you. I will find whatever I need to know in order to be able to do you in a way that we can both have a way in here. And in meeting these three basic needs in our kids' lives, it's going to help them develop in a way that is going to make them more confident, more motivated to do new things. If they can separate that trying and perhaps failing doesn't make them a failure, it just makes them having failed. It's very different. They're going to take appropriate risks. They're not going to have to be going really far afield to kind of try things. They're going to be real appropriate because they're going to think about the consequences of their behavior because they're going to be able to think about their behavior as separate from them. They're going to be less influenced by peer pressure, less likely to substitute sex or dependence on some other substance to meet their needs. They'll be more open to talk about failures because they realize they're not a failure. They just made a failure. And that's really different, and they need to know that. If you were to draw two circles, one circle and then a bigger circle, make a smaller circle who the kid is, who you are. And the outer circle is your behavior, your performance, or your kid's behavior, their performance. That'll help you kind of get a picture of it's that middle part, you're unconditionally loving, accepting, having worth, giving worth and value. That doesn't mean their behavior is going to come under those same standards. I mean, kids do things that need to be dealt with. And so we as parents need to deal with them. But we want to make sure we're not assassinating their character and going for that middle part when all we're really doing is talking about their behavior. And sometimes as parents, we forget that. And those two things kind of blur together. And then we really mean that there was a poor choice. And we always say, you stupid, or you lazy, you're a slob, you're a bum. And we just mean, gosh, you don't pick up your womb like I'd like. You're not moving as quickly as I need to be moving. And to keep that separate from them. So they kind of get this feeling that they're not okay. And when we think about what Jesus does for us, I mean, that's kind of, those are his terms. He unconditionally loves us, values us, we have worth, and he supports us. But it doesn't support our behavior all the time. We still have issues that we have to look at. So what we do for our kids is, until they can do that direct, like go to Jesus direct and get that peace, we stand in for him. And that to me is kind of like, kind of so heavy. He's kind of like, I don't want to stand in because I don't do this now. I can't be in condition all the time. You know, couldn't they just get it? I mean, but until they can have their needs met here in that way, They're not going to be able to kind of go to somebody they can't see and think that person can meet their needs if we can't do it here. So we have to be stand-ins for a while and help them, you know, point them in the direction of. But in the meantime, we're the greatest, too, and we've got to give it our best shot. And so we've got to be armed and equipped to do the best job that we can do. Sometimes, though, when we get geared up, you know, and we're going to do this, it's hard to keep a positive focus. We tend to, out of frustration and desperation, become focused on the negative. And just to show you how that works, even when I came here today, podium's here, lights are on, everything was fine. Did I say, Wendy, this is great, podium's here, lights are on, you can get me to drink, everything's fine. I would go up to the positive and say, there's no overhead. Gotta have an overhead. And so, you know, she has to run out with the overhead. That's appropriate, but I'm saying we don't tend to accentuate positives. We tend to talk about negatives. So learning how to do that with our kids is going to produce positive results, but it's going to take some discipline on our part. So we're going to have some attitudes and behaviors that we need to eliminate. And there are, for those of you who are writing one, two, three, four, five of them. Okay? The first one is negative expectations. This is the most powerful force in human relationships, expectations. We can influence a person's behavior just by expecting something from them. If you expect your kid to fail, she probably won't let you down. If you expect them to do well, they will probably do well. So those expectations, we need to take a look at those and eliminate the negative ones. We need to eliminate unreasonably high standards. Standards that are too high invite failure and discouragement. The third one is we need to eliminate promoting competition between brothers and sisters. Now, we have read enough about this, and we all say, we don't do that. We don't say, oh, if you just didn't act like your brother, or if you were just as smart as your sister, we don't say that anymore. It's really the nonverbal promoting of the competition that we do. A kid comes in and brings his spelling paper. It's not a good spelling. And you kind of go, the eye roll, the breath out the mouth or through the nose. They know what that means. And that's a real nonverbal thing. They know who spells and who doesn't spell in the family. And that's just your way of saying, oh, you're not the speller. You know, like, it's a spell. I don't know. You're still doing it. So be really careful about those nonverbals that will promote the competition between siblings. The fourth one is overambition. Overambitious parents communicate that the child is just not quite good enough. It's like the kid who makes five A's and a B brings the report card home. and what does the parent say? What's with this beat? Well, this is a book written by middle schoolers. A lot of poems written by middle schoolers. I want to read this to you. It's written by a 13-year-old. I bring home my test, proud of my beat. You could do better. This is what they say to me. I jump and run and let out a screech. They say act your age along with a speech. After my game, I sit down and rest. All they could say is, you didn't try your best. They expect of me what I cannot give and are constantly telling me how to live. I'm only 13. I'm supposed to act wild. But Dad said he wasn't when he was a child. Now living with them is kind of tough, especially when nothing is ever getting up. My dad was like this. He thought that if he raised the hoop higher or raised the carrot higher, that that would motivate us to jump higher. When you realize that you can never get there, then you become an under-treater. So what the heck do I try? If I can't make it, I'm not going to do anything. So my brother and I early on were that way. We kind of got it that we didn't need to keep giving him power in that way. So both later on became a little successful. So that's kind of an encouraging thing. But if you're over-ambitious, there's a little jingle that kind of goes with this family system. And it goes, good, better, best. Never let it rest until your good is better and your better best. So when you get there, it's never nothing. You get there and you keep moving it on. Be careful that you're not doing that to your kids. Double standards. Double standards convey that children have less value in the family. Now, they understand some of the legal double standards. They know if they're poor, they can't drive. They understand that. That's a law. Those aren't the ones they're struggling with. When I went through his class, I said, well, there's no double standards in our family. and they said why don't you go and ask your kids I thought okay so I go home really Bethany was probably 7 or 8 at the time and Dinah would have been 6 and Adam was 4 so he's not going to have a full line of input but I said do you guys know what double standards are well they kind of did it's when one person gets to do something but the other person doesn't and there's really kind of no reason for it and I'm giving this really good definition because I know there's not going to be any. And I said, so we have any. And they said, oh, yeah. Did you? But what? Well, you get to walk upstairs with your shoes on and we don't. Oh, yeah, that would be one. But you see, I mean, I'm a grown-up. I wash, I wipe my feet off. My shoes are different. I don't walk through them. It doesn't matter. That's still a double-standing. And that's something that I needed to look at. I needed to get over, needing to have a clean carpet, but I needed to take my shoes off. That's something I can do. I can meet them and convey respect to them and that there's some equality here. So watch out for those double standards. But if we want to overcome these discouraging attitudes and encourage our children, then we've got to be willing to work forward following some other attitudes. And there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven of these. The first one is to accept your children as they are, not only as they could be. This is separating the deed from the doer. Accepting your child as they are will give them then the courage to try to be better, to excel, to go on. But if you're always pushing them higher than they are, again, it's that same thing about over-ambition. I feel like they'll never make it so wide travel. And I know that it is for me, and I'm going to guess it's true for all of you, when someone won't let you be where you are, you have a tendency to want to sit there longer. This happens in my family with my mother. I'm kind of the upbeat, hyper clown in the family, and so I'm not allowed to get depressed. I can't really have a bad day. And so if my mom calls, and I've had a bad day, and was telling her that, she says, no, not you. Yes, Mom, it's really been a bad day. I'm depressed. No, no, no, no, no, you're not depressed. Not you, you're never depressed. Yes, yes, I really am. And then I have to get more depressed just to convince her that I'm depressed. And so I finally got tired of doing that and told her, I need for you to let me be where I am. You don't have to fix me. If you get to sit with me, I would have much more energy then to getting out of my hole than digging myself deeper in to convince you I really am. And so she said, well, what would that look like? And I said, well, it would look like you're just kind of going, hmm, when I say that, and letting it be. So, I mean, you know, she tries, but it's so comprived. You can just feel it. So she'll call, and it's been a bad day. I'll feel kind of depressed. Hmm. Depressed. Hmm. And I know she's just doing her head like this on the phone, like going, I don't know what to do. She doesn't know what to do. She doesn't like that. So letting your kid be where they are, then their energy can go to going elsewhere. But if they've got to convince you this is really where they are, because you're arguing with them all the time, it's going to be hard. So let them be where they are. Don't always be thinking about where they're going to go. They'll get there. Ignore tabling is the second one. Now, I could spend 45 minutes on tabling. Anybody have tablers? No? Oh, a few tablers. Okay. Just ignoring the behavior of tabling will not make it go away. You're going to have to find something different to do. When I went, again, when I went to this class, I take everything. Oh, ignore tabling. Good. I can do this. Boom. I go home. And so they stop because every kid does it. And they come to me. Mom, dad, dad, dad. And I'm like, okay, this is tattling. I'm supposed to ignore it. Okay, they're in front of me. And I think, no problem. I'll just turn. And so I just kind of turn over this way. And they're supposed to leave, right? They said ignore tattling. And then they would go away, and they would leave. They're in my face over here. And I'm going, okay. And they're still going at it. So I'm thinking, I just turn this way. Well, they're in front of me. This doesn't work just by ignoring it. So I go back to the group, and I say, that didn't work. And they said, oh, we forgot to tell you, you have to have a plan. You have to do something different. You have to find some other way to occupy yourself. I'm like, okay, I can do that. So I go home. In our kitchen, there's this corner cabinet that has, it's really deep. And way in the back there's someone who has a fondue pot. I got one when I got married 20 years ago. It's still in the plastic paper. I don't do fondue. It's too slow. It's like you can get on with life, you know. So fondue is awful. So it's there, and I'm not going to do that. And I'm thinking, that would occupy me, looking for the fondue pot. And so they come in, bickering, taddling, and I just, oh, I've got to find that fondue pot. I think Mary wants to borrow it. So I climb down, and I'm in here, and I'm rattling a pan. It's going to be down in this one. Well, wait a minute. And I'm watching, and the legs are still there. And I'm thinking, it's not working. And so I rattle a little more, and eventually they go away because I'm not feeding kind of their taddling. It's really hard to pray and let them really work it out on their own. But the message you send there is, kids, I really believe you have what it takes to work out what's going on. You don't meet me all the time. And so, I mean, I did that. My oldest daughter is pretty bright, and that didn't go on very long before. They would come and tattle. She would be sitting in the kitchen, and maybe the little ones would come in. And I'd say, oh, I've got to look down here for something. And she says, I don't know why you come and tell Mom things. You know she looks for that fondue, but every time you come in. So when you get caught, you need to move on. That is done now. You can't use that again, and you have to find something different to do. Now I check the dryer a lot. It's like, oh, I think I'm a floating dryer. It can't be wrinkled, you know, so you run downstairs. So you need to have a plan because it's hard to break, and it's hard to get out of their lives. But they need to experience life as it really happens, and we can't always be there. And so we need to give them some training while we are there and can at least oversee it from afar. Third thing, be positive. Stop using negative comments and avoid using discouraging words and actions. There are positive ways to say just about every negative thing. Your kid is running. Of course, what do we say? Don't run. Or we could say, walk. They're yelling. We say, shut up. Don't yell. Or we could say, oh, just talking to my neighbors. They're throwing something. Don't throw in the house. Instead, we say, oh, let's roll this along the carpet. I mean, there are positive ways to say it. So catch yourself next time you say don't. See if there's some positive way you could say that, some encouraging way that you could say that. The fourth one, have faith in children so that they may believe in themselves. Lack of faith in children fosters anticipation of failure. Truly, if they don't believe, someone believes in them, how are they going to believe in themselves? It really does start out there first and grows within. The parent's job is really to reflect back to the kid they're okay. It starts when they're very little. they kind of look at you and they're kind of like going, am I okay? And we need to let them know, yeah, you're okay. And then they begin to move back from that. Am I okay? And if they're 16 and they're saying, so am I okay? We've let this go on too long. They need to get it when they're little, but they're okay, internalizing it, take it, so then they ask themselves, am I okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Am I doing okay? Well, what do I think? I think I'm okay. So, because we're not going to always be there for them. So we have to instill that within them. Our belief in them will get them going. So it's hard to believe in you kids sometimes. You're bad and I'll go crazy. So sometimes you have to just go with the thread of the possibility that they have, what it takes to be like. And start there and say, I really think you can work this out. I'll be available, but I believe in you. Sometimes you say that, you want to turn around and go, ah! You know, because, you know, they haven't shown themselves to be able to do that. But you've got to start believing in them first. They'll kick in and they can do it. Okay. Focus on contributions, assets, and strengths. To feel adequate, children must feel useful and know that their contributions count. You've got to know that what they're doing is helpful to you. It doesn't have to be perfect, which is the next one. You need to recognize effort and improvement as well as final accomplishment. The end result doesn't have to be perfect. You don't have to get perfection before you say something to them. Just the very fact that they want to help you do the dishes. You may have to kind of rinse them with really hot water if they don't get clean to it. But if they're there, that helps them. If they want to maybe help you, sleep. They're trying. They have a few years to learn how to use a broom. We wonder sometimes why our kids still want to help us in the kitchen or in the house. Because early on when they did want to help us, it had to be perfect. always a good enough. So good enough is good enough. They will get better. The last thing, am I on the last one? I think so, yeah. Encourage better than praise. And that's really the heart of this, is to learn how to encourage your kids, which will grow that center circle, as opposed to praising them, which will grow that outer circle. If the center circle is strong, they'll be able to take just about any assault for their behavior, you know, any mistake they make, any, you know, teacher could say something, parent could say something, sibling could say something. If they know they're okay and what they did is separate from who they are, they'll be able to take some of the rougher knots in life. But if you praise your kid a lot, then that outer circle is going to be stronger and it's going to be real external focus. It's what other people think. Am I doing good? You're always looking out there because you're checking out, is my behavior okay? Let me make that a little more clear. Praise is a type of reward that's based on winning and being the best. You praise a kid when they win. You praise a kid when they win the blue ribbon, the A, the 100 on the test, they finish the race, whatever. You can praise a kid. What do you do with the kid who made the C, who didn't make the spelling B, who didn't make the team? Praise doesn't work here. And we're going to have to have a tool that will stem the tide of discouragement and praise will not do it. Praise is not a motivator. It builds performance-based mentality and performance-based kids and performance-based adults. So praise is a type of reward, again, based on winning. The completed achievement is the end result. That is what we're going for. And it's an attempt to motivate children with external rewards. It's, again, out there, blue ribbons winning, confirming what they did is really good, has nothing to say or do about who they are. The child becomes then believing that his work depends on the opinions of others, what other people think about what he's doing, and it places value jokings on the child. It sounds like this, okay, it sounds like this. You're such a good girl. You're a good boy. My opinion of the kid, right? Not an easy expectation to live up to. What if I can't be good all the time? See, the truth is, your kids are good all the time. I would assume it's hard. It's 100% okay. Number one, because they're human being kids. Number two, because they're in Jesus. So because of what Jesus did, they're 100% okay. Now their behavior sometimes is not. Sometimes often more than sometimes. So that we need to help them understand that. And the way to do that is focus on, again, how what they did, that we're giving our opinion on, how what they did helped us out. That'll put the spotlight back over on them. Hey, you did this. That really helped me out. Thanks. Well, they get to own that. Whoa, good deal. But when I say, good boy, good girl, it's like, I get to be so pretty on you, pretty on you. The spotlight will focus on you. I want to move it back over on to them. Praise sounds like this. You got an A. That's great. Does that mean they're only worth following when they get an A? Whether it's figured it'd be. Or C. Do they lose their worthwhileness? You want to focus on how the child feels about what they're doing. Boy, you put a lot of effort into that thing. How do you feel about that? You know, normally do that, but there's no need to have to have people. Because we're all going, hey, great job, hey, great job, great job. What do you think? Nothing? Well, how did it feel getting there? I like it. I like getting there. Oh, hi. You have a moment to tell. The important is how do you feel about that. Because they need to be making A's for themselves. Not for you. Because what's going to happen when they get a little bit older and they don't like you? And it will happen. They are going to then rebel against you. And if you are A's, then even though they might want to make A's, now they can't. Because then they'd be doing what you want. And they want to do what you want. That's part of their task as kids. really it starts at 2, and they will fight this until they're 22, is separating and individuating and becoming different from you. So if everything is kind of wrapped up in you, then they have to rebel against it. Little kids, maybe they're going for their sweater at school outside, and they're going for their sweater, their coat, and you say, wear your coat outside. They were just going for the coat. Now because you said to go get the coat, now they can't wear the coat because you said do it even though they wanted to because they have to be different. That desire to be separate is bigger than their desire to please you, and that will get greater as they get older. Those of you who please know that. You know, I mean, pleasing you is kind of really falling low on the scale, if it's on there at all anymore. Yeah. So anyway, focusing on how they've done it, putting it back over in there. What a good job you did. Again, that's an evaluation on my part, kind of bestowing goodness on what they've done, rather than letting them know how that is appreciated by me. But the men kind of take credit for that. The hardest one, I think, to give up, and you don't have to give these up completely. I'm just kind of showing you what it looks like. I'm so proud of you. It's okay to be proud of your kids. But don't have that be the first response out of your mouth. You want them to be proud of themselves. And so you say, how do you feel about that? And they'll tell you. And then they'll say, yeah, they're really proud of you. Well, you know, you really worked hard on that. You see that hard work paid off. yeah? what are you proud of me? how do you feel about it? I feel really good about it are you proud of me? they will ask you that because they want to know that partially because we've trained them to not be okay until I get that and so it's important I will answer your question I will tell you how I feel about this but what's more important is are you proud of what you've done? yes I am you know what I'm proud of you too and you can put it in yourself you know and they walk off they're fine But you just don't want that to be the first response. And again, it puts their okayness kind of rest on if you think what you think and how you think about what they've done or not done or whatever. So encouragement then focuses on effort and improvement, however slight. It says what's important is how you feel about yourself and how you feel about your efforts. It doesn't reward, it acknowledges, and it recognizes. This is easy to do with most kids. Most kids are not that 100-point, A-plus, blue-ribbon winners. Most of them are just middle-of-the-road kids. And this will really help them become stronger in who they are. It focuses on their assets and strengths as a way of them contributing to the good of all. It is not concerned with how they compare to others, but how they accept themselves and what they have and bring to difficult tasks. It helps them feel good about themselves and learn to make their own judgments. It motivates them within. so it doesn't mean that you can never praise the kid again okay it's just that praise is something that really we do to God God is perfect his performance is perfect he's perfect and he prays this game he does not praise us he encourages us he comes alongside he exhorts, he upholds he encourages us we in turn need to be doing that for our kids encouraging them praise again it can be used but it's not encouraging it doesn't stem the tide of discouragement and it doesn't motivate so you want to use praise like you use salt on the tree the steady diet should be encouragement, you can sell it with praise every now and then, it's not a bad thing you just don't want to it comes so easy when I teach this lesson and we go through this session the homework for the following week is to encourage the kids and not to praise them one time. Oh, they come back going, that's so hard, I couldn't do it. It just kind of becomes so easy. So raising their awareness and getting them to be real sensitive about that, I think eventually they'll kind of get back into where they're doing both. But you want to be encouraging more than praising. I want to just give you a word of caution about qualifying and moralizing comments when you start picking this up and you decide, okay, I picked this, and I can do this. there's going to be a tendency to want to add something on the end of this because encouragement kind of never feels like enough. I mean, just kind of laying it out there. A kid may bring you something and you say, wow, it looks like you really worked hard on that. Really, that's where you stop. You kind of want to say, so, why don't you do that all the time? Or see what you can do when you try? And that's like handing them a gift and then smacking it away when they try to take it. So also in this class, if I was really rich, I would give every person in my class a sock to carry around with them because this is where you stuck a sock in. You just say what you need to say, and then you wait and you let it lay there. It's going to be hard for your kids to accept this because they're so used to getting the other. So what we're going to do is we're going to try this. I'm going to show you. I'll give you one other example. Again, somebody confronted me on this and asked me that I feel like my kids knew that I accepted them separate from their behavior? Did they understand that? Did I think kids could really get that? And I said, oh, sure. I'm sure I teach it. Of course they do it. I'm moving in the home. And they said, well, why don't you find a way to try it out and let me know? So I went home and it was report card time. I thought, well, this would be a good way, because report cards are about performance. And so a report card comes in, my oldest friend's hers, And she's a straight-A student. I mean, she makes A's like I donk, which is really easy. And I said, so Bethany, before I open this, is there anything in this report card that would make me love you more? I'm going to hear you all the best. How about anything that would make me love you more? She said, Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. He said, and still, if I had it back tomorrow, if I could, I would do it. So, I mean, we're still playing it, and I said, OK, do that. Well, I have a question. If you answer that, you know, it's kind a pretty hard. OK. So I want you guys to try this, because, you know, you told me. But you said that you really really want to do it. You know, it's a pretty good question. And you thought it really could be a good question. Thank you. is too difficult. So you don't want to come up with your third-minute response. Okay, you're in tune, back there. You have a sign that you're interested to direct the door for the first time. The shirt's on backwards. It's two-year-old. Thank you. It comes out. That's your response. Okay, your son is just out of the way to get in. Third-minute response. Are you in this one? You've got a good one. Your son, your daughter, is worried that your son will not do well in your different time. Okay, do you guys? You guys, your daughter and your sister who turns into an athletic contest, have you playing well? Have you lost? Played well, have you lost? Okay, you're in good. You're in good response, the daughter gets in the card, you walk back to the field with her. Look, go look, go look, actually I'm real sorry to interrupt you, but are you in good response? Are she gonna call her next to my family? The son of the daughter of the ghost is telling you, she's gonna be in good condition. I'm just going to get it kind of started getting the feel of it. Okay, this group here has a daughter that's complaining that their natural mark is too difficult. What is the answer to this part? What do you think they're going to say to them? Okay, how can I help you with that? What I like about that is how can I help you? As soon as you have friends, you can say, okay, what do you want? And we'll sit down and we'll start and they wander off and put them in front of the table and we'll be working with them. Okay? So then, you know, if you feel she needs help, then you say, let's bring this room together. Okay? What if you think she can receive this? I have a favorite, so I have a favorite. But first, I'm going to say, okay. You know, what if you think she can receive this? Is it the word that works you takes? You can say, you know, I know this isn't a joke. You're getting the job. I'm getting it to you. Okay. Okay. Okay. You can't do that. You can't do that. You can't do that. You're saying, you're getting it. You're getting it. You're getting it. You're getting it. Okay. You're getting it. All right. You're getting it. You're getting it. Okay. Just do that. Okay. What you want to not say is I'm just going to say, okay. Okay? Yes, right. That's what I'm like, what is this? It's amazing, right? It's just simple, but it's not easy. It's simple. When I say it, it's like, let's get home. I'm going to say, right? It's like, well, I'm glad you got home. And you can say, I'm glad you're learning to trust yourself. And then you feel proud? Getting yourself dressed without any help. Okay. Any of you go with a conversation and you say, um, what do you choose to go in this corner? Or, you know, um, what do you choose? I mean, I don't want to give it to me, but then help them get out. It's such an interesting thing. I don't know. Okay. Well, and then you kind of say, this is the parents of the child, and this is what you feel like. Okay. And the parents of the child, this is what you feel like, you know, I'm talking about numbering, the child, the one who has to make this call, it's not going to be a failure if you're going to shoot me in the world. So this is what you're going to do, and either you've got your head. Okay, okay, I see what you're saying. Yeah, you can kind of make me cry here. Normally, this happens when you're in school. And then, okay, I'm a new kid. You guys have a new kid. You know, I'm going to be here in the daytime for the week. But, you know, at home, you have to do it. So, if you're in the middle, you have to do something you can. Because when they come out, and when you're going, some words that you don't find in the open. Branding news, I'm quoting, and I'm not going to get experience in the back of my school. It's really short for you to take a match of things up. Branding news is very expensive. You can get out of the answer about the same place. You can answer something that comes in on you. You just don't do it. You're in the country. You just have to take a second. You're in the other person. And you find a way to get to the end of the day. Thank you. answer and then tell them a lot about things. You learn. You can even tell them. Yeah, she knows about things. You never know. I like to make sure you're swollen, clear. Because now you've told them, now they're not wearing that way. But if you go to school, and they come on and they get their cards, they're not even going to tell you about things. They're not going to be right. So you're going to have to sell them. So you want to catch them before. Catch them everything before. But if you take them sometimes, you're not there. I'm going to put a group on the wall of shoes on the other side. And so he just put that in the ground, and then he'll start here and go down, and he'll put that shoe on the square. And then he'll go in the square. So, just because we're short of time, one of the things that we're going to do is, we're going to be trying to just help you in the kitchen. Thank you. Are you a guest for your time? I appreciate your help. Thanks for your help. Thank you. Okay. Because you respect, you need to say, all of you. You have your guest, you're welcome. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for your time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're saying it's worried that you will not do it in this pre-telling. I'm not going to do it in this pre-telling. Okay. Yeah. Those are easier, don't they? Yeah. Okay. And you're thinking about seven weeks of this, which is, you know, this is a class. It's the next week part. And then how do you call yourself? You get that kind of thing with this kind of emotion that they're scared or whatever. You say, you do not have to do better stuff. So you can get from there what they meant to do. You know, we've got that one. And now you're upset about it. And we also know what they're doing about it. And we're not there to talk. So you say, what do you do with anything? I'm really, what do you think you want to help people to benefit? Thank you. Thank you. Don't be excited. Yeah, but they're not ready to go. Yeah. Yeah. And like I said, 10 seconds, I'm not going to do that. It's always something that you're doing. It's just a few people that you're doing. That is true. You look at the scoreboard. That is what it is. We are unimportant with this, and I'm going to be moving through the tunnel, but it's still a shift in the tunnel. In the tunnel, we're going to teach you how to sail, and this phase of our time is there. We're going to teach you how to fly, to sail the skies, on the inside. We're going to teach you how to sail. We see things that have said before, but most are going to be bad. We're going to teach you how to fly, we're going to teach you how to fly, Thank you.
