Father thank you for your goodness to us as we sing how great thou art oh how great thou art and Father wherever we are in the circumstances of life this morning whether it's on the mountain peaks or whether it's walking through the valley of shadow of death the truth is still there how great thou art that God you are good and while your ways are not always known to us while we are not always certainly predictable not always understood the one constant remains that you are good all the time. Father, speak to us your truth from your word this morning by the power of your spirit and let it impact us, not just this morning, but in the days, the weeks, the months, and the years to come that it may change the course of our lives in some way this week. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. 1 Corinthians 15, 58, an end of the entire chapter about the resurrection of Jesus Christ. That points to the fact that life is not just about here and now, but rather it's about all of eternity. That there is life beyond the grave. That when this life is over, and really in the grand scheme of things is brief as it is, life goes on into eternity. And we will either be with him for all eternity, or we'll be separated from him for all of eternity. At the end of that chapter, because of the resurrection, Paul writes, therefore, my beloved, be steadfast immovable always abounding in the work of the Lord be steadfast immovable always abounding in he said in the work of the Lord you know that it is God's will for your life that he be involved in the work of his kingdom in fact that your life revolve around the work of his kingdom do you know that that's God' will for you you say I want to know God's will for my life well I'm telling you one thing this morning there's God's will for your life that you be actively involved in the work of the kingdom in Luke chapter 10 verse 2 Jesus says to a group of his followers the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest in other words not only are we to step forward to be involved in the work of the kingdom but we are to pray and ask God to raise up other people to join us in the work of the kingdom that the kingdom of God might be built that is God's will for our lives that's why to a great degree we as a church have been brought together that we might be a collection, a community of people, embracing God, receiving from him, and then going out to build his kingdom in the world in which he has placed us. Now the question I want to ask you this morning, and then try and answer, is the question why. Why has God called you and I to be involved in the work of his kingdom? What's the reason? Well, before I spell out why, Let me take just a few moments and dispel for you some misconceptions, some reasons that many of us have, in many cases, adopted and believed that are not in accordance with truth. And I want to put these aside this morning for a few minutes and then deal with the true reasons for why God has called us to participate. Misconception number one, God needs our help. God needs our help. Now, while some of you and I say that, you chuckle and think, well, God doesn't need any help. How silly. The fact of the matter is that many of us have subtly bought into this notion that in some way God does need our help. After all, we've been told, you know, you've got friends and neighbors and work associates that are living a life apart from Christ and they're going to die and they're going to go to a Christless eternity. And how will they be saved unless you go and speak to them? Right? As if their salvation in some way depended on us. Can I tell you this morning that no one's salvation depends on you? isn't that a good thing well I would hate to live every day with the burden of someone's eternal destiny dependent upon me we've been told that well you know if we don't go and visit people who are homeless and people who are shut in and people who are in the hospital and discouraged we don't visit them they can't be encouraged and they'll remain in their loneliness friends the God who spoke the world into order can speak hope and encouragement into the life of anyone without your voice or mine. We've been told, well, if you don't get out your checkbook and write the check, then the work of God in some way will be hindered. Now, the God who owns the cattle on a thousand hills doesn't need your check or mine. God at any time can just sell a few thousand heads of cattle. The God who literally deposited manna on his children, two million of them wandering in the desert in order to feed them, the God who caused the quail to fly into the camp with a sign that said eat me it doesn't need you and I to even feed the hungry friends God doesn't need our help Acts chapter 17 verses 24 and 25 say this the God who made the world and all things in it since he is Lord of heaven and earth does not dwell in temples neither is he served by human hands as though he needed anything since he himself gives to all life and breath and all things. Friends, God doesn't invite us into his work because he needs our help. Our God is all-sufficient. Our God is self-sufficient. Misconception number two. Our involvement enables us to pay him back for all he has done for us. After all, we've all been told and heard the words of the psalmist, what shall I render to the Lord for all of his benefits toward me? And rhetorically, we have answered that rhetorical question by saying, well, God's given so much to me, I'm going to jump on board with the church in some way and I'm going to participate in a way to give back. As if we owe God something. You know, I have a relationship with my mortgage company. Now, they call me a customer. I'm not a customer. That is to say, I don't choose to participate with them. I have to. In fact, when I get mail from them, what it really ought to say is, debtor Don Cousins. You have a relationship like that, I would guess many of you, okay, unless you're financially independent. We're debtors. We owe them. They have given us something, and they expect to be paid back. And if we don't pay them back, they get rather upset. In fact, initially they start sending notices home to you. And then if you don't heed those notices, eventually judgment falls on you, and they take your house away. Now, they not only want their money paid back, They likely have even additional money paid back to call it interest. We owe them. Well, you know, the Bible tells us that at one time we were, before God, debtors. We owed him. He's a holy God. We're sinners. We must stand before him one day, and our sin is a debt that we carry. And God reaches out to us and speaks to us, and he tries to tell us that there's a way in which the debt can be paid. and the hope is that we hear and we respond. But if we don't, if we don't, then judgment eventually falls and we spend an eternity apart from him. Now let's just use for the imagination for a second, in our imagination, that the mortgage company every month pulled one name out of a big drum and then canceled the mortgage. Like I said, use your imagination. Let's say this next month that they drew my name out of the drum, and they called me and said, Don, we drew your name this month. Your debt has been canceled. Mortgage has been paid. At that point, would I still be a debtor? No. Once my mortgage is paid, the debt is paid, I am no longer a debtor. I no longer owe them anything. Friends, when you know Jesus Christ as your Savior, you're no longer a debtor. that is to say you owe God nothing God isn't asking for you to do anything for him so as to pay him back in fact he tells us that we are saved by grace unmerited favor and that we not only are saved by faith but the Bible tells us that we dwell in grace we live in grace and that everything in our future is dependent upon his grace and the degree to which we try and do something to pay him back, what we're in effect saying to him is, your grace is not sufficient for me. So friends, if there are any of you here this morning who are on a payback plan, I'm going to give God back. Can I tell you, his grace is sufficient for you. And he doesn't invite you to his work because he wants you to pay him back for anything. Isn't that freeing? Third misconception, He wants us to do something for him. That is to say he wants to be served. In fact, we even use the term, are you serving God? You know, words fail us at that point because Jesus said in Mark chapter 10, verse 45, I did not come to be served, but rather to serve and give my life as a ransom for many. I didn't come to be served, Jesus said. In any serving relationship, there is a person who's the giver and there's a person who's the receiver. We could call the giver the benefactor. The one who out of what they have gives something so as the person who's receiving the beneficiary receives something. Jesus says, I didn't come to be the beneficiary, I came to be the benefactor. Well friends, it's very important that you and I allow Jesus to always be the benefactor. Why? Because benefactors always get the glory. a person donates a million dollars to help build a building the building is often named after them it's called the whatever and their name is put right on the building so that every time someone drives by the highway and sees their name on the building we all conclude what? that family gave a lot of money to help build that building in other words they got the glory benefactors always get the glory and so what God would say to us He says, serving me has nothing to do with doing for me in such a way that I would be the beneficiary of your giving. Because if you're the one who's doing the giving and I'm the one who's doing the receiving, then what does it make you? The benefactor. What does it make me? The beneficiary. And in that context, who gets the glory? You do. And what does God say about sharing his glory? I share my glory with no man. So here's the great mystery. in the midst of your and my being involved in the work of his kingdom we must always maintain the position of being the beneficiary and God must always be the benefactor he must always be the giver we must never change roles you say well if that's the case then then in the midst of my joining the work of his kingdom well then why has he called me to join his kingdom if it's not to pay him back, if it's not because he needs my help, and if it somehow involves the mystery of my always being the person who's receiving, why has God called all of us to be involved in the work of the kingdom? Let me articulate very simply to you and straightforwardly the reason, and let me try and then unpack it for you. The reason is simply this. God wants to bring blessing to us. and then he wants to bring blessing through us for God displays his nature through blessing and in turn brings glory to himself say it again that's a mouthful God wants to bring blessing to us and out of the blessing he brings to us he wants to bring blessing through us because in blessing us and in blessing to us to others, God puts his own nature on display. And as he displays his nature, he brings glory to himself. Friends, you get your arms around and that will change your life. Our God is a blessing God, and God delights in blessing his children. God delights in blessing not only us, but in blessing others through us. Because in that blessing, God displays his greatness. And in turn, we and others then say, isn't God great? I have a friend who runs a small investment company. Over the last several years, God has prospered greatly in such a way that his profits coming in have been significant with a tune of millions of dollars. He called me about four years ago and knowing the type of thing that I've done over the years with organizations and things, I said, my wife and I want to put together a foundation. We want to become very intentional about giving money away. Very specifically, we want to give it to exclusively Christian causes. We want to be about the kingdom of God. Would you be willing to help us kind of put that together and figure out what's the best way to kind of make that happen in a way that would honor God? And so I said, that'd be great. I'd love to participate in that. So the three of us got together, sat in his family room. I brought my little pad, pen in hand, and I said, okay, I'd like to ask you some questions and start to unpack what's in your heart and your mind. The first question I asked is, why do you want to do this? And one of the first answers he gave was, we want to put the generosity of God on display. God has blessed us. His generosity has been poured out in our lives. And as a result, we now want, with that blessing that we have received. We want to now extend that blessing to others so that other people see that God is generous. Now over the last several years they've been engaged in actually doing that. They have a name for their foundation. Remember their foundation does not involve their own personal name. When they give donations to different ministries both near where they live as well as abroad the donations they'll give are always given without their name being attached to it a letter always goes out that indicates that this comes as a result of the goodness of God in a business and in a family's life and they simply want to pass on that goodness and be a part of putting God's generosity on display and they make it very clear very clear that this is God who's done this and is doing this, not us. And many of the ministries and many of the people who have been recipients don't even know the name of the family from whom that goes. Why has this been important to this particular couple? Because whose generosity are they putting on display? God's generosity. Friends, God delights in blessing his children, and then he delights in pulling that blessing through his children because in that blessing we come away and say, Isn't our God great? This is why God calls us to his work, so that we would be the recipients of blessing, and then we would be the dispensers of blessing. If I said to you, if you came to the end of your life, and you could look back upon your life, and you would conclude that your life had been a life in which you had been a recipient of the blessing of God, and not only that, but that God had enabled you through the course of your life to be a blessing to others, would your life have been worth living? What more do any of us want than to live a life blessed by God and in a life that's been a blessing to others? Friends, that's why God calls us to be involved in the work of His kingdom, because in the midst of the work of His kingdom, God dispenses blessing. Now you say, well, how does God dispense blessing? From the time I have the menu, let me give you three or four ways in which God dispenses blessing. blessing number one God gives us purpose for life God gives us purpose in life I read not too long ago that life involves one great fact and one great question and in order for life to really be understood every person must get their hands around the one great fact and then must answer the one great question the one great fact is you were born. You were given life. God formed you. If you have any question about that, open your Bible at some point in time and read Psalm 139. So God wove you by hand. He knows exactly who you are. He formed you. He knew you. He knows when you'll sit before you sit. He knows when you'll stand before you stand. He knows everything about you. God formed you. You were born and not an accident. get your arms around that fact but then there's one great question that every person must answer and that is why why was I born why was I given life well Ephesians 2.10 very simply gives us the answer to that question says in Ephesians 2.10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. Let me take that verse apart for just a moment because it's a life-changing verse. For we are his workmanship. The first five words stop right there. If every follower of Jesus Christ understood and really felt and believed those first five words of Ephesians 2.10, every believer would forever see themselves differently. No believer would ever have a self-esteem problem. Self-esteem is a big deal in our world today and in our country. We want to go to any bookstore, Barnes & Noble. I passed it this morning on the way here. I walked into that store and said, can you show me a few books on self-esteem? They would say, sure, go over that wall. There's hundreds of them. Many of them best sellers. Why? Because we have such an appetite to feel good about ourselves and so many of us don't. Well, into that, God says, before we are his workmanship. You say, well, how does that God give me value? Well, let me give you a little analogy. About 15 years ago, my wife and I took a trip to Paris. My wife has been, for many years, a flight attendant for United Airlines. And one of the benefits of being an employee of an airline is you fly for free. And one of the benefits of being married to a flight attendant is you fly for free. So she has a t-shirt that says, marry me, fly for free. Now, she got that after we got married. They had nothing to do, but it's been a side benefit of kind of going along with the package. So one day she gets a win, and she says, hey, let's go to Paris. Oh, whatever, let's go to Paris. So we at that time only had one child. When I was three, we had one child, and we gave him to my in-laws to take care of for the time we were there. We were just going to go for a few days. And so when you go to Paris, you feel obligated to kind of see the sights. So to walk to Changerluse, and see the Arc de Triomphe. Do you like the way I say that? I kind of like that it rolls off the tongue. And Notre Dame, and, you know, these are the things you need to do. And, of course, one of the things she said is we ought to go to the roof. I said, is that the art museum? She said, yeah, that's the art museum. I said, now, you know, I grew up in Chicago, and we have a great world-class art museum in Chicago. I've never been there. I've driven by it many times. I have no desire to go. I don't have a plan to go. Now, I've gone to Ridley Field many times, That always moves me. Okay? Soldier's Field, that moves me. The museum? But we're in Paris, the Louvre, Michelangelo, Da Vinci, you know, sculpture. We probably ought to go. So we went. That flew in 45 minutes. If my wife hadn't been dragging along, I could have done it in 15. Now, I've been to the Baseball Hall of Fame four times. First thing I went through, I spent eight hours there. Room by room by room. Oh, there's Ted Williams' bats. Oh, man. Babe Ruth's uniform. In fact, even at this moment, it kind of creates that emotional moment for me. Just standing here, thinking about that. I've been to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton. When I went out of the way to drive there, to just slowly walk through and just take it in, I went through the Louvre, you know. Heck, there's a sculpture. Heck, there's a painting. Oh, yeah, Michelangelo. Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, boy, that's really nice. Anyway, back to the room where they have the Mona Lisa. How many of you have been there? Have you seen the Mona Lisa? Well, I walked in the room, and it's a big room. It's a good-sized room. And there's a small crowd of people standing, and they're all looking in this one direction behind this red rope that comes around the front, and they're all looking, and there she is, the Mona Lisa. Now I looked and I thought, good deal. I mean, really, there was a wall-sized painting over here, there was a wall-sized painting behind us, a wall-sized painting on this wall, and really, I thought all three of those were far more impressive. I mean, here was this painting, about this big, on this wall, just sitting on the wall. So I kind of stood in the back and thought to myself, I wonder what that's worth. So I asked someone, they said, oh, that's priceless. Priceless. I wasn't going to take it or anything, but I thought, well, if you were going to take it, you couldn't even get paid for it because it's priceless. It doesn't even have a value. It's beyond estimation of value. Sometime later, I was reading Ephesians 2.10, and I went back to that image, standing in that room, looking at this painting, and I thought to myself, you know, this is interesting. Here's a painting hanging on a wall. It's priceless. Why is it priceless? Well, I think the reason it's priceless is because of who painted it. Leonardo da Vinci. One of the great people to ever walk the earth. None consider other than Jesus the most talented, brilliant individual who's ever walked the face of the earth. He painted the Mona Lisa. And because of that, it's priceless. What's interesting, here we have an inanimate object hanging on a wall. In fact, today it's still probably hanging on that wall. It does nothing else. It just hangs on the wall. It's a lifeless object. Tainted by a man who's been dead 500 years. In other words, he's dust. And that's priceless. And now you read Ephesians 2.10. So we are his workmanship. And my question would be, so what does that make you work? a living, breathing being created by the living God. What do you worth? The one great fact, you were born. What do you worth? You're way beyond prices. One great question, why? Why? The verse tells us. For good works. You and I get this now, the imagery are God's painting. and we're not hanging on a wall, no. We're literally journeying through life. And as we journey through life, what God does is He put good work in our path, literally creates them beforehand that we should walk in them. So that as we walk through the course of our day, you and I have an opportunity to be God's paintings on display to the world around us through the way we live. Is it important that you as a businessman and woman do business with integrity? You better believe it because you're displaying God. Is it important that you treat every person you come in contact with with kindness and with goodness and with truth in love? You better believe it because you're a painting on display. Is it important that you speak the truth and when given the opportunity to communicate the gospel which changes someone's life in eternity? You better believe it because it's God's truth on display. You realize that even today, You don't even know what's awaiting you, but for every single one of you who's a follower of Jesus Christ today, God has the potential for good work laid in your path. So that when you lay your head on a pillow tonight, you look back upon your bed and say, you know what, my life today may be different. I'm his workmanship, and I've been created for good work. Now when you understand that, all of a sudden you find yourself able to say, you know, I'm not just a salesman. I'm not just a housewife. I'm not just a computer programmer. I am a masterpiece being created in Christ Jesus for the purpose of executing good works through the course of life. To the glory of God. So God blesses us with purpose for life. Second, He blesses us with the ability to make a difference. Really, it's capability to make a difference, and that is to say that God gives each and every one of us that follows His spiritual gifts. the Bible tells us that every one of us has at least one spiritual gift, a divine enablement, a divine ability a supernatural power to make a contribution to the work of the kingdom some of the gift of teaching some of the gift of leadership some of the ministration, some help, some mercy some shepherding, some pastoring some intercession the list of gifts many believe is inexhaustible we all have a gift at least one and through that gift God wants to empower us to make a difference to be capable to do something to make a contribution to his kingdom I grew up attending a small neighborhood church on the outskirts of Chicago a church with about 400 or 500 people in the middle of a neighborhood on 2 or 3 acres it was a great church that taught the bible when I entered high school I joined the high school youth ministry. It was about 30 kids. The church couldn't afford a full-time youth pastor, so it had youth sponsors. That was usually a couple of young couples. They would sign on for a year. The kids would kill them, and then they'd get new ones upon them a year. Well, the church eventually decided they'd hire somebody part-time, so they hired a young man named Dave, and he came in. He was a music guy, so he began to coordinate us and put us together as a music group because that's what he did. Well, our little youth group needed a drummer, our music ministry, needed a drummer. And so he began to play and look around and came across a young man named Mike. Now Mike happened to live in a community about 30 minutes away from where our church was. But David invited him to come and be our drummer. And so he would drive in each and every Wednesday to our little youth group meeting where we had our music practice and we played the drums. He had grown up as a very nominal Catholic, meaning God meant nothing to him. He had been to a lot of drugs and alcohol, but he had met Jesus, and his wife had dramatically changed. Dramatically changed. Well, in the months that followed, God began to work in that youth group. In fact, Dave knew that he wasn't a Bible teacher until he invited a friend of his that he had known growing up from camp days in the summer. His name is Bill Heathers. And he invited Bill to come and teach some Bible studies to this group of parents. so Bill began to do that on Wednesday nights and I really used to begin to grow a little bit as we began to enjoy music together as well as hearing the word and the relationships we had well Mike Mike had a gift spiritual gift of evangelism that the evangelism enabled him to want to share the gospel to anybody he came in contact with and when he did amazing things happen God empowered the gift and friends of his started to come to know Jesus in a personal way. And so Mike began to share Christ with his friends at school and he began to fill his family, it was actually a business, a vehicle that his business, his family had a business and he drove a van and he would drive his little van into our youth group with his friends each and every week, friends that were coming to know Jesus. And eventually, you know, one van wasn't enough and so the friends said, well, I'll drive. So he said two wasn't enough, so he drove in three. And then three wasn't enough, so he drove in four. And we'd have four veins every week coming into our youth ministry. Kids that Mike was sharing Christ with, and they were turning to know Christ in a personal way. And Mike kept telling us, some good God's going to do something great in Palatine. That was the community he came from. Some good God's going to do something great in Palatine. And we said, yeah, what, right, Mike, sure, Mike, uh-huh. It was a farming community. He said, as soon as we get some people out there, I'm sure God will. Eventually, they decided that the four cars wasn't enough and it probably wasn't the safest way, so why don't we rent a bus for the kids to pool their money, paid for a bus, they rented a school bus, and they met at the high school and drove in together on the bus, and pretty soon one bus wasn't enough, and they got two. Two bus wasn't enough, three bus wasn't enough, four. Mark kept telling us, guys will do something great in Palestine someday. Within three and a half years, that lease ministry moved from 30 kids a week to 1,200 kids a week. And Mike and his parents were bringing in four busloads of kids from Palatine, 30 minutes. Unload, go to our church ministry that evening, put back on the bus, and then go back out to where they lived. In October 1975, Little Creek Community Church began in Palatine, Illinois. It was that group of high school and our young college-age kids. All begun by a young man who had a gift. He was just a kid who had a supernatural gift. God not only calls us to his work, but God gives us his abilities. Supernatural abilities can make a difference. Do you know what your spiritual gift is? And more importantly, are you using it? The third blessing God gives us is the indwelling Holy Spirit. God says, not only am I going to give you a purpose for life, there will be a reflection of who I've made you to be, my image in you. I'm going to give you the spiritual gift necessary to make a difference, but I'm going to give you my indwelling Holy Spirit, and I'm going to put my presence in you. Jesus said, amazing sin in John chapter 16, verse 8, he said to his followers, it is to your advantage that I go away. Do you know what you mean after Jesus? Jesus said, yeah, right, Jesus. He said, really good, because the sooner I live in, the sooner the Holy Spirit will come. and the great son of the Holy Spirit is going because he will be with you always. While I'm here, my presence with you is limited to when I'm with you physically. But when I leave, the Holy Spirit will entail your life. And literally, God will be with you all the time. Your companion working in your life. You say, well, what difference does that make? Well, let me give you a quick analogy. I have three children. They're oldest two are boys. Since my boys were young, I was a volunteer to be a coach on their various athletic teams. I enjoy athletics. That's kind of my background. And so my boys have enjoyed athletics. My daughter does as well. I'm a coach then as they've grown older. And so I became, you know, good soccer. I didn't know anything about it. And other than go pick the ball and pick it that way. And then when I was here about nine, it got too complicated for me. And I had to pick up soccer. But I've done basketball and baseball and football. I coached my son to a football team in this past year. Now, there's a few reasons why I do that. The first is I enjoy it. I just quite enjoy it. I enjoy being out with kids. I enjoy coaching. I enjoy athletics. I just enjoy it. But if my kids weren't playing, I probably wouldn't be volunteering for it. I don't enjoy it that much. The reason I do it is because I just watch running out with my kids. And I figure, why should I take my kids to a practice and drop them off with another day I'd like to spend time with my kids. In fact, my greatest joy in life really is doing anything with my family, anything with my kids. And so being out in the field of plays, hanging out with my kids, just produces bad great delight. In addition to that, I know that the athletic arena and the plays wear character in the world, and life lessons that are taught. It's where you learn how to win, and you learn how to lose, and you learn to compete, and you learn to deal with people, and you learn to get along with people, and you learn that people are more talented than you, and people are less talented than you. You learn to get along with difficult people, and you learn to deal with referees, and make bail decisions, and you learn how life is not fair. And you learn to be disciplined, and you learn to persevere, and you learn to get up after you're falling down. Well, as I said, I figured that the playing field of athletics is a place where I can help build character and teach life lessons to my kids as they participate. And God drives it. God calls us to the work of this kingdom because he likes to hang out with his kids. And he looks to the world to teach his own life lessons and his character. God doesn't call us to relationship with himself to put us to work. No, no, no, no, no. God calls us to his work in order to have a relationship. So God doesn't need you and I to participate in the world. God wants you and I to participate in the world because he wants to do life with you. And so while we can reach that neighbor alone, he says, I don't want to reach them alone. I want to reach them with you. Come on, son, daughter, let's go. I can still put them in the hospital, baby, stud, alone. You know what? I'd rather do it with you. Let's go together. And we know as we go, we're going to die because we're in God and heart and spirit. because of this life passion, that you confirm that truth, that image, through the image of Jesus, right? That's why we become black. So, this is a quick synodized, we're doing the ability to make a difference. She's indwelling spirit, and doing the final response, blessing the universe, and we experience this joy. Then, chapter 15, we're all about bearing fruit. She's a part of bearing fruit. And at the end of that section, a verse is in verse 11, He says, "The reason that I accept the reason is that I put them, is that my joy would be a new and my good bread would be made for." And this is what the time that the seven years sent out two by two by two to minister. They all return, and when they return, verse 17 says that they return, and one year it would, because you say to the God-based experience is a little joy. I was here with you. A number of years ago, I had the opportunity. I had been invited over to Hawaii to be involved in the ministry over there. Somebody has to go after the only of the...
