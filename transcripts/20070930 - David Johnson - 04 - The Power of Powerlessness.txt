For words of grace and truth and full of life, all born of your spirit, I pray. And I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. As most of you know for the last several weeks, in an effort to better understand the teachings of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount, which we've begun to wade into over the last several weeks, to dig as deeply as his teaching actually goes. We've been taking what amounts to as a crash course in the teaching style of Jesus. The teaching style, we've discovered, involves the extensive use of, among other things, great reversal themes, where Jesus changes the order of things, thereby giving voice to the upside-down realities of the kingdom of God, where the first will be last and the last will be first. It sounds so weird, but over and over again are these themes of Jesus spinning things to kind of knock us off center, thereby bringing us into these places where real change can take place. But it wasn't just Jesus who utilized this technique. Many of the gospel writers did it. And it wasn't just because it was kind of a cool teaching technique. It's because this reversal theme was so central to the gospel of the kingdom. For instance, Luke in Luke chapter 3 says this, that in the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius as Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea and Herod was Tetrarch of Galilee and his brother Philip was Tetrarch of the region of Ituria and Trachonitis and Lysanias was Tetrarch of Abilene, not Texas. That was a joke. Sorry. It's bad when you have to tell them it's a joke. In the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, The word of the Lord came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness. Now, it's not real obvious, but that is a reversal theme. Here's how you spot it. Because it's hard to spot. It subtly kind of snuck it in there by noting that in verse 1, Luke is identifying all the rulers and all the powers of all the kingdoms in this world. Political, religious, economic. But the word of the Lord did not come to them. It didn't come to Caesar. It didn't come to Pilate. It didn't come to Herod's sons or the chief priests. It didn't come to all the people who have all the power and all the status and all the money in the kingdoms of this world. Instead, and this is on purpose, he's writing it this way, the word of the Lord came to an untitled, unwashed, rag-wearing, locust-eating hermit in the desert, which means, among other things, that in the kingdom of God the order of things is reversed because now who counts and who doesn't, who makes a difference and who doesn't, who's successful and who isn't, who has power and who doesn't, gets all turned upside down, which is at least part of why Mary sang the way she sang. We looked at it last week in Luke chapter 1, verse 46, when she sang, my soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God, my Savior. Why? Because he's reversed the order of things, because God is regard for the humble, and nobody else does. But he scatters the proud. He brings down rulers from their thrones. He exalts the humble. He fills the hungry with good things but sends away the rich empty-handed. In other words, again, he's reversing the order of things which is what we see in the very first beatitude we began to speak about last week. Matthew 5, verse 3. Blessed are the poor in spirit. A reversal theme, if there ever was one, because what Jesus is saying in that verse and in many of the Beatitudes as well, among other things, is this, that life in God's kingdom is not what you think. Indeed, it will not come to and it will not flow through who you think. Blessed are the poor in spirit. And if you've not yet figured out what poor in spirit even means, The message that's designed to jar you is that it's coming to people that you wouldn't expect. Blessed are those who in their poverty, we talked last week that there's more than one way to be poor. You can be economically poor, but spiritually and emotionally poor as well. Blessed are those who in their poverty recognize their need for a provider, for a redeemer, savior, purifier, empowerer. They are the ones who get a provider, a redeemer, a savior, an empowerer, primarily because they're the ones who know they need one. But as I tried to explain when I closed the sermon last week, there is a cyclical dynamic to these kingdom reversal teams that I want us to catch where the first will be last and the last will be first, such that poverty of spirit actually gives birth not to more poverty. Really want to get this today. But indeed, true poverty of spirit will give birth to, ironically, and this is the cyclical part of it, a strength of spirit. Poverty of spirit will give birth to actually a vibrancy of spirit, a richness of spirit that is ironically, cyclically rooted in beggarly dependence. resulting in strength because the first will be last and the last will be first and round and round you go. It's just so weird. All of which is why what I want to talk about this morning is what we will call the power of powerlessness because the first will be last but powerlessness gives yield to power, so the last will be first. I want to talk about how weakness is the new strength, and I want to do it by doing three things. First of all, I want to do it by telling a story. Second, I want to do it by asking a question, and third, by remembering a pattern. Let's start with the story. It's a familiar one found in Matthew 18, wherein the disciples are asking Jesus a question. It's a question that on the surface is a legitimate question, innocent question, a question that you would think that disciples would ask their teacher. Matthew 18, verse 1, here's the question. Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And again, on the surface, looks like a good question. If what you're actually asking is, what does greatness look like in the kingdom of heaven? Because I really don't know what it looks like, and you're the teacher, so kind of give me the scoop on this thing? How does it manifest? How do we know when we're looking at it? But that's not really what they wanted to know. Because in Mark chapter 9, which is a parallel passage to Matthew 5, which means in Mark 9, you're hearing the same story, but Mark is adding some things that Matthew didn't, and Matthew had a few little things that Mark didn't. But in Mark 9 verse 34, it indicates that when they asked this question, they had already been discussing, indeed they were arguing amongst themselves which one of them was actually the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, which means that they didn't just want Jesus to answer their question. What they were wanting him to do was settle an argument. So the picture you need to have here is not of students like Jesus Talmudim. This is what they were his students. They were his Talmudim coming to the great rabbi, But they're not curious about and wanting to know what greatness in the kingdom really looks like, how it manifested, how it was measured, how it was defined. They already had an opinion about that. A very strong one, actually, I suppose. They were arguing amongst themselves about who was the greatest. So tell us, Lord, which one of us is right, which one of us is wrong, which one of us is winning? Where do we stand? How do we rank? which one of us then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And, oh, Lord, we're so submissive too. We just said, because we will submit to your answer. We will accept your answer. So that's how humble we are in asking this question, which one of us is the greatest. Some, I'm sure, thought it was Peter. I'm pretty sure Peter thought it was Peter. You know, in Matthew 10, and there would be a reason. I think maybe it is Peter. Matthew 10, verse 12, Peter is called by Jesus the first of the disciples. And the first wasn't just, you know, numerical. The Greek word there is protos, and it speaks to rank. He is first in rank. So Peter was clearly a leader, flamboyant, a decisive up front. He's the one who got out of the boat when Jesus said, come. He's the one who walked on water. No one else did that. So surely he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, or at least people like Peter. But here's the deal. There's an argument going on. So whatever people are saying in this little group of 12, they're not all agreeing that it's Peter. See, others might have noted in watching Peter that while he did walk on water and that was great, he also sank like a stone. Whatever else this guy is, he's inconsistent. I think it's John who is the greatest in the kingdom of having the disciple of Jesus love, the disciple of love, who in his epistle said over and over, my little children, love one another because the greatest of these is love and love is all you need. So on and on you go. Surely he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, but as wonderful and clearly sensual as love is to life in the kingdom of God, sometimes, how many of you know that sometimes real loving people have a hard time kind of pulling the trigger when the trigger needs to be pulled? That really loving people, sometimes when hard decisions are needing to be made, they kind of turn to much, let's have a hug. No, we need to decide. Maybe, you know, sometimes loving doesn't get much done. What we really need is passion. So I think the greatest in the kingdom is James. But the problem with passion is that sometimes people with passion run other people over. So I think it's Andrew who quietly, consistently, behind the scenes, just kept bringing people to Jesus. Surely he is the greatest in the kingdom. And some of you maybe even have an idea of who he is. So tell us, Lord, is it the up-fronter? Or is it the behind-the-scenes-er? Is it the miracle worker, the prophecy giver, the signs and wonders worker, the doctrine defender, the do-gooder. I think it's the Baptists, actually. But, you know, it can't be them, because though they got the Bible, and they're big on the Bible, they don't have much power. It's got to be the Charismatics, but they're so weird. It's probably the Catholics. No, it's the Methodists, the evangelists, the social activists. So tell us, Lord. Which one of us is right? Which one of us is wrong? Which one of us is winning? Which one of us then is the greatest in the kingdom? And answering them, verse 2, he called the child to himself. I love this. I mean, you've been with us, some of you have, for this series, and you know that Jesus' whole method of teaching was to disturb their way of thinking. And if anything would have disturbed their way of thinking relative to the answer they're looking for around greatness, calling a child and saying, there you go, would have disturbed them. Called the child to himself. Greek word here for child is interesting because it helps us get a picture of kind of what the child looked like. It's paideon, which means the child was somewhere between four and six years old. So in your mind, kind of think about a kid in kindergarten, little girl, little boy, kindergarten age. And he sets him or her before them saying, there. There you go. You want greatness? You want to talk about greatness? We're going to talk about greatness today in the kingdom of heaven. Take a look. There it is. And the reason I want you to look at this child is because of this. Because in this child, this child are all the necessary ingredients for greatness and power in the kingdom of God. And the other thing I want you to dial into, you guys, I love you so much, but right now, whatever those characteristics of greatness and power are, you don't have them. In fact, for you to even begin to understand and enter into what greatness in the kingdom actually is and how its power is accessed and then released, two things would actually have to happen to you first that haven't happened yet. Look at the verse again, verse 3. First of all, you'd have to be converted. I mean, you know, I don't think they heard that the way some of us would hear it. Because if you have to be converted, which means, wait a minute, I'm going to hell? You'd have to be converted. It simply means you would have to turn. You would have to change direction. Because your understanding of greatness and power is bringing you in entirely the wrong direction. So you would have to convert to a different way of looking at the world. And then you would have to become something different than you are. You'd have to become like this child. And if you don't become like this child, you won't even enter the kingdom of heaven. You won't enter the kingdom of heaven, which does not mean you won't even go to heaven. He's not answering that question. He's not saying you're not even in the kingdom. What he's saying is there. If you don't become like this child, if you don't turn and change the way you're looking at the whole world, in the kingdom of God in particular, you will never enter into, and you will never experience the reality of God's kingdom relative to greatness. You will never, ever taste it. The word become is significant. You need to become like this child. It's a word that speaks to transformation. It speaks to becoming a different kind of person. thought about that a little bit because when we talk about transformation and we talk about it a lot around here I don't know about you but generally when I think about transformation I think of something that when I'm transformed brings me to a better place a bigger place, a greater place you've been transformed into something bigger, better, greater don't you kind of think like that? like going from a caterpillar to a butterfly like going from an ugly duckling to a beautiful swan that's transformation and that's kind of how I look at it. So how many of you know that becoming like a child would not be considered by these disciples a promotion? See, it's not the direction I think they thought transformation would bring them. And I don't think it's the direction most of us think transformation will bring us, because I think they thought transformation would bring them this way, ascent. Jesus puts a child in front of them, and by virtue of what a child is relative to greatness and power, he is saying, before you go this way, you've got to go this way. He is inviting them on a journey that they're not going to take right away, because they're going to resist this, on a journey of descent. The fact is, most of us don't want that journey. Most of us aren't excited about that journey. And wouldn't go to a seminar by Jesus, you know, if it was about greatness and power in the kingdom, and he showed us a child, and that was the video we saw. I like going to the ones, I mean, I remember going to a men's conference not long ago, and it was good in many levels, and it was about stirring up your heart, but they showed us videos of Maximus, and it was like, men, you are Maximus. And Jesus would say, no, you're not. And put a child, and it would pick, irritate everybody. Woo. It would irritate everybody. Oh, it would bore them like me. I don't want to hear about a child. I want to be told a Maximus. Because I like a scent. I don't like the scent. But Jesus sets a child before them or whatever else a child is, whatever other qualities a child has that speaks to the reality of God's kingdom, the two things the disciples are looking for, and this is where the child picture dials in, you've got to keep dialing into what the disciples are looking for and arguing about greatness and power. Those are not things you find in a child. So maybe, I'm one of the disciples, I'm thinking, you know, Jesus, maybe you didn't understand our question. You know, because we didn't ask you, Jesus, who then is the cutest in the kingdom of heaven? Because I've got to tell you, if we'd asked Jesus who is the cutest, and you would have put the child, we'd have gone, you are the rabbi. You are so wise and you're the greatest rabbi. Because you know what? You're right. That kid is cute. We all agree that's the cutest. We don't want to know. We want to know who's the greatest in the kingdom. So I think if you're a disciple, you'd be confused about this answer. Because if there's anything that jumps out at me about being a child relative to greatness and power, it's that this child is above all powerless. Helpless. Actually quite needy and dependent. If you leave them alone, they're terrified. If you leave them in the middle of a forest and walk away, they die. Which may be when the disciples went from not getting his answer to not liking his answer. Because when I look at children and consider them in the context of kingdom life, like most of you, I can get all warm and gooey. I mean, in fact, that's kind of what happens when Jesus put a child and goes, you have this and that? I should be more like that. I love kids. And now that I'm a grandpa, it's even more. I mean, I wish I had a picture like Al does, I mean, of my little grandson. And he smiles every time he sees me. And I know because he's dialed into me big time. I'm going to be his favorite anyway. Little kids, I'm moved by them like you. I'm moved by them. I value them. I believe that we can learn things from them. But let me just, you know, this is, you know, share time. I don't want to be one. I don't want to become a child. Why? Why? Well, being as honest as I know how to be with this, here's why. Because whatever they are on the positive side, carefree, trusting, open, transparent, believing, which are all good things, and I would want to be those things. On the negative side, they're small. And I don't want to be small. Vulnerable? I really don't want to be vulnerable. Needy? Dependent? Powerless? I hate that stuff. Indeed, when I was a child, like this cute little guy, when I was a child, I desperately wanted to grow out of that stuff, to get over that stuff. In fact, it was kind of what I thought it would be like when I grew up. I won't be needy anymore. I won't be vulnerable anymore. I hope I'll be this sweet little guy still, but I hate this neediness. thing. Indeed, I wonder if I could share with you a secret desire of mine. Actually, for some time, it was an expectation of mine, but it was one of those expectations that I think all of us have, that you're not really aware you have this expectation until the expectation isn't met, and then you kind of come up all indignant and confused. The kind of unconscious expectation I had relative to the process of my transformation as a person and even our maturity as a church was that I and that we would maybe come to a point where as we grew in the Lord and as we just kind of got seasoned and entered into maturity, we would come to this place where we were no longer vulnerable, needy, dependent, where we'd no longer be as confused as we were like when we were 30, going, I have no idea what I'm doing, No, God, by 54, I want to be over that. And kind of go, I am 54, I kind of know. So we could kind of have this thing, you know, have this vision. It's like this wonderful dream that, Lord, we could maybe do everything we do in my personal life, even in our church, everything we do, promise God it will be for God. But we won't need God. We'll talk about that, but we won't need God. I love to love God. I do. I love to love God. I get all misty-eyed during the worship. I love that when that happens, and I don't mind obeying God. It's right. It's good. It's the best. It's just, I just don't like needing God. And God, it's nothing personal. I just don't like needing anything. Anybody with me on that? See, it's weird. A couple weeks ago when we celebrated our fifth anniversary here in the building one of the things I did in prepping for that was I went back and looked at some of my sermons what I was preaching around that time, just kind of dialed back into what we were talking about and what we were thinking and I also pulled out some of my journals in that time and kind of what I was going through and what I was thinking, what I was wrestling with and saw something there written in surprising detail that I think fits here. It was my journal entry the day after our farewell service at Robinsdale High School. I don't know if you remember that, but we had been at Earl Brown for quite a while, kind of had lost our space at RHS, but we got a chance, just one service, you remember this, to go back to RHS, and we just celebrated, and we just remembered, we remembered just the workings of God among us, and we kind of retold the story of our journey, and we were, as we always are, real honest about all the wonderful things God did and all the horrible things that happened as well, all the competencies we had and all the incompetencies that were, you know, It was just so obvious to all of us. And I remember in the third service, and I was just kind of reflecting on this in my journal the very next day, that in the third service, I was just kind of reflecting on how we had come to where we were. And just in a few weeks, we were going to move into this building, and it was going to be a whole new day, and all this hope was around it. It was as if the Spirit of God whispered in my ear these words, Dave, you did most of your ministry life here, along with all the people here and your elders and your friends. You did this together in desperate dependence on me. And you didn't always like it because you felt weak and needy and stupid. But it resulted in some real power. I mean, you made mistakes all over the place, but it resulted in some real power. But here's the deal, Dave. And again, this is kind of leaving the old thing and we'll come to the new thing. I felt like he whispered in my ear, here's the deal, Dave. You're gonna have to do the rest of your life here in this church the very same way. And then I wrote in my journal these words, to God, I hate that. Because I hate feeling weak. I hate being needy and feeling powerless, but here's the deal. Here's what I know and believe, regardless of what I sometimes feel and even fight with. The power in the kingdom of God is perfected in weakness. For when I am weak, then I am dependent. By the way, the virtue isn't weakness. The virtue is that out of weakness you would become dependent. Because some people get weak and they just go, Oh, shut up. That isn't it. That isn't poverty. The virtue of weakness is that your weakness, your awareness of your deficiencies. I almost made up a new word. Your awareness of your deficiencies make you dependent. When I am weak, then I am dependent. And when I am dependent, then I'm strong. So when they asked him about greatness in the kingdom, he showed them a child because he's reversing the order of things, all of which raises a question, point number two. Where does that kind of dependence come from? How is it formed in the human heart? Well, the text, Matthew 18, verse 4 says, here's how it happens, disciples. Humble yourselves, therefore, and become like this child. But here's the truth about that. We don't always know how to do that. Humble ourselves. The disciples didn't. I mean, it's just funny because Jesus, the great rabbi, the wonder teacher that we would all love to be, you know, under listening to, and puts the child before them and tells him about greatness in the kingdom. And two chapters later, this has happened in Matthew 18, Matthew 20, they're arguing with him about the same thing. In fact, James and John got their mother involved. Remember, the mother came and said, Jesus, would you put my sons at your right and your They'll have to give them, make them. Oh, gee, they still don't get it. So they didn't know how to humble themselves. So the next best thing to learning this is failure. Because if you don't know how to humble yourself, you know what will humble you? Failure. Enter, my favorite, Peter. Matthew 26, again, a story you're familiar with. Jesus is preparing his disciples for his suffering and death, and he's preparing them for what's going to happen to them when he suffers and dies by warning them in Matthew 26, verse 31, that something's going to happen to them that they can't prevent. In fact, it comes in the form of a prophecy. That's why those words are in capital letters. It's the Zechariah. He's quoting Zechariah. And what he's saying is this, that when I go down, when I get crucified, you are all going to fall away. And it's not even any shame. It's just going to happen. When the shepherd goes down, the sheep don't know what to do, so what they do is scatter. Peter's response to that prophecy, to that, what was designed, I think, by Jesus to be kind of a comfort, like there's nothing you can do about this. You are going to be afraid, and you are going to scatter. Peter's response is, not me. Everyone else might act the way sheep act when they lose their shepherd. Everyone else might be bewildered, lost, and afraid, but I'm no ordinary sheep. See, Lord, what you're forgetting about me is this, that my priorities are straight, my commitment is secure, my word is, my bond, I won't be weak. I can do this. I have the right stuff. Indeed, he might as well have said, I'm rich, increased with goods, and in need of nothing, because I can do this. To which Jesus says in verse 34, essentially this. You're right. Peter, you're not going to be scattered. All the others will. Like frightened lost little sheep huddled in the upper room. But not you. You won't be. You know why? Because you're going to be shattered. Indeed, verse 34, Jesus says these words familiar to most of us, actually, this very night before the cock crows, Peter. You're going to deny me three times. You're going to do something that you can't even in your wildest dreams, especially with all your I can do it stuff, can picture yourself. You will deny you ever knew me three times. In other words, Peter, you're going to hit the wall. In fact, you're going to hit the wall going 100 miles an hour. And what I mean by that is you're going to hit the wall just at the time that you are full of I can, I will, I won't. Want to get a picture of that? Move in your mind to Matthew 26, verse 56. And you'll just see him full of, I can do it, stuff. Matthew 26, 56, what's happened is Jesus has been arrested. He has not yet been crucified. The betrayal of Judas has happened. And in Matthew 26, 56, what Jesus said would happen has happened. The disciples have all scattered and fled, but not Peter. Next verse, oh boy, he's still got it. He's still got it. He follows Jesus and the people who arrested him into the courtyard of the high priest. And all the others have left, but he's in the high priest's courtyard saying, in effect, I don't know if he was saying this, but somewhere in him he's going, see, she told you, told you, here I am. Nobody else did it. I'm still here. And you know what's going to happen in the next couple of verses. A little servant girl comes, you know him, I don't know him three times, bam, he just collapses. you're going to hit the wall Peter you know why you're going to hit the wall other than because of your choices your own choices here's why you're going to hit the wall because I really love you Peter and I'd really like to be able to use you though right now that's not a guaranteed deal I mean it doesn't mean I don't love you but I'm not sure the way you are now I'm not sure we're going to be able to use you and I'd love to see you I really would love to see you enter into what real greatness in the kingdom is. But for any of that to happen, Peter, you're going to have to get more than a sermon about this. Because this I can, I will, I won't that looks real godly to you, this self-sufficient spirit, even to do things for God, has got to go. because the truth, Peter, is this. As capable, energetic, and committed as you are right now, and I don't know anybody more capable, energetic, and committed than Peter, you are not in yourself. Big enough? You're pretty big, but you're not big enough. Smart enough, strong enough, committed enough, and I don't know anybody more committed than you, but you're not committed enough to do the supernatural work of God's kingdom. Because nobody is. But when you hit the wall of your monumental failure, a failure that at first will convince you that you're done, a failure that at first will convince you what it sometimes convinces us when we hit the wall like this, that we are forever disqualified, but it is a failure that in fact might be able to teach you what you may not have been able to learn any other way. Indeed, just dial into this thing. I've kind of alluded to this already. That hearing the Sermon on the Mount, which they all heard, the disciples all heard, probably more than once, the essence of it, more than once in the three years they had been with him, but the sermon kind of got unfolded in Matthew 5. Didn't do it for them or Peter. It didn't teach him this. See, Peter didn't become poor in spirit or discover the power of powerlessness in Matthew 5 sitting on a hill listening to a talk any more than you will listening to this one. But when he hit the wall, it was monumental failure. when he did what he swore he would never do, when he broke his vow, betrayed his friend, tasted his depravity, and saw his sin that he didn't think was there. He knew. Not up here in his head. It wasn't because he took notes and got the answer right. He knew, maybe for the first time, how it felt to be poor in spirit, to weep and mourn, to be hungry for righteousness that by himself he couldn't produce, to be dependent like a child, which ironically made him ready to hear the Great Commission. Remember the Great Commission, Matthew 28. This is after this scene of his failures in Matthew 26. Then Jesus is crucified, but then he rises again, spends 40 days with the disciples, and Jesus gives the Great Commission to these guys, but get the picture. I don't have time to develop this a lot. But by the time the disciples had been with Jesus, the resurrected Jesus, for these 40 days before he's ascended, they were probably never more sure of Christ's power than them, than right then. If for no other reason than they were looking at the resurrected Christ. They'd seen him die, they saw him alive. So never were they more convinced of his power. But just given the recent events of their own denial and their own scattering and weakness and failure, they were probably never more convinced of their own inability to crank this out. And to people like that, he said, now you're ready to go to the world from a position of utter dependence on my power, not yours. Now go. It's the power of powerlessness because weakness is the new strength. Paul said it this way, 2 Corinthians 12, verse 10. my paraphrase, this is precisely why I am content with weaknesses. I hate weaknesses, but I'm going to tell you why I'm content with them. With insults, distresses, persecutions, and difficulties for Christ's sake, because when I am weak, then I am dependent like a child. And when I am dependent, then I am strong, which simply means Paul knew what I'm talking about. Paul knew the power of powerlessness and how weakness is new strength. But ironically, the real pattern, and this is the third and final point here, the pattern for this reversal of things isn't found in Peter's failure. Peter's failure isn't the pattern. Though failure is sometimes how we access this, you got to just know there's a better way. Though sometimes the failure thing is necessary. No, the pattern that has set in motion this great reverse of power being born of powerlessness is revealed wonderfully in Christ himself. Although he existed in the form of God, Philippians chapter 2, dial in to that. And if you just dial in to the first and last stuff, he existed in the form of God. He was first. Did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but he emptied himself last, becoming by this emptying of himself, in the use of the metaphor poor, taking on the form of a bondservant and being made in the likeness of men, he humbled himself. Because he failed. He chose a path. He humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death, even death on the cross, death on the cross, obedience to the point of death, all of which looks pretty weak. Dying on a cross is the picture of powerlessness. But God, next verse, has reversed the order of things because he highly exalted him and bestowed on him, that is Jesus, the name. The name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. To the glory of the Father, beloved, we have a God who has reversed the order of things and he did it by showing us how. To the glory of the Father, amen. Amen. Amen. We call him Rabbi. We call him Savior and Redeemer. His name is Jesus, who says to us, among other things, this. People of God, don't just admire me. Don't even look at that verse and clap, although I'm glad we clapped, to affirm an amen. but don't just admire me and cheer for me and sing songs about me. I want you to what? Follow me. Thereby becoming just like me. And so the rabbi says, come, follow me into this way of living. Maybe this following thing begins when we humble ourselves like a child. Don't know how to humble yourself? I know. I don't either sometimes. But you will when you fail. You ever fail? Have you ever failed to the degree where you wondered if you could ever recover? funny thing it's the poor in spirit who for whatever reason know they can't save themselves purify themselves who know their only hope is God and from that desperate dependence like a child powerlessness comes the strangest kind of power. It's called kingdom power. Because our God has reversed the order of things. Would you pray with me as we close? Just be quiet with God for a moment. I think a word like this can land in just a whole variety of ways. But I just need to tell you, the person that my heart is moving toward most today is that person who is intensely aware of their poverty. Like to the point where you're pretty sure you can't recover. Father, I just pray for that person, for those people who are so in tune with their poverty of spirits that they don't even have the energy yet to move into dependence. It just feels like death. So I pray for gifts of your grace. I pray for gifts of your grace to come. I pray for the power of your spirit to manifest. I pray for the reality of your gospel message to come clear in ways that the mind can't figure out but the soul of the man and the woman can embrace and find in their hope. Holy Spirit, come. And find among us the poor in spirit who are ready to translate that into a whole new kind of power and life and vibrance of spirit. full of hope and God-like energy that's rooted in begging dependence. The God who made them. Father, I pray that this cycle of kingdom truth, these great reversals, would continue to be our experience, that we would understand them and know them and recognize where we are in them. There are some among us who are full of themselves, and they're good people. In the course of a day, I think there's times I'm just kind of all full of me, and then the first, we just humble ourselves. Lord, so I just pray for a spirit of humility. Just as simple as that. It doesn't always have to be failure. Lord, I pray for a spirit of humility. Holy Spirit, come. You're so sure of yourself. Oh, God. and in the letting go of how sure you are you're the last but in the least God exalts you it's just the strangest thing God thank you for your ministry among us ministry that we can see and feel ministry we can't because you move in ways that we won't even notice it was you for a week or three or whatever continue. Church is over now. Continue the work of your spirit among us in Jesus' name. And all God's people said, amen.
