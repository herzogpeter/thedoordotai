The issue we're dealing with in this course is spiritual abuse, not a funny topic. One of the things I want to set up in the beginning of the class is that I have two assumptions as I go into this material. The first assumption that I have is that everybody in this room has at one time or another been a victim of spiritual abuse, myself included. The other assumption that I have as I go into this class is that everybody in this class has been a perpetrator of spiritual abuse. at some time, myself included. That we have been victimized and have been victimizers of the perpetrators of the very issues we're going to be dealing with here. And what that does with this material is give it a kind of tension that I'm not used to and we may not be used to. And I remember when I originally taught this course on Sunday, just Sunday after Sunday, it took a few weeks for me to pick up what this tension was. And the tension was that most of us stood in need of both healing as it relates to spiritual abuse and repentance. That was a weird place to be. You know, it's like you're used to either needing repentance or needing healing. And on most every one of these things, we needed both at the same time. That we saw ways in which this had been done to us and had wounded us in ways that we had done it and wounded other people. So I think that's an important thing to know as we go in. And I think it would be good with that in mind to pray as we start. Okay, let's pray. Father, I believe this to be a topic that is very close to your heart. It's something you care about. It's something that, especially near the end of the Gospels, we see you standing and fighting about in visible, verbal ways. And Father, I pray that as we move into this material, that you would, by your Spirit, use it to heal. use it to build, use it also to make us aware of ways in which we are perpetrating the very things that we really don't like, don't want to do. So I pray for the work of grace to be released among us as we deal with some painful things. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. First thing I want to do is, as it relates to this issue of spiritual abuse, establish the fact that the issue of spiritual abuse is not a new problem. There is a sense of history to it. I think that's important. Though the term spiritual abuse may be somewhat new to you, and it might even sound like a bit of a buzzword to you, like the latest psychological thing, it is not, in terms of its reality and presence, a new thing at all. Moses battled with this issue with people he had to deal with in Egypt. Jeremiah confronted the problem in Judah. Ezekiel identified false spiritual leaders as, I quote, Foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and see nothing. Jude spoke of deluded dreamers. Peter identified people like this as wells without water. Interesting imagery, wells without water. Titus called them empty talkers. Paul in Galatia spoke of preachers of the gospel who aren't preaching the gospel. In Philippians, he called spiritually abusive perpetrators dogs. I would never do that. He called them dogs, evil workers, wolves that devour the prey. in this chapter, that is Matthew 23, which is the text that we're going to be using for this entire course, Jesus himself has various and sundry names for abusive systems and false spiritual leaders, among them whited walls, vipers. His favorite term is simply this, hypocrites. Now, as we go through this, one of the truly disconcerting, unsettling pieces in all of this information is going to be that these empty talkers, these deluded dreamers, are hard to spot. And the reason they're hard to spot is they come to us in the form of sincerity. They come to us in the guise of safety. They come to us in the form of spirituality. And the reason is they are the leaders, at least the ones that Jesus is going to deal with. They are the priests. They are the rabbis. They are the pastors, the elders, the chairman of the board. They are the spokesmen for God, as it were. They are the representatives of God in our mind's eye. And therefore, when we approach people like that, we expect something other than an empty well, a deluded dreamer, an empty talker. When you pull all that together, the fact that there is some mystery to who is real and who is not, it generates some things. Among them, fear. It also generates questions. A question you might already have, as I've even talked about the tension of not knowing what you always have, the question being, how do we know? How can we tell? Who can we trust? What about you? What about me? What about Church of the Open Door? How do we know that we can give ourselves to that? And if you've come from an abusive system, one of the things that you're going to have a very hard time with when you go to another system is, how can I trust him? You know, the other woman or the other man that I was with when I first met him sounded wonderful, sounded great. And so you'll spend a significant period of time kind of poking. You ever do that when you, maybe you've done that here. Maybe you're doing it now. Kind of just going, I wonder if there, you know, like that, in your mind. You know, you just kind of poke it around to see. You might even feel guilty about doing that. And what I want to tell you is I think that's a fair question to ask. What about you? I think that's a fair question to ask. What about open door? I think that's a fair question to ask. More than I think it's a fair question to ask, I think, in fact, it's an important question to ask. I think you ought to ask that question. I think you need to ask that question. It's a necessary question. But the key in asking that question is knowing them what to look for. See, I don't think any of you want to move into cynicism in all. So we're just going to untrust anybody. They're all a bunch of him. What do we look for? How do we know? And that's why I think I've got some good news for you. You see, we aren't left clueless. Although, when it comes to this issue, I think most of the time we feel clueless because most of the time when we find out that we've been dealing with a well without water, it comes as an absolute shock. I couldn't believe it. The truth is, when we see some of the things Jesus is going to talk about, we'll be able to go off a checklist and say, I saw that, I saw that, I saw that. If I'd known about that, I would have seen it sooner. I would have seen it sooner. I would have seen it sooner. Because we aren't left clueless. There are signs to look for. They are observable. They are objective. They are not hidden. They are things that when we see them will make things clear. Jesus in his final speech, this is Matthew 23, to a public arena just before he died, gave at least five marks of a false spiritual leader. Five indicators of what a well without water looks like, an empty talker, one who is following his own spirit and not the spirit of the Lord. The first mark of a false spiritual leader is that he will have a false basis of authority. Write it down if you take a note. It's a false basis of authority will mark a false spiritual leader. Let's look at the verse. Verse 1, first of all, setting the context. Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples. Just to set the scene, he is in the courtyard of the temple. There was a multitude of people around. Also the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the scribes are there as well. He has just come off a blistering debate with them where they have brought to him three questions designed to embarrass and discredit Jesus. Jesus turned all three questions back on them. They are finally quiet. Now he's talking to the multitude with them kind of as exhibit A. Here's the first thing he says. The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses. They've seated themselves in the chair of Moses. What he's saying there, and I'll explain it in a minute, is they have a false basis of authority. Let me get at this thing by asking you a question. Well, no, it's not a question. I want to enter you into something. Let's say something. Because I'm the pastor, that's why. Okay, don't even have an angry face. Because I'm the pastor, that's why. What I want from you is some visceral responses to that. Give me some gut level responses to what I just said. Anger. What else? So you feel small. I think that statement is designed to make you feel small. Anger. right it sounds like a parent to a child makes you feel small what else condescended upon what i have to say or what i think doesn't matter what else a fear and intimidation absolutely what else it would make me rebellious okay right now for many okay okay see i think that would be a good response i think a response like that you're not now you'd get beat up if you had that response because I can even think of some verses I can beat you up with. Well, then earlier submitted them. I'm going to talk about that verse. Not today, necessarily. But I could beat you up with some verses about that. But the truth is, that would be a healthy response to not be abused. But if you buy it, the fear response, the intimidation response, I think that word is given to get you to shut up. What else? What else? What visceral responses? What else? Unqualified. Unqualified. You're unqualified. The person... Okay, what else? Guilt for even questioning you. Yeah, yeah. You know, like, okay. Okay, what else? Manipulated. Right. Yeah, okay. Make you feel real stupid as if I didn't know who you were. Of course you're the pastor. I hear that. Anything else? Because you're the pastor? That's not a good enough reason. That's a healthy response, I think. What else? Controlled. You feel controlled. In an abusive system, that line's going to work. it'll shut you up it'll make you feel small and I think it is designed to make you feel small it's designed to shut you up let me explain what the Pharisees were doing here the chair of Moses first of all was not a literal chair it was something that spoke of the seat of authority it's like at a university when they have a chair of a philosophy department the chair of the philosophy department is not a real chair there's no chair saying philosophy the chair of the philosophy department is the person who sits in the seat of authority over the philosophy department okay so it's not It's just a place of authority, of leadership. It is a position of authority. The key in this verse that reveals to us that something's wrong is this. They have seated themselves in the chair of Moses. They have seated themselves in this place of authority. Who gave them the authority? They gave themselves the authority. Now the real key is this, for the Pharisees and the scribes was this. That the basis of the authority that they gave to themselves was their position. I am a Pharisee. I am a scribe. I am a pastor. I am an elder. I am the chairman of the board. Therefore, on the basis of the fact that I am the Pharisee, scribe, pastor, elder, chairman, I am the authority. I just want to tell you my opinion. My opinion is this, that that is a false basis of authority. Think about it this way. If I'm the pastor and my basis of authority and my criteria for my authority is simply that I'm a pastor, that's a great deal. It's a great deal for me. Why? Do whatever you want. No accountability. But here's the real subtle thing. If the basis of my authority is just that I'm the pastor because that's the rank I hold or the Pharisee or the scribe or whatever, I don't have to be right. I don't have to be right. I just have to be the pastor. I don't have to be real. I don't have to know God. I don't have to be discerning. I don't have to hear the voice of God. I don't have to know the word. All I have to do is have the office. It's a great deal. I love this job You don't have to be wise You don't have to be directed by You don't have to be mature You just have to be the pastor And because I'm the pastor I seat myself in the chair of Moses Because I'm the elder Because I'm the Pharisee Because I'm the scribe I seat myself in the chair of Moses I believe that that is a false basis of authority I believe that if you have a false basis of authority Here's what I believe It will be abusive I want to say it stronger than that I promise you It will be abusive And I think that when you see it You should run Do not pass gold do not collect a hundred dollars go what this mentality reminds me of is the mindless and the maddening attitudes that we discovered some years ago when we did a real extensive study of the roles of women in the church now some of you were here when i did that initial study and in our foundations course generally it's been the last course we do but one of the things we discovered was that in israel the criteria for leadership and authority in israel that's in the temple but in Israel in general, the criteria for leadership in Israel was based on three things. Number one, you had to be Jewish. Number two, you had to be old. And number three, you had to be what? Male. You had to be male. So, if you were wise, mature, godly, good, spirit-directed in some sense, in tune with God, but you were a young Gentile woman, you didn't have authority. You could have been right. You could have heard from God. It didn't matter. You weren't old, Jewish, or male. so you were disqualified you didn't have authority conversely as i said with the pastor piece if you were old jewish and male didn't matter if you were really right didn't matter if you knew god didn't matter if you had wisdom or maturity that stuff didn't matter you were old jewish and male therefore you had what authority was automatic what you say goes why because you're old jewish and male because you're a pharisee because you're scribe because you're a pastor x2 came along said some weird things blew the whole thing up x2 the infusion of the new covenant comes with the fulfillment of the prophet joel this is what you've just seen what was spoken of through the prophet joel that it shall be in the last days and now from this day on we're in the last days then i'm going to pour forth my spirit on all mankind your sons and your daughters shall prophesy so folks it's not just the boys it's the girls and your young men shall see vision and your old men shall dream dreams not just your old but your young men and your old even upon my bond slaves both men and women i will pour forth my spirit in those days the new covenant came along and changed the order of things said basically this the basis of authority is no longer going to be race it's going to be all mankind it's no longer going to be gentile it's going to be men and women it's not going to be age it's going to be young and old it's not going to be rank just because you're the pastor. The basis of authority in the new covenant is going to be the spirit in you. It's going to be maturity. It's going to be wisdom, holiness, knowledge of God, the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Now, one little piece on this. I would like to think that people who hold the office of pastor and elder have those qualities. Hopefully, the reason our men and women are elders in our church, the men and women we have as pastors in our church are in those positions because the Spirit of God is in them. They are mature. They have wisdom. There is holiness. They have a knowledge of God. And there is an anointing of the Spirit upon them. But just because they hold the office doesn't mean they have authority. If there's any authority, it's because those other qualities are there, not because they have the office. A false basis of authority is an authority that is presumed solely on the basis of my office because I'm the scribe. That's why. Because I'm the pastor. That's why. Not a good enough reason. I'll give you some examples of this. I think these are good examples, help you kind of filter through the stuff. Start with Moses. Moses had authority. Would you all agree? Moses had authority. See, by the way, while I'm blowing up this false authority, there could be a tendency to think, well, authority of any kind is bad. I'm not saying that at all. Moses had authority. Genuine authority is a good thing. In fact, Moses' authority was the authority everybody else was trying to presume for themselves. So we'll start with him. I'm going to say something that on the surface, might sound a little bit scary. What I'm going to say is this. Even his authority, as authoritative as he was, wasn't his. I'm going to say something that might scare you. I don't think that because Moses said it, made it true. I think Moses' authority came from the fact that Moses accurately, clearly, and truthfully told the people what God really told him without changing it and goofing it up. He honestly told the people what God told him. And the authority that Moses had was in the truth that he told. It wasn't in him. And as long as Moses spoke the truth, he had authority because the authority was out here. The authority was in the truth that he spoke. Not in him. His authority was not because he was Moses. It was because he was right. His authority was not because he was Moses. It was because he spoke the truth. It was because he was a humble servant who did what God told him to do. I don't think we have authority because we're the scribe, the Pharisee, the alder, the pastor. If we want authority, we're going to have to tell the truth. If we want authority, we're going to have to make sense. What a concept. If we have authority, we're going to have to be wise, know God, and say accurately what he says. You don't just get authority because you're big. You don't just get authority because you're loud. Timothy. I'll give you another example. Now, Timothy's a good example because he was a guy who was struggling with authority. He wasn't getting much respect. Now, some of the scenario for Timothy's problem was that he was in a church that some would number right around 3,000. He was a pastor of a church of the church in Ephesus. right around 3,000 people, and he followed the Apostle Paul as the pastor. Now, that would be a hard thing to do. I wouldn't want to follow Paul. He's a real force of personality, a real strength in his presence. And Timothy, my word for Timothy is he's kind of timid Timmy. He didn't have the same kind of presence that Paul did, and he was kind of getting run over, and there was a tremendously subtle Pharisee running through the Ephesian church, and Timothy was really having a hard time hanging on. It's real apparent that he wrote a letter to Paul. they were friends in fact there was a discipleship relationship between the two i think you're aware of that the letters of first and second timothy were personal letters written by paul to timothy to help him in his ministry the biggest problem timothy had again was this whole issue of authority what's interesting to me was what paul told him about how you get authority and what's most interesting is what he didn't tell him there's nowhere in first and second timothy where i hear paul saying timothy just tell him you're the pastor get all big and blustery do that and tell Let me read the pastor. No, he said things like this. Here, Timothy, here's the deal. Here's the deal, Timothy. 2 Timothy 2.15. Here's what I want you to do. Study to show yourself approved into God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. Here's the deal, Timothy. Rightly divide the word of truth. When you rightly divide the word of truth, you'll have authority. Why? Because the authority will be in the truth. So just start doing that. Don't even start trying to have authority. Just start trying to rightly divide the word of truth. Start speaking the truth. Get back to the scriptures. Tell the truth. That's where your authority will be. Don't get big. He's telling the truth. 2 Timothy 3, 14 and 17. Here's the deal, Timothy. It's kind of scary. Evil men, imposters, will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. So, Timothy, it's not going to get any better. Okay? Here's what I want you to do. You, however, verse 14, continue in the things that you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. Here's what I want you to remember, Timothy, Scripture is inspired by God. It's profitable for teaching, reproof, correction, for training in righteousness that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work. Timothy, there's where your authority base is. Give people the word, tell them the truth, people will respond to the truth. Don't get big and blustery on the passages, tell them the truth. The authority is there. 1 Timothy 4, same thing basically, until I come give attention to the public reading of scripture to exhortation and teaching don't neglect the spiritual gift within you which is bestowed upon you through prophetic utterance with a laying out of hands take pains with these things be absorbed with them so that your progress may be evident to all give public attention to the reading of scripture tell the truth the fact is timothy the basis of your authority is not that you're pastor tim you have no authority in you in you there's none in the truth there's authority tell the truth find out what the truth is tell the truth tell something else that might sound a little scary at first i don't think paul had authority because he was paul now what's scary about that is that two thousand years later my posture towards paul here is my posture towards paul whatever paul said in my view is authoritative i take it as from the spirit of god that's how i take it but i don't think that because paul said it it was authoritative in fact paul said that that's why i feel like i'm on fairly safe ground when i say that paul said that In Galatians chapter 1, verse 8, he says this. Here's the deal. I want to warn you guys about something. If even we, or an angel from heaven, should come and preach to you a gospel that's contrary to the one that I've already preached to you, that was the gospel of grace, let him be accursed. What I'm saying is this. If I come to you and say to you something that's different than what I said to you before, let me be accursed, because I say it doesn't make it true. Paul said that. What does that mean? That means the authority wasn't because he was Paul. It was because he told the truth. As long as I tell the truth, I'll have authority. But it'll be in the truth, not in me. Get it? It's real important. My favorite one of this is Jesus. People heard Jesus speak. You could probably do the verses as well as I could or better. And they marveled because Jesus spoke as one having what? Authority. Because he spoke not as the scribes and Pharisees spoke. Question. What was the basis of his authority? Now, you know the answer already. But really, plug it into the text here. The basis of the Pharisees' authority was that they had the office. I'm the Pharisee. I'm the scribe. That's ironic because they had the office. Jesus had no office. Jesus had none of the accoutrements of power. None of them. He didn't have the Ph.D. He didn't have the long flowing robes. He didn't hold the office. He didn't have the title. He didn't have the position. What did he do? He just said true things. He said true things. When he said true things, everybody noticed. He's got authority. They marveled because he spoke with such authority because he's told the truth. Where was the authority? It was in the truth. It came from him, but it was in the truth. That's what they noticed. Let me just be a pastor and respond to this as me for a minute. Ironically, while that might sound like, if this was a room full of pastors, if you were a room full of pastors and I was giving this to you, it might sound like I was going like that. The truth is, as a pastor, that is a real liberating thing. for me. You know why? Because if I think authority is in the position, because I'm the pastor, that's, you know what it means? I can never be wrong. It's like I can never be wrong. Authority means you obey me, and I can't ever be wrong, and if I have an understanding that authority isn't automatic for me, what it means is that sometimes I'm going to be wrong, and I'm going to say I'm wrong when I'm wrong, and when you can never be wrong, you know what ends up happening? you end up defending things that even you know are stupid first indicator first spot first way to spot an empty talker a well without water is you're dealing with the false bases of authority if you begin to pick a hint of that up don't automatically assume that's the bottom line but watch for that false bases of authority presumed authority because i'm the pastor that's why false bases of authority jesus doesn't stop there in fact he's just getting warmed up verse three second mark of a false teacher is this therefore all that they do all that they tell you do and observe but do not according to their deeds for they say things and do not do them therefore all that you tell you do and observe that's a little bit confusing and i don't have time to develop that as much as i'd like to but basically what i believe he's dealing with here is this you know even false teachers use scripture from time to time and to the degree that they're telling the truth to the degree that they're using scripture i don't want you to throw the whole thing out and this is not like a magic want automatically you would do this uh but but it's almost like i think one of the responses to spiritual abuse is that that we not only toss out the abuser but people and this is one of the the tragedies of spiritual abuse is that if you know people who've been spiritually abused sometimes the result is they throw the whole thing out they throw everything out christianity god jesus it's all a bunch of hooey the things that are true do not observe but here's what i want you to do don't by their hypocrisy do not according to the deeds for they say things but do not do them that's the second mark of a false leader they say but do not do the easiest way to say that is they they have a double life i don't think any of us will ever be able to forget the images i know i won't of jimmy swagger some years ago on the television calling jim baker cancer on the body of christ remember that for his sin and then just a few weeks or months after that big thing on nightline um the expose and jimmy swagger himself was coming out that he was involved in some of the same kinds of things um at the time that his particular double life reality was being exposed he was doing a series in his church on rahab the harlot and at the same time he was going to a harlot it's a double life there was kind of a period of time a few years ago where the church in general seemed to be consistently being rocked by a series of scandals some of them were on tv but some of them that were even and maybe personally more damaging to some of us were the ones a little closer to home where where we would find out about some local pastor that we loved and knew and trusted found out that that there was a double life it was it wasn't a slip it was it was something for years going on serious things like pedophilia and homosexuality and adultery and on and on and and we're left coming up with things like that uh with questions how where does a double life come from well we're a double lie where's a double life get generated saying but not doing i don't know if this is an easy one to open up or not but i wanted to open it up any of you have any anything any insight on what do you think what do you think i know you've thought of this i know you've thought of this you know the double life where do you think it comes from the soil of it okay they've set themselves up for a fall. Standards are too high. I'm going to get back to that. I think that's a pretty significant thing. I'll explain some more things about that. Didn't weed your own garden. Trying to do it in your own strength, absolutely. Having good motives in the beginning. Forgetting about the basics. Presumption. Sure. That's a good thing. I think sometimes lacking confidence, insecure, don't believe in it in our heart, but one way to maybe make it sound like I really believe it is to say, really big. I had a friend, I had a friend call those friendly demons. We have, we have friendly demons, meaning he was a guy who was disclosing, a pastor friend of mine, who was just saying, you know, one of the hardest things for me was, was dealing with the demons that I like. Yeah. So that's one. Okay. Take heed when you think you stand, lest you fall. They, They become unaware, sloppy in some way. Yeah. Okay, becoming judgmental about other people. You're into the same thing, yeah. Right. You lose focus, okay. They start living at the fruit, and I think their pride starts to come in. I think there's a demonic spirit that would come. Warfare would come because they're a leader in the church. Their hearts are good, but a demonic spirit would come and begin to deceive them. This is you. This is you. They really begin to believe they did it. Right. Not the spirit because of themselves. So pride comes in and they fall. Okay. What would really make sense about that is if they really begin to believe they're doing it, the first thing that would leave if they began to think they were doing it would be a desperate sense of dependence. They'd be gone. If they really thought they were doing it, there wouldn't be dependence. And that's why Paul ultimately was thankful for the thorn in his flesh because it made him consistently feel his own flesh weakness. And he said, I glory in my weakness because when I'm weak, I'm absolutely dependent. I'm real. I'm constantly aware I can't do this. And when I know I can't do it, I'm dependent. When I'm dependent, I'm strong. And that's where power came from. So I think that is a key. Somewhere along the line, maybe they had enough success, born of the spirit success, and then began to think they were cranking it out. No garden friends, fear of failure. I'm trying to do this for the camera. I don't know how to get all this stuff. But, yeah. One of the things I wanted to talk about, I think, yeah, I know we go crazy on that, but I think there is an ability that all of us have to delude ourselves. We get seared in our conscience, and there is a delusion that happens. And they, you know, I've asked the same thing. How do you get up and preach? I mean, Jeff and I have talked about, you know, if we have a fight with our wife on the way to church or that, I mean, it just messes me up. I'm on the phone between services. You know, good for me, but, you know. But I think somewhere along the line there comes a delusion, and maybe that is even a demonically induced delusion. Keep it up, keep it going. That's no big deal. Yeah. I think that's a huge piece. That performance-based issue, and meeting people's needs and meeting people's needs, and people who go into ministry. There are personality profiles. And an awful lot of people going to ministry are going in to get their needs met, even from the ministry they're doing. And give, give, give, give, give, and never know how to take care of themselves in a healthy spiritual way. And there are vacuums. And instead of getting their life from God, start getting them from things that they would be preaching against. Yeah. Just a few more here. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Sure. Yeah. that really triggers something for me if you're a pastor and you're part of a system but at the same time you're perpetuating a system that the pastor is the authority again maybe even coming out of this false basis of authority but not only do i perpetrate that but as a young pastor that's been given to me that's been given to me you are the pastor you are the one who knows you can never be wrong i might not even have a sense that i'm always right but i'm being even pressured by the system even by people you know you have to be right and um there's this atmosphere that i'm even part of perpetrating that says the pastor can't be wrong, where does he go when he is wrong? Where does he go? Who does he tell? Especially if you've been part of perpetrating that system. And so there's a real trap. There's a real trap. It's why grace is so incredibly important. There has to be a graceful environment because there's no way I'm telling you what's really in here unless I know there's grace. There's no way you're ever going to know me unless there's grace. No way. It's when I started believing in grace, and when you started believing in grace, that what was on the inside was able to come out because nothing can destroy me now. Because there's grace. So I don't have to hide anymore. Let me give you some things that I think about why double life happens. And I'll just add it to the things you said because I think there was tremendous insight here. Helpful to me. Now, when I say this, I want to also say that an awful lot of people have said an awful lot about this who know more than I do and so I don't think what I'm about to say is the final word at all but it's something I can add okay I think one reason double lives happen is that that we get trapped and this probably applies as much to all of us as to pastors but I'm going to kind of focus in on leadership I don't believe that people who get into double lives set out to do it I think we probably all agree with that you know I don't think anybody went into the ministry going i have decided to have a ministry that is riddled with lies and deceit and fakery and i'm going to hide my sin in fact in all probability i think these people and i have in my mind's eye jimmy swagger and i and i'm not i'm not doing that to pick on him at all my heart goes out to him but i i see him weeping when he confessed i believe him that he was absolutely remorseful about that I believe that. So what I put into the hopper here is that not only did they not set out in their ministries to be hypocrites, the sin that's kind of dominating them, they despise it. They hate it. In fact, if I were to kind of play out this scenario I've kind of developed in my mind, not only do they despise it, they've despised it since their youth. And sometimes the things that plague them have been with them since their youth. They've been aware of it since then. And they've wanted to get rid of it since then because they love God and they've been in the church and they really do love God. But here's the deal. And this is coming out of my experience in the church. All too often, with those things that plague, what I'll call those besetting sins, those fortresses of the enemy, those lusts of the flesh, if you will, whatever. All too often in the evangelical church, the only method I've ever been given, we've ever been given to deal with those things that plague us is this. Crank down the lid on those things and tie it down really tight and just don't do it. And so every time those things start moving in us, you know, every time they start moving in us, we just... No! No! No! Just keep... Pull down the lid. Pull down the lid. Cap it. Really crank down hard. And the way we crank down hard in the church is we come with a lot of external constraints, lots of injunctions, lots of edicts, lots of prohibitions, lots of thou shalt not, thinking that all of those external pressures will keep the lid on. Because that's how we deal with our sin. We just put the lid on, and if it starts squeaking out, we put the lid on tighter. I've kind of been aware of that all my life. You know, a 13-year-old boy, you've got stuff going on inside you. How do you deal with that? Just don't do it. Okay, okay? Doesn't go away, doesn't go away, doesn't go away. but you love God and you don't want to do that stuff and you don't even want that stuff moving in you how am I going to keep this lid on I know going to the ministry I'm not joking I'm not joking I know it's funny you can laugh going to the ministry first time this this kind of dawned on me that this was a a thing to do it wasn't in the ministry context I was a psych major in college and I remember doing some internships at Hennepin County and I think at that time it was the eighth floor was the floor where all the stuff was happening and every once in a while we'd go into someone's home who had to be committed and they kind of went off the wall and were unmanageable and we had to go into their apartment and clean out their apartment we got the dirty job and we went in there and i was always amazed not every time but i remember one time in particular that we cleaned out this apartment and it was full of psychology books and and um and the person had in in fact a master's in psychology and the reason this person was doing all the psychology stuff and going into counseling was to fix herself and i thought later i don't know where i made the connection but i made the connection somewhere if the only thing we've ever given people to deal with their sin is to crank on the lid and i really don't want to sin let's we're talking about a heart that doesn't want to sin i hate to sin okay jimmy swagger tears i believe those tears but the only I've got to crank it down. If I go into the ministry and I go to seminary and I keep my nose in this thing all the time, I'll never deal with my issue, but I'll just keep it in this. And I'll, PRACTURE GUNS! PRAGRAPHY! Okay? Maybe that'll keep the lid on. But there's a problem with that. External control for sin is no control. And one day the lid will blow. And when it blows, there will be bodies everywhere. Don't all of you become teachers? Some of you have heard this illustration. I've used it in different contexts. but William Barclay did a study of the Pharisees. And he was studying different sects of Pharisees, S-E-C-T-S, sects of Pharisees. And he kind of developed pet names for all little groups. And one of the little groups was called the Bruised and Bleeding Pharisees. It's just a great group. Now the thing I love about this group is that they really, let's get to heart here, they really didn't want to sin. And the sin was they didn't want to lust. They didn't want any immorality. And so the way they decided to deal with their immorality or make sure they didn't have any impure thoughts was that we will never look at a woman. We just won't look at women. We won't look. And so when they went in public, they had capes that they would put over their head. Somebody's heard this illustration. Don't laugh yet. Okay. They would put capes over their head, and they would walk around, and they would just always look at the ground, and they would never look up, thus avoiding any kind of impurity and any kind of lust because they would never see a woman. But that was also why they were called the bruising, bleeding Pharisees because they kept walking in the walls and falling downstairs. The thing I want to catch here and kind of develop in ourselves a gentleness toward them, not a less accountability for the sin, but in people like that, what do we see? There's a desire not to do the sin. But Colossians 2, verse 20, says things like this. You need to understand that submitting yourselves to decrees such as do not handle, do not taste, Do not touch. These are matters, incredible that this is in the Bible, these are matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom and self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body. But you need to understand they are of no value against fleshly indulgence. I read verses like that, you know, and I go, where was I when those verses were being memorized? Because what that verse says is the cranking the lid down on your sin, does not work. They are of no use to flesh and indulgence. I'll say it again. If our method for dealing with our sin is to crank down the lid, one day the lid will blow. And when it does, there will be bodies everywhere. And that's a frightening thing. That's why I think grace needs to be in the atmosphere so that people can get out here what's in here. I need to spend a little bit of time anyway on, well, then how do we deal with the issue of sin? What's going on really in here? What I hear echoing in my mind's eye is Matthew 5. It's my favorite passage of scripture. I think it's the essence of the gospel when Jesus came and said, Blessed are the broken. And as I would apply that concept of brokenness, and the language of brokenness is what? I can't. I can't. Remember? That's what brokenness means. It's the first message Jesus ever preached. These are the fundamental principles of the kingdom of God. Here's how you get in the kingdom. Here's how you live in the kingdom. blessed are those who say i can't apply to this i can't keep the lid on what if we what if the people like jimmy swagger who really have a heart for god would somewhere along the line be able to say this i can't keep the lid on was able to say when he was 13 15 18 50 whatever i can't keep the lid on i can't do it blessed are the broken who realize they do not have in themselves the power to deal with this the answer is not crank it down blessed are those who mourn that's the next one blessed those who mourn remember mourning what does that mean doesn't mean walk around being sad the greek word is penthos it means literally to express out here what's going on in here blessed are those who say they can't i'm broken blessed are those who mourn meaning they start getting out here what's in here. Blessed are those who quit pretending about what's really going on in here. Blessed are those who start saying out here what's really going on in here. Blessed are those who quit screaming about pornography and deal about the pornography that's already in here. Blessed are those who say the truth about their sin and quit pretending. They get comfort. They get the kingdom. They get grace. But too often when people have mourned. And we dealt with this when we taught the Beatitudes and gotten out here, what's in here. The text says if you mourn and get out here what's really going on in here, you'll get comfort. But the problem is we haven't always had graceful atmospheres in the church. So sometimes when we've begun to mourn about what was really going on in here, about our sin, about that besetting thing, about that demon, if you will, that's, we've never had victory over one, we finally said it out loud, thinking there would be comfort and grace and maybe some healing, because you hate to sin too, you got this, what, what? Or condemnation, not comfort. And when you got condemned because you told the truth about what was going on in here, you made a vow. The vow was this, I will never tell the truth about what's in here again. And when it's in here, Satan just has a dance. He just has a party with your insides. And so we crank down the lid tighter, hope it'll stay down, hope the kids won't notice, hope my wife won't see it, dysfunction like crazy. And even if the lid never does blow so people see it, let's not call that the abundant life. Blessed are those who tell the truth about what's in here. They get grace. Let's have a graceful atmosphere so that's what they get when it starts coming out. I'm aware of the fact that this issue hits real close to home for some people. Some of you come from situations where there was a time in your life, and in fact, I remember when I originally preached this, there was a significant thing like that going on in our church where there were some people from a real painful situation. And they were very disillusioned, and there were bodies everywhere, and one of the nagging questions they had as they came out of this church where they just thought God had been blessing like crazy was that really a work of God that we were a part of? You know, and all of a sudden later we find out there was a double life and there was this false authority and we just loved God and didn't know and then we found out and we're so disillusioned. Was that a work of God? Were people saved? Really? We thought people were being saved. Were they saved? Am I saved? I don't know if you struggle with that, so I don't know if this lands in everybody, but if you come out of a system like that recognize it was false, I think it's a real natural thing to wonder about me. Am I even saved? If I was under that. Yeah, you're saved. See, here's the deal. What we need to understand, in fact, it even goes back to the false basis of authority or the basis of authority. See, if the church was growing, if people were being saved, if there was the filling of the Spirit on certain aspects of it, and if people were being healed, it wasn't because of the guy anyway. It wasn't because of the leader, the woman, or the man anyway. The life is in the gospel, people. The life is in the truth. The life is in the word. The life is in the seed. And the seed is good. And I heard a preacher say once that in the mouth of the vilest sinner, this is still the living seed. And a living seed can still produce life. So the work that God did in people's lives, even in an abusive system, is a valid work. The work that God did. Still means there needs to be a lot of healing. But the work that God did in you, in terms of redemption and even sanctification and an awareness of the Spirit, was a valid thing. The other thing that this raises, I hope is not some sort of condemnatory response, although it might raise some anger and you might need to deal with your anger. That's okay. But it's that we really need to pray for each other and we need to pray for our leadership. We need to pray for each other and we need to pray for our leadership. You need to know something about the leadership. Any church you're in, I know we have visitors and you don't all go to Open Door and some of you do and some of you don't. Wherever you are, pray for your leadership. You need to know something about the leadership. Leadership does not have some special dispensation when it comes to the common to man aspects of life. There is not some sort of, ah, it must be easier for them. It's no easier. Some would say it's harder. I don't know if it's harder or easier. There's no special grace for leaders. Same kinds of things you have to deal with. And I do sometimes think that at leadership positions there is a targeting. And maybe it's not because they're so special. It's not at all that. It's that if we can knock off the leader, we take a bunch of people with us. So maybe there is a targeting. Pray for the leaders so that genuineness would stay. Not, oh God, help him crank the lid down tight. Don't pray for that. For transparency, pray for that. For genuineness, pray for that. For mourning, pray for that. For brokenness, pray for that. Stuff like that. Pray for that. I think everybody gets disillusioned. I get disillusioned. I think it's something that we all have to deal with. And we need to support one another in those kinds of things. okay i have time for another one this one's going to get my anger up again third i'm sorry fourth verse fourth verse second third characteristic they tie up heavy loads and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves are unwilling to move them with so much as a finger here's the third characteristic of a false system they tie up heavy loads um one of the things i'd like to say in this particular characteristic is whether you understand any of the theology or the illustrations i'm going to give just just kind of go with this one a false system weighs you down just weighs you down you feel heavy and if that's what you feel just pay attention just pay attention now let me kind of get into this a little bit the picture here is one that would have conjured up some images in the mind of a jew um and the picture here is that of a guy loading up a donkey would have been a common site in the land of Palestine, the equivalent of a four-wheel drive in Palestine would have been, four-wheel drive pickup truck would have been a donkey. And the thing you use a donkey for in a pickup truck is to carry things. And they would load these donkeys up with every conceivable thing you could get. And the thing that I discovered as I was going into this research about how they loaded donkeys and tied heavy weights on the donkeys was that they would put so much of their stuff on the donkey that literally the donkey would disappear. Can you picture it? They just put pots and pans and wood and all this kind of stuff and all up on top and all the way around and with lists to the right a little bit and the donkey would go like this and then this is left you know like that and then and and on on the side is this guy with a switch you know there's nothing on him there's nothing on him and this is the picture spiritually the pharisee the leader who's putting the big load on the donkey you carry the donkey and the way we keep moving down the road is smack him in the the heinous every once in a while you better try harder you better do more on and on and carry the load or carry the load but the picture that i had in my mind's eye that was a little bit frightening was this picture of the donkey disappearing and then i applied that to spiritual contexts where we've put people under such an incredible load of guilt and religious performance but after a while the load is so big that the person disappears and we literally under this load of religious stuff i'm supposed to do to be okay while i'm getting kind of prodded in the back by this pharisee over here with the switch my identity literally is gone. I don't have any idea who I am. I'm just carrying this load. I mean, you disappear under the load of stuff you're carrying, walking down the road, listening to the right, listening to the left, getting more thrown on every once in a while, somebody else's expectation of you, and think of the evangelistic appeal of that. Well, come and follow Jesus like me. In fact, what's interesting about systems like this, evangelism is important. Evangelism is important. Please, we'll get to that. But in systems like this, evangelism, getting other people into church, making them come, bringing your friends, getting them safe is another piece of the load you've got to carry. See, that's just another thing we've thrown on the heap. We'll carry that one too. Okay, come, come. And we'll have to even coerce them to come because it's not about life that I've got to give. It's I want them to come give them some load too. if they come except I get to take some of my load off because they came, give it to them. Let me give you three examples of the load we put on people. The first is the most extreme. It's what I would call a radical works righteousness theology. Evangelicals avoid this one. And we're pretty clear on avoiding this one. Works righteousness theology says this. God is counting up your good behavior and he's counting up your bad behavior. and if your good outweighs your bad, you'll make it. The operative word there is weigh. If it outweighs your bad, good, you'll make it. The picture on that that's interesting to me is this. That in a system like this where the name of the game is good outweighing the bad, nothing ever comes along to lift the load of sin. The only hope you've got is that your good outweighs the bad. You understand? so you not only carry the weight of your sin, because that's never gone, ever. See, grace never comes to this. The only hope you've got is if you can pile up enough good to outweigh the bad. So sin never is gone. You can only come up with enough good. So even the good you carry is a weight. It's incredible. It's just very heavy. So you carry the load of all your good behavior and all your bad behavior and all your going to church and all your memorizing this and giving money here and going four times a week or five times a week or three times a day. or whatever, hoping that by carrying all this, someday, someway, somehow, you'll do enough. But there's a problem. It's never enough. It's never enough. Not only do you know it's never enough, because you can feel the weight, you're told that all the time. So you keep piling up expectations, regulations, rituals, and rules. And then maybe you'll go to another church, and they have different regulations, rules, so you add them. And the load keeps getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger. And if you ever stumble, under the weight of all that in this kind of system where carrying the load is how you make it or you grow weary, our ministry to you will not be to lift the load with grace or forgiveness or talk about brokenness and mourning. Our ministry will be to you at least either on a positive side encouraging you to try a little harder and do a little more. Try a little harder and do a little more. Be the little engine that could. Come on. So I'll be a positive pastor who's a nice guy but basically what I'm doing is kind of giving you a pep talk to what? Carry the load. Or on the other hand, I'll be a little hellfire and brimstone, come at it negatively, and shame you for not really caring, not doing enough, you're really not committed enough I thought you were, you didn't really mean it. In a false system, nothing's ever done to lift the load. Contrast that with Matthew 11. I love this, especially just the contrast. Jesus said this, Come unto me, all you who are what? weary and what? Heavy laden, just like this donkey with a load of religious performance and I will give you more to do. I will give you another rule. I will give you another expectation. I will give you another hoop to jump through. I will give you what? Rest. And all God's people said, second load we put on people is after we realize that for salvation we can't carry the load and we understand the truth of Ephesians 2.8.9 which says, For by grace you've been saved through faith and not of yourselves as a gift, not of works lest any man should boast. You can't carry the load and we take that load off for salvation. We give the load back for Christian living. We give the load back for sanctification, for holy living. We give the load back for salvation. What I mean by that is this. We hand people Jesus for their salvation. Your only hope is Jesus. You can't carry the load. No hope to carry the load. But I'll tell you what, if you want to be holy and if you want to serve, it's up to you. It's up to you. You better just do it. Crank the lid down hard and gut it out. And all of a sudden, I'm back to living the Christian life the same way I lived before I was a Christian, trying to carry the load to get to God, although now the load is off somehow for salvation. But in terms of my experience of life, it's absolutely no different. The method for holy living in a system like this, it puts the load back on for Christian living and service the method or the message is simply this if you want to be sanctified you have to try hard do more just do it it's up to you great verse for this by the way that the con or con confronts this it's a great verse for this colossians 2 6 says this says this as therefore you have received christ jesus the lord stop right there how did you receive christ jesus the lord by faith, recognizing you couldn't carry the load, for by grace you've been saved through faith. The message that liberated you when you were first redeemed was, there is grace, you can't carry the load, there is forgiveness. As you therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, my only hope is him, next words, so walk in him. You need to walk the way you came. And that was this, my only hope is him. I want to give you a real easy mark to spot a false shepherd and a true shepherd. Here's the mark of a true shepherd. The true shepherd will always point you to Jesus as your only hope. I got, here, so is it, is that complicated? No. You want to be saved? Here's your only hope. Try harder. No. Here's your only hope, Jesus. You want to be sanctified? You want to live holy? Here's your only hope. Read this, read these four things. Do these four things. No. True shepherd, here's your only hope if you really want to live holy. Your only hope is Jesus. Let's get on our knees and ask for a filling of the Spirit. You don't have a prayer to live out even what you want to live out without the power of God. You don't have a prayer. Your only hope is Jesus. Want to serve? Want to serve God? Your only hope is Jesus. You're going to have to have a filling. You're going to have to have an anointing. You're going to have to have an empowerment. Get your education. I'm not saying education is bad. But if you think that's what empowers you, it's not going to work. False system will point to you as the source for your salvation. That's an obvious one. More subtle. Evangelicals is where we get caught in this. They'll point to you for the source of sanctification. False. They'll point to you as a source of power for service. False. We're supposed to bury each other's burdens and then carry our own load. Explain that for me, please. Where does it say that? It says bury others' burdens and thus fulfill the law of Christ. Where does it say carry your own load? I don't know. Okay. Okay. I wish I had an answer for you. I've never gotten into that verse. I'll tell you what I always do with stuff like this is I always read this stuff in context and I feel awkward because I wish I had time to study this whole context to know what it means. That verse by itself is troublesome. I don't know what it means. I don't know what it means. I need to do some study around that. I can get that for you next week. okay it's a good question I don't have any fear that that verse is going to contradict the gospel I do want to know what it means I know I've dealt with that before I can look up my notes see what I did let each one examine his own work and then he will have reason for boasting in regard to himself alone and not in regard to another all I know about this question you're kind of giving me it's a good question is that it feels like so many other scriptures that on Tuesday when I'm studying this text for this week, it just sounds so, I don't have any idea what that means. It is so confusing. And when I get into it, I can make sense of it. And I'll need some time to work that through. I could give you something quick, but I don't know. My brother's a professor of Middle Eastern history and languages, and it always goes back to the translation. Some of those words, you know, don't mean exactly what it is. So like you said, you've got to study the context because the translations got so lost from Aramaic to Greek to Arabic to Hebrew to Old English, you know, that sometimes they might mean, you know, having to do with reverence and working it out personally between you and God and not telling you to bear your own burdens. You never know. I'm going to dig that up. I know I taught that. I know I did Galatians, and I know Chapter 6 was a zinger. I'll work on that, though. I'll find out about that. Let me pick up where I was. okay the point the point was we're talking about loads that we put on and and the mark of a false teacher is they tie heavy weights and don't do a thing to lift them off and the way you can spot a false teacher is that are going to point to you as the bearer of the burden not jesus jesus is the one who who is the empowerer to do that i have a question the question is this what might be the motivation for keeping a load on people any ideas about that you might have you know it's like your question. You may need some time to think that through, so I don't know what kind of response I can get right now, but what might be some motivations for keeping the load on people? Yeah. Whether they go to church or not, they want to earn what they get. And so people are asking the person in power to put loads on them because they expect to earn it. And the more they can do, the better chance they have. It's one of the reasons that the pharisaical system worked. because it pandered to their pride. Now see, if you can carry the load, there's two responses to the load carrying performance. In the book, we're writing a book on this right now, Jeff and I, and the chapter we're calling this right here is The Load, is performance-based Christianity. And one of the reasons performance-based Christianity works for some is that some people can perform. They don't even need God. They can crank out the behaviors. It's like the Marines. There's a few of them. They're proud. They're Marines, you know. they can do it and the result of cranking out the behaviors just because i'm so cotton-picked and disciplined and just quite frankly capable is self-righteousness it really makes me it feeds me my performance feeds me the other kind of person that produces however is devastated people who under the load crumble those are the ones who jesus came to and said i got rest for you if you want grace and sometimes even their shame was so powerful that they couldn't receive the grace though because of that very reason. They felt like they had to earn it. Pharisees don't get grace because they're going to earn it. Shamed, broken people sometimes don't get grace because even they feel like they have to earn it. And I won't take it. I won't take it. It's one of the real frustrations in ministry. I'm sure you've had it too when people who you just feel like are such incredible targets for God's grace because they really are messed up. And they know they're messed up. But they just push grace away like crazy for what you just said. You have to earn it. And when I can earn it, yeah yeah do you think sort of one piece on the other because if the authority person is in the lead and they want people to sort of get intimidated if you have too much stuff on top of you you're not going to say anything yes that's i think another reason that we put the load on i think a reason the reason i want was going to deal with that we put as leaders would put a load on you is control. See, if I can put a load on you of guilt or whatever, and you will accept the load, I can control you. You know why? Because you'll do anything to get rid of the load. Now, let me give you a load. God won't love you unless you teach Sunday school. God is angry with you if you don't teach Sunday school. Okay, now, some of you go, in your ear, pal. What does that mean? What does that mean? It means you didn't accept the load. You know, and he said, goodbye, you didn't accept the law, so it didn't work. So I can't control you, but you don't stay in my church. Somebody else goes, well, I love God, and I love God, and I don't want to teach Sunday school, but I love God. So they teach Sunday school. Why did they teach Sunday school? Why did they teach Sunday school? Guilt. It doesn't have anything to do with the voice of God. We aren't training people in righteousness. They're training people in righteousness as this. You have been given a brand new identity. The God who made the world lives in you. I believe the God who made the world lives in you. You know what I else think? What else I think? I've been on vacation. Well, I think the God who lives in you can talk to you. But we aren't tuned, trained to listen to the Spirit in us. So here's the deal. Listen to God. Listen to God. Listen to God. Listen to God. Just listen. He's in. No, no, no, no, no. No, He's in you. He's in you. If you're a redeemed person, the Spirit of God is in you. And I'm confident in this area of thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it. So listen to God. And some of us are so not used to that because we've been told all our life, do this, do that, and we're still looking to me or some authority figure to tell you what to do. That you're lost when we tell you that. That's okay. I'll just hang on to you while you learn to listen. And don't teach Sunday school while you're learning to listen because he didn't tell you to do that because you don't know how to listen yet. It takes time to listen. And if we have to build our church today, I'm going to put the load on you because we've got to have Sunday school teachers now right following this this is huge i think but if we if we really just want to train people in righteousness and bring the grace of god and have people moved by the spirit we might have to wait for things while things are very messy because people might stop doing all their because the only reason some people ever gave a nickel maybe you gave a lot of money to the church but the only reason you ever gave it was coming because somebody said god's gonna be real angry with you if you don't. It had nothing to do with the voice of God. It had nothing to do with obedience to God. It had a lot to do with somebody to put a load on you, and you accepted it, and you would do anything to get out from under that load, include give money, that you don't have any internal compulsion to give. Now, we're going to come along and say, take off the load, take off the load, take off the load. Don't do it to please me. Not one time. Not one time. Listen to God. And I'm confident to this very thing that he who began a good work in you will talk to you eventually. And if we don't get one performance out of you for a while, if you learn to listen to God, the God who lives in you will begin to speak. And when he does, you'll do what you need to do. You'll do. You'll give. You'll serve. You'll teach. You'll do whatever. Or you won't. Take off the load. Listen to God. I've got to add a verse here. this is a great encouragement to me when we start taking off the load and people did quit teaching science go around here oh this doesn't work you know when we brought this message to this church some of you were around here ten years ago or so this little traditional church it was so scary because the thing the machinery just about did grind to a halt that was the big fear here was a verse I took I just love this verse the one who sows to the field of the flesh will from the field of the flesh reap what the field of the flesh can give. The field of the flesh is manipulate, manipulate, no, no, no, no, do it, do it, do it, do it. But if you sow to the field of the spirit, meaning in a paraphrase for this thing here, learn to listen to God, learn to listen to God, learn to listen to God. We're not going to manipulate people. You will from that field reap what that field can give you. And that's a work of the spirit. You know what? I learned something from that little thing. If you sow in the field of the flesh, manipulation and striving, you can grow a big church in that field. With striving and manipulation of pressure, you can grow a big church. Don't get excited about that, by the way. Building big buildings doesn't take God. You want proof? Want proof that building big buildings doesn't take God? Go downtown. Go downtown. There's a lot of big buildings. God didn't have anything to do with it. So, in the field of the Spirit, it says, here's the encouragement. I want you to do it in the field of the Spirit. Verse 9, I love this. Don't lose heart in doing good. What's good? I used to think it was walking a little old lady across the street. Keep doing that! No, no, no, no. Stay in the context. Don't lose heart in doing the good thing. What's the good thing? Sowing in the field of the Spirit. Listen to God, listen to God. Look inside, look inside. I'm confident that He who began a good work in you will continue it. For in due time you'll reap if you don't grow weary. Because you know what? God is in people who are redeemed. And if you take off the load, they're going to be lost for a while and they don't want to do it and they're probably going to stop. Let them stop. Let them rest, and the God who is in them will rise up, and they will learn to walk by the Spirit. And when they learn to walk by the Spirit, they will reap from the field of the Spirit. So keep doing that. So we will. Okay. Galatians 5, when it was for freedom, the Christ that is free. Keep standing firm and don't be subject again to a yoke of slavery. Don't do it. Final load. Final load. Final load. Real quick. And the reason I'm going to do this real quick is because I'm going to develop this further later. And it's a huge piece. Yeah. Yes, that was Galatians 6, 5? 6, 5? no the flesh is 6, 8 and 9 6, 8 and 9 and for freedom that was 5, 1 the final load quickly is this and this is one that strikes close to home too it's when the shepherd uses the sheep to promote themselves and the reason that's a load is that roles get reversed. In an abusive system, roles get reversed. In a healthy system, I'll use a family system. In a healthy system, the dad and the mom are there for the kids. Right? And the dad and the mom use their strength and their size and their experience and whatever to nurture the kids. And they give things to the kids to nurture them. In an abusive family system, the kids are there to meet the needs of the parents. And so that's even where sexual abuse happens. Kids are there to meet my sexual needs, and so kids get sexually abused. They need to behave a certain way, not because it's for their good. They need to behave a certain way because that's where I get my value, and so you are there to make me okay. And that's an abusive system. That's what an abusive family system looks like. An abusive spiritual system is when the sheep are there, and your job is to make me look good, so you better be here Sunday night. Okay? See, I want you here Sunday night. It's not, okay, we don't have Sunday night service, but the one reason why you're here Sunday night is because I really care about you, and I believe we've got some life for you on Sunday night. That'd be a good reason to come, and that'd be a good reason for me to want you to come. That's an okay reason for me to want you to come. But sometimes the reason I want you to come is if we only have 50 people, I look stupid. And you're here to make me look good. That's an abusive system. And you just got a load to put on you. and the load is you're here to make me look good. And that's why I've got to come Wednesday night too and that's why I've got to give a lot of money because I have to give a report to the district office and if I give a report to the district office and we have these, she, annual meetings and I meet with other pastors, I'm going to tell them, you know, these statistics don't look good and I'm going to look bad so you better make me look good because you're here to make me look good. Roles are reversed. It's an abusive system. It's just like a family system where the roles have been turned upside down. Let me give you some scripture for this. So you don't think this is like something I made up, you know? God's a lot more upset about this than I am. Or you. 2 Peter 2.3 The way of the truth is maligned, and because of greed they make merchandise of you. See? They make merchandise of you. What does that mean? That means they're using you. They're using you to make themselves look good. Zechariah 11.16 woe to the shepherds woe to the shepherds for you don't care for the perishing you don't seek the scattered you don't heal the broken you don't sustain the one who is standing but hear this but you devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off the hooves you devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off the hooves meaning you're there to feed me I'm not here to feed you roles are reversed these are the leaders who devour widows houses This is Mark 12. Let me close with this passage in Ezekiel 34. Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and say to those shepherds, Thus says the Lord God. This is big, and I just, without comment, read it. Woe, shepherds of Israel, who have been feeding themselves. Woe, reversal. Should not the shepherds feed the flock? You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool. You slaughter the fat sheep without feeding the flock. Those who are sickly, you have not strengthened. The disease, you have not healed. The broken you have not bound up, the scattered you have not brought back, nor have you sought for the lost, but with force and severity you have dominated them. Interesting. And they were scattered for lack of a shepherd, and they became food for every beast of the field and were scattered. When I first read that, I don't know if this is accurate, but what flashed through my mind was a few years ago, the big thing was losing people to the cults, or losing people to the cults. And I thought, why? Well, maybe this is why. Maybe this is why. Maybe roles have been reversed, even in the evangelical church, Maybe there's spiritual abuse going on, and the sheep have been scattered, and they have become food for every beast of the field. Maybe that's why. One reason. My flock wandered through all the mountains and on every hillside, and my flock, my people, my people, I'm talking about, God is saying, were scattered all over the surface of the earth, and there was no one to search or seek for them. Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord. As I live, surely because my flock has become a prey, my flock has even become food for all the beasts of the field, the world has gotten them. for lack of a shepherd. And my shepherds did not search for my flock, but rather the shepherds fed themselves on the flock. Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord. I am against the shepherds. I am against the shepherds. And I shall demand my sheep from them and make them cease from feeding sheep. They're going to be taken out. So the shepherds will not feed themselves anymore, but I shall deliver my flock from their mouth that they may not eat, that they may not be food for them, that they may not be food for them. That's why Jesus said in Matthew 9, 36, seeing the multitude he felt compassion, for they were distressed and downcast like sheep without a shepherd. He was talking about a religious system that was abusive. That's what he was noticing. They don't have a shepherd. Come unto me all you who are weary and heavy laden, I'll give you rest. Contrast that picture of a shepherd with this, and this is what I close with. 1 Thessalonians 2, 5-12. Paul is speaking of himself, actually. He says, We never came with flattering speech, as you know, nor with great pretext for greed. God is witness. Nor do we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, even though as apostles of Christ we might have asserted our authority. That's interesting. But we prove to be gentle among you. As a nursing mother tenderly cares for her children, Just keep contrasting to that, to the Ezekiel thing we just read. Having thus a fond affection for you, we are well pleased to impart to you, not only the gospel, but our very lives. Phew. Hmm. I know I'm getting so mushy about this. For you recall, brethren, our labor and hardship, how working night and day, so as not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaim to you the gospel of God. That's what we did. You are witnesses, and so is God, how devoutly and uprightly and blamelessly we behave toward you believers, just as you know how we were exhorting and encouraging and imploring each one of you as a father would implore his own children, so that you might walk in the manner worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory. Incredible contrast. Just an incredible contrast. It just hits me heavy. It just feels big to me. We don't have a lot of time. I want to tell you something I think this issue is so big and I think that it's so affected us that there are going to be times in this series that we're going to need some time for ministry I think and we don't have time today and we may not do it every week but I'm going to build into this and hopefully be able to discern when's the right time just for times of ministry after some of this stuff just know that and there might even after something like this tonight be some stuff that you're going oh I need to talk to somebody about this I've seen this, I'm in this and maybe some of you can connect with a friend even tonight and dialogue a little bit and process some maybe it's not as big to you as it is to me I think this stuff is huge I think it's everywhere I see ways I've done this, you've done this I've been victimized by this you've been victimized by this and that's why again I end with what I started with we probably all stand in need of some healing on this we probably all stand in need of some repentance on this and there better be grace and there is so let's pray God I every time I do this series I'm grateful for one thing above everything and that is this this is all coming out of your word what that tells me is you really care about this and you fight for us even the scenario that this Matthew 23 is coming in is you standing up in the middle right in the middle of the religious system that was abusing people and you stood up in that system and said this cannot go on any longer and you paid with it for your with your life you paid for that with your life and I'm really grateful we are really grateful for that and I pray as we go even deeper into these things as we see things that that may be hurtful um that may be hard to see as far as things that have happened to us and even that we have done i pray that a spirit of grace would just would um come over this whole thing and that you would bring your healing and that father you would even there's another piece of this that you need to embolden some of us who may be in systems that need to stand up and speak truth like you did that there may need even to be anointing for some of us to do those kinds of things and family systems and church systems and whatever do your work among us we need your holy spirit to be very active through this series we pray that you would be on our behalf in jesus name amen okay good see you next week
