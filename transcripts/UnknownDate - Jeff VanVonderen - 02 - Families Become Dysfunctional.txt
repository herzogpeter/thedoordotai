Okay, this is the session where we talk about family systems and introduce the concepts of shame and guilt, and so I'm going to do that first. Guilt, when I talk about guilt, which probably this is one of the last times I'm going to talk about guilt while you're here, but guilt is an emotion. It's an emotional response. It's an emotion about behavior. It's about what we do. it's a feeling. It's a signal. Guilt is like a flare that goes up in the air and explodes and points us towards something that we did. So if we do a wrong behavior, we feel guilty, it's okay. Guilt is a good thing. Guilt is not a good thing if you ignore it, if you just kind of store it up. But if you pay attention to it, it can be a good learning tool. It can tell you about your behavior. So if I do a wrong thing to this person here, I feel guilty about it. It's about what I did. Then I go to him and say, here's what I did, I'm sorry, will you forgive me? And he forgives me and it's over. So the guilt has served its purpose and that incident is over. If I go to him and say, I'm sorry, will you forgive me? And he says, no, I won't, I'm going to hold a grudge forever. It's still over for me because I have done what I can do. With the behavior that you feel guilty about, you can do something about it. It's not over for him because he has to do the work of keeping track of the debt that I owe him or he thinks I owe him. And I'm not in charge of his forgiveness. I'm just in charge of my apology. So I can't control how he responds to it. And if he decides to forgive me, that's just something he gives me. Understand? But I've already done what I can do. If I broke something his, I can replace it. If I said a bunch of bad stuff about him to you, I can come and correct it. I can do something about it. But let's say I go to him and I say, here's what I did. I'm sorry. Will you forgive me? He says, yeah, I'll forgive you. And then I walk away, and it's over, right? But then it's not over because I'm beating myself up about doing it, and I'm saying, like, what is wrong with me? I'm so stupid. I can't believe I did that. That is no longer guilt anymore. That's shame. And shame is not a feeling, although I'm sure I would get some argument from people about that because we even talk about it like feeling ashamed. Don't you feel ashamed? But I don't believe that shame is a feeling. I think shame is bigger than a feeling. It's more, those of you who struggle with shame know that it's more than just a feeling. It's more of a view of or a belief about or an assessment of, or my word that I like to use is it's a mindset. It's a way of thinking about you. So guilt is about behavior. Shame is about you, which is why we say shame on you. We don't say shame on what you did. Shame on you. Have you no shame? You ought to be ashamed of yourself. So guilt is a behavior issue, and shame is about people. It's about itself. Guilt is the same kind of sense about behavior that guilt is about you. So guilt is I did a wrong thing, and shame is something's wrong with me. Guilt is what I did was bad. Shame is I'm bad. I'm a bad guy for doing that. Guilt is I made a mistake. Shame is I am the mistake. Guilt is a, or shame is a sense of being defective, inadequate. Guilt is the, I mean, shame is the opposite of those three needs that I taught you about last session. It's a sense of being not loved, unloved, unlovable, unaccepted, unacceptable, worth less. As a person, this is about you now, worth less. And I want you to notice that all of the suffixes and prefixes that kind of communicate shame have a sense of lacking about them. There's something lacking here. You are defective, inadequate, worthless, unloved, unaccepted, and pretty alone, too. Remember, our need is to know we're not alone, but you are alone. You are the only person in the history of the human race that ever had that problem. What is wrong with you? And shame is so powerful that you can communicate it without words. So, you know, obviously one of the ways to communicate shame is to say you're stupid and just say words that communicate shame. Tomorrow morning I'm going to talk about what I call a shame-based family system that communicates shame in ten ways to people, but only one of them is verbal. The other nine are more like the dynamics that happen. But, for instance, if I have a rule that says good speakers always know all the answers to all the questions, Okay, and then this guy here asks me a question that I don't know the answer to. Okay, we see if good speakers know all the answers to all the questions, and he asks a question I don't know the answer to, then that's about me. Understand? So that says something's wrong with me for not knowing the answer. So what I have to do is I have to shut up the question then. And one way I could do that would be I could say, well, that's a stupid question, but see, that's still about the question. But that might be enough, okay? He might say, I'm not asking any questions anymore. Or I could say, he asks me this question, I could say, well, you don't know that. And now what I've insinuated is that something's wrong with him for having the question in the first place. Understand this? And he might say, forget this, I'm not asking any more questions. Or I wouldn't even have to say anything. You know, he asks a question, I'll just look at you guys and go, like this. And, see, I still said that something's wrong with him for having the question. And he might decide not to ask questions to protect himself from getting shamed anymore. And so if he doesn't ask any more questions, then I've protected myself from getting shamed by shaming him. Anybody here have in your life a person that is an eyebrow raiser? They just, like, destroy you with an eyebrow? You know, like they can just ruin your morning with an eyebrow. and what they're really saying is you are really stupid. What is wrong with you? Just with a little eyebrow. Speeding tickets are really shaming. Speeding tickets are about driving behavior. Understand this? Speeding tickets are about behavior. They're about choices and deciding to go over the speed limit or about not paying attention or things like that. But when you get a speeding ticket, it doesn't feel like it's about behavior. It feels like it's about you and you're sitting in this car and there's a glass thing all around you and everybody can see you and then this person comes who's usually bigger than you and they hand you a piece of paper with a red stripe on the side of it that's like getting a sad face in kindergarten and they ask you questions to which there are no answers. Yeah, yeah. Like, yeah, like where's the fire? And you feel really small, and some people actually even get small. And there's no answer that you're going to give them that they're going to like anyway. Why are you speeding? Well, because I didn't see you, for one thing. They wouldn't like that answer. That would be the wrong answer. And then, plus, remember, you're in this glass room, right? And there's a car behind you with red lights on. And then drawing the attention of everybody who goes by to you. And then people are driving by looking at you and saying, look at that jerk. And even if they're not saying that, you think they are. And then some people actually physically get small. And they start getting little like this, which is one of the ways that people respond to shame. And you can tell sometimes when a person's heard a shaming thing because they lower their eyes. They kind of look like that because they want to not be seen. That's another concept that shame is about is a sense of being seen in a diminished way. Being seen less than a minute ago. Other people, when they experience shame, they get big. And they throw their temper. And Zsa Zsa Gabor got big when she got her speeding ticket. She just hit the cop. Remember that? But if she would have just remembered that it's about driving behavior and not about people, then you don't need to hit cops, right? And plus you don't have to get small either, and you don't have to stop asking questions, and you don't have to tiptoe around your parents and all that kind of stuff, you see. Spilled milk. I have four daughters, and we get spilled milk, and we get spilled milk four times sometimes, and sometimes you get spilled milk six times because adults spill milk too. And spilling milk is normal human behavior. But if someone spills their milk, you see, then the correct response would be, would you please get a towel and clean up the milk, which is a behavior you can do to fix the other behavior. But what happens if someone spills their milk and you go, you are so clumsy, what is wrong with you? I can't believe you did that. That's no longer about the behavior of spilling milk. That's about the person who spilled the milk for having spilled the milk because it's communicating that spilling milk is really powerful, which I don't know if you knew that, but milk is so powerful That if you spill it, you lose approval. You lose points as a person. Someone looks less of you. They have a lesser view of you. And then, of course, it's so powerful that if you keep it up straight, then people approve of you. And you can protect yourself from getting these messages that you're going to get if you spill it. And so now, instead of just learning to be capable of not spilling your milk, you end up being very careful with your milk for the wrong reason, as if milk is powerful. Another thing that's really powerful is clean plates. Clean plates are so powerful that they can absolutely destroy the self-worth of the person who made the food. So you could ruin a whole holiday for someone and their whole view of themselves as a person and as a cook. If you left something on the plate, whether you want it or not, it doesn't matter. And you leave it on the plate because if you do leave it on the plate, they're going to feel like a bad person based on that. so then they've got to get you to eat it even though you're not hungry. How many people here stop eating when you're not hungry anymore? As soon as you're not hungry anymore, you stop eating. This is very typical, maybe 5%, not very many people. Because most people don't even know when they're not hungry anymore because we weren't taught to pay attention to when we were not hungry anymore and then stop eating. We were taught to keep eating even though we weren't hungry anymore, because there were starving people in Asia. It had nothing to do with starving people in Asia. It had to do with people with poor self-esteem right in the same room. And so now the reason, actually, that there are starving people in Asia is because Americans do keep eating after they're not hungry anymore. And so even though we weren't hungry, we were told we had to keep eating. Of course, when we were hungry, like at 5 o'clock, if we came and said, could I have an apple, We said, no, you've got to wait until 5.30. Supper's at 5.30. So you couldn't eat when you were hungry, and you had to keep eating when you weren't hungry, and when you were sad, you were told you were really tired. Right? You're not sad. You're just tired. They're just really tired. And so all these things get mixed up because all of a sudden things have power that they shouldn't have. See, it should be okay for people to be sad or hungry or full or whatever, But when you attach all this heavy meaning to stuff like that, you end up scrambling around trying to feel what you should feel and not feel what you shouldn't feel and eat what you don't like because somebody's not going to be okay if you don't do that. And now the relationships that are there to help you be less tired end up making you more tired. So guilt is about behavior and shame is about who we are as a person. It's very powerful. It's very all-encompassing. It's about you. Now, I'm going to talk about shame-based systems, and the way that I'm going to do that is that during the rest of this time, I'm going to tell you what I mean when I say systems, and then tomorrow I'm going to tell you what I mean when I say shame-based systems. But I do want to give you the brief definition or kind of a handle to hang on to when I talk about shame-based systems. Shame-based systems, shame-based family system, is a family system where shame is the glue that holds it together. Shame is the underlying thing that gets people to do what they do or keeps them from doing other stuff. If it wasn't for shame, we wouldn't even go visit each other at Christmas. Like the difference between a regular Christmas visit and a shame-based Christmas visit is that a regular Christmas visit is here are these people who live, you know, halfway across the country, and you don't get to see them nearly enough, and you miss them like crazy, and now it's the greatest event in the history of the human race, so you've got an excuse, right, to finally go celebrate and party and have a great time with them, and then when you go home, you're sad, you only have that much time. The shame-based visit is that you go because if you don't go, you are going to get so many messages about what a bad son or daughter you are or bad son-in-law or daughter-in-law you are, So in order to protect yourself from getting all that indictment and condemnation and sense of being bad, to protect yourself from getting that, you go, and then you get it anyway, right? And the reason you get it anyway is because it's a shame-based system, get it? That's what it communicates, and it communicates whether you're there or whether you're not there, because that's what it communicates. It's a shame-based system. And so people go to protect themselves and end up driving home, and they end up in my office, and they say, you know what, I just came back from vacation with my family, and I feel so guilty. I felt guilty ever since I left there. The whole time I was there, I felt guilty, and now I still feel guilty. And I say, well, what did you do wrong? Remember, guilt is about behavior. What did you do wrong? And they go, what do you mean, what did I do wrong? I say, well, like, what did you do wrong? Okay, what morally wrong behavior did you do when you were there? What sins did you commit when you were there? And they go, wow, let's see. Boy, you know, I can't even think anything I did wrong. In fact, I was very careful to make sure I did everything right. Well, see, then it wasn't guilt that they were feeling. Do you understand? They were feeling like a defective visitor, right? They're feeling like they failed as a visitor. Something was wrong with them the whole time they were there, and it's hanging on them even now they're not there anymore. That's not about guilt. That's about shame. And shame is a sense about yourself. And the lie that we've been told is that not only do behaviors have the power to send shaming messages, but behaviors also have the power to erase shaming messages. And so it gets us trying to overcome our shame down here with our behavior out here, and it doesn't work. You know, how many of you have a 2-year-old? Anybody here have a 2-year-old? You ever notice about your 2-year-old that they like to build stuff? How many of you have ever had a 2-year-old? So how much money or time did you spend getting that person something to build? You know, like stack up, colored blocks and things like that. You go out to the store and spend $40 for, you know, a dollar's worth of wood with paint on it so this person can build stuff because they love to build. So they build this kind of stuff. When that tower tips over, because the truth is, They don't know about physics and all that kind of stuff. They just know they like to build, so they're building this thing. When the tower tips over, they don't say to themselves, I'm a defective tower builder. Do you understand? In fact, they just build it again. Or sometimes they knock it over on purpose because they like to see the blocks fly all over, and then they get to do it again. The connection between a tower that falls over on the outside and a defective person on the inside has to be made by somebody else who interprets that event for them to mean that. Do you understand? And so what happens is that this issue of behavior and self gets mixed up through the course of relationships instead of further clarified. My opinion is that those of us who are parents, if you can pull this off, if you can do the work of separating who people are in your family and giving them unconditionally affirming messages, yes messages to them as a person, even at the same time maybe that you're giving them very strong no messages about their behavior, you've done the biggest deal. That's the hardest. That's the biggest thing. If you pull that off, everything else is easy. Okay? But that's the hard part because we live in a culture and we go to churches and we come from families and we work for people and, you know, we listen to the radio and we see billboards and the billboards say, Well, billboards don't really say, you know, you are really jerks, okay? They don't say that, but what they do say is this car has some kind of power here to give you status, which then obviously must mean that right now you're kind of lacking status, right? Because you must have a need for status in order to buy this car to get status, or these jeans or this booze or whatever. Drink this and you'll be okay, because right now, sitting in the chair, you're not quite okay. But if you bought these jeans or drove this car or drank this liquor, then you'd be okay. And so there's a subtle message about you as a person that sells the product more than the product because there's 30 boozes out there to drink and 50 pairs of jeans that you could pick from. But if you think that that has some kind of power to make you a little more adequate or a little bit more powerful or a little bit more okay, then you buy the product. So these messages are kind of connected all the way through everything we get bombarded, with as we drive down the road or watch the TV or go home for Christmas. So that's the difference between guilt and shame. Now, I want to talk about shame-based systems, like I said. So this is the systems piece. When I talk about a system, a relationship system, what I mean is a group of interrelated, a group of interrelated, interdependent parts. and what that means is that every part of the system affects and is affected by every other part of the system. There isn't one part of the system that isn't affected by every other part of the system. So, for instance, we're meeting in a building in Robbinsdale school system. We call it a school system because all the parts of the system are related to all the other parts of the system. And if one part of the system is affected, all the other parts are affected. So if the teachers decide to all stay home next Monday, you parents who have students in the school system are going to be affected because you're going to have a bunch of kids at your house instead of at school, and maybe you're going to have to rearrange your lives for that day. And if the cooks stay home, you're going to be affected because you're going to have to make lunches. And if the bus drivers stay home, you're going to be affected because you're going to have to drive people. And if the school system asks for people to pay more taxes next year, because if they don't, the volleyball is going to disappear from the curriculum. And you say, no, we don't think that's a fair tax and it's too much and we're not going to pay it. Somebody's going to be affected. You understand? It's because it's a system. The human body is a system. We just came back from Central America last month. And just before that, some friends of ours had gone to the same place in Central America and came back, one of the guys came back with some kind of crud in his stomach, you know, like an amoeba or virus, or I don't know what it was. But I have to tell you that all of him was sick, not just his stomach. He was, like, absolutely sick, all of them. Because when you get that in your stomach, it's not just your stomach that's sick. Do you understand? All the whole parts of the system are affected. I was pounding a nail a couple years ago, like trying to put a board on the end of a board in the shape of a T, and the way you're supposed to do it, I found out through this incident, actually, is that you're supposed to put it on the ground and then hammer it onto the end of it. But I wasn't doing that. I had it balanced up on top. So I was trying to hold the board and balance it and hit the nail, and I hit my finger full swing, bam, right on the side of this pointer finger. And when I did that, my knees buckled automatically, and I had projectile tears. I don't know if you've ever seen those, but just like... You know? And things came out of my mouth spontaneously. And I did not say, oh, my finger is hurt. How shall I respond? It's like all of me was affected because every part is connected. Do you understand? The human body is a system made up actually of different systems even. Well, families and churches are systems too. And one of the verses that communicates that is a verse like in 1 Corinthians 5 where Paul talks about leaven. And what's happening in the church at Corinth is that a little leaven is leavening the lump. And so what he says is it's commonly reported, it's actually reported that immorality exists here. And immorality is such a kind that doesn't even exist among the Gentiles that someone has his father's wife. So there's like an incestuous thing going on with a stepmother or something like that. And his conclusion is that a little leaven leavens the whole lump. Now, where I grew up, the way that we were taught that leaven leaven lumps is that we were supposed to stay away from everybody who did anything negative at all because if we were with them, we would absolutely end up doing the negative thing. In other words, it wasn't even within our choice to look at this negative thing and say, no, I won't do that. It's like if we hung out with them, we were going to do it like that. So don't hang out with them. The solution then was not to build strong people on the inside, but to keep people away from everybody on the outside like that. I remember when we had a rule in our family about playing cards. We couldn't play cards. And I couldn't figure out why we couldn't play cards. So one day I asked my grandmother, why can't we play cards? And she said, because when people play cards, they end up fighting all the time. Now, see, I don't know if she had just watched too many Westerns or something. Seriously, like you're going to end up shooting each other under the table or something like that. But, okay, now you have to understand, I'm a little bitty kid here, and she's saying because you end up fighting, and even as a little kid, I thought to myself, well, why don't you just learn how to play cards without fighting? See, that would never be an option. It would be to just stay away from the negative stuff because you're going to get leavened. Well, if you applied that to Corinthians, then it would seem like Paul would be saying, well, like, here's a situation going on in a church where somebody's being sexual with his father's wife, and if you guys are all looking at this, you're going to say, well, if he can do it, I can do it too, and so pretty soon the whole church is going to be sexual with their father's wife. Well, that's not what's going to happen at Corinth. You see, leaven can leaven a lot of different ways, and probably that actually is not going to happen. But see, what was happening at Corinth was that these people were so spiritual and so loving and so forgiving that they just were ignoring this and not dealing with it. and my experience in working with families and churches where problems exist is that you will use as much energy and effort not dealing with stuff as if you just dealt with it as a matter of fact you'll end up using more energy than if you just dealt with it because if you don't deal with it you get to keep it tomorrow and do it again and keep it the next day and do it again so you are leavened either way even if you don't end up in the same behavior you got to do all kinds of effort not to see stuff and not to enter into stuff and deal with it you still are using energy up on the issue, do you understand? So you've been leavened. The leaven in Galatians 5 is legalism. And Paul is saying to the Christians there, you know, that a little leaven leavens a whole lump. Watch out for the legalists, because only a few of them can leaven the whole place. You understand? Now the reason that is, is because churches and families are systems. Paul says a little leaven leavens a whole lump. He doesn't say a little leaven might leaven the lump, or a little leaven could leaven the lump, or should. He just says it does. And the way they used to bake bread, actually, is they would have a lump of bread that wasn't leavened, dough that wasn't leavened, and they take a little piece of leavened dough that they had saved from the last bread, and they stuff it in this, and it would leaven eventually the whole lump, and then they break off a little piece of leavened dough and bake this dough, and the next time they make unleavened dough, they take this piece of leavened dough and stuff it in a lump. It leavens the whole lump. They break off a piece, save it, and so on. That's what leaven does. know it. It just does. When one member suffers, all suffer with it. Paul doesn't say when one member suffers, all might suffer. All could suffer. He says when one suffers, all suffer. There are people in the body of Christ being affected by somebody's problem over here and they don't even know that person and don't even know what the problem is. But I guarantee you that there are people over here being affected by that because it takes energy and resources to deal with stuff even if you don't deal with them. and even if you don't know that they're there. So I'm going to draw a picture of the optimum healthy family system. This would be like a five-member family system. And these lines that are going between these people are all the relationships that go in every direction. So in this healthy family system, everybody talks to everybody and everybody loves everybody and everybody communicates to everybody and everybody who has a problem comes and tells everybody. And everybody helps that person. Now, there's no such family as this family. This family does not exist. My family does not look like this family. My family looks like this once in a great while. Understand? Mostly, when one member suffers, all suffer with it. Mostly, a little leaven leavens the whole lump. So two and a half years ago, this member of the system blows out his back. That's me, which means that if my family is going to function as effectively and productively as it did before, somebody's going to have to adjust to accommodate the fact that i'm not doing anything so this system adjusts now that's a way that that's like a 1990 way of saying 11 okay it adjusts to do more so that's a functional adjustment adjusts in the way it functions people do more because someone's doing less and when people do more because someone's doing less and the efficiency of the family is maintained, and the family keeps operating at a certain level. The way it looks on paper is that this person now ends up in the center of the family system, and people are looking at that person saying, well, what can we do to help Dad, and what can we do to make it easier for him? Because, you know, the doctor told me I'm supposed to lay down for six weeks and not get up, which means if it's my job to take out the garbage, somebody else is going to have to take out the garbage. And if it's my job to walk the dog, somebody's going to have to walk the dog. And if it's my job to change the kitty litter, somebody else is going to have to change the kitty litter. So everybody's kind of revolving. And whether they like it or not, see, somebody's going to change the kitty litter eventually. It's going to happen, right? Those of you... Okay, so what happens is that all these people are doing more, which allows me to do less, which means that after six weeks, my back gets better. I get up off the bed and take back my jobs, And the family readjusts to look like this until the next thing happens. So now that's my definition of healthy family. When I say healthy family, what I mean is a family that can adjust and readjust freely. It can adjust to accommodate the problem, to deal with the problem, and then readjust until the next problem comes and it adjusts again. So let's say that instead of having a physical problem, one of these people is physically absent for a while. Now, my wife is an actress and a mime, and she does theater and things like that, and once in a while she comes to the family and she says, look, there's this play that I want to try out for, but if I get the part, it means I'm going to be gone, you know, every night a week for three months and then for every weekend for the next two months. What do you think? Now, she's not asking our permission because she doesn't have to ask our permission because we want her to do what God has built her to do, But she is saying, this is going to be work for you. Because she's going to be a non-contributing member of the system for all that time. Which means that somebody in the system is going to have to do more to accommodate the fact that she's doing less. And she's saying, where are you at with that? And then we say, yeah, we'll do that. And then she leaves. Well, what's interesting is that even though she geographically, physically is not present within the system, she still is the center of the system. You understand? The energy is still around her and toward her. And so even though physically she's not there, she's still there. And then when the play is over, she comes back. Because while she's in the play, she's over here being a contributing member of another system. And when she comes back, the system readjusts. So a healthy family system is one that can adjust and readjust. A healthy family system is not a family without problems. There's no such thing as a family without problems. There's no such thing as a church without issues. A healthy church is not an issue-less church. In fact, families can have incredible problems and still be healthy if they can adjust and readjust. I have seen families that are going through incredible struggles, awful problems, but I would still call them healthy families because they're able to adjust to deal with the issues and then they readjust when the issues are over. But let's say that instead of this being a blown-out back or somebody going out for a play. Let's say that this is an alcoholic or some other non-performing member of the system. Now, in my family system, my dad was, we did not have an alcoholic. What we had was an immature, easily offended person. Okay? And that person ended up in the middle of our family system, and then the rest of our family tiptoed around trying to make sure he had a good day. Okay? So he was in the center of our family, and our family gravitated around him. And my mother ended up doing twice as much parenting as she should have because he bailed out because he got so angry, he just left the scene every once in a while, you know, and went and locked himself in the bedroom. So he was in the middle of the family. So it doesn't have to be an alcoholic or something like that to end up in the middle of the system. Lots of different things can end you up in the middle of the system. But what happens then is that the system adjusts to accommodate the fact that this person isn't contributing. And what that does is it sets up a situation where they don't have to readjust and take back their jobs. In other words, this family system gets so good at doing the jobs of the person in the center that the person in the center doesn't have to take back their jobs. And so the family gets stuck. Another adjustment that happens is what I call a psycho-emotional adjustment, which is just a fancy way of saying that people learn to pretend. they learn to pretend people learn to pretend not to feel what they feel and they learn to pretend not to see what they see and they learn to pretend not to think what they think because if they see what they see and think what they think and feel what they feel they become the problem so they just shut up and they spend a lot of energy then talking to each other about the person in the middle but not to the person in the middle because if you talk to the person in the middle you're the problem So now these two adjustments enable this person to stay in the middle of the system. And even though everybody wishes they weren't in the middle of the system, they're actually helping them stay in the middle of the system. And this is my definition of dysfunction. A dysfunctional family system is not a family system with problems. It's a family system that's stuck. If you get so good at accommodating the presence of the person who's not performing that they don't ever have to perform, you're stuck. That's dysfunction. A dysfunctional person is not a person with incredible struggles or problems in their life. I know people who have incredible problems in their life, and they're still functional. It doesn't mean that they don't cry a lot. It doesn't mean that they don't wonder what they're going to do. It doesn't mean that they don't make lousy choices. They're not stuck, though. But what happens is that people get stuck in malfunction, let's say. You know, let's say that my back malfunctions like it did. That's a malfunction. Do you understand that? And after six weeks, I say to myself, I kind of like this deal. You know, this is kind of cool. I mean, everybody's waiting on me and doing stuff for me, and maybe I just won't even take back my jobs, and so I pretend that I'm really sick when I'm really not sick, and everybody keeps doing my jobs. We're stuck. That's a dysfunction now, not just a problem. And the family gets so good at doing my jobs that in some cases, the person does get better and wants to get their jobs back, and they can't even get their jobs back because these people are so good at doing them, they won't give them up. You know, this person goes off to treatment, you know, and so here they are over here sitting in a treatment center. Of course, they don't want to be there. They're sad, and that's terrible. and they wish they didn't have to go there, but after a while, they start to get healthy. So they're not quite sure about this yet, but this is better. They kind of are liking this and it's making sense, and then one day they're healthy, whatever that is. So here they are. If you put this person back in this family system and now they want to handle the finances. Before they gave up all handling the finances, by default, they just didn't do it or else they were so irresponsible with it that somebody else had to do it or else the family was going to go under financially, and now this person's responsible and wants to do it, and they end up with a tug-of-war with the other people who got so good at doing the job they don't want to give it up. Or parenting, you know, they defaulted on all the parenting, and so one parent had to do both of the parenting, and now this person wants to come back and be one of the parents again and have people respect them again and take them seriously again, and nobody wants to give them that job because the family got so good at doing without them that it's hard for them to get their jobs back. Usually what I see happen when you take this person and put them back in the system is one of three things. Now, I'm saying this as things I've observed, okay? Usually one of three things happens. So this isn't like three recommendations. This is just three observations. You put this person back in this system, and there's no impact made on the system. One of three things happens. And the reason that is is because families are systems. And there's a lot of gravity here in this family system. First thing that happens is this. In the original scenario, if you put a dysfunctional person into a family system, it creates a painful, uncomfortable situation. In other words, people don't know how to deal with this. And so the family adjusts to accommodate the situation to make it a little more comfortable and a little less painful, and it becomes dysfunctional. Well, if you put a recovering person in this family system, a person who's honest now, let's say. Of course, when they were at treatment, what they were told was get honest or die, okay? If you don't get honest, you're going to die. It's just that simple. And so they're going, okay, we're going to be honest. They come back here. They don't know what to do with honesty. But it creates a new painful, uncomfortable situation. And so the family starts to readjust back to being healthy again in response to this leaven because you see a little leaven leavens a whole lump. It's just not like negative leaven that leavens positive lumps. Positive leaven leavens negative lumps. But in order for this to happen, though, this person would have to be really well supported in other systems, you know, for them to be able to stay here and stay healthy because there's a lot of gravity in families, if you know what I mean. The kind of gravity... Maybe some of you have experienced gravity in a family by going to visit your family for a holiday and then as you're driving home again, you're going, why do I always act that way when I go there? I can't even believe it. I just turned into this idiot. You know, I turned into this. Well, it's because the family gravity pulls you back into that role that you had when you used to live there, okay? And there's gravity there. So this positive person is going to leaven this system. This is why, though, in Minnesota especially, but more and more across the country, Incredible counseling, in my opinion, is family systems counseling. In other words, when you see a person in counseling, you think to yourself, how can we get the system there? We want to get the system there because we don't want to just take healthy people and put them in dysfunctional systems. We want to try to make an impact on the entire system. Some places are so committed to this systems thinking that if you come as a counselor, I mean as a client, and your family won't come, we won't even take you. Which I don't agree with. I don't agree with that. What I think is do everything you can to get everybody you can and take who you get. But do everything you can to get everybody you can. Because if you put a healthy person in a dysfunctional system, there's gravity there, and they're going to have to be so well supported to stay healthy there. but it might work, okay? Because families change one person at a time. Families get healthy one person at a time. And so if one person this doesn't work for anymore and they adjust, then there's more leaven there, you see? When I was growing up, we used to have this strategy in our church about vacation Bible school. What they used to do is they used to bus little kids in from all these places, you know, out in the country for two weeks of vacation Bible school. And so what happened, the strategy was we're going to get all these kids from all these non-Christian families into vacation Bible school, and then they're all going to become Christians. We're going to save them all. Then we're going to send them back to their non-Christian families, and then all these dads and moms who are swearing and drinking and carrying on are going to look at this kid and go, Whoa, what happened to our kid? Oh, I want that too. And then they're going to all become Christians because... Which, you know, little leaven leavens the whole lump. Do you understand? And that happened with some people. But mostly, it didn't happen. Mostly, the big leaven leavened a little bitty lump. Do you understand? And the kid went back to doing what they were doing before. So the first thing that happens is that the system readjusts. But it's unlikely that this is going to happen without a lot of help. Families get dysfunctional unintentionally. They get functional intentionally. Nobody becomes dysfunctional on purpose. But people get healthy on purpose. You can get sick by accident, but you've got to get healthy on purpose. Well, the second thing that happens is that this person figures out that they can't stay here and stay healthy both at the same time. So they leave. And, of course, when that happens, everybody's all shocked. Because, see, for 20 years or 10 years, they've been trying to get this person to go get help. And they finally go get help, and they hung in with them. The whole time it was hell on earth, okay, but they hung in there. And now the person gets help, and then they get a divorce. And everybody's all surprised. Well, it's because this family didn't know how to support health, and this person figures out that I'm going to lose my health if I stay here, and being healthy is too important to me. I'm going to die if I go back to doing that kind of stuff, so they leave. And then people are shocked. And then the third thing that can happen, that I've seen happen, is that the person relapses because dysfunction is what sells here. Function doesn't sell here. So people don't know how to stay healthy, and so they go back to doing what they were doing. That's why, you know, when you send an adolescent to treatment, there's almost this brainwashing that goes on there that keeps saying, now when you go back to school, you can't hang out with your old friends. You can't hang out with your old friends. You've got to find a whole different group of friends. It's because there's gravity in relationship systems. One last thing I want to do with this is to show you that this applies to churches as well as families. Let's say that instead of this being a five-member family, let's say that this is a five-family church, or however big. So now what we have is each circle is representing five circles. Following this? So each circle is five circles now. So we've got a 25-member church, a five-family church, and so the relationships go like this. But now let's say that this teenager in this family ends up with a drug issue, And so that puts them in the center of their family, and everybody in their family is looking over there instead of over here. And they should be. And it's good that they are, and they need to deal with this. There's a crisis going on, and they need to deal with this. But what that means is now the arrows that used to be going out here are going over here, and they ought to be going over here. But see, if you used to be teaching a junior high Sunday school class, and the junior highers loved you, And see, now you've got a teenager that's having a drug problem. Then you go to the Sunday school superintendent and you say, you know, I've got to go and deal with this at home. I mean, I'm preoccupied all the time and I'm losing my family and we've got to deal with this. And so I can't be teaching this class anymore. And so then you go home, which you ought to go. Okay, so now you're over here. Well, what's going to happen then is that you're going to have a big slot to fill, right, in a junior high class. So then you come over to this guy and you say, you know, you haven't taught for two or three years. You ought to teach this class. and you go, okay, you're right, I'll teach the class. So you go teach the class, you know, but you don't care about junior hires. In fact, they drive you nuts. What you care about is missions, okay? But instead of someone coming to you and coming underneath your heart and saying, how can we turn you loose to care about missions? It doesn't matter what guys put on your heart. Come and fill this slot. And so now you've got a junior hire that's in this class with a teacher that doesn't even like junior hires and would rather be doing missions, okay? And then they're starting to hate church, and they don't even want to go anymore because they got some grumpy old guy there who needs the kids to all act a certain way so he can feel like an okay teacher. I don't know if you can see the leaven happening here, but now, see, now we got a teenager in this family over here that the rest of you don't even know about that's having a drug problem, and junior hires over here, they're being affected, and they don't even know that person. It just ripples all over the place, you see. I've seen churches where whole families have been in the center of the church, but everybody talks about them and never to them. You know, send them casseroles and stuff like that. But, you know, we don't... Because a little leaven leavens the whole lump. So, tomorrow I'm going to talk about now what's shame-based about this. Because if you add the ingredient of shame to this whole dynamic, that the message that people get from here and that is actually underneath this and generates this is shame, then what you see is not only some very describable characteristics and so for some of you you're going to get a vocabulary now to put on some of the things that you've experienced or seen but didn't know what to call and I anticipate this will be very liberating and also then that this is a very painful place to be and so people learn to survive which is great survival is great survival is good but it stinks compared to flourishing it reeks compared to the abundant life and some people are stuck surviving 20 years later and they're not even in relationships that they need to survive anymore they could even flourish but they're still using survival skills that they learn to make it through there so tomorrow we're going to untangle that so are there any questions? I told you it was going to be bad news at the front end and good news later any questions? I think I need to clarify I'm feeling some guilt over here about this little issue here Which one? About the fact that in my instance, a person went into treatment and came back and it wasn't going to work. Yeah. But yet I'm feeling guilt right now because I didn't readjust. Yeah. Or that person kept on relapsing and I think I was trying to readjust. Yeah, the issue is that you're saying that in your instance, when the person came back from getting help, then you didn't readjust and that person left or something like that. I don't know what they did. You didn't know how to deal with it? I tried to readjust, but that person kept on relapsing. But I was, in my family, meaning it was only us two, the adjustment took place, but I think it also had to take place in the other circles that were involved. Yes. So you weren't the only system that this person was a part of, and there was some gravity in some of the other systems that pulled them back toward relapse. The other thing about that is that, like I said, When this is happening, tomorrow I'm going to talk about this a lot, but when this is happening, in a shame-based system or in a dysfunctional system, there's a couple rules that kind of govern, but they're both lies. One of them is that you are powerful enough to do it well enough to make the other person okay. Then the other rule is that other people are powerful enough to do it well enough to make you okay, neither of which is true, but both of which kind of govern stuff. So what that does, though, is it gets people looking over at that other person all the time instead of at themselves. And actually, if you have a person who is needing to get help in the first place and then relapsing, they're easy to look at. I mean, they provide many opportunities for you to be looking at because there's a crisis all the time, and you have to survive the crisis by becoming kind of an emergency room diagnostician and trying to figure out how do you respond to this latest crisis. And then you don't take care of yourself because you've got to survive. And all that does, though, then kind of as a ripple effect is it doesn't contribute to the health of the system. So probably you did the best you could. And probably you'd do better today. I agree. I think also I need to hear that from you, that it's not only a family system, but it's friends systems. Oh, yes. Things like that that contribute to the fact that a person can relapse. Systems are any places where relationships are such that people are affected by each other's behavior. So it could be an employment situation. It could be a friend situation. I remember when I was using chemicals myself that I had a group of people that needed me to use. Now, that doesn't make them responsible for my use, do you understand? But I knew I was in a little bit of trouble. I didn't realize about addiction, but I knew that I was having consequences that I didn't like and wanted to change my behavior. But see, if there are five people getting blasted and being inappropriate and ripping people off and stuff like that, and then one of them gets better, you've got four people that are looking pretty bad. So what happens is those four people need that other person to look like they look, and then everybody doesn't look quite so bad. So that's another dynamic that happens in systems, and that would be where the big lump leavens the little lump then. And so I've seen family systems where this person was the husband or the wife or somebody, and they go off and get help, and everybody goes off and gets help too. And they readjust the best they can to accommodate health and to get with their own issues and stop supporting on the outside what they don't agree with on the inside. But this person still has other systems like their family of origin, for instance, that are bailing them out all the time and telling them that they don't really have an issue, and the gravity of that system is stronger than the gravity of this system, and then they relapse. So that's why, as a counselor, you want to get everybody you can get, try to get everybody, and then take what you get. Yeah. Maureen. You talked about families that have stuff happen and they readjust, but what if something happens and they're not going to readjust? Like one of the people becomes disabled or something and they're never going to be able to take on their jobs. Yeah. Well, see, the thing about when someone becomes disabled or terminally ill or something like that is that when the family members adjust, they don't do it as an accidental kind of thing that they end up supporting something they don't agree with. When they adjust to a loved one's disability, they're adjusting on purpose and supporting something that they agree with. I did it just now with you. When I called on you, I called your name, okay, because if I just said, yeah, go ahead, you wouldn't know I was talking to you. But I did that because it was something, I wanted to help something happen that I agreed with, and so when people take jobs of the person who has gravitated to the middle for whatever reason because of some disability or something like that, and they pick up the responsibilities, they're helping something happen that they agree with, and they don't end up resenting that. They don't end up, you know, coming over here and talking to this person about that other stinker who's in the middle of the family, you know. They do it on purpose. They do it to help out of a heart that wants to help something happen that they agree with, and so there's a big difference with that. But this is a system that I just described here where at the same time that I'm helping the person stay in the middle, I'm over here griping about the fact that they're in the middle, you know, and wishing they weren't and trying to figure out how to get them out of there and at the same time helping them stay, you know. anybody else there was a question back here someplace okay yeah yeah yeah Yes, the question is, what if some of the members of the family get help and readjust, but some of the other members don't? And now we're not even necessarily talking about the person in the middle, right? We can even leave them out of the picture. Just talk about people around the circle. Well, if some of the people get help and the others don't, probably what results from that is that the family ends up beginning to look as disconnected as it always was anyway. Okay? Okay? So it probably doesn't, you know, it doesn't cause the problems to be there. It more like shows that they're there because these people are willing to talk about it now and start saying stuff out loud. And depending on the gravity of the system, they may end up being the problem too. So, anybody else? Yes, back there. Can you have a person in the system that can help a family for years or years or years? And that person dies. Oh, here's the situation where someone, the question is about when somebody's been in the center of the family system and then that person dies and they've been controlling it, you know, that whole time. What do you do? Well, you either end up, you know, feeling really lost because now you've got this job to do and there's nobody to do it on, or else you have to get some help to readjust. This happened in my family where when my dad died, you know, in 1982, about six months later, my mom and I kind of looked at each other and I thought, who is this person? Because my mom and I spent most of our energy about my dad and now there wasn't anybody there to spend it on and we didn't really have our own relationship. So we've been spending about 13 or 12 years almost having a from-scratch relationship with each other. Or else we could have just spent the last 12 years feeling really distant because that's how we felt. When I looked at her and realized I didn't know her, That was a very scary feeling, but all of a sudden I realized what was really there all along, which is that my mom and I didn't have a relationship about my mom and I. We had it about my dad. So there's some work to do there. Just because this person disappears doesn't mean that... In fact, that's the whole issue of surviving, is that even if the person in the middle doesn't disappear, let's say the people around the outside grow up and disappear, They take all this stuff into new relationships and end up trying to get those other relationships to receive all of their dysfunctional skills. Yeah. Let's say you have a person that's in the center, like a father, and one person decides they don't want to take this anymore, but the rest of the family is still all hooked into the shame. So you leave? Yes. or you try to be healthy, how do you deal with all the shame that they give you? Okay. Well, the question is, what if one person around the outside of the circle decides to leave because they want to get healthy and the rest of the system doesn't? So instead of the person in the middle saying, I can't stay healthy and stay here, someone on the outside says, I can't stay healthy and stay here, how do you deal with all the shame? Well, see, the issue is that you get shame either way. You get a shaming message either way. It's just that if you decide to take a stand and be healthy, now it comes out in real concrete, easily observable ways, whereas before it was more like this sense of undercurrent all the time. And so I figure if you're going to get shame either way, get shame being healthy instead of being dysfunctional. Yeah. Is it possible to have one person in the center of the system? Oh, sure. Yeah, and I'm going to talk about that tomorrow because this takes a lot of different shapes, even adjusts, like different people end up in the middle at different times. Sometimes this family system has one person, sometimes it has two for a different reason, and the way that person A responds to person B is different than the way that person A responds to person C who's in the middle, same person, different kind of role with that, and I'll talk about that tomorrow. Yeah. This is a very painful, very tiring place to be. But there's lots of hope for this, you see, because families get well one person at a time. And the good news is that you don't have to wait for your family system to get better before you can get better. A lot of people kind of put themselves on hold thinking that if this would change, I'd be okay. And you don't have to wait for that. You can become healthy right now. One more question. No more questions. Yes? How do you survive if you're the one who's sick of that mess and you want to change and you're getting abused by these other people but you cannot leave that system? Yeah. Now the question is, if you're a member of the system and you want to change but you can't leave and so you're getting all kinds of abuse and stuff from the people in the system, how do you survive? It would be the same way as if this person who's in the middle of the system goes off and gets help and then wants to come back and be a healthy person. It is possible to be a healthy person in an unhealthy system but it's not possible just by gritting your teeth and trying hard. You really need to get connected with some other systems of support that can provide some gravity for you, some support to stay healthy and some sanity checks to remind you that you're not crazy for thinking there's a problem and all that kind of stuff. Because just like that other person can't stay healthy and stay both in a dysfunctional system that won't adjust, neither can one of the people on the outside, but they need to get some support to be able to do that. They're going to pay some prices to do that, but they're paying them either way.
