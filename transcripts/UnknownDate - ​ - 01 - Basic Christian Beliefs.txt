OK. Let's go through what we're going to deal with in this course, just so you get kind of an overview. Hello. And I hate these cords. I'm bound to fall on my face before the night's over. Just so you kind of know what the course is about, you get an overview before we deal with any particular material. Am I going to make it? Okay. Introduction to Christian Theology and Overview or Basic Christian Beliefs. A class for the Training Center of the Church of the Open Door. Here's our course objectives. And for you on the tape, we are reading from a syllabus that you probably don't have, but that's your misfortune. The purpose of this class is to acquaint Christians with the basic beliefs of evangelical Christianity. We shall seek to provide the biblical foundation for each belief, to relate each belief to various heresies which have plagued the church. A heresy is like a wrong belief, an off-headed idea. And we're going to relate what the church believes against that which the church does not believe. To discuss various theological issues which surround each belief. Considering each of the foundational beliefs of Christendom, there usually are some controversies going on. And part of what I want to get at is those controversies. And then finally, to answer questions which may arise in class about the topics discussed. One of the things I want to say at the very beginning is this. This is a real foundational class. I'm presupposing nothing. And so I want you to feel totally free to ask whatever questions arise. As we're going through stuff, please feel free to ask questions. The best way to learn is to ask questions. I don't guarantee that I'll have the answer. it's good just to ask the question even if there is no answer um so there's there's no question that's that's out of bounds here because this is just foundational ask whatever comes to mind this is the time to address it everything you want to know about christian faith but had no opportunity to ask in all of this we shall be attempting to show how each of these beliefs makes a practical difference in the lives of believers our orientation is not going to be just egghead academic kind of stuff. There's information and history and stuff like that that I want to be getting at, because that's important, I think, to what getting a foundation in Christian faith is about. But I always want to be showing what kind of practical difference this stuff makes in our life. Whatever we believe, whatever evangelical Christians believe, it's a pretty useless belief if it doesn't impact our lives. In fact, all of the central doctrines of the Christian faith impact our lives in very important ways. It's not just important to believe something. It's important for a reason. You believe it because it makes a difference in your life. It's not just sort of an academic question. So that's going to be kind of our orientation throughout these six weeks. I'm not sure of the dates here. I assumed that we were meeting every Wednesday for six weeks. Is that correct? Sometimes they have a break in kind of a weird way, but I didn't know of any breaks, So I just plowed through and did six weeks. Tonight we're doing our introduction. That's what I'm doing right now. And then we're going to discuss the inspiration of Scripture, the inspiration of the Bible. And the issues that we'll touch on there is how the Bible came to be and the nature of inspiration. Next week we'll talk about the doctrine of God. And as I said, this is tentative because there may be carryover next week from this week or maybe we'll even get a little ahead of ourselves this first week. I don't know. So this is kind of fluid. But this is the order we'll deal with things. We'll deal with the doctrine of God, talking about the various attributes of God, the Trinity, why we believe in the Trinity, and then the nature of the Trinity. What difference does it make whether you believe in a Trinity or not? What possible difference in your life could that make? I think it makes a whole lot of difference. It's really, I think, a central tenet of the Christian faith. The next Wednesday on the 25th, we'll talk about the person of Jesus Christ and also the fall of humanity. We'll talk about why we believe that Jesus is fully God and fully human. And what does that mean? And isn't that kind of a strange belief? We'll talk about issues that surround that particular belief. This is a belief in the incarnation. And we'll talk about why we believe in the fallenness of humanity. Original sin. What does original sin mean? When Paul says that we all fell on Adam, what in Boulder Dash is going on there? How are we responsible for what Adam did? and kind of get at that kind of stuff. What does it mean that humanity fell? That will set up what we're going to do the next week, and that is talk about salvation. We'll talk about the atonement. What did Jesus do on the cross? Why did Jesus have to die to save us, to justify us? We'll talk about justification by grace through faith. What does it mean to be saved, and how do you know that you're saved? And can you lose that? And if you can, how do you know that you're in or that you're out? And then we'll talk about the relationship between faith and works. Are we supposed to be good deed-doers? Is that part of our salvation? What role does all these mandates in Scripture about doing this and doing that, what relationship does that have to our salvation? Does our salvation hang on that? And so we'll talk about that kind of stuff. On the ninth, we'll talk about the Christian life. we'll talk more about living out of grace what does it mean to live out of grace and i really think this is going to be a for for some of you at least can be a real freeing time to get a grip on what it is to live out of grace to live your life gracefully is an incredible freedom and liberation and joy and peace that comes when when that really starts to click in your mind and if it hasn't clicked already uh i'd like this to be an opportunity where that does click and then we'll talk about developing a devotional life how do you go about getting close to god or feeling God's presence or growing in that relationship with God? What are some disciplines that Christians have done throughout the ages that have strengthened their spiritual walk? I mean, a lot of people, in fact, all of us sometimes at least, when we pray, it seems kind of like we're talking to ourselves. It seems pretty useless, pretty senseless, pretty empty. It seems like your prayers are bouncing off the ceiling, and you wonder, what's the point of it all you don't really feel his presence and maybe you look around and you see these other christians who are on fire and they've got a lot of joy and you wonder what am i missing out on you know it doesn't seem like there's any kind of reality there well what can you do uh how do you go about you know developing a closeness with the lord and uh that's part of a basic christian belief growing in our relationship with the lord you can have a whole course on that but we're just going to deal with it for one evening on october 16th we'll deal with the doctrine of the church christ's body here on earth we'll talk about the nature of the church what is it you know is the church is the church the church of the open door or is the church uh just protestants or or what is the church uh god's body here on earth what who who comprises that we'll talk about the mission of the church what are we supposed to be doing here what's our what's our our commission all about what's the function of the church we'll talk about the gifts of the spirit to the church the lord in order for us to carry out the mission of the church gave us gifts and so we'll talk a little bit here about uh the issue that surrounds things like a word of knowledge and prophecy and a word of wisdom and speaking in tongues and healing and that sort of stuff uh and then we'll talk about the ordinances of the church i really packed a lot into that week we probably talked to all of that but uh the two main ordinance of the church as protestants understand them is a baptism and communion. And we'll talk about what those mean and the various issues that surround that. Should you baptize infants? Should you baptize adults? What does a baptism do? What difference does it make? I'm not talking loud enough. I'm not? Oh no. Really? Glory! There, how's that? Glory! Hallelujah! Alright. In the final week, it's kind of a catch-all week. In the final week, we're going to deal with end times. It's appropriate, isn't it? And I don't know much about that, really. I used to think I knew a lot about it, but now I'm just, all I know is that I don't know. But I know a couple of things, and so I'll share with you, and that can be kind of a free-for-all, because there's no really kosher standard position on end times. Do you believe in the tribulation period before the rapture, or the tribulation period after the rapture, or during the rapture? No, not during the rapture, but the rapture during the tribulation, and a millennium, and all that kind of stuff. But we'll talk a little bit about that and what difference it makes and that's what we're gonna all wrap it up I suspect that and the last week will be a lot of carry over from the previous week stuff that we didn't get to and so we'll have a wrap up and whatever yo that's what I was afraid of I mean I'm not afraid of prayer concerts but I was afraid that there's gonna be a break so the 23rd is is not the last week the 30th is? Look at that. I've been on several weeks here. I've got a PhD. One, two, three, four, five, six. Okay. Well, I guess we won't get to end times. Well, I'll tell you what, if you have a real question about that, interject it at some point. And I won't have an answer, but go ahead and interject it, just for the public speaking experience. Oh, there's nothing on the 23rd. That's really interesting. Does the next session start on the 30th, then? Well, we don't have to answer that. Okay. Well, then, as well as everything else we're going to deal with on the 16th. 30th? Okay. Do you have questions about what the course is about, what we're trying to cover? I don't know if that meets your expectations of what you want to get out of the class. I think it's pretty compatible with what we said in the brochure that was going to be covered in the class. The class is primarily intended, as I was structuring in my mind, primarily intended for new Christians or relatively new Christians, or sometimes just very confused Christians, or maybe just, this is the outside one, The Christians who just want to review the basics. Maybe think there's another, you know, it doesn't hurt to rehash the basics. But I'm really supposing nothing. In fact, I'd like to ask this question, and don't be shy. How many people here have been Christians for less than a year? Raise your hand. Do you know who's been a Christian for less than a year? Okay. Okay, we got two. How about less than two years? Okay, good. How about less than three years? Okay, so we got about eight or nine. in that category. Good. How many people-- and this is just another little Gallup poll I'm doing here. How many people have been attending the Open Door for less than a year? Raise your hand. You guys are all into the-- OK, four or five. How many have been attending for less than two years? All right, OK. I think this kind of helps me to know what we're getting at. OK, so probably some of this is going to be reviewed for some of you, but maybe it'll be a review with a twist. So let's get into it. Are there any questions about the structure the course or anything? Okay. All right, Garth. Okay. The inspiration of scripture. I can't believe I confused six and seven. I mean, I've been working with my son too long and he's having more influence on me than I'm having on him. He hates the number five. He won't say it. One, two, three, four, six. And so that's probably what's doing it. Okay. We're talking about the inspiration of scripture. Can you see that at all? Kind of? How come it so so light well I'll try to move it down like this or maybe I can hang on what's that was that yeah there's no way to turn on the front ones without turning the back ones I don't think let's see here though is that better I like this dun dun dun dun okay okay i never claimed to be sane i mean that's first conception i want to get rid of i okay let's talk about the inspiration of scripture the first thing is is the the importance of this when we talk about inspiration the word that's used a kind of key text and i encourage you to take notes on this otherwise you're probably not going to remember a lot of it they tend to go rapidly uh the word um you know if i when i look up there and i look back i it's It's kind of blurred, so if you raise your hand and I don't see it, go, hey. Okay. Oh, that's fine. Yeah. Does anyone have a pencil? Every question is legit. It's a theologically loaded question. Do I? Now, what does that verb consist of? The word inspiration, the word that's actually used in the Bible, in 1 Timothy 3.16, where it says, all scripture is given by inspiration of God, literally means God breathed. It's God breathed. We talk about, we don't talk about it a lot, but spiration, we expire when we die. But when you breathe out, isn't that called spiration or whatever? Well, inspiration means that God breathes it out. Actually, inspiration isn't a good term for it. It should just be interpreted God breathed, because inspiration makes it sound like God breathed into it. but scripture is God breathed it comes from God it communicates God's thoughts communicates God's will for our life communicates what God's about teaches us about God teaches us about what God has done it comes ultimately from the mind of God it doesn't mean it was dictated by God to some people it doesn't mean that the people who wrote it didn't use their own mind and resources and ingenuity and and abilities but it does mean that ultimately god uses the the the vehicles of the authors of scripture to his own purpose to to communicate and say just what he wants to communicate and say the reason why we deal with this doctrine first as sort of a foundational belief for uh the the christian worldview is because without this without without a belief that God has revealed himself in a special, unique way, we have no basis of knowing anything. You can know something about God by looking at the trees and the stars and the moon and the northern lights and all those kind of things. They inspire you and all that kind of stuff. And you can know that there is a God, I believe, if you have a heart to believe that. But you don't know anything about what this mastermind, this artist behind the world that made everything, you don't know what he expects from you. You don't know what his disposition is towards you. i i don't know if you've ever been an atheist or a non-believer or not um but uh uh as if you have been one as an adult maybe you've had this experience it comes out of my own experience where you look at the stars and you look at the majesty and the power that went into making up the earth and everything like that and you say there must be a god but then the question is okay there's a god who made all this but what does he want with me why am i here what's he like maybe i'm off the boat someplace maybe I'm doing stuff and and living in a way that that he doesn't like and I don't want to fall in the hands of this God who's so powerful he can make the stars it'd be a dreadful thing to fall in the hands of a God who may could make the stars and have him ticked off at you uh it'd be dreadful um and so the question is what in particular does God want from us what is he what's his relationship to us maybe we're unimportant maybe we're important who knows well that's why we need a special revelation more than just what the what the world gives us what nature gives us in the stars we need something in particular something that's tangible and understandable that tells us what the creator of the universe and what the creator of our life thinks about us what's his relationship to us what's his disposition towards us wherever you find people whether they're in the church or outside the church people who reject or even strongly qualify a belief in the inspiration of the Bible, you'll find people who basically relate to God and live for God out of their own thinking. If we don't know what God thinks about us, then it's everyone for themselves. Whatever you think is okay is okay. It's everyone's own interpretation. It's everyone's own particular subjective whim. I went to Yale Divinity School. That's where I got my master's. And Yale Divinity School, it's a great school. I liked it. I learned a lot. But it's not particularly evangelical. In fact, it's about as left-wing a seminary as you can get. Left-wing meaning liberal. And so I went there, and I was just out of this kind of a real narrow fundamentalist church that had a lot of rules and doctrines and all sorts of things. And I was a little bit intimidated going to this big liberal school, but I got a scholarship, so I couldn't turn it down. So I went. I was a little intimidated. Well, I used to be a Catholic, and there was a nun teaching a class, a class on ethics. So I thought, well, I know a little bit about Catholic nuns, and I know that she's not going to be liberal. Nuns are never liberal. So I took the class, thinking that this would be a nice safe haven for me. In one of the first classes that we had, we talked about, very openly, very explicitly, whether or not premarital and extramarital sexual relationships could be Christianized. Could they be Christianized? Could this be a God thing, something that God is in favor of, and something that the church could endorse, maybe even recommend in certain cases? Can premarital and extramarital relationships, sexual relationships, be Christianized? And they would talk, you know, well, you know, and they would talk about, you know, can it be positive? What if your wife is an invalid or your husband, you know, is impotent or whatever? And maybe then, you know, and they kind of come into the idea that, hey, if it's loving, if it's agreed upon, if there's consent, If it brings about health, then how could it possibly be wrong? And I, in my little fundamentalist brain, made the mistake of saying, well, shouldn't we maybe just out of curiosity check to see what the Bible says about it? I mean, I don't know if it does or not, but if it did, wouldn't that be kind of an interesting thing? Because these are people who are training for the ministry. These are all people who are going to be future ministers in some denomination or other. And so I said, you know, why shouldn't we look at the Bible? After all, they were quoting Luther and Calvin on certain things, like Calvin was for life, and if sexual relationships bring about more life, then Calvin must be for it. And they were kind of quoting these church fathers, and that was bothering me because I know these church fathers would never have ever endorsed this. So I said, what did Paul say about it? I mean, I remember reading something about it was better to marry than to burn, and that fornicators had no place in heaven, and that Jesus said that adultery was wrong. I mean, isn't that in there someplace or other? And the response that I got back from one lady was a very, you know, kind of a biting kind of response. She said, well, Paul said a lot of off-the-wall things. Look at his view of women. I mean, you can't base your life on a first-century Jew. That's what she said. A guy who was in a first-century Jewish culture who thought like a first-century Jew. Of course Paul thought it was adultery, but he also thought homosexuality was wrong, and who would ever agree with that? So here we are. Also, I learned the game rules. understood what was going on here it's basically this if we if we happen to like it and the bible happens to say it then the bible is authoritative and if we don't like it and the bible says it and the bible is not authoritative so basically the bible is not authoritative i mean if you have an authority that you only listen to when you when it agrees with you you're the authority it's following you not you following it so the bible is not authority and so is everyone for themselves i I mean, there's no guidelines here, because if there's ever a guideline that you disagree with, you just reject it. And it's just really bothering me. A number of times in my educational background, which was pretty much all through these liberal institutions, I felt, for a lot of different reasons, pressure on me, intellectual pressure on me, to abandon a belief in the inspiration of the Bible. It was a tough thing for me to work out. A lot of questions were there. A lot of puzzling things were there. And a number of times, I would feel like this is a belief I just can't hold to any longer. But when I do that, I look at the results of what happens when you do that. And the result is that you've got no clue on earth as to how to live, no clue on earth as to what to believe. It's every man for himself, and anything goes. So this is a centrally important doctrine. It's at the center of the Christian faith. If we don't go by the Bible, then what do we go by? Your own brain, your own feeling, your own whimsical preference. Why believe in inspiration? Why do we believe in the inspiration of the Bible anyways? I mean, we can't get into this. In Reasons to Believe, another course I teach here, we get into this a lot more. But there are a number of books on the market claiming to be inspired by God, right? I mean, you've got the Koran, you've got the Book of Mormon, you've got Bhagavad Gita, You've got the Upanishads. You've got, where are some other books on the market here? The Divine Principles of Sun, Young, Moon. There's another one. Uranthea. Anyone ever heard of the Uranthea book? That's really bizarre. But there are people pushing that one these days. Okay, yeah, they have their own little kind of, they kind of be inspired by God. You've got a lot of Elizabeth Clare Prophet. She channels Jesus. speak. What was that? Eck and Carr, they've got their own little mandates. Okay, so why the Bible? Why the Bible? We're not really going to answer that too much here, but let me just kind of give you an overview. Several reasons to believe that the Bible's inspired. The first one has to do with this, and all these kind of supplement each other. One has to do with Christian experience. It is the testimony of contemporary genuine Christians, and the testimony of Christians down through the ages that when you go to this book and your heart is open to the work of the Holy Spirit, this book explodes in your face. This book's got power. It's got life. It transforms you. It knocks you on the side of the head when that's what you need. It heals you when that's what you need. It encourages you when that's what you need. The book's an explosive book. It's a stick of dynamite. Now, there are a lot of deaf people around who don't hear it going off, but that doesn't mean that it's not going off because there's also a whole lot of people who do hear it going off. And the fact that there are colorblind people in the world doesn't mean there's not colors. And the fact that other people can read the book and not get inspired by it doesn't mean it's not inspiring because believers go to it and it explodes in their face face no one could ever convince me just on the basis of my own experience that romans 8 1 isn't inspired the thing set my life ablaze it just turned me upside down and uh and so when you have an experience like that that itself is an authenticating uh foundation for believing that the bible is inspired there's also this kind of a thing jesus says when you find a jewel in the middle of a field you buy the whole field and if you find a gem in the field isn't a parable like that yeah i know there is when you find a gem in the field you buy the whole field well it's that way in the bible if this is where you met jesus christ and this is the thing that sets your your life ablaze this is the thing that's turned you upside down and has been working a healing process in your life and has got you out of your dysfunctional thinking the tendency is to say look at i don't know about all the parts but i'm going to buy the whole thing because you know i i know what it can do for me and so there may be questions there may be problems, but I'm going to embrace the whole thing. I don't have time to sit and pick it apart to see what is inspired and what's not. So the Christian experience is clue number one. Does someone have a question? I think I saw a handbag. Did you have a question? Okay. If you do, just say, yo, Jesus' teaching is another foundational point here. And this is what I kept on coming to over and over again. It's like this, in a nutshell, and this is really abbreviated. Reasons to believe goes into a lot more depth. Doesn't it, Mark? It goes into a lot more depth. If I believe that Jesus is the Son of God, and I've got a ton of reasons for believing in that, my own experience, his miracles, his resurrection from the dead, the birth of the church, there's this incontrafutable evidence, because now I just made up one, incontrafutable evidence that he was the Son of God. Now, if he's the Son of God, if that means anything, it means he can't make blunders on fundamental mistakes. He can't make blunders at all, but especially not on fundamental things. Fundamental to Jesus' whole self-identity, fundamental to his ministry, fundamental to everything he was about was a belief that the Bible was inspired. He quotes it all the time. He understands himself in connection with the Old Testament, with fulfilling the Old Testament. He refers to it a number of times as God's Word. In fact, if you study the Gospels, he uses two phrases interchangeably. He says God says or Scripture says, and he means the same thing. If Scripture speaks, God speaks. He was referring explicitly to the Old Testament, but we also have good reasons to believe that he foresaw the inspiration of a New Testament. If you read John 14 through 16, for example, he was constantly telling his disciples that right now you don't understand everything. Everything's kind of vague to you, but the Holy Spirit's going to come on you, and he's going to lead you into all truth, and he'll cause you to remember everything I've ever told you. and then he talks about how the spirit's going to lead them to uh to be witnesses for him and that people are going to believe through them which would entail having it written down he says that the whole world eventually is going to hear of the gospel that would entail it being written down the bottom line here is this jesus is the son of god garden god incarnate he doesn't make intellectual blunders he believes in the old testament he pre-authenticates the new testament therefore our our our reasons for believing that he is the son of god are also our reasons for believing that the bible is inspired is that kind of a nutshell thing in these times that i told you about where i was kind of going through intellectual trouble and and puzzling you know how could i really believe the bible is inspired it's got so many weird things in it and what it appears to be contradictions and all that kind of stuff how can i believe it's inspired at times i would i would get to the point where i say i can't believe it any longer i know jesus is lord because of my experience and all this other stuff but i can't accept this inspiration business what would happen to me is and this happened several times is in prayer i would hear the lord say greg how can you call me lord and yet correct me on my view of the bible uh you know the phrase there's a scripture john it's in john 13 i think it is someplace like that correct me if i'm wrong where jesus says how can you call me lord lord and do not the things that i say well by the same means jesus would say to me how can you call me lord lord king of the universe god almighty and yet correct me on my view of the bible uh you know jesus your lord god almighty but you know you were kind of wrong on your view of scripture let me kind of correct you it just didn't fit and so what the lord finally got me to do first of all in seeing the implications the catastrophic implications of denying scripture but also it what he got me to see in just you know in our relationship together was this to call him lord means that you accept his teachings the bible's the word of god it means that there may be times where you don't understand it all where your mind can't reason it all reason it all out and times when it doesn't even look like the word of god but in those times you go with your relationship over your mind not that you're going to be an irrational dupe but there's times when you just have to say i don't understand but i do know this lord your lord and you don't make mistakes like that so you experience the transforming power of the scripture you also uh your reasons for believing that jesus is the son of god are also evidence for believing that the bible is inspired i don't think that you can consistently get rid of the inspiration of the bible and also hold to jesus lordship the two go hand in hand the third thing has to do with fulfilled prophecy you've probably heard this before josh mcdowell's books are good on this, evidence that demands a verdict. The Bible has a lot of spots where it has prophecies that were fulfilled later on. Pretty impressive stuff. At one point in Ezekiel, I think it's chapter 33 or right around there, Ezekiel, 500 years ahead of the event, prophesied that the city of Tyre would be destroyed. Tyre was a metropolis, a seaport, like New York City. And Ezekiel says this, Nebuchadnezzar is going to come against you, and then many other nations are going to come against you, and they're going to destroy you and they're going to lay you flat as a rock and all your debris is going to be cast into the lake and the only thing and people will they'll never rebuild this city again in fact they'll never find the city again and the only thing that the city will be known for is that it will be a place where fishermen spread their nets he had eight different prophecies with regard to the city of Tyre you look at throughout history that's a pretty pretty unlikely prophecy given the time that he prophesied around the 6th century B.C. About 40 years after the prophecy, Nebuchadnezzar comes against it, lays waste to the city. Alexander the Great comes against the city in 327, I think it was, B.C. All the people in the city of Tyre move out to an island. They had a little island there, so they fled to this island, knowing that Alexander the Great didn't possess a naval fleet. So Alexander the Great takes all of his bulldozers and presses all the debris of the city. He didn't really have bulldozers. pressed all the debris of the city into the lake in order to build a walkway out to the island to get the people on the island. So all the debris was pushed into the lake. The city of Tyre has never been rebuilt. And to this day, we don't know exactly where the city was. It's flat as a rock, but there are a couple villages around there, and they're fishing villages, and on those flat rocks, people just lay out their nets to dry. And that's the only thing that the rock is good for. So prophecies like that at least make you go, hmm, something's going on here. Maybe this is just more than a human book. All the prophecies about Christ. It's spectacular, where he's going to be born and all that kind of stuff. Really interesting stuff. In Reasons to Believe, we go into more of that. This is like one giant commercial. The unity of its message. The Bible was written over a 2,000-year period. Well, maybe 1,600 years. We're not really sure. Anyway, from 1,600 to 2,000 years. And some of the material is much older than that. And yet it's got a unity of a theme, a unity of a message. It was written in a wide variety of cultural and historical circumstances by authors who weren't related to one another, and yet there's a unity, a theme, dealing with the nature of God and God's relationship to human beings who have fallen into sin, and God's ongoing quest to redeem humanity through the nation of Israel, and the coming of a Savior, and the establishing of the church. There's a unity there that you could expect if one author wrote the book. If one author sat down and said, I want to make a great novel, here's what it's going to be, then you'd expect this kind of a thing. But when you've got some 42 different authors, I believe, 42 different authors writing in a wide variety of circumstances, and they happen to come up with this unified work, like a jigsaw puzzle just happening to fall off of an Empire State Building and landing on the ground in perfect formation, it shows the work of something else going on. It shows the work of one author. And that itself is testimony to the inspiration of the Bible. The final thing is the historical accuracy of the Bible. There are still some historical squabbles that people have with it. Archaeologists debate this point or that point. But time and time again, the Bible has shown itself to be historically voracious. It's shown itself to be true over against the critics time and time again. We're going to a lot of examples of that. Let me just give you one. They used to argue up until about 50 years ago that the Hittites, Remember the Hittites in the Old Testament? The Old Testament talks a lot about these Hittites. Vicious people, always doing no good. Very bad people. And it talks a lot about these Hittites. It describes them as having this incredible empire, and they're all over the place. But up until, I guess it was about five, six decades ago, archaeologists never could find anything about a Hittite. And they thought they excavated the area that the Hittites were supposed to live in real thoroughly, and there's no Hittites found, or no artifacts of the Hittites found. No evidence of ever being Hittites. So the conclusion was the Bible made up this mythological group of people called the Hittites. And all the stories about them are just fancy, and it's just kind of a nice little story that got passed on through the ages. The Bible has shown, proven conclusively, to be full of hogwash or some such thing. Well, what's happened in the meantime is that we have discovered a great deal about the Hittites. First of all, that they existed, that they were exactly the kind of people and exactly the geographical location that the Bible describes them. that they had the same kind of characteristics and weapons as the bible describes them and in fact now those archaeologists are much more inclined to go to the bible to find out what exactly to know what to look for in terms of their archaeology they go to the bible to find out well here's the bible says maybe we should begin to excavate and look in this area for more information about the that kind of thing has happened time and time again so even when there's a question that's held out that hasn't been proven yet i think we have good reason to trust the whole thing and say that it's and it'll prove itself true in time. Okay, questions about that? Is it all straightforward? Are you following me here? All right. Someone say amen so I know that you're alive. Say amen. All right. I'm trying to, you know, have to stare. I'm kind of like, are you getting there or not? Okay, let's talk about the nature of inspiration. Here's where we get into a little controversy. It's not really controversial, but... Okay, the nature of inspiration. What we're getting at here is this. What is it to believe the Bible is inspired? What does that entail? Does it entail that this book doesn't have any errors in it? Or does it entail that it's just sort of trustworthy on a certain point? What does this belief entail? There are really three schools of thought here, okay? And since I'm trying to show basic Christians' beliefs, I want to show you the spectrum of what Christians believe, and I'll show you where I land up on this thing and why. But here's the spectrum. There are really three views, three schools of thought. The first one is sort of the Yale view, the view that I got when I was in seminary. And that's the liberal Christian view is that there's no inerrancy. The Bible is in no sense inerrant. It's full of errors. That's what the word inerrant means, no error. So really no inerrancy is really sort of a bad grammar because it's a double negative. it is errant would be the other way of saying it it is errant that just sounds so weird um but it's got all sorts of errors in it so if you if you are like my denomination the denomination that i'm officially uh i'm a minister uh and i the denomination i'm officially ordained through and i've had this for like seven years and i've just never gotten around to changing it okay i'm almost embarrassed to say it i shouldn't be embarrassed but it's the disciples of christ christian church disciples of christ and there are a lot of great people in that denomination a lot of great churches but as a denomination it's gone so far to the left it's like dropped off in the sea um they're they never even entertained the idea that the bible is inerrant i mean that they gave up that belief about a century ago um they they're very much compatible with the yale philosophy that you know there's a lot about the bible that you just got to you know kind of get rid of if it doesn't agree with you they're about one inch away from the ordination of homosexuals where they're just going to ordain gay people without any you know questions asked that would be that's their view of the Bible and you get this in on the whole there are a lot of exceptions but on the whole the left-wing say United Church of Christ disciples of Christ left-wing Episcopalian Church the left-wing, I mean, even left-wing Lutheran churches, if you go to Northwestern, Luther, Northwestern Theological Seminary, is that what it's called? You'll have that same kind of teaching. It's not really codified in one denomination, but left-wing churches tend to have this view. It's a very much open thing. Their idea of inspiration is basically this. Read the book, read it piously, and whatever strikes you as true is true. Yeah? Inspiration. yeah what is your name Lana calling that Christian good that's fine when I say these are the Christian alternatives I do not mean to say that I think you can endorse any one of these and call it Christian i i'm i'm referring to it descriptively uh if you talk about you know the christian church um all who who claim christianity these are the options they believe i i certainly don't think this is an evangelical option i have a lot of problems with it i'm not saying that the people who believe this are not saved some of them might be uh but uh but i wouldn't codify it as a orthodox christian position at all what i'm trying to do is actually show an orthodox Christian position by showing the unorthodox one. In the description at the beginning of the class, I said we're going to contrast the beliefs with various heresies. And I regard this as a heresy. Okay, that would be the liberal view. There's also two options within evangelicalism. And for lack of any better definition, I call one evangelical left and the other one evangelical right. I don't know I'm going to call them and real creative here. There's a more liberal evangelical view and a more conservative evangelical view. The liberal one would say something like this. The Bible is inerrant in a limited sense. There are, and a lot of people at Fuller Theological Seminary believe this. I mean, a lot of evangelicals believe something like this. And what they mean by that is this. The Bible is infallible. When you look to it for the right things, it's infallible in terms of communicating God's message to us, in terms of working the work of God in our life, in terms of inspiring us, in terms of saving us. Then it's inerrant. But it's not inerrant on matters of historical detail. It's not inerrant on matters of science, on matters of cosmology, how the world was formed, and things like that. It's inerrant in a limited sense. A problem they have, of course, is knowing exactly when it's inerrant and when it's not. How do you cut that line? How do you divide those things? Can you make a sharp distinction between, say, straight history and what God intends to do? When do you know what's one and what's the other? The more right-wing evangelicals say this. No, it's totally inerrant. It's fully inerrant. It's inerrant in all matters that it teaches. Now, this distinction between right-wing and left-wing evangelicals is an important one because this one is dividing churches like you would not believe. It has been dividing churches like you wouldn't believe since about the 30s of this century. Almost every major denomination in America, and actually in the world, has gone through some kind of a split because of this. Is it fully inerrant or is it not fully inerrant? It's really been a tough issue. The Southern Baptist Church right now is wrestling with this thing in a really strong way. And they are progressively working towards a split. The right-wing group and the left-wing group, they've each set up their own seminaries. They're now dividing their finances. They're getting ready to split. So it's a very important issue. You would think you could settle this just by going to the Bible and saying, okay, let's look at it. Are there any errors or aren't there? What's really going on in this book? Let's settle this dispute. It shouldn't be that hard to settle, you know. If we have a history book and we don't know whether it's errant or not, we'd say, well, let's check the facts. Is it errant or not? And so it seemed like it would be an easy issue to settle, but it's not for this reason. Here's what happens. You go to the Bible, and I'll show you a passage that says that the earth is held up by four pillars. And I could say, well, that shows that it's not scientifically accurate because the Bible is not held up by four pillars. Now, you have some believers who would say, and these would be called, I think, fundamentalists, who would say, well, maybe in some sense it is held up by four pillars. And I'd say, well, what about the dome? The Bible talks about a dome over the earth, and there's water above the dome. Is that scientifically accurate? And they might say, well, if the Bible says it, then I believe it. And the Bible says the earth is flat, you're going to believe that too. Or if it says that the sun revolves around the earth. This was a real big issue 400 years ago with Copernicus and the scientific revolution when they first came to believe that the earth revolves around the sun. Major crisis in people. There are some who would try to say it's scientifically accurate in that sense. But most evangelicals would say this. If someone said, well, that's an error, that's a scientific error, they would say, well, no, that's not an error. Because the author's not teaching that the earth is held up by four pillars. He's teaching that God is Lord of all, and he's using the cultural language of his day to do it. You can't blame him for not knowing that the earth is round and rotates around the sun. He lived in the 10th century B.C. the only language he had available was this language of the earth being held up by four pillars in this dome but that he's not teaching that god's not telling us that that's the way the world is god's telling us and if you read the psalms and stuff this is in fact what's going on god is the the psalmist is proclaiming god's lordship who makes the earth stable and gives it this design and for a person in the 20th century bc or the 10th century bc that meant uh you know the pillars and the and the and the hard sky and all that other kind of stuff So that's not an error. That's not an error. And the other person would say, well, it is too an error. And I'd say, no, it's not. That's not an error. It is too, it is. We go back and forth. Well, here's what's going on here, and it's kind of tragic. We really agree, we really agree, but we're using different terms for the same thing. I agree that you can't base a scientific theory on the passage. You can't do that. The purpose of the passage isn't to teach us science. So the inerrancy attaches to what the author is trying to say. And if he's not trying to say, here's the way the earth is made, then don't try to find the way the earth is made by what he says. The other person is using a criteria of scientific accuracy to say that the Bible is erroneous. What I'm saying is, don't use that criteria. A lot of what is splitting churches today should not split churches. Because what one person is calling an error, another person is saying, no, that's just cultural baggage that goes along with it. there are people that i mean there are there are churches that you're that i think we really should split from those who say hey paul was just a first century guy and of course he thought adultery was wrong you know okay so so therefore we have to reject him i i don't see how you can ever have a common belief system with that kind of crowd but the people who say it is an errant but uh you know you can't find science in it and it's got scientific errors well the question is well what do you mean by a scientific error and are you reading into some in the bible something that that the bible never intended us to give in the first place it's the same thing with numbers you know you can find uh oh hundreds and this is what used to really bother me you can find hundreds of examples in the bible where chronicle says david had 20 000 men first samuel says he had 25 000 men and it's clearly referring to the same narrative well let's see what the one one person says well look at it's historically inaccurate what was it 20 000 or 25 000 you know what gives here we got an error a contradiction here. And they say, this bothers me. Oh, how can God's word have a contradiction? But if you understand the way they did things in those days, they were very loose about numbers. The bottom line intent of the passage was to say he had a lot of people. And they would round off numbers all the time. Was it 460 years or 400 years that the children of Israel wandered in the desert? Well, you can, one author was a little more particular than another. It's like someone said, Boyd's birthday is in June. And someone else said, no, it's June 2nd. Okay. You'd be a little more precise here but you know it's a question of how general you're trying to be was there one blind man or two blind men going out of jericho when jesus healed them one author says two another one says one well if there was if there was two there certainly was one so there's there's uh no contradiction one was just being a little more precise than the other ancient authors a lot of times were very loose and very general about things and we can't hold them to our criteria of a video recording kind of accuracy in order to prove the inerrity of the Bible. So the basic evangelical Christian belief, I think it's compatible with both of these, so long as it makes clear that it's not compatible with this. The bottom line, oh, I already talked about this. The issue is what is an error? What is an error? You want to say there's an error in the Bible, I want to know what you mean by that. And what I'll do is to say this. Based on what Jesus said, well, you call an error, I'm not going to call an error. If you find an error in the Bible, I'll just say, well, that wasn't part of what the Bible is teaching.
