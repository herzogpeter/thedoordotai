Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. We'll open your Bibles, if you have them, to the book of Colossians. First chapter, beginning in the third verse, where because of what Paul talks about in this section, from Colossians 1.3 to Colossians 1.8, we are going to talk about hope. And what we put our hope in and what it is we hope for. and we're going to talk about what it feels like to lose hope. You know what that feels like? And we're going to talk about how it is that some people who live in very difficult circumstances that we might consider hopeless, sometimes those people find a way to actually have hope. A lot like the people to whom Paul is writing, who lived at Colossae, because to live in Colossae, as we've been learning the last couple of weeks, was to live in the shadow of Rome, which, as it turns out, was a pretty frightening place to live. So frightening, in fact, that lots of really good people in Colossae had actually lost their hope. Because they lost their land and they lost their freedom. And many of them, to the tyranny of Rome, had lost their lives. Some of them even nailed to crosses, which was the ultimate way for Rome to show how powerful they were. But nonetheless, Paul, along with Timothy, wrote these words to the saints in Colossae. Colossians chapter 1, beginning in verse 3. We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you. And the reason when he prays he gives thanks for them is because we heard, first of all, of your faith in Christ Jesus. And they heard of it from Epaphras, kind of a strange name, who Paul mentions in verse 7. Epaphras who had come to Colossae to visit Paul who was in prison to just kind of give him a report of what was going on in this Colossian church. So when we pray, we give thanks, because Epaphras told us of your deep and abiding confidence, that is, faith. That the Jesus way of living and loving is the way, regardless of what Caesar's way might be. So we've heard of your faith that manifests itself, which you have for all the saints. And you have this faith and love, it says in the text, because of the hope you have. There's the hope thing laid up for you in heaven. Now, I don't want to get nitpicky about this, but I really want to get you to enter into the flow of this and get all the juice out of it that we can. I want you to notice the order of this faith, hope, and love because it's significant. Because the faith and love comes from hope. In fact, the NIV translation says it this way, that it's the faith and love that springs from hope. So there's hope, and out of that hope there comes this faith in Christ and love for the brethren. But the hope came from someplace too. end of verse 5. This hope came and was given birth by the word of truth which you previously heard the gospel. The gospel. Steve introduced this word to us a couple weeks ago when he began the book of Colossians. The gospel is the Greek word there, euangelion which we've learned was a common phrase in Paul's day used by the Romans to speak of what they referred to as the good news, the euangelion that Caesar is Lord. Remember that? But that word had other usages pages too, because it was also used in the context of battle. It had a military connotation. When the armies had gone off to war, the people of the city, just kind of picture it, they don't see the battle, they just know it's raging. And they're in the city, and they're waiting for word. Do we win or lose? Will we be enslaved, or will we remain free? It was a lot was at stake. And as they were waiting, at some point in the distance, they would see a runner coming maybe over the hill. And often, simply by what this runner was wearing, they would know if he had euangelion, if he had good news or he had bad news. And if it was euangelion, if he had good news, he would usually bust in through the gates of the city and shout at the top of his voice, I have euangelion, I have good news, the war is over, the victory is won. And that word would give birth to hope. In the people of the city, we're free. We've won. the war's over there's peace good news get your hopes up back to the text verse six this euangelium good news that has come to you just as in all the world it has come it is constantly bearing fruit it's just amazing paul says this thing just can't be stopped and increasing even it has as it has been doing in you since the first day you heard of it and understood the grace of god in truth and Do you remember who you learned this grace of God from? Epaphras, verse 7. Our beloved fellow bondservant who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf. Indeed, he's the one who told us of your love in the Spirit. All of which raises a question. And there's a number of questions that get raised in that text from me. But the first one would be this. What is this word of truth that has the power to give birth to hope? Particularly in the hearts of people who have reason because of Rome in their living conditions to have no hope. What is this word of truth, this euangelion that stirs in the hearts of people who otherwise would be hopeless, that stirs in them such faith and manifests itself in love in places like Colossae. But even beyond Colossae, according to the text, because in all the world, it says in verse 6, this word of truth is bearing fruit. It's capturing people's imaginations, it's stirring people's hearts, it's giving people hope. Even, again, in the context of circumstances where there seems to be no hope. Because we human beings are hopers. Hope is why people get married. Hope is wonderful, I feel good every day. But hope is why people have children. Hope is why they stick in their marriage and with their kids when things get tough because they hope. If you've ever persevered in anything at all, a relation, anything at all, It's because somewhere along the line you were able to find hope. And if you lose hope, and there really is no reason at all for hope, that's when you just can't keep going. It's over. I can't persevere. Hope is why farmers plant seeds. Hope is why people play the stock market. Hope is why people go on blind dates. Hope. And hope is why 40,000 people will go back to Wrigley Field next April. because they hope. You know, I was thinking about that. Actually, I don't think it is why they go back. They've lost hope. I've lost hope in the Cubs. They go to Wrigley Field for other reasons. I'll talk about it later. But Proverbs 13, 12 says that hope deferred makes the heart grow sick. Relate to that? Because the truth is this, that the human spirit can survive just about anything. I mean, you could survive a difficult marriage. But if in that marriage you lost hope, it just about kills you. You can actually feel it in your body, according to Proverbs 13. It can actually make you sick. Which actually, again, stirs up another question. I told you there's a lot of questions that this thing stirs up. And the question is this. what are you hoping for? What are you hoping in? Because again, we're all hopers. We just are. It's incurable. And I don't think you should ever get over it. Hope I get that job. That's a good thing to hope for. Hope we get that house. Hope the kids are safe. Hope my spouse comes back. Hope we don't lose them. Hope it's not cancer. but what if it is cancer and and and what if you do lose them and what if they don't come back what are you hoping now i was i was thinking about this this week for me for us i was thinking about that announcement i had to make about the finances and and what do you hope for i hope i hope we make the budget this is a very important question but what if you don't? what are you going to hope in now? Paul was in a Roman prison when he wrote this letter to the Colossians so let's interview him okay Paul you're here in prison and quite frankly it's clear from Philippians which he wrote during the same season in his life when he was in prison that he thought he was going to die what are you hoping for? hope I get out I think so. But here's this question. It's a pesky question. What if you don't? In fact, in this imprisonment, he does get out. He does live. But there's another imprisonment in a Roman prison some years after this one. And in that imprisonment, he doesn't get out alive. In fact, he's beheaded just west of Rome on what's known as the Ostian Way. And then the Colossians, living as they do in the shadow of Rome, had some tangible things to fear because emperor worship meant claiming Jesus as Lord, not Caesar as Lord was a crime. So Colossians, what are you hoping for in that kind of environment? Hope they don't notice that I don't think Caesar is Lord. And if they notice, hope they don't care. Because quite frankly, there would be rulers who would really care and rulers who would, I don't care. But what if they do notice that I think Jesus is Lord and what if they do care about that? well, hope they don't imprison me. Hope they don't execute me. But what if they do? What are you hoping now? And what on earth was this word of truth that in the middle of those kinds of reality sounded like good enough news to give people hope in circumstances like that? Well, the short answer to that is found in places like 1 Corinthians 15 where Paul with great passion reduces the word of truth, the euangelion, this guy busting through the gates to say, I got good news, it's gonna be okay. He reduced that good news down to one thing. 1 Corinthians 15, 1, 4, I make known to you, brethren, the gospel. I am here busting through the gates to say euangelion, which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, by which also you are saved. For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was raised the third day according to the scriptures. But this is not hearsay. I've got to tell you the rest. Because he appeared to Cephas, that is to Peter, and then to the twelve, and then to more than 500 at one time, most of whom are still alive, so you can go ask them, but some of them are dead. Don't bother trying to talk to them. But then he appeared to James, And then to all the apostles, and then last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. And that is what gives birth to hope in the face of Roman prisons and Roman crosses and Roman Caesars, because now Christ has been raised. 1 Corinthians 15, 20. And in 1 Corinthians 15, 20, he calls Christ's resurrection the first fruits of many to follow, which means he is the first of many to follow. So at the end of the day, while Roman prisons and crosses and Caesars can scare you and hurt you, even kill you, they cannot keep you. Because now Christ has been raised, and because he is raised, you will be also. And that was the euangelion, the word of truth that gave birth to hope in places like Colossae, where there was very little hope. hope because what it told people who believe this? In fact, I love this picture that Peter paints in Acts 5.31 where Peter says of Jesus that he is the one whom God exalted at the right hand as prince and savior. Prince is the word archegos. And I've told you about this before. It's an incredible picture. Archegos was actually the name of a person on a ship. The ship would come close to shore. They didn't have a dinghy to bring it into shore. And they would tie a rope around the archegos, his waist, and he would dive into the waters. He was obviously the best swimmer on the ship. He would dive into these waters. Anybody else went into that water, they would die. They would drown, but this guy could swim. So he would swim through those waters, come out the other side, take a rope off his waist, tie it around a tree, and turn around and say, because I made it, you will too. Grab the rope. That's the message. That's the euangelion. To people who were maybe gonna die, the resurrection of Christ said, I am the one who dove into the waters of death, and anybody else who dies into those waters doesn't come out alive, but I went into those waters, ran through those waters, came out the other side of those waters, turned around and said, because I made it, so will you. Get your hopes up. And this drove Rome crazy, because people did get their hopes up, because what they realized was this. Even if you kill me, I'm still living. I don't want to die. Scares me to death. I have a lot of fear, but I know that you can't stop me. And it did drive Rome nuts because no matter how much Rome huffed and puffed, no matter how much they tried to hurt people and crush people, there was this growing group of people who, regardless of that, still had hope. And part of the whole agenda of Rome was to mess people up so bad that they would lose their hope. Because if you lose your hope, we can control you. But this group of people still had hope. In fact, their hope was only increasing their faith in Christ. I mean this is weird we snuff them out and they'll lose faith in Christ no this hope that had a bigger picture of eternity was actually increasing their faith in Christ and love for each other and they just had Rome had to start thinking we just can't beat these guys Paul said it this way in 2 Corinthians 4.8 afflicted? oh yeah persecuted almost every day perplexed almost every day persecuted yes struck down a lot but I am not crushed, not despairing, not forsaken, not destroyed. In other words, I still have hope. Which raises a question, and another question, and this one's personal, and I invite you into it, but this really is my question. Why, Paul, how did you do this? Because the truth is, I get how the resurrection stuff can give birth to hope, particularly when you're facing death, like Paul was and the Colossians were. But my question is this, and I even love preaching that. I mean, I have a lot of energy. Because I live, so will you. Okay, I get that. But my question is, what about day to day? Because the truth for me, and I'm guessing this is true for you. I don't wake up every morning going, I got heaven. And some of the things that weigh me down and perplex me and discourage me aren't helped by going, well, hey, if you have heaven. because the truth, I'm afraid, is that when I get afflicted, I pretty quickly get crushed. And when I get perplexed, which happens a lot, I can move to despair pretty quick. So how did he do this? What did he see that sometimes I don't see? well to answer that let me start with this I just kind of want to wade through some things and just kind of inviting you into my thinking this week around this the first thing I had to kind of deal with here and I want you to get is this that the faith and hope we're talking about here and I think that Paul had and I have to and so do you at times we move in and out of this is first of all this kind of faith and hope is not born of denying or ignoring your real feelings of despair It is not born of pretending things are fine when they're not. It is not like fairy dust that magically makes all your problems go away. If I just had more faith, I would just be happy all the day. No. Because here's the deal. Paul saw his problems very clearly, and he felt the pain of them very deeply. Faith and hope does not make you oblivious to feeling hard things. Indeed, in 2 Corinthians 1.8, Paul says this. I want you to know about the affliction we had when we were in Asia. For when we were in Asia, we were burdened excessively, despairing even of life. Well, he just contradicted. Did you hear what I just said? He says here, he despaired of life, which means I was pretty sure we were going to die. But over in the other Corinthian thing, he says, you know, struck down, but not despairing. Well, he says right here he does despair. Well, here's what I want you to get. Paul saw the pain stuff. He wasn't oblivious. He didn't deny those painful things. Here's the key, however. He saw those things. He just saw more than the pain and the suffering and the disappointment. He saw that stuff. He felt that stuff. He just saw more. 2 Corinthians 4.18, he says it this way. For we look not at things which are seen, but at things which are not seen. For the things which are seen, this is interesting, important, are temporal, which doesn't mean they're not real. The things which are seen are real. They're in my face. I feel them. It's why I can't sleep. Maybe, Paul said. They're real. They're temporal. They just don't last, and here's the word, forever. Well, it lasted forever. What do you mean, a week? No, no, no. You gotta get a bigger view than this. But the things which are unseen are eternal. In fact, the things which are seen, He calls them temporal. In the verse just previous to that, 2 Corinthians 4, 17, he says, he calls those temporal things this momentary light affliction. I've told you this before, but the momentary light affliction, how long is that? The momentary part? A couple weeks? Bad week? Bad month? No, when he's talking about this momentary light affliction, he's talking about just this life. Full of whatever pain there might be and disappointment from time to time. But this momentary light affliction is producing something you can't see. It's producing an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison. And if you don't see that, at least from time to time, get a glimpse of that, you're going to lose hope. In fact, that is why. Because I do get a glimpse of that, Paul says, that is why, though afflicted, I'm not crushed, perplexed, not despairing, though in pain I'm full of this faith that springs out of hope because though I see the problems and feel the pain, I see more. which raises the question, I just want to walk around for the rest of the morning. Here's the question, what do you see? In your personal battle to find hope and faith, what do you see? A couple weeks ago, the question was, what are you wearing? Remember that? Different question today. What do you see? What are you looking at? Hebrews 11.1 says, is the assurance of things hoped for. There's those two words together, faith. Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things that you can't see. And the things you can't see are eternal things. I've heard some people take this verse and they turn it into a little prosperity thing. And you can't see. The boat, the new boat is not in your garage yet. So just you gotta see with the eyes of faith and believe God. Shut up. Anyway. Here's the deal. People full of faith and hope live their lives with the realization, assurance, and conviction that there is more going on in life than what they can see with physical eyes and hear with physical ears because they're living in a much bigger story than today or tomorrow or this momentary light affliction. So people full of faith and hope, listen, do not deny and ignore what's real. They don't pretend they're happy when they're not and call it faith. And Paul despaired of life, as I said in 2 Corinthians 1, 8. He didn't pretend he didn't despair. Now, people full of faith and hope don't deny what they see and feel. They just see more. And what they see is a bigger story. And what they have is an eternal perspective. And what they know is that this life is not all there is to life. And sometimes they forget. Sometimes I forget. And that's why we need to be reminded. And maybe that's why we come to church and sing these songs that Stephan talks about. reminding us and hear words like this that remind us, and it's why we've got to be in community and in relationships to be with people who will help us see more and remind us of what we really do believe, regardless of what's falling apart, maybe, around us. And what that produces, this eternal perspective, among other things, believe it or not, is freedom and a kind of fearlessness. When you can finally get into that place where, wait a minute, this is not what my hope is in. It's got to be bigger. It gives birth to a kind of fearlessness to live and to love and to attempt and to accomplish, to sometimes defy, to support and to endure, to persevere. The people in Colossae saw Rome. I mean, they didn't deal with the fear of Rome by going, oh, it's not that big a deal. They'll never bother me. oh no, that's this stupid living in unreality. I just believe God is going to make sure I never have any pain. Boy, you're going down when you have pain. No, they saw Rome. And they saw Caesar. And they saw the crosses that sometimes their best friends were hanging from. They just saw more. And what they saw gave birth to hope, which sprang faith, from which sprang faith and love. This pattern, beloved, this story I'm telling, in fact, this word of truth flows, not just here in the Gospels. It didn't start, this word of truth, this euangelion, didn't just start with Jesus. Jesus kind of brought it to the fore and kind of culminated some things about it, but this story flows all the way through Scripture from beginning to end, because it's all part of the story of God that gives birth to hope. Let me tell you some stories about hope and how people in difficult circumstances had hope. Remember Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego? And in their day, I think the king was Nebuchadnezzar. And so it wasn't Caesar that was making everybody bow down to them. It was Nebuchadnezzar. And Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego said, we're not bowing down to you. We don't think you're Lord. And if you don't bow down, however, they were going to be thrown into the fiery furnace. and there they were because they weren't standing in front of the fiery furnace. How do you think that felt? What do you think they hoped? Hope I don't go in there. Here's the truth. I think they saw the fiery furnace. Hello, of course. And I'm sure they were afraid. Maybe, like, couldn't hardly stand up. They just saw more. This furnace is going to hurt, like, well, you know. but I don't know why? as scary as this is I see more I see something bigger look for something bigger Hebrews 11 27 says by faith Moses left Egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured how? as seeing him who is unseen so here's the deal he saw he wasn't blind he didn't go oh the king will never hurt me I'm here, I'm the Lord's anointed and God will protect me from the king. No, it wasn't what he said. He saw the king of Egypt and he knew what the king of Egypt could do to him and he saw the riches of Egypt and understood and was drawn to the passing pleasure of sin. So how did he risk it all? Maybe even his very life. Here's how he saw more. He endured a seeing him who was unseen. so what do you see? what do you see? Joshua and Caleb about to go into the promised land at a place called K-Barnea Numbers 13 verse 1 says then the Lord spoke to Moses saying send out for yourselves men so that they may spy out the land of Canaan which I'm going to give to the children of Israel you shall send a man from each of their father's tribes everyone a leader among them and the report from the majority was that it was indeed a land of abundance and promise so yeah, good report But, verse 28, the people who live in the land are strong. The cities are fortified and very large. So it says in verse 32, they gave a bad report. We can't go. Why? It's a land that devours its inhabitants. And all the people we saw were men of great size. So much so, it says in verse 33, that we felt like grasshoppers. We became like grasshoppers. Little bitty things in our own eyes. And that's all that they could see. I mean, the giants were real. but that's all that they could see and in comparison no hope Joshua and Caleb you know they brought a different report and says we can by all means take this but it wasn't because they denied the giants were big they didn't go oh they're not that big they didn't do that they said they're huge we just see more so what do you see then there's Nehemiah This is my favorite. Nehemiah, who had given himself to rebuild the wall in Jerusalem, which was a noble thing, but it was a daunting thing as well. Why don't you think about this? He had given himself to rebuild. Some of you have done that. Your whole life is about, or some significant part of your life, is because you've given yourself to rebuild something. Maybe it's a marriage. maybe it's a ministry I know guys who go to churches and their whole things I'm giving myself to rebuild something here some of you work in the inner city because you have a heart you've given yourself to rebuild something some of your teachers and maybe you don't say it this way but you've given your heart to rebuild some things in the hearts of these young kids and there's this thing that you want to do and then in Nehemiah they were halfway through this task of rebuilding the wall when Nehemiah 4.10 says that the strength of the laborers was giving out because there was so much rubble we cannot rebuild. You get the picture of that? They've been at it for a while. They've been building something and what they've built is good. But now halfway through this thing, there's just so much rubble. So what was the problem? The problem was the rubble was all they could see. and so they were losing hope, which is what you do if all you can see is the rubble. I get the picture here. They had built some parts of the wall, and they were good, but that's not what they were looking at. Any of you resonate with this at all? I do. I do. Even in the ministry here, there's times over years, I find myself, well, I'm getting downer and downer and downer. Sorry for all you teachers. now you're going to kill me. Because there are times, there are seasons where I feel like all I'm going to do is look at the rubble, and I can't even see the wall anymore. I don't think I'm speaking in somewhere that's foreign to you. But it raises this question, what do you see? In fact, is anyone who's ever persevered in anything at all was able sooner or later, sooner or later, they were able sooner or later to see more than the rubble of the relationship, more than the rubble of the marriage, more than the rubble of the ministry or the rubble of their mistakes. But sometimes the rubble's all you see. You ever make a mistake? Or maybe someone that you really love, make a mistake? Like one you can't undo? Probably. So what do you see? I remember some time ago doing a talk here about our need to understand that while there are things in our lives that are true, we need to dial into the fact that there are other things more true. So there's something, and this is true, let's say that's the rubble, but there's something more true than this. For example, you know what's true? You're sinners, all of you. Dirty rotten sinners. You've all blown it. You have blown it more than once. Mistakes more than a few. True. You know what's more true? That in him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace, and in him we have been made complete. So what do you see? Indeed, can you see anything but the rubble? This is not an appeal to look away from the rubble and go, oh, the rubble is not that bad. No, let's say it's that bad. However that bad is, let's say it's that bad. But if you're going to keep working on the rubble, you're going to have to see more than that. So, and what's the rubble for you? What's the rubble for you that's convinced you you can't rebuild? Listen to me here. Sometimes our ability to see more is a choice. And sometimes you have to make it, and you can. Sometimes you have to turn your head in order to see something else. And this is where I think friends come in. Sometimes they need to go, Dave, Dave, Dave, wake up. I know that's true. You just need to look at this as well. You have to make a choice about what you see sometimes. By faith, Moses chose. Hebrews 12, verse 2 gives this advice on endurance. Hebrews 12, verse 1 is talking about running the race with endurance. How do you run the race with endurance? Verse 2, here's how. Fix your eyes on something other than the rubble. Try this. Fix your eyes on Jesus, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, despised the shame, sitting now at the right hand of the Father, interceding always for us, which means, among other things, even in the middle of the rubble, you are not alone. I'm not telling you to ignore the rubble. I'm telling you to look at more than that. Just read your gaze, look up in order to see more. But sometimes this ability to see more is not a choice. It's a gift. Because you've lost your ability even to choose. You've almost become blind to the euangelion. You can't hear it anymore. You can't see it anymore. Elisha's servant needed a gift. And by the way, if you're in this place, it doesn't make you defective. It makes you kind of human. It's tough being human. Quit pretending you're not. Incredible story. 2 Kings, verse 6. The Syrian army had surrounded the city, and everybody was in despair. We're going to get killed. So the servant comes to Elisha. Elisha's servant comes and says, in a panic, what are we going to do? So Elisha says, in verse 16, 2 Kings, chapter 6, verse 16. I think his voice was calm enough to maybe irritate the servant, who was upset, because he says, don't be afraid. because those who are with us are more than those who are with them. Really? Be the servant. I'm looking at the Syrian army. What do you see that I don't see? So Elisha prayed in verse 17. Oh, Lord, I pray. Open his eyes. that he could see. The Lord opened his servant's eyes, and the servant saw, and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around. Incredible picture of spiritual warfare, among other things. So what are you saying, Dave? That there's horses and chariots of fire all around? Yeah, can't you see them? No, that ain't what I'm saying. That's not what I'm saying. I'm falling apart up here. No, I'm not saying that. That there's horses and chariots of fire. What I am saying is this. And I am saying this. God is for you. And Christ in you really is the hope of living in a glorious way, regardless of the rubble. if God really is for us as Paul in Romans 8 31 then let me ask you a question who can be against us even if we die we live listen Paul goes on he who did not spare his own son but delivered him up for us all how will he not also with him freely give us all things verse 33 who bring a charge against the elect I know you're looking at the rubble and because you got this rubble you're full of shame so you kind of feel like God's not even with you. Let me ask you a question. Who is it that brings a charge against God's life? You think it's God, don't you? You got it wrong. God doesn't do that. God is the one who justifies. That's his job. And who is the one who condemns? You're full of condemnation because of your rubble. You think Jesus condemns you? That's not what he does. Read the rest of the verse. Christ Jesus is the one who died. Remember him? Remember this? You forgot the story. Rather, he was raised. Who is at the right hand of the Father who is also interceding for you now? Let me ask you a question. Who do you think has the power to separate you from the love of Christ? Tribulation, distress, persecution? How about famine, nakedness, peril, or sword? How about Rome? How about a Roman prison? Here's the deal. I'm convinced, verse 38, that neither life nor death, nor angels nor principalities. Things present, things to come. I forget these things, but I still am convinced of these things. You know how both of those things can be true at the same time? not powers, not height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. And that is the word of truth. That is the euangelion that was giving birth to hope in places, in unlikely places, like Colossae, where there wasn't much reason to hope, and in Roman prisons where people like Paul thought they were about to die, but it wasn't just there, it was in all the world. All the world. Colossians 1 verse 6, this word of truth was constantly bearing fruit and increasing just as it has been doing in you since the first day you heard it. And understood the grace of God in truth. So here's my word. Get your hopes up. And fix your gaze on something other than the rubble. Don't ignore the rubble. Don't deny it. But fix your gaze on something other than that. Lift up your head so you can see more. And for those who can't, because you've lost your ability to see, we pray, Holy Spirit, come. Holy Spirit, come. Enter into just the spirit of prayer with me. Lord help us see what sometimes we can't see what yesterday we could see but for whatever reason right now can't see like Elisha's servant open our eyes rekindle our hope the kind of hope from which springs faith in Christ Jesus and love for the brethren. And all God's people said, amen. I want you to stand as they read over you a benediction. One thing I'd say too, I'm gonna ask the prayer team to come and make yourself available for prayer. Some of you might do well to be prayed for. Here's the benediction. It comes from Romans 15, verse 13. Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit I want to read it again Now may the God OF hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in hope by God's power by the power of the Holy Spirit God bless you as you leave your dismissal in peace and hope and faith and love for the brethren. See you later. Thank you.
