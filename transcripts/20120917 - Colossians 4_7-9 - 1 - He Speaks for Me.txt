Well, hey everyone, my name is Steve. Welcome to Open Door. And as we move into the message, I want to invite you into a practice. And the practice is any time that your desire is to hear from God. I mean, to really hear from God. That there's a way in which you need to participate in that by opening up your heart to God. And so as I pray for the message, I would invite you to, in whatever way that makes sense to you, if you feel like today, I need to hear from you, God. That's what I want to hear. I want to hear from you. I need to hear from you. I need a word from you, God, that during this prayer, you would simply say a prayer to God in your own words that says, God, I open up my heart to you. You have access. Speak to me, please. So let's pray together. God, we are people who are desperate to hear from you. If we don't hear from you, in fact, we're done. And so as a community of people, desperate and broken people hanging onto your grace, we open up our hands and open up our ears and open up our minds and say to you, speak, God, because we are listening. We give you access to our hearts. Have your way with us. Amen. Amen? Okay, well, I want to give you a little picture of where we're going for the next several weeks because if you're paying attention at all, you're noticing that we are just in the last few verses of this wonderful little letter called Colossians that we've been studying for three years. It's an amazing journey. Some might call it weird and like something's wrong with us that we would spend three years and four chapters, but we're heading toward the end. And so I want to give you a little picture of where we're going. Over the next two weeks, I'm going to look at the last several verses in Colossians where I think we're going to find some wonderfully ordinary instruction about how the body of Christ plays out the mystery of Christ in us in very ordinary ways with each other. And I think there's going to be some gifts in it for us all. So that's this week and next week. And then the last week of September, Dave and I are going to wrap up Colossians. We're going to sit up here on stools probably, And we're going to talk about the things that we remember impacting our story because of the story of Colossians. And so that's going to take three or four days. So when you come here that weekend, you're going to need to book some rooms at the Comfort Inn and Suites over there, or whatever that's called. And no, it's going to be a sweet weekend. And then the first weekend in October, Dave Johnson, our senior pastor, is going to start our next study, which you will find out what it is on the last weekend in September. So you've got to come to that. And then, you know, only at Open Door would we even try to whet your appetite for the next book that we'll be studying for the next seven years. All right? So it's going to be amazing and beautiful and wonderful. But today, right here, right now, we are still in the book of Colossians. So open up your Bibles or your smartphones or your iPads, whatever you have, to Colossians chapter 4. I'm going to start in verse 7. We're going to cover three verses today. Tychicus. Everyone say Tychicus. Beautiful name, isn't it? Some of you women who are pregnant might want to think about that for your son. Tychicus will tell you all the news about me Paul is writing because remember, Paul's in prison and he's writing this letter to the Colossians and this letter has to be delivered to the Colossians by someone. There's no phone. There's no email. There's no U.S. Postal Service. It actually has to be hand delivered and so Tychicus is going to do that. Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He's a dear brother. He's a faithful minister. And he's a fellow servant in the Lord. And I'm sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our circumstances. And that he may encourage your hearts. And he's also coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. He's one of you, Colossians. He's from you. And they will tell you everything that's happening here. Now, I want you to dial into the heart of Paul right now. As he's in prison, and he cares a lot about this group of people, that he started this church at Colossae. And so he's thinking of people. He has people's faces in his mind and their hearts in his heart. And he is bummed out because what he wants to say to them in person, he cannot. Because he's in prison. And so he writes this letter, but then toward the end of the letter, he realizes, I'm not going to be able to give this to them in person. I'm not going to be able to read this to them in person. I'm going to have to send someone to them that carries my spirit in them. And I don't want just to give this to anyone. Because remember, the express purpose was to tell them about their circumstances and what was Paul's circumstances as he's writing, from prison. They're difficult. He's a prisoner. and he is vulnerably wanting to share with his people what life is like. But also, he's not just thinking about him, he's thinking about his people and he's like, I want to send someone to you that will encourage your hearts. And so walk with me into Paul's prison cell as he racks his brain. Who could I send that will carry my spirit of love and devotion for these people? Who can I send that will adequately express our circumstances and my heart for them so that they'll be encouraged? Who will I send? And who he comes up with is this person we've never heard of before called Tychicus. So it made me wonder, what was the relationship like between Paul and Tychicus? that they carried the same spirit that he would say to Tychicus. Now, Tychicus, you've got to understand this. When you go to the Colossians, you're speaking for me. And what does it mean that he actually trusted that Tychicus would speak for him, that he carried the same spirit in his heart? Question for you. who would you let speak for you in important matters? Let's say that you had something very important to share with someone, something that you really, really wanted them to know and feel. Maybe you wanted to encourage their hearts, or maybe you wanted to tell them about what was happening with you, but for whatever reason, whether it be you were in the military and you were stationed overseas or you were in the hospital and you could not get the word to them, Do you have someone in your life that you would trust to speak for you? Now the way to ask that is this. What allows this kind of trust and unity to be developed? Where you share the same spirit. You share the same heart. You're united and trusting. How does that kind of trust get built? And I want you to think, do you have someone in your life that at least you would say, they have a pretty good shot at sharing my heart? Because I think what we're gonna learn today and what I'm gonna invite you into today is in that relationship, maybe it's with a little group of people, maybe it's with one other person, what would it look like for you to get really, really intentional about that trust growing so that your spirit really is united with each other. So we're going to learn what it takes to have this kind of trust and unity developed right out of the text. Remember in Colossians 4, 7, I just read this to you. Paul talks about this wonderful guy named Tychicus that none of us have ever heard about. Apparently, he was very close to Paul. It says, Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. And then three things Paul writes about Tychicus. He's a dear brother, he's a faithful minister, and he's a fellow servant in the Lord. He's a dear brother. He's a faithful minister. And he's a fellow servant in the Lord. Three things that I think, if we dive into them, are going to lead us into knowing how this kind of trust and unity is developed so that you could send someone to speak for you. And so really, even if you never had to send someone to speak for you, you would know that you were united and that trust really was growing. So first of all, dear brother, you know, I have to admit that with my religious upbringing and background, what this reminds me most of all of is my little Baptist church that I grew up in in 1973 where someone would say, Hey, brother. How you doing, brother? Hey, sister. And it almost sounded a little like, whoa, that's a little weird. Mom, are they my brother? I mean, is there something I don't know about? Is this weird? This is weird. This is a little bit weird. I know I'm three, 1973. But what does it mean when he calls me a brother? Or someone says sister. Hey, we're brothers and sisters in Christ. Brothers and sisters in the Lord. What is that? Well, the Greek word for brother here, or brethren, it actually refers to much more than just the male part of the society. It's male and female, but it's Adelphos, and it came to designate a community of love, a community of love, based on the commonality of believers due to Christ's work. This is what the society called the church, the Adelphos, the community of love that's united around the work of Jesus. in the world. The community of love that's united around the person of Jesus and his work in the world. Oh yeah, they're the Adelphos. You know what they do. They just share all their food with people. It's pretty crazy. Oh, the Adelphos. And that gives you a little picture about the relationship that Paul had with Tichkis. They were part of the Adelphos. Question. When you think of that person or that little group of people that I asked you to think about just a couple moments ago, question, what roots you together? In what are you rooted? And that's a difficult question, right? You know, because if you're a Christian, you're like, well, Jesus, of course. We're of course rooted in Jesus. I think the relationship that Paul and Titchkus had and the relationship that people have, that they share their spirit with each other in this way, the spirit of the Adelphos, goes something like this. People with this kind of trust in each other are rooted in something bigger than their similarities, bigger than ideals, or even bigger than what's attractive about the other person. People with this kind of trust in each other are rooted in something bigger than similarities, bigger than ideals, and bigger than what's attractive about the other person. Because I think many times when you move towards someone for the first time, in very believable and understandable ways, you move toward them based on a bunch of different things. One thing you might move toward them is based on what you're attracted to about them. And this might be physical. It might be something that they have that you kind of don't have. They have a confidence that you don't have, and so you want to get around them. And so what roots you together is the fact that they have confidence and you don't. And so, you know, or maybe, you know, think back to your high school days and that first time you saw that person that you felt, all of a sudden your blood pressure went way up in a really, really good way, and you started feeling like, wow, okay, I really like them. I really want to be around them. It's amazing. And it had nothing to do with anything other than their physical appearance. You remember that? No, I don't remember that at all. But if you're a Christian, especially, oh man, I feel the Lord drawing me to that person. Man, I just sense, I feel it in my prayer time. It's like, in my prayer time, that's because that's all you can think about. That's it. So of course it's in your prayer time. Whew. Or maybe it's the similarities that you share. you know I mean we just get along so well because they like bike riding and I like bike riding and they like soup and I like soup and it's just an amazing you know or we both don't like that person and so that we can root have you ever gotten rooted in that that the only really thing that roots you is the fact that you don't like that person or that type of person if you're rooted in those things similarities and attraction none of those things are bad I mean that's just reality that's just part of the deal it's part of the picture but if that's the deepest thing that roots you then we got a problem because emails like this one that I got yesterday morning start becoming the answer so apparently this is the advertising campaign that Groupon has to 41-year-old males. You can get a skin-tightening facelift. Feeling a little saggy around the eyes? Just get a facelift and you'll be even more attractive to your spouse because what we're rooted in is my ability to stay attractive to my spouse. Now that picture, like that girl is no more than 15 years old. She does not need a skin-tightening facelift, and neither do you. We get a skin-tightening facelift, or whatever the equivalent is, when we're rooted in an idea that what roots us together and what keeps us together is my ability to be attractive to the other person in whatever way you want to play that, physical, emotional. And Paul and Tychicus were saying, what unites us and roots us together is our common desire that Christ be revealed in people, that the mystery of Christ in you be brought out. That's what unites us. That's what roots us together. That's the spirit we carry together. And I imagine Paul and Tychicus could have been very different people. I mean, Paul couldn't have been easy to be a friend with. I mean, that guy was all over the place, right? He was, I mean, he was, I mean, doesn't he kind of seem like a kind of guy that you might like to read about or listen to, but being his friend might be challenging? I mean, like Paul, he's Paul. Might have been a little narcissistic. Might have been a little bit like, yeah, my deal is my deal, and I'm going to, and Titchkus might have been this just soft-spoken guy that's just like, hey, you know what, whatever, I'm just along for the ride here, And I just want the mystery of Christ to be revealed in people. And Paul, I know that's your deepest heart too. So even though we may fight and we may have conflicts, and even though we may go toward each other when we have conflicts, what roots us together is not our ability to like each other and always laugh. It's not what attracts you to me that unites us. It's our ability to be rooted in something much, much bigger. So question. As you think about this little group of people that you're with, or that person that, you know, it's like, well, if anyone has a shot, they have a shot of speaking for me. And the bigger question there is they trust me and I trust them. What would it look like for you to have an honest conversation about what is rooting you together right now? You know, sometimes I think for people who are married and have kids, it's like without even knowing it, you discover that what roots you together is your kids. Now that's, you know, be a good parent and be intentional about your parenting, but the way that you would know that what roots you together is your kids is if that's all you talk about, and when they move out, now it got real quiet, all of a sudden you're looking at each other like, well, okay, now I need to get to know you again because I haven't even known you for 22 years. What roots you together? And could you have an honest conversation about that that was not defensive or not judgmental even. Just, hey, can we talk about, what do we think roots us together? Maybe it's one of you that roots you together. Maybe it's someone else that you don't like that roots you together. The body of Christ has to actually drill all the way down and get really centered on this one. We are rooted by our passion that the work of Christ be done in this world. And the work of Christ done in this world is the mystery of Christ revealed in people. Christ in us, the mystery of the gospel. Dear brother, faithful minister is the second thing that he says. And again, that just sounds like such a beautiful language, a faithful minister. He served his church for 25 years. He was faithful. But the word for minister is actually a Greek word called diakonos. And the word for diakonos is waiter. It's server. It's like when you go to Applebee's and the person that comes up to your table with the black shirt on and says, Hi, can I have your order? And then that person goes back and you order a double cheeseburger with extra bacon and extra crispy fries. And she goes back or he goes back and they get from the chef in the back room in the kitchen of Applebee's and that chef prepares a perfect double cheeseburger with extra bacon and fries that are so crispy that you could absolutely, I mean, you would die just by eating them, and takes that exact meal exactly as it was prepared to your table and gives it to you and says, this is my job. This is what I want to do. I take what the chef is prepared for you and give it to you. That's what I do. That's a the Akonos. That's a deacon in the church. That's a leader in the church. A leader in the church says, God has something for you. And my only job as a leader in this church is to pray and think and wonder about what God has for you. And then when I think about that enough and pray about that enough, I'm not going to dilute that with any of my opinion or any of my stuff. I'm going to give you what God's given me to give you. That's a leader in the church. And not in some heavy-handed way. God told me. That's when you sort of, you know, no, it's probably not God told me. The other phrase, voluntarily laboring in the dust. Don't you love that one? You want to sign up for that? Be a leader in the church. You'll voluntarily labor in the dust. No one will notice you. No one will thank you. The people that you serve might sometimes get ticked off at you. Woo! Dust. Momentarily. The relationship I think that Tishkiss and Paul had and people with this kind of trust have, people with this kind of trust in each other go to God as the source of what to give to each other. Does that make sense? People with this kind of trust go to God as the source of what to give to the other person, which implies that they go to God as the source of what they need to receive for themselves. You ever been in a relationship where all of a sudden you feel like that person is going to me for everything that they need? Or you ever been in a relationship where you realize, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, I'm going to them to get what I should get from God. What would it be like in this relationship that I asked you to think about, this little group of people or this little person with whom they maybe have a shot of speaking for you, this person that the trust is getting there? What would it look like for you to every day go to God and say, God, here's this person. I love this person. Do you have anything you want to give to this person through me? What about if that was your posture? Because at the end of the day, I'm a server. I'm a server. I'm at Applebee's. I'm not at Applebee's, but that's my role is just to go to get from the chef what the chef has prepared for the person, which is going to be way better than what I've prepared for the person because usually what I've prepared for the person is a big old plate of something else. No, I'm going to get what God wants for that person. I'm going to give that real humbly to that person. I have a friend that every once in a while, he texts me and he says, Steve, can I share with you what I feel like I'm hearing from God about you? You know what I like? Every time I gulp because I trust this person. This person I think does hear from God. And then, so I usually say, yes, go ahead. And this person will say just really beautiful things like, I just really feel like God wants you to know how proud God is of you as a father right now. And it will usually be right at a moment that, I mean, like that's, you know, that would be a good thing to hear from me. What would it be like for you to have that attitude? I'm a server. And I serve God. and part of how I serve God is by bringing to this person that I'm building trust with what God might want to give for them as a gift. Would you think about doing that? Setting up a practice in your day that asks God what gift that God wants to give to this person through you. I wonder what would happen if we just begin to be committed to doing that. Humbly. In Philippians 2, 1 through 4, we read about this kind of attitude. Paul writes this, Therefore, if any of you have any encouragement of being united with Christ, which, you know, I just, again, that's one of those phrases that you just read in the Bible. Oh, encouragement of being united with Christ. But that's crazy. Like, you're united with Christ, which means that you have every resource that Christ has at your disposal. If any of you have any encouragement of being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, that's what I just talked about. If any tenderness and compassion, if you have a heartbeat as it relates to the life of Christ in you, then make my joy complete, Paul writes, by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. We are all servers in the kingdom, Paul is saying. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Ouch! But then Paul writes, see, if you live like that, connected to God's spirit, you'll realize that doing nothing out of vain ambition, vain conceit or selfish ambition is one of the freest ways to live because you're not defending anything anymore. It's like, I don't need to. I get what I need from God. Rather in humility, valuing others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests, but each of you to the interests of the others. And that does not mean that you don't take care of yourself. It doesn't mean you don't have boundaries. It doesn't mean that you don't look to your own interests. It simply means you also look to the interests of others. And every once in a while, look to the others as if they actually were more important than you. They're not more important than you, but if you looked at them as more important than you, sometimes it would be like, whoa, then actually I might get over myself. Which would be a beautiful, beautiful gift. Dear brother, faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord is what Paul calls titchkus. and it's why it enabled him to trust him to give his heart away. The word for fellow servant is sundulas. It means to be a servant or slave of the same Lord. If you were a Greek person and you worked in the house of an important person, that was the Lord. And so all the other servants that worked with you were sundulas of you. You just were sundulas together. And Paul is saying, Titichkis and I, we are simply sundalos. We are servants of the same Lord. And so people with this kind of trust understand who's really calling the plays. The Lord is. This one gets so confusing, I think, for us. As one of us starts calling the plays or the other person, we feel like the other person's trying to call all the plays. You're trying to call all the plays. You're not the play caller. God's the play caller. Come on, you know, and then you're actually calling the plays right there. what would it look like to humbly submit and say oh you know what the Lord really is the risen Lord who sits at the right hand of the Father at this moment is leading his church at this moment has a desire and will for his church at this very moment so being servants of the same Lord means saying that we are looking to the Lord to give us our direction and we're not going to move until we know what it is and when we know what it is, we're going to move there. What would it mean for the two of you or the little small group of you to just have an honest conversation about who's really calling the plays here? Like, is our fear calling the plays here? Is one of us calling the plays? How is it that we're actually seeking Jesus and his will in our relationship? How do we do that together? Do we have a process for that or a practice around that? How is it that we're doing that together? Wouldn't that be a fascinating conversation to have? I mean, in the church, you feel like, oh, yeah, we always want to do God's will, but we don't have any kind of way in which to talk about that. Like, are we actually trying to do God's will in our life and in our relationship? And how would we know? So what would it look like for you to have a conversation about that? Whoa. I mean, that's radical. but it brings up another question and that is let's say you're you've been in a relationship with someone like that and you know what you were rooted in in jesus and having the mystery of christ revealed in people and and for the for the most part you were trying to serve each other and trying to give each other what god has for you and really you were serving god and really all three of those things were clicking along as best and as humanly possible they're not perfect they never will be, but now that relationship is over because of a disagreement or a battle or a thing you couldn't get past. Trust was broken. So what about when you disagree and trust has been broken? What do you do then? Well, in the book of Acts, we read about this happening with Paul. And so Acts 15, just real quick, 36 through 40, we read this. Sometime later, Paul said to Barnabas, and I love this sort of an ENFP kind of plan. He says, let's go back and visit all the believers in all the towns where we preach the word of the Lord. And let's just see how they're doing. Wouldn't that be awesome, Barnabas? I mean, let's just go take a three-year tour and do that. Me and you, it's going to be awesome. Doing the deal, seeing everybody, seeing how they're doing. It'll be great, won't it? I mean, it'll encourage us. It'll encourage them. Let's do it. And frankly, I'm bored of where we're at right now, so let's go. I don't know if that's actually what he was thinking, but that's my interpretation of it. Barnabas is like, totally, let's go. I'm with you, but let's take John Mark. And then the conversation got real quiet. And Paul's like, but Paul did not think it wise. That meant Paul was absolutely unbending about the fact that he did not want John Mark to go. He didn't trust John Mark. John Mark deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work. You gotta be kidding me, Barnabas. That guy is not going with us. Well, they had such a sharp disagreement, we read, that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus, but Paul chose Silas and left, commanded by the believers to the grace of the Lord. question. Who was right in that situation? Nervous giggling, I hear. Who was right? Was Paul right? Or was Barnabas right? When it comes to these kind of disagreements between people who especially are united, I mean, Paul and Barnabas united in all three of these things. When disagreements like this happen, disagreements are sometimes bigger than what is right and what is wrong. Sometimes it's about right, and sometimes it's about wrong, and sometimes I'm right and you're wrong, and sometimes you're right and I'm wrong. But here's what I want to say to you. Sometimes it's two people that love God and love each other and they just cannot make it right at the moment. They talk about it. They break it down. They disagree. And at the end of the day, they go, you know what? I got to go this way and you got to go this way. And when that happens, gang, It's so easy to surround yourself with people who will go, you're right and they're wrong. You're right. I can't believe the audacity of that other person. I mean, Barnabas, unbelievable. And I think the thing that Christ would have us do in the spirit of unity in his church would be to say, you know what? That person loves God, and that person's trying to follow God, and I don't know everything that happened between us. What I'm praying for is God's will to be done, and I'm going to follow God where I'm discerning God's going to lead me to go. But I'm not going to fall into the trap of agreeing with you that that person's wrong. The minute you let that in, it's a prison. Because sometimes God is in these things too, where people disagree and have to part ways. And when that happens, it's like, okay, Lord, you're the Lord, and I'm on my knees, and that's what I can do. Because disagreements are not always the end of the story. Amen? In fact, Colossians 4.10, the very next verse we'll hit next week. Paul writes this, My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings. As does his other fellow prisoner, guess who? John Mark. They've had a little time in the cell to talk. Hey, bro, remember that time in Pamphylia or whatever that? I mean, what was going on? Well, you have received instructions about him, and if he comes to you, Paul writes, welcome him. What does that mean to you? That the disagreement wasn't the end of the story. So we can get on our knees and go, okay, Lord, you do what you do and I will partner with what you want me to do in this relationship, wherever it might go. I'm open to you. I'm not going to hold on to the resentments. I'm going to be honest about what happened, but I'm not going to hold on to the resentments. Because here's the bewildering and beautiful thought that I want to leave you with as it relates to people that you build trust in, people that can speak for you. Here's the wonderfully thought is that Jesus has trusted us to speak for him. You ever thought about that? I mean, like, that's his plan. He died, rose again, has built his church, gives gifts to the church, and now he's saying to the church, now I want you to speak for me. To which I say, horrible idea! I mean, come on! You know us? We don't even like each other! And he's like, I know, isn't that awesome? You don't even like each other. And I'm still going to speak through you. Yeah, but we don't even agree with each other on some pretty important things. I know, isn't that awesome? I mean, I can't wait to see what happens. Oh, man, I mean, because remember his disciples? Twelve people that couldn't have been more dissimilar. Judas. Peter. Jesus you want us to speak for you? well if that's true then we better be united by rooting something much bigger than our similarities you know and we better start taking the posture of a servant we better drape the towel over our arms and start washing each other's feet a whole lot more than we do and start believing listen I'm not calling the plays the Lord is calling the plays I'm just trying to follow and you're a teammate of mine even though we might not disagree on some pretty important things at the end of the day. We're rooted in something much, much bigger than whether or not we agree on something or whether or not we read the same books or listen to the same podcasts or like the same Facebook posts. We're rooted in the mission of Jesus in the world which is to make right that which is wrong. So we'll keep singing until that day comes, amen? Because the Lord Jesus, who is sitting at the right hand of the Father and leading his church, is calling us to speak for him. So let's be rooted in him. And let's see as our role, we're servers. I mean, that is the deal. And Jesus himself is calling the place. So it's up to us to try to discern what Jesus is saying and then do his will in the world and in our hearts. Amen? And if you're new around here, that is at the heartbeat of what we're about as a church. At this church, this is a beautiful church. It's also a beautifully messy church that is so imperfect. And if you stick around here for any length of time, I promise you, you will be disappointed. Oh, man. I'm, oh, so disappointed by something Dave said. Or something I said. Or why doesn't Joel sing that one song? We haven't sung that song since 1984. It would really be great if we sang that song because I really, and that's awesome, but I'm just telling you, that can't be what keeps you here. I like, I don't know, I like those. Where are those one people that used to come here? They're not here anymore. Well, that's sad, isn't it? But what are we going to unite around? What are we going to deeply unite around? Well, we want to unite around something that's bigger than all those things. Amen? Stand with you for the benediction.
