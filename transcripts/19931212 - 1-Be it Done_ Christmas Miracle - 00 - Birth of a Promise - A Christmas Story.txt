At the top of my notes, this morning I had a little note to myself. It says, angelic assistance. Sounds kind of weird, I'm sure, maybe to you. In the middle of the week, I really felt the Spirit of God impressed on my heart, the need for angelic assistance in the preparation of this Word and in the preaching of it. Every week I come to this time and I pray for the power of the Spirit. I'm going to do that in a minute, again. But for reasons that may become apparent as I go into this, I'm going to ask for angelic assistance as well. And I'm telling you, because even if you don't understand that, I like you as best you know how to enter into the prayer with me around that. Let's pray. Jesus, I really do adore you. And I am among many people who do. My heart is full from two services already and the worship we've just had, and I'm full from anticipation of the word you've given for this week to me, now to deliver. And I do pray for the power of your Spirit, as always we do. For there is an overwhelming sense every time we break open your word, that without the overwhelming power of your Spirit, the breath of God, this is nothing but a recitation of nice but meaningless and empty words, so come Holy Spirit. But, Father, you have impressed on my heart and have confirmed the joy of it in the prior services of angelic assistance. And so simply with my words I ask for angelic assistance. To preach, angelic assistance, to hear. God, I don't want to be disrespectful in any way, but honestly, I just want to say what's in my heart. If Gabriel's available, that'd be good. That'd be good. But we want your presence and angelic presence. In Jesus' name, amen. I pray like that. I really do pray like that. Yeah. Now, in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth. to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the descendants of David, and the virgin's name was Mary. Right in the middle, beloved, of events that I believe for many of us could be described this season as Christmas chaos, I would like to, this week and the week of Christmas, that would be the 25th and 26th, take some liberty in the pulpit and withdraw from our study just for a brief time in Acts, specifically Acts chapter 20, to come around the events that during this season we suppose to be celebrating. I want to talk this week and the weekend of Christmas about the incarnation with you. I want to talk about the coming of a child, the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, but as it relates to that issue of the incarnation, what I want to focus on most specifically is the girl, the young girl, to whom that child came. I want to speak to you these two weeks about Mary. It all began in the text that I just read but did not identify for you. Luke chapter 1, verse 26 and following. If you have your Bibles, open with me to that text. Luke chapter 1 verse 26 we will cover through verse 38 this morning and as you're looking I'll just kind of get you up to speed with what I just read the angel in the presence of God was sent to Galilee from Galilee to Nazareth from Nazareth to Mary and Joseph from Mary and Joseph specifically to Mary now eye to eye with this young woman he brings this message verse 28 saying this Hail, favored one, the Lord is with you. Hail there means beyond just listen to me. I want to get your attention, Mary. The word literally means rejoice. Mary, get your joy up here. There is something I am about to tell you that is worth rejoicing. I've got some good news for you, for you are a favored one. The angel then says the same thing to her in verse 30 when he adds this. do not be afraid either. Why? Because you are or you have found favor with God. That word favor is important for what it means literally is this, grace. You are a graced one. Mary, get your joy up here for a minute because grace has come to you. Grace is about to come to you. Mary, what I want you to do is open yourself wide for the grace that is about to come to you. And he hasn't told Mary this yet, But this grace that is going to come to her, to you, Mary, is not just going to kind of come to you in some ethereal sense. It is going to come and live in you. So get your joy up. I've got some good news for you. Don't be afraid. You have found favor. We hear the phrase, Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Somebody didn't just make that up out of the blue and decide to recite it. That's Luke chapter 1, verse 28. Later on in the same chapter, verse 41, Elizabeth had come to Mary, and Elizabeth, by the way, was the mother-to-be of John the Baptist. And when Elizabeth came into the presence of Mary, having already received this promise Mary had, the Spirit of God moved in the little baby that was in her, John the Baptist. And immediately, as by a word from the Spirit, Elizabeth knew something about Mary. And Elizabeth says this to Mary, Blessed, Mary, are you among women. And blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. That's Luke chapter 1, verse 42. If you are from a Catholic background, those words that I have just recited for you, Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Are words familiar to you, and may be precious to you. If you are from Protestant background, as I am, The truth is, those words may make you a bit nervous, actually. I believe in reaction to what we believe as Protestants is an excess on the part of our Catholic brothers and sisters as it relates to Mary, our sense that among our Catholic brethren there are those who would deify her, make her superhuman, maybe more than superhuman, make her even equal with Jesus. Our Protestant perspective has caused us to withdraw from that, hopefully not from our brothers and sisters in Catholicism, but withdraw from that view of Mary that would see her as equal with Christ. But you know what I'm discovering and have this week as I got into this text? That for our reaction, for my reaction that way, we are left, beloved, with very little understanding of. and very little appreciation for what I want to call this morning the merry miracle. The merry miracle is fourfold. The first part of the merry miracle is this. Please hear this. It's a wonderful thing. The first part of the merry miracle is, number one, that God would, by a work of His Spirit, to the glory of God, come alive inside of Mary. God's Son would come alive inside of Mary. Verse 31, And behold, you will conceive. There will come life to you. Not only that, number two, second part of the miracle, is that the Son of God that is going to come alive inside of you, Mary, is also going to grow in you, Mary, for you will bear a son. The word bear there doesn't simply mean come to term, bring it to term. It means to carry. You will not only have life planted inside of you, but the life planted inside of you will swell your womb and you will grow. It will stretch you. It will grow in you. You will bear it. And I think it is important to enter in to the picture of a woman receiving life in her womb and from that life beginning to bear that life. But not only that, Mary, there's another part of this miracle that's going to come to you. The Son of God is going to come alive in you. The Son of God is going to grow in you. Third thing, the Son of God and His life is going to come from you. And when He does, you will name Him Jesus, for He will save His people from their sin. End of verse 31, you shall name Him Jesus. But there's another part of this miracle. Not only is the life of God, His Son Jesus, going to be planted in you and come alive in you, and not only is it going to grow in you, and not only is it going to come from you, but as it comes from you, it is radically going to change the world around you forever and ever. And Mary, here's why this life that is planted in you, growing in you, coming from you, is going to change the world around you. It will not be because you are so great, Though you are precious, you are not great. But the one born in you, coming from you, verse 32, he will be great. He will be great. And he will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will have no... And that's what I'm going to do in you. That's the life I'm bringing to you. That's the life I'm going to grow in you. That's the life I'm going to bring from you to change the world around you. Pretty heady stuff for a little girl in Nazareth. You know what I wonder? I wonder this. If as I said those words describing the fourfold aspects of the Mary miracle, if you heard what I heard, for as I described the merry miracle the way I just did, and as I hear the words in the order that I gave them, there is for me a light that goes on inside of me, helping me to see something I've never seen before as it relates to this story. The things I'm about to say I've seen before, but not as it relates to this story. And the light that went on is this, that this historic record of the incarnation of the Lord Jesus Christ in Luke chapter 1 is more than an accurate recording of the fact that in fact the miracle that came to Mary is a miracle that since the time of Mary, hear me, has happened over and over and over and over and over again. what are you talking about I believe it can be argued beloved and I think it can be argued successfully for I am going to do it and hopefully successfully that Mary is what we might call a prototype a prototype defined is simply this the first of a kind the first of a kind and Mary I believe is the first of a kind in this way hear me Mary is the first person ever that Jesus Christ, the Son of God came alive inside of Jesus Christ came alive inside of Mary but she was just the first for since Jesus Christ came alive inside of Mary whoever else he has done that in I don't need to stand in front of you and say this he has come alive inside of me too he did not take his residence in my womb I don't have one. He has, however. He has, however. And this is where we all get in on the Mary miracle. For it is not just for women. It started with Mary. But the Mary miracle is this, that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, has taken his life and planted it inside my heart. And like the womb that swells, my heart has grown too since that life came inside me. For the Mary miracle is Jesus, the Son of God, alive in people, not just alive in people, growing inside of people, not just growing inside of people, coming from people, not just coming from people in some benign sense, but as the Son of God comes from people in whom He lives, in whom He grows. That expression of His life radically changes the world around us. And that has happened in my life and that has happened in your life if you are among the redeemed. The Mary miracle. Is Christ alive in us? See, what happened to Mary in a physical sense has happened to us if we are redeemed in a spiritual sense. 1 Peter 1.23 says, We are born of a righteous seed. The Greek word there is almost indelicate for seed, spermata. We are born the same kind of miracle that was done in Mary's physical body, bringing the life of Christ, has been done in us spiritually. It is the same miracle. It is just as real, and it is just as necessary. Christ in you, Colossians 1.27 says, is your hope of glory. And this Christ in you dynamic, Colossians 1.26 calls it the mystery. This Christ in you thing is a mystery which has been hidden from past ages and generations. But now, good news, good news, rejoice. Get your joy out. It's being revealed now. It is now being made manifest. Started with Mary. Beloved, the glory of the Christmas story isn't just that Christ came alive in Mary. It is that. The glory of the Christmas message, however, is this, that that same Jesus that came alive in her has come alive in me and come alive in you. But Mary was the first. So in the spirit of the text, we think this morning of Mary and say to Mary, rejoice, favored one. Get your joy up, Mary, for grace has come to you. Open yourself wide to this grace. Open yourself wide. Blessed are you and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus, For we have been by that fruit, been blessed ourselves. Pull all that together that I've just said to you. And I have something this morning to say to you that may sound odd, but I think it's wonderful and good. In fact, what I'm about to say to you is the point of my sermon, and it is more than the point of my sermon. It's the passion of my heart. It's this. Have yourself a merry Christmas. I'm going to just bless it on you, give it to you. Have yourself a merry Christmas. And by that, I think you know what I mean. Here's what it means. Have yourself a merry Christmas. Have a Christ alive in you, Christmas. Have A Christ coming to life in you, Christmas. Oh, let's even get it better than that. Have A Christ growing in you, Christmas. Let's even do better than that. Have a Christ that has come alive in you and is growing in you, coming through you, Christmas. Have a Christ alive in you, growing in you, coming from you, affecting the world around you, Christmas. Have a merry Christmas. You know what I hope? I hope you never hear merry Christmas the same again. I hope you never do. I hope you don't even have to make any comment every time you hear it on secular radio or anywhere else. Merry Christmas, Christ in me, growing in me, coming from me, changing the world around me. Rejoice! Get your joy! i like this i do like this you know what you know what if i felt this was a play i'd like right now to play the part of the angel i would like to do it i know that's hard for you to believe but i love drama i i really get into that i like that and if this was a play stop it if this was a play and we're doing that we're gonna play this out i would go oh oh oh i want to copy the angel i want to be the angel. And if I was the angel, angelically assisted, I pray I am right now, because this is more than me talking. This is so important for our body and every believer, I think. I would say this, rejoice, open door. Rejoice, all of you who ever hear my voice. Get your joy up. For grace has come. I bring good tidings of great joy. Grace has come to us. Open yourself wide to this grace. The Son of God has come to live in us. The Son of God has come to grow in us. The Son of God has come to live His life through us, express Himself through us. And the Son of God has come to change the world around us, even unbelievably using us in the process of that. What an incredible thing. Merry Christmas! Now, for those of you who may be slow of hearing, I really do want to become Gabriel. Now, I can't do it, but I want to be. You know, there was someone in the text earlier on who was slow of hearing. A promise from God was coming to Zacharias over here in verse 9, 18. And the promise to Zacharias was not going to be related to Mary, but related to his wife, Elizabeth, who was going to be the recipient of the life of John the Baptist. But this was an impossible thing, just like it was impossible for Mary to have what was going to happen to her. For Elizabeth, Zacharias' wife, was advanced in years, and so was Zacharias, but she had been barren all her life. And so the angel came and told Zacharias that this would happen, and Zechariah said, you've got to be kidding me. How do I know this for certain? Prove it to me. For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years. Listen to what Gabriel does. And the angel answered and said to him, I am Gabriel. What more do you want? How do you know this for certain? I'm Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you, to bring to you this good news. I am not Gabriel. The best I can do is this. I am David. I am David. Who stands in the presence of the Lord God Most High. And I do believe. I have been on this weekend sent to you. To speak to you. And to bring to you this good news. Here's the good news. Jesus wants to come alive in you. Jesus wants to grow in you. Jesus wants to come from you. And Jesus wants to change the world around you. Have a Merry Christmas. Amen. Choir, just before I preach, sang a great song, The First Noel. Noel is a French word that means carol or Christmas song. The First Noel is the first song that the angels did sing. And the angels did sing it. That's how the song goes. The angels, the first Noel. The angels, they sang it after the birth of Christ, proclaiming the birth of the king. You know what? There was a song before that song, and it wasn't the angels' song. You know whose song it was? Or somebody sang a song. It was Mary's song. And again, because of my... I'm just delighted this week because I'm learning stuff I never saw before. We were so scared of Mary. You know, if you're a Catholic among us, just forgive us, okay? Give us a break. But if you're Protestant, if you're from my, you kind of understand what I mean. I never knew she had a song. She had a song, Mary did. When the wonder of the miracle that was going to come to her dawned on her, it's called the Magnificat. It's from the Latin, which means to magnify the Lord. And when the promise of God that was going to come and give life inside her and grow in her and come from her dawned on her, she said, my soul exalts the Lord. She just worshiped. My spirit has rejoiced in the God of my salvation, for he has had regard on the humble state of me. Wow! Let me ask my paraphrase. I think she said wow. For the mighty one, the mighty one, has done great things for me. Stop right there. He's done great things for me. Mary, look around. What do you mean great things? What was the great thing? Obviously, you know I've been spouting it off. But look at her life. This baby was going to be born in a cave. Thousands of babies were going to be dying. And she was going to have to bear some of that, I am sure, in her spirit for the sake of the baby that was being born to her. For Herod would move and kill thousands of babies because this baby was going to be born. She was not going to have pleasant circumstances all her life. Those were not the mighty deeds. The mighty deeds, the mighty one giving to her was this. His life is going to come inside me and grow in me and come from me and change the world around me. I rejoice. My soul exalts. She goes on to verse 35. exalting and magnifying the Lord. I don't have time to develop it, but in verse 51 to 53, if you read it, you know what you'll find in those verses? The Beatitudes. For He fills the poor, and He brings those who are broken to Himself, and He sends away the rich empty-handed because the rich don't have a sense of need. I'm delighted that I discovered her song. but here's what my heart says finally to this song and I really wish I could say it to Mary so I'm going to say it to Mary. Mary I love your song and I love your faith and I love that when this promise came to you you did receive it and you said okay for she did in verse 38 but Mary I got some really good news for you the good news is this your song it's become my song you know why here's why Mary because the son of God that came to you has come to me and the son of God that put his life in you put his life in me and the son of God that grew in you is growing in me and the son of God that expressed himself through you is in ways that I don't even know sometimes, expressing Himself through me, changing the world around me. And you know what it makes me do? It makes me want to say this. My soul exalts the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior, for He has regard for my humble estate. And He saw me, and He said, life goes there, life goes there. Now, I've got a question for you. How many of you are sitting here going, David, David, it's not Mary's song, but you need to know it's not your song either. It's my song too. How many of you are thinking, this is my song too. For life has come to me. And life is growing in me. And his life is coming through me. And his life in ways that I don't even see sometimes is changing the world around me too. It's my song too. How many of you say that? A lot of you say that. I knew you would. I knew you would. That's why it's so fun to give it to you. Because you can join me in singing it. My soul exalts the Lord. My spirit rejoiced in God, for he has regarded our humble state and he's put his life in us. The mighty one has done great things for us. Okay, let's slow down. I need to slow down. Back off and pick out what I will call from this text some choice truth. The reason I'm calling it choice truth is because I don't have an outline. So we'll just kind of... By the way, you notice that I do that often. I kind of go through a text and then I stop and I go, well, let's go do this again. That's what we're going to do. We're just going to go back to the beginning here. I want to pick some things out that blessed me. The angel Gabriel was sent from God to the city of Galilee called Nazareth, comes to Mary. I want you to get this picture. Gabriel is in the presence of God, and he's looking at the eyes of the Father. the Bible tells us that all of the angels, and you can get this picture in your mind, it is helpful to me, all of the angels, the hosts of heaven, are constantly looking at the eyes of God the Father. And whether that is a literal thing or a metaphor to help us kind of enter into the way it works, it doesn't matter to me. It is the way I see it. And we've got biblical support to see it that way. And these angels are waiting for assignment. And from the eyes of the Father, He just dispatches angels to God's people all through time to assist them and empower them along with the power of the Spirit to protect them sometimes. But angelic works, just like there are demonic forces that we recognize and pray against, there are angelic forces, far more of them, by the way, than any demon you could ever fear. Far more angels than demons. And Gabriel on this day was looking at the eyes of the Father and the Father said, today is the day, go and do the deed. And he flew, I don't know, Helps me to see it that way. To earth, found Galilee. In Galilee, found Nazareth. In Nazareth, found Mary and Joseph. And between Mary and Joseph, he knew it was Mary. Here's the thing that ministered to me. It's so simple that it's like I'm almost embarrassed. But I think if this dawned on Mary, it would have blessed her, and it does bless me. All that trouble. Mary, whatever else I want to say to you, I want you to know this. I know where you live. I like that. I know where you live. I will find you in Nazareth. You know, I almost want to say God-forsaken place. Well, obviously, it's not a God-forsaken place. But I can find you there. And I hear the Spirit of God say to me, David, sometimes you do feel abandoned, and so do the people who are going to be listening to you on Sunday. tell them I know where they live. You know, in a gangster movie, it occurs to me that somebody would say that as a threat. I know where you live. And I'd be, whoa, he knows where I live. He's going to find me and kill me. God's people, he knows where you live. And I'm not talking about the gray or the blue or the white house you live in. He knows where you live. He knows what you're living in. I wish he always extracted us from those painful things that we might find ourselves in. but he came to her, and he knew where she lived. It says in verse 21, 9, that when the angel gave this message, that she was greatly troubled. Well, I guess so. If an angel appeared to me, I would be greatly troubled. I don't know if it's true, but Gabriel, well, I do think this is true, that Gabriel was of real significant rank in the angelic host, higher rank than other angels, And I don't know if that translates into bigger size, but I do it in my mind it's bigger, and so I think that would be pretty normal to be troubled to see Gabriel. But it doesn't say in the text that she was troubled because she saw the angel. She was troubled with what the angel said, it says. Greatly troubled at this statement and kept pondering what kind of salutation this might be. Here's what Mary wanted to know. Gabriel, what does it mean I'm favored? What does it mean the Lord is with me? In what way is this grace coming to me? And how on earth is this grace going to live in me, this life going to live in me? And how is it that all of that should make me rejoice? And the angel explains, as I've already explained in verse 31, well, you're going to conceive, meaning the life is going to come to you. And you're going to bear a son, meaning that life is going to grow in you. And you'll name him Jesus means that life will have come from you and it will change the world around you, not because you're a great Mary, but because he will be great. and in verse 33 after this litany of how great it is that this life expressed through her is going to be it says this and his kingdom will have no end i want to focus on that right now that there's a little choice truth there for when the angel says his kingdom will have no end i believe the angel is saying to Mary, among other things, this. Mary, what I'm about to do inside of you, and what I'm about to do through you, if you allow it, if you receive it, what I want you to know is this, that once the life has been planted because you have received it, once the life has begun, there will be no stoppage of it. There will be no end to the kingdom and the work of the kingdom. And here's where I want you to get this. Whenever I think of no stoppage to the kingdom and the work of the kingdom, my eyes immediately go up and I think the kingdom of God in the world, more than in the world, in eternity and through eternity, the kingdom keeps advancing. But the angel is talking specifically to Mary and I want you to hear the angel speaking specifically to you because the specific word to Mary was this. The work of the kingdom Mary, not just in the world and in eternity, but literally in you, will have no stoppage. I am giving that to you almost as a warning. Once it is planted, there will be no turning back for I will bring to fruit in you and through you what that life in you does. What is set in motion by your consent. I will bring to fruit Philippians 1.6. Paul said this very same thing this way. I am confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until a day of salvation. Now, to that truth, both physically for Mary and spiritually for us, there are two very normal responses that I can think of. One would be excitement, just delirious excitement. I've got a promise right there. I've got a promise there that regardless of the dark days I go through or you go through, those times when I'm feeling abandoned, those times when the life of God may be in me and I'm hearing this promise, He's growing in me. But you know, there's certain times in pregnancy that you don't know if anything's really going on. You know, I don't see anything. I don't see anything. I will, what I planted in you, I will grow. I will. I get excited about that. But you know, want to know something? I think there's another appropriate response to that promise that I will grow in you what I've planted, what I've given life to, and that response would be fear. In fact, I think a little bit of fear would indicate you really heard what this promise is. That maybe if you're not afraid at all, Maybe you didn't even hear the promise, how big this is. Well, where would the fear come from, Dave? This just all sounds good. Well, believe me, it's good. It's life. Where's the fear? Well, the easiest place I can touch this is if you just stick with this pregnancy metaphor, this pregnancy model that we see modeled in Mary. For Mary, once you receive this life, Once you let it in, and here's something that might sound a bit indelicate, unless you yourself intervene and decide to stop what it is that God is doing in you or birthing in you, unless you somehow say, no, these things I've planted in you will be brought to term. By the way, I am aware that I just said something that could make some of you think if the only way this is being applied is to salvation, that you could somehow be saved and then not be saved. That is not the level at which I'm saying. Do you want to know something? I'm going to talk to believers right now. God, in your pilgrimage with Him, is birthing new things in your life all the time. Do you hear that? You've experienced that. And do you know something else? You have also experienced this. The times when God begins to birth a new thing in you, call you to deeper awareness, call you to a deeper understanding of grace. We went through a season in our life when we came alive to the gifts of the Spirit. Wasn't that a wonderful time? It was. It was also a scary time. God has called us recently to what I'm calling a larger place of faith. I've been using that terminology. Numbers of you are coming. What do you mean by that? My response, I still don't know. It's just a seed that God planted that I believe is going to grow unless we say no more. You know why I might say no more? Because it hurts. We would have to appeal to the women right now who have had children who would be able to give testimony of the life that gets planted in them as a miracle that they want more than anything and desire and love. But the truth is this, that life that begins to grow in them changes them. And sometimes the change translates in a glow. Oh, you're just glowing. My wife glowed like for three days. It was a glow. But other times this life that was growing in her hurt her and stretched her. And sometimes the life that grows in us marks us. In fact, it scars us. It occurs to me that if life comes to us, again, we could hear testimony from the women among us who've gone through this. That life grow in you, you know what? You get into that about seven or eight months and you don't look near as slick as you used to. Doesn't that work? It works for me. I don't want to be indelicate or disrespectful, but it's really true. You don't look near as slick as you used to. You walk kind of funny. I got a word for you. Beloved, I got a word for you. You let the life of God come inside of you and you let the life of God start to grow in you and you're going to walk different. You are going to walk different. and you might have people in this world who are walking to a different step but God in us is going to make us walk different. You may walk funny. You still want this life because you may walk. Peter calls us a peculiar people who are out of step with this world. Mary said, let it be. I want to hear your hearts. Let it be. Let it be. I'm willing to walk funny. could mark you, it could scar you. Seventeen years ago, this last October, my wife and I, Bonnie, Bonnie and I, were walking outside St. Mary's Hospital. And at that time, my wife had growing within her our first child. Turned out to be Andrea. and we were at this time at St. Mary's Hospital on a break in a class where we were learning how to deal with this pregnancy of my wife's and we had just come from a session where they described in rather graphic terms what this process would be like how it was this baby would grow in her the kinds of things she might experience and then a rather graphic description of what the process of birth giving would be like. And in anticipation of this child and the preparation for this child, my wife and I were delighted. And we were very much like Mary, I'm sure, when the promise came, let it be, let it be. Oh, oh, this is such a wonderful thing. And after we saw this and heard these things, my wife was in the parking lot and she began to weep and I knew why. And she was scared and she says, Dave, I'm scared. I don't know if I can do this. I don't know if I can do this. I want this more than anything else. I think she felt what every woman feels. It didn't even occur to us to do anything about that so that Bonnie wouldn't have to go through the pain, for there were options available to us, as they are to us now. She could have chosen to end this process. We didn't think about that at the time. it was more at that stage of the life in her growing a re-acceptance of what was going on in her and we held one another and we went through the process and in great agony and pain as many women can attest from that agony and pain there came life a little baby named Drea who was turned into a warrior in the kingdom but I want to tell you something about my wife and I've asked her permission to say this for it is rather private but you want to know something? My wife is marked by that by the giving of life to four little children my wife is forever scarred by that but she gave life but it marked her it marked her so the appropriate question after that clear teaching would be this do you still want that life well yeah i want it to come to me but i just don't want to grow in me it doesn't work like that it doesn't work like that because it will be life but it will mark you and stretch you and change you and that changing and that growing different than other pregnancies, this one will never end. There's the good news. This kingdom, this kingdom, this kingdom work in you will never end. And you want to know something? Now I don't have to just get the women up here to give testimony. I could give every person, man or woman, boy and girl who's ever walked with God for any length of time, give testimony to that. You know what? God, God birthed this in me. And now I'm not talking about salvation. And then he birthed this in me, and as he was birthing that, it grew, and it hurt, and I stretched, and I didn't think I'd be able to do it, and I didn't, I almost wanted to stop it, and we could also give testimony of times we have stopped it. Couldn't you? I could, where I said no, and I aborted a work of God in me. Couldn't do the pain. Oh, so you're painting such a dark picture. It's not a dark picture, because I want to tell you something. He will bring to completion life every time. Life every time. Mary's response to this promise comes in verse 38 when she says be it unto me but first she has a question verse 34 good question it's this how can this be since I am a virgin how can this life come inside of me because I'm a virgin here's Mary's question I have heard the promise of life to be planted in me and I want that life in me but how can it be I am not qualified. Now here's an irony here. I'm sure you've already heard it. What disqualified Mary in her mind for this miracle of life in her was her virginity. Now what's ironic about that is we've all heard teaching on Jesus' birth and Jesus being born of a virgin and how the requirement was that Jesus be born of a virgin. And that teaching is true and real and I want to leave it over here for another time. For the point of this text is another application that we can enter into. For the virginity of Mary that in some sense, in another context, did qualify her to Mary's way of thinking, disqualified her. I don't get it. Hear Mary's heart. She would be saying this, Angel Gabriel, I want this thing done in me, but I have not done the thing you have to do to get the life you're talking about. I have not been alive that long, but I have some sense of history. There has never been a person on the face of the earth that has ever had life in them without doing something, and I haven't done that thing. To get life in me, there's got to be something that you do in the flesh, that you perform in the flesh to make that happen. And I have not done that thing. I am therefore by my virginity disqualified. Hear now the gospel. The grace. Hear now the work of creation born of the Spirit. Hear now the application spiritually to a work of recreation. For the angel said to her, verse 35, Mary, it is the fact that you have not had a physical union that does make you qualified for this because what I want to do in you is something no man can do. It is a God work. The Holy Spirit will come upon you. The power of the Most High will overshadow you and for that reason, not your fleshy manipulation or your work at all, For that reason, the Holy One of God will be born in you, grow in you, come from you. It's going to be a work of the Spirit. The word overshadow there is kind of cool. Episciadzo. Compound word, skia, means shadow. Comes from skuneo. Another part of the word skuneo means to tent. Literally, the phrase is the shadow of a tent to stay over you. now a tent to them was different than a tent is to us a tent to me is what I take with me to Taylor's Falls on a camping trip a tent to them is where they live what the angel is saying to Mary is this Mary, God is going to be the place you live and his son is going to be in you and his son is going to grow in you and his son is going to come from you and change the world around you but it's so incredible Mary because not only is it going to be in you but he is going to be the place you live he is going to be the tent around you apply that to yourself if you're redeemed the son of God in you, growing in you coming from you, changing the world but more than that, God is a shadow overshadowing you he is a tent over you among other things what I like about that is I can't get away from him not only is he in me, he's around me he's all over me, he's all over you one of the darkest times in my life. I'll never forget it. I was sitting on a chaise lounge feeling incredibly distant from God and wanting to get away from God. And I remember it just came over me, came over me like a, just like a wave. None of the circumstances in my life changed. I began to sob at a time that I didn't feel like I wanted to sob. I wanted to shake my fist at God. But the word finally came, I cannot get away from you. I really do belong to you. After everything is said and done. I am the place. You are the place I live. I live in God, and He lives in me. And Mary, that's what I'm going to do if you say yes. This life of Christ in you, Mary, I will plant it if you will receive it. I will grow it if you will bear it. I will complete it if you will allow it and nurture it and embrace it. You know, I'll tell you, this giving birth thing, this picture of giving birth, I've never thought of it like this before, but it may be one of the most graphic examples of what the spiritual life really is like. Because while I'm talking about the Spirit's work in us and we just receive it, you get a picture of a woman giving birth, and there is a compulsion inside of you when that baby comes. I mean, you don't decide the time. You can jump on a pogo stick if you want, but you don't decide the time. It comes when it comes, right? But you want to know something? to think that you are not an active participant in that would be the most ludicrous thing in the world. I mean you are an active participant in what God is doing in your life and it's just a powerful picture. Maybe you can even go with it someplace where I am not touching but that's my life with God. He moves and he touches and he brings life and he grows things but I know I'm an active participant and I can resist and say but let it be unto me said Mary. make no mistake Mary if you receive this there will be no stoppage of it I will grow in you and I will press you and call you and stretch you and scar you possibly Mary's response is beautiful verse 38 I close with this behold the bond slave of the Lord she start to. I love that. Just picture it. Behold, here I am. Here I am, big old Mary. Big, I'm a rock the world Mary. No, just me. It's just me. Nazareth person, am I? All I can say to you is this, be it done to me according to your word. Question, do you think Mary knew all of what was going to happen to her when she said yes to this? Do you think she knew how it would grow in her, how it might even hurt her, how people might miss it. Do you think she knew? You know what I think about that? I don't think she knew any more than you knew the day you said, let it be unto me, just as your word has said. I want to receive your life. And you knew everything about what that was going to say? No, you didn't. That's a powerful question. Did she know? In fact, it's the question I want to deal with when we come back on Christmas Day. I want to ask of Mary. Mary, what did it cost you? How did it feel? How did it grow in you? I have no idea what I'm going to say that day, but that's the question I'm going to ask. You know what I wonder? I wonder how many of you right now are saying in your spirit, I want to say what Mary said. Let it be into me just as your word has said. First of all, I wonder how many who are not redeemed, who've never come into the Mary miracle who would say this morning for the first time, I mean, this is possible. I mean, this isn't just religion. I mean, this is God alive in me. That's a real, yeah. Yeah. I wonder how many among us would say, let it be done to me, just as you said. I had a lady after our, we had a share time like we have been having recently, and we're going to do it again this service. After that came up to me, tears in her eyes said, do you have anyone here who could tell me how to be introduced to Jesus this morning. And I had the joy of ushering her to someone who could. And I blessed her as she went and watched that interchange take place between two people, and the life of God got planted in her. She got pregnant. That's real gross. But you know what? I got pregnant too. I'm pregnant. Life of God's in me. I love that. Say it. Say it. Life of God's in me. Say it. Life of God's in me. Now go. Point of the sermon passion to my heart. That we have a Merry Christmas. That's my passion. That we have a Merry Christmas. And what I mean by that, I think you know now. It's a Christ coming alive in you Christmas. It's a Christ growing in you Christmas. And you want to know something? Christ growing in you this Christmas might mean some of you will have some pain in your Christmas. It's a Christ coming from us Christmas. It's a Christ changing the world and touching the world around us Christmas. And I just believe there's many, many of you who say to that, I wish you a Merry Christmas, want to say back to me, David, be it unto me, just as you have said. And now I'm not just talking to people who haven't received Christ. I'm talking to those of you who have, who have said yes to Jesus for salvation, but you've said yes to Jesus again and again, and there was a time when you said no, and it was a long time, and then you said yes again, those things that God wants to birth in me. Anybody here want to say just generally to the Spirit of God today, be it unto me, be it unto me according to your word. I'm going to give you a chance to do it, just quietly if you want. Just think about saying it, be it unto me according you were. Be a dunder to me according to your word. Have yourself a merry Christmas. Be a dunder to me according to your word. Have a Christ alive in you Christmas. Be a dunder to me. Have a Christ growing in you Christmas. Be a dunder to me. Have a Christ coming from me Christmas. Be a dunder to me. Have a Christ affecting the world of Rome. Be a dunder to me. I want you to say it with me. Be a dunder to me. Ready? Be a dunder to me even as you have said. Say it again. Be a dunder to me even as you have said. I want you to stand with me. I really liked how that sounded. I really liked how that sounded. I want to do it again. If you feel free to raise your hands, I want to raise my hands. If you want to close your eyes, close your eyes. But I want to do it two ways. I want us to say, be it done to me even as you have said or just as you have said. I keep changing it so you're not going to be able to do this. but I don't know this is a body thing let's say it the second time be it done to us do this work in us as a church we receive your work even if it hurts us we're going to receive it because we believe you're going to complete it you're going to complete it be it done to me first of all once again raise your hands if you want close your eyes if you can be it done to me ready be it done to me just as you have said be it done to us be it done to us just as you have said. Dear Jesus, you have heard not only the voice of your people in this place, but you have heard our hearts. As we come to you and say, Jesus, we want you to do the merry miracle in us. Those of us who are redeemed, we want you alive in us in bigger ways, in different ways, in new ways. We want to know more about your life and your truth and your power toward us who believe. We want to know more about this larger place of faith, more about your gifts and more about your grace. And we recognize, Lord, that if we receive your life and more deeper aspects of your life, that that life will grow in us and it could be scary and it's okay to be afraid. We say yes to you and you've heard us. But I also want to say this to you, Lord, we believe you. We believe that you who began a good work in us will complete it, and you will do the growing, and you will do the stretching, and you will hang on to us as we enter into that process with you, and you will bring life from us in ways that we can't imagine to change the world around us. I pray that you seal this in our hearts and in our lives. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
