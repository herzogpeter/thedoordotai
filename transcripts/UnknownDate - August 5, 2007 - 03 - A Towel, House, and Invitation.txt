Holy Spirit of God, come into this place, in this place, and bring life and redemption and wholeness. Bring wholeness. Amen. Well, in some traditions of the church, when the Gospels are read, anytime anything from Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John is read, the people stand up for it. So I'm going to ask you to stand up for this reading. And if you can't physically stand up, that's okay. You can stand up in your spirit. And that's maybe even better. So I'm going to read from John chapter 13, starting in verse 1. and this story is written almost in real time. Every detail is given. John is really saying this passage is dripping with meaning. Starting in verse 1 of John 13, we read this. It was just before the Passover festival and Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave the world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. the evening meal was in progress and the devil had already prompted Judas the son of Simon Iscariot to betray Jesus and Jesus knew that the father had put all things under his power and that he had come from God and was returning to God so he got up from the meal took off his outer clothing and wrapped a towel around his waist and after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples feet drying them with a towel that was wrapped around him. And he came to Simon Peter who said to him, Lord, are you going to wash my feet? And Jesus replied, you don't realize now what I'm doing, which had never happened to Peter before. But later you will understand. No, said Peter, you shall never wash my feet. And Jesus answered, unless I wash you, you have no part with me. Then Lord Simon Peter replied, not just my feet, but my hands and my head as well. And Jesus answered, those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet. Their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you. For he knew who was going to betray him. And that was why he said that not everyone was clean. When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. Do you understand what I have done for you? He asked them. You call me teacher and Lord and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet, you should also wash one another's feet. I have set an example so that you should do as I have done for you. Very truly I tell you, servants are not greater than their master, nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them. You can be seated. so we hear this great story as a moral lesson that God this God of the universe through Jesus Christ stooped so low to wash our feet and we're blown away by that we're blown away by the fact that the creator of all things has our feet in his hands and we should be blown away and we see the paradox there between the creator of the universe and washing our feet and we sort of say, wow, that's just incredible. And then the moral lesson is, so you should go do it to others. You should wash each other's feet. Then we walk away and say, yeah, we should do that. But it's so much bigger than that. And I want to give you three words to help you understand what I think Jesus is doing in this passage. And the first word is towel. Back in John 13, 4, we read that when Jesus got up from the meal, the Passover meal, the last supper that he was sharing with his disciples, when he got up from the meal, he took off his outer garments and he exchanged them for a towel. Now, the verb that's used there in the Greek is a word called tithemi. And it's the same exact verb that Jesus uses when he uses the phrase, I lay down my life. I take off my clothes. I lay down my life. Same verb. John 15, 13, he says, greater love has no one than this that he tithame his life for his friends. Same verb. John 10, 11, I am the good shepherd, Jesus says. And the good shepherd, Tathamis, his life for his sheep, lays down his life. See, when Jesus takes off his outer garments and exchanges them for a towel, he shows that he is laying his very life down for us. That's the meaning that John wants us to see. That John is, in his brilliant way, painting for us. that the original readers would have seen right away. It's the same thing that we read in Philippians 2, verses 5-8 when Paul writes this. He says, your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus. That's almost all he needs to write, right? I mean, we could do a 17-year study on that. Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus, who, being in the very nature God, didn't consider equality with God, something to be grasped but made himself nothing taking the very nature of a servant taking off his clothes and putting on a towel being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even death on a cross and we read that set of verses and we read the first set of verses in John 13 and we say wow even though he was God even though he was God, he stooped down so low. But we should read it like this. Being in very nature God means precisely because he was God. Precisely because it is in the character of God to serve those he loves, Jesus shows us the full extent of that love. Jesus could do nothing else because he was God than stoop down low and exchange his clothes, his glory for a towel. And we should be awestruck by that. Not just that sort of the God who sits on high would stoop down so low, but that the God who sits on high is one who would stoop down so low. I mean, that is our God shown in Jesus. When we read that Jesus is the exact representation of God, one of the truest things about him is that he stoops low. Amen? The towel is the first word that we see. And the second word is house. In John 13, 5, remember, we read, After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with a towel that was wrapped around him. See, back in the day, obviously you've heard this before, but there was no paved roads. People walked on dusty roads and their feet got really hot and smelly. And before they would lay down, literally, they would recline on their elbow and stick their feet out on these low tables when they would eat. And so your face would be right next to someone's feet. nasty, smelly, warty feet. It would be very common for someone to have someone that they would wash their feet. And sometimes it was the people that would wash each other's feet and that was cool. And sometimes a servant would do it. Very rarely would a host do it. But Jesus takes on the character of the host. And he says, I'm gonna wash your feet. It's a very intimate thing. I don't know if you've ever gotten your feet washed by someone before. I have a few times. And it's a very weird thing. At first, you know, the context that I've done it has been like at camps and retreats and student ministry things. And all of a sudden the leader says, okay, now we're going to do something different. And the leaders are going to wash your feet. And people start bringing out towels and basins. And the first thing that goes through your mind is, oh, no. Because it's intimate. It's very intimate. But then when it happens, it's a way of knowing and being known that is inexpressible. So Jesus takes on the character of the host. And he's inviting you into something. He's inviting you into the home that he shares with his father. He's inviting his disciples to share in the intimacy and knowing that he shares with his father. In John 10, 14 and 15, in an almost redundant way, Jesus explains what he had just explained we read in John 10, 11. But he says in 14 and 15, I am the good shepherd. I know my sheep and my sheep know me just as the father knows me and I know the father and I lay down my life. I tithame me for the sheep. Jesus, when he washes his disciples' feet, is not only saying, I am laying down my life for you, but he's also saying, I, the host, am inviting you into the house of intimacy that I share with my father. I have some friends that live in Africa. And they have three kids, two little girls that are about 11 and 9, and then one little boy. His name is Bennett. He's five. And Bennett has got to know this family next door that also has a five-year-old son named Lucas. And they've become best friends and it's been very cool. Well, my friends, the Dykstras, went on this little trip. They went to go visit Victoria Falls. And when they came back, they heard some terrible news. They heard that the father of the next-door neighbor family had committed suicide. Inexplicitly. Just totally blew them away because it did not seem to be in his character to do that. And in that culture, in this instance, the woman was named as the reason for his death. And so the kids became orphans. And they had to be farmed out. And so my friends, the Dykstra's, thought about this little five-year-old boy named Lucas. And they thought, we need to invite him in. To our home. To our house. And I think about Bennett, this little five-year-old guy, his best friend named Lucas. And as he thinks about inviting Lucas in, even though it's his best friend, he is sharing his father's love with him. And yet the invitation goes out to this little boy that's really happening really recently right now. This little boy is invited into the intimacy of this family. And it's a beautiful thing. And Jesus does the same thing when he washes the feet of his disciples. He invites them into intimacy. We learn about Jesus and his expressly, his intense expression of love. When we read he loves them to the end. He shows the full extent of his love through a towel and through a house. And lastly, through an invitation. And I want to read the last couple verses that we read earlier from John 13 again. And Jesus says, Now that I, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet, you should also wash one another's feet. See, I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. Very truly, I tell you, servants are not greater than their master, nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them. But now that you know these things, you'll be blessed if you do them. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them. See, Jesus is issuing us an invitation because he is laying down his life to assume his identity, to love as he loved, and to give as he gave. He's issuing us an invitation to lay down our lives by washing each other's feet. And that is what John wants us to see. But the thing in that, in the church, my fear is that we get the doing part. Like we get the go and do, go and wash each other's feet. And we get that as leaders. We should do that. We just don't get the knowing part. And when we rush to the doing part, past the understanding that Jesus has laid his life down for us and it has divided us into intimacy with the Father. When we miss that and get into the doing alone, Everything gets kind of sideways. Amen? That we start doing things out of a should. And we all know what it feels like to be a leader, or most of us do, to be a leader and to serve the people that follow us. But we make sure that it's still positional. That we feel more important than them, and that's why we're going to serve them. I think Jesus, one of the reasons why he served his disciples in this way and in many other ways, was literally because he saw them as more important than himself. And that wasn't a weird thing. It wasn't a shaming thing or overly self-effacing thing. It was just he was so secure in who he was that he could see his followers as more important than him. And so when he washed their feet, what if? What if he did not on the way over there go, hmm, what's the program for the dinner? Well, first, I'm going to serve some hummus and pita bread. Secondly, I'm going to wash their feet because it's very important that they learn this lesson. What if he got there planning to share a Passover meal and he noticed there was no servant. And he noticed that people's feet were dirty. And so he just, being him, he just washed their feet. What if that was the character of the master that we call rabbi? That he would simply wash their feet because they were dirty. Doesn't that, isn't that more compelling and more majestic than some pre-planned teaching moment? Now, I don't know if that was the truth. But if Jesus, being the very nature of God, humbled himself to the point of death on the cross, it wouldn't surprise me that he could humble himself to the point of being a servant. So if we're going to assume his identity and do, we need to know. It needs to come out of a formation that's in us that is becoming more and more Christ-like, that we find ourselves serving. Not because we should do it, but because it's in our nature to serve and to put others in front of ourselves. Mother Teresa, one of the greatest examples of this in modern history. The story is told of her being driven to the airport. And there was a large group of people gathered there to see her off. And her driver tells the story. His name is Charles. and Charles said that Mother Teresa noticed all the people and she asked him, Charles, who's coming to the airport today? There must be someone important coming to the airport today. Who is it? And she was dead serious. And Charles said, Mother, do you realize they're coming for you? And she said, oh, Charles. She didn't know. Her feet at the end of her life were disfigured because she would never take shoes that fit her. She would always give them away first and she would take whatever was left. Mother Teresa knew her identity and intimacy with the Father. And so her doing flowed out of a natural relationship of intimacy with the Father. So I really think the invitation here for us is to do. But it's to know, to know, to know, to know so much that the doing becomes natural. And as we move to the table here in the next couple minutes, as we celebrate the Eucharist, which means the great blessing for us, the body and the blood, the body that was broken, the blood that was shed for us, as we take that in, we can hear the invitation of Jesus to take it in, to know it, and then turn around and give it. That we can assume the identity of Jesus in the world by being the body of Christ and carrying around the life and death of Christ in our cracked and broken vessels, that we can be the Eucharist, we can be the great blessing for the world. Amen? Amen. Let's go to the table. Thank you.
