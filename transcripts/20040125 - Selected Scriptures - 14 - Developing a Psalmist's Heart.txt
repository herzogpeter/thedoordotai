Several weeks ago in our study of the life of David that we have been calling a journey of the heart, we began to examine what it meant when in the context of David's desert cave experience where he was running for his life from Saul, what it meant and what it looked like in real life practical ways for David to strengthen himself in the Lord his God. Remember that 1 Samuel 30 verse 6, Ziklag, the town that they were a little village with, they were living and had been burned to the ground. The women and children had been taken by the Amalekites. David and his mighty men wept until there was no more strength to weep. But then it says he strengthened his heart in the Lord his God. And how he did that is what we examine. Well, today to the list of things we've already learned about that. I'd like to add this as being central to David's ability to strengthen himself in his God. Quite simply, he prayed. He was a real-life prayer. In fact, because of the record of his prayers in the Psalms, some consider David to be among the greatest prayers who ever lived. I want to talk today about a praying heart in the context of this journey of the heart. want to talk about developing a psalmist's heart using the Psalms of David as our guide. Fact is, over the last 2,500 years, the book of the Psalms has been the greatest collection of prayers to God in the history of the human race. Might have never thought of it this way, but they were the prayer book of Jesus, giving words, giving expression, even to the prayers of Jesus were the Psalms. You see record of that in Scripture in various places. The Psalms have been the prayer book of his followers for centuries, and today they become ours. For that to happen, let me start with a word about what the Psalms are not. They are not, first of all, a devotional book filled with uplifting thoughts and inspiring words that you might read in the morning to put yourself in a positive frame of mind. It's a very good thing to do, and from time to time, the Psalms even help in that, but if you think of them that way only, you're often going to be disappointed and sometimes very confused, because while many of the Psalms are, in fact, uplifting and inspiring, there are just as many Psalms that are real head scratchers and downers, to tell you the truth. Let me give you an example of this. If you're just going through the Psalms, you come to Psalm 136, for instance, says this, give thanks to the Lord for he is good, his love endures forever. Give thanks to the God of gods, his love endures forever. Now that's a great psalm, puts you in a positive, thankful frame of mind, and that was a good day. Next day, Psalm 137, the eighth verse says this, O daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us, he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks. What's up with that? I mean, nobody's going to make a bumper sticker out of that one. I mean, some people have looked at the Psalms and wondered, why don't they organize them better? You know, put all the happy Psalms in one place and the mad somewhere else and the sad Psalms somewhere else. You can kind of find them. Well, I think the reason the Psalms are messy, and they are, It's because life is messy. Sometimes in life you have a really good day and you have a really bad day on the same day. See, I think the simplest and maybe best way to view the Psalms, if you're going to understand them and enter into them, is to look at them as if you're reading someone's prayer journal. Uncensored, unfiltered, raw expressions of the heart. None of the highs or lows getting filtered out to make it more palatable, just all there, it's called prayer. Prayers that have given expression to the human heart for centuries. Sometimes the things that are being expressed are very positive things. Think, for instance, of the triumphal entry, one of the highlight moments of human history, Jesus riding into Jerusalem, giving a glimpse of the kingdom of God. How do you find words to express what you're seeing, what you're hearing, what you're feeling, you go to the Psalms. Psalm 18, blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord. Go to another extreme of human emotion. One of the darkest days in human history, Jesus hanging on a cross, feeling utterly alone and abandoned for the first time in history. The son is estranged from the father. The fellowship of the Trinity is broken. How do you find words to express such unspeakable sorrow? you go to the Psalms. Psalm 22, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Someone said it this way, all of the Bible is God's words to us. The Psalms are our words back to God. And they deal with all our lives, not just the pretty parts, not just the happy parts. Eugene Peterson, in his book about the Psalms entitled Answering God, says it this way, the Psalms teach us to bring our lives in all their fullness before our God and all his fullness. So this morning, we're going to look at and interact with six different kinds of psalms. And hopefully in the process, we will make these psalms, our words, back to God. The most basic level, you can divide the psalms into two categories. You have psalms of praise and psalms of lament. Let's begin with psalms of praise. Psalm 103 verse 1 says this, Praise the Lord, O my soul. All my inmost being, praise his holy name. Praise the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits. Then the psalmist lists some of the benefits in verses 3 and 4. He forgives all my sins. He heals my diseases. He redeems my life from the pit and crowns me with love and compassion. Little note back up on verse 2. It says, praise the Lord, O my soul, and forget not his benefits. C. Hassel Bullock in his commentary on the Psalms indicates that the coordination between praise the Lord, O my soul, and forget not his benefits is profoundly significant because the Hebrews believed that only those who praise don't forget. Forgetting God begins when praise is silenced. Think about that. Made me think about that. Why do we do all this? Why do we bother to corporately gather in the way we gather? Why would Bruce and his team spend lots of time, more than you know, putting songs together and thinking about the words and what they say and how they fit with the next and worrying about, wondering about whether it's going to facilitate praise? One reason we go to all that work is because we forget. And we need to be reminded. I've long thought that, often experienced it actually, We're in the context of our praise here. On a Sunday, I'm standing right over here, and we're in the middle of worship as we lift our voices and declare the truth about who God is, truth I've heard before about what he does and how he loves in the middle of that. And I'm about to preach, so it means I'm kind of prepared for this thing, but I will be hearing truths about who God is and what he does and how he loves, and I will remember. And I didn't even know that I forgot until I praised. him. C.S. Lewis says this about the importance of praise. There's something in the human heart that when we see something that's praiseworthy or admirable, our instinct is to express that adoration or delight. In fact, our experience is incomplete until we give voice to the wonder in our hearts. So in the middle of the summer, when you're away from the lights of the city, and the sky is dark but full of stars. Or you see a majestic mountain, or a beautiful sunset, or Kevin Garnett stuffing a basketball over some other guy. Thank you, Jesus. It's just... The experience isn't complete until you give voice. That's why I watch football games with my boys. They give voice. And Caleb's a Viking fan, so it's been lament. Beloved, we encounter, when we encounter an all-wise, all-powerful, eternal, utterly holy, all-loving, completely merciful, an exhaustively patient, ceaselessly creative, endlessly joyful God, our experience of that encounter, regardless of how real, will never be complete without the ability to express our praise, adoration, and wonder, and to do it directly to God, sometimes with laughter, sometimes with tears, sometimes with cheering, sometimes with singing, sometimes with silence. When I'm most moved, sometimes in the middle of loud singing, singing. I often can't sing at all. But I am expressing deep things of adoration to God in praise. So this is the heart of praise. To reflect on and delight in the goodness and greatness and glory of our God and to express that delight directly to him. And then to know, as we're doing that, he receives it, he delights in it. So what do you say we do it? Right now, this is the interactive part. I want you to stand with me. And the first thing we're going to do is read together, corporately, a psalm of praise and we'll move then into singing. Psalm 145, let's declare this together. I will exalt you my God the King. I will praise your name forever and ever. Every day I will praise you and extol your name forever and ever. Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise. His greatness no one can fathom. One generation will commend your works to another. They will tell of your mighty acts. They will speak of the glorious splendor of your majesty. And I will meditate on your wonderful works. They will tell of the power of your awesome works, and I will proclaim your great deeds. They will celebrate your abundant goodness and joyfully sing of your righteousness. The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love. The Lord is good to all. He has compassion on all he has made. All you have made will praise you, O Lord. Your saints will extol you. They will tell of the glory of your kingdom and speak of your might, so that all men may know of your mighty acts and the glorious splendor of your kingdom. Sing. Great and miraculous are your needs And righteousness is your way, Lord You are the almighty King of kings And Lord of all the ages Oh, who will not fear you, O Lord And glorify your holy name When your righteousness is revealed Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess That you alone are only You alone are only All nations come and worship you We'll sing praise with the song of the Lamb You alone are only You alone are worthy All nations come and worship you We'll sing praise with the song of the land Our glory be to you God and me The heavens be clear all your greatness So bright and beautiful in the skies Their message rings to the earth Saying who will not fear you, O Lord And glorify your holy name When your righteousness is revealed Every knee shall bow Every time I confess That you alone are holy You alone are holy All nations come and worship you We'll sing praise with the song of love You alone are holy You alone are holy All nations come and worship You will sing praise with the song of love They will all sing around your throne Praising your holy name, Lord Like the wings of all the oceans Thundering on the shore Saying who will not fear you alone And glorify your only name When your righteousness is revealed Every time the best And you alone are holy You alone are holy All nations come and worshiping We'll sing praise with the song of the Lord You alone are holy You alone are holy All nations come and worship you We'll sing praise with us all All right, all right All right, all right You can be seated. Second category of the psalms are psalms of lament. Because God longs for us not only to come to him with our praise and our joy, but also come to him with our pain and our anger and our burdens and our doubts. In other words, he longs for us to come to him with our whole life. Psalm 42, verse 1. As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, O God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. when can I go and meet with God my tears have been my only food day and night while men say to me all day long where's your God these things I remember as I pour out my soul how I used to go with the multitude leading the procession to the house of God with shouts of joy and thanksgiving among the festive throng but not anymore and so I say to God my rock why have you forgotten me why must I go about mourning oppressed by the enemy My bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me, saying to me all day long, Where is your God? Many of you might recognize the opening line of that psalm as the deer pants for the water as a fairly common song that we sing here at Open Door and is fairly common in the church at large. But what I want you to notice is that this psalm is not the expression of someone who's on the top of their spiritual game. As if he's saying, you know, God, I really don't care about the circumstances of my life. All I want to do is worship and praise you like a deer who's thirsty for water. I'm just thirsty for God. I just can't get enough. It's not the spirit of the psalm. What the psalmist is actually saying here is this. God, my life is falling apart. My health is failing me. My enemies are mocking me. And you're not doing anything, God. So like a fragile creature dying of thirst, I'm desperate. That's lament. Actually, there are four categories or kinds of lament in the Psalms that deal with four general areas of life, problems that we face in life. All of them can be found in Psalm 42, but in other Psalms as well. The four general categories are problems with enemies, problems with sickness, problems with death, and problems with traps, or times when you feel stuck. Enemies may be best understood as anything or anyone you need deliverance from, but when we think of enemies, I think we mostly think of people. People with whom we may be experiencing conflict or tension or rivalry of some sort. Could be a neighbor or a boss, could be a spouse or a friend, could be everyone on Highway 494 at rush hour. Every single person there could be someone that you love. But you can't resolve this issue, this chasm over which you don't seem to be able to reach. The enemy's not always a person. Your enemy could be depression. For some of you it could be loneliness or fear or some besetting sin that you can't hardly speak of. Anything you are threatened by right now that you need help from God for. It's an enemy. Sickness is the second category. Verse 10 says, my bones suffer. Obviously, when we think of sickness, we think of physical disease, and it certainly would apply to that, but it's also an expression of the depth of the problem that's affecting my body. Truth is, we carry things in our bodies all day. You know that. Anxious about a test? Afraid of failing at work or at school? Upset about a blow up at home with your parents or with your kids? Worried about money? Worried about a relationship that you thought was going this way, but now it's going that way? As human beings, we walk around with churning stomachs, stiff necks, sweaty palms, aching heads, and sometimes boiling blood. See, these psalms that, because of their language, seem a bit far off to us from time to time, aren't far off at all. See, I think almost all of us know what the psalmist means when he says, my bones suffer. In mortal agony, is what that verse goes on to say, mortal agony would be speaking of death, third category. And when you're speaking of death, there would be speaking certainly of physical death, but as is so often the case in Scripture, there is symbolism beyond that, so it's not just physical death that these words speak. The psalmist often speaks of going down to Sheol. The idea there is this, I don't see any way out. I'm out of hope. Life is being squeezed out of me. At points like that, you maybe wish you could die because you are the walking dead life being sucked out. Fourth category is trapped. Psalmist often uses images like drowning or being in the pits. Psalm 103, he redeems my life from the pit. My feet are trapped in miry clay. The imagery there is clear. I'm stuck. I relate to that. I don't talk about miry clay, but I know about being stuck in my finances and career. Some of you in your marriage. in your spiritual life. You feel trapped. There's no way out. All of these are the expressions of prayer that we find in the Psalms of lament. Say a quick word about a subcategory of laments, imprecatory Psalms. You might not have heard a lot about those, but you've probably read one or two and been troubled by them. Imprecatory Psalms is where the psalmist expresses shockingly strong desires for the destruction of an enemy. Now, there aren't many of these, only 18 in all of the Psalms, but they're very disturbing. I already read you one earlier in this talk, Psalm 137. Another one is Psalm 58, 6. It says this, break the teeth in their mouths, O God. Tear out the fangs of the lion, verse 8, like a slug melting away as it moves along. You ever think that on an enemy? Like the one that melt on the concrete, like a slug. No. Like a stubborn, like a stillborn child, may they not see this son. And those kinds of expressions raise this question in my mind and yours too, I think. Whatever happened to love your enemies? I mean, how do I reconcile that? As you can imagine, a whole lot has been written on this. And Christian scholars differ widely on how to interpret it. But without going deeply into this, maybe the best comment I've ever heard on this comes from a brilliant theologian. He teaches at Yale, originally from Croatia. Being from Croatia, he therefore knows something about pain and suffering, about injustice and even genocide. His name is Miroslav Volf. And he writes this, just one phrase, about imprecatory psalms. He says this, rage belongs before God. It's the only safe place for it. You see, these imprecatory psalms are the unfiltered expressions of hearts that have experienced enormous pain and great injustice and refusing to take vengeance into their own hands. They lay out their anger to God with shocking candor. God, I want you to bring justice here. Help me to forgive. There's no way I can do that on my own. Rage belongs before God. It's the only safe place for it. So let's do it. Privately, quietly, in this holy place, in this holy moment, just between you and God, prayers of lament. because everybody in this room has some area of life where you have a deep need for God's help. For some, it may be rage, a white hot anger that you can't forgive. There's an enemy in your life that you need deliverance from. Something or someone is weighing you down and you need wisdom, you need strength, healing, guidance, forgiveness, maybe just hope. Some of you are just stuck, desperate for God's help, like a deer panting for water, desperate for a drink. Just now, in this quiet place, let's do what the psalmist does and lament. Bow your heads as I pray us into this. Heavenly Father, You hear every prayer. You know every heart. And you count every single tear. Hear now the cries of your people. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Amen. Amen. Third category is the psalms or the psalms of thanksgiving. These psalms are often connected to laments in this way. Having cried out to God for wisdom or strength, healing or hope, God then answers or acts in some way and will respond with thanksgiving. The psalms are full of these kinds of expressions. Psalm 30 would be one such expression. Verse 1, I will exalt you, O Lord, for you have lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me. O Lord, my God, I called to you for help and you healed me. You brought me up from the grave. You spared me from going down into the pit. Verse 11, You turned my wailing into dancing. You removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy that my heart may sing and not be silent. Oh, Lord, my God, I will give thanks to thee forever. Let's stand. Where there once was no leader He gave His healing hand Where there once was only pain He brought comfort like a friend I feel the sweetness of His love Piercing my darkness I see the bright and morning sun As it ushers in His joyful gladness He's turned my morning Into dancing again He's lifted my sorrows I can't stay silent I must sing for His joyous love I must sing for Sing the chorus again Oh, He's turned my boy Into dancing in He's lifted my sorrows I can't stay silent I must sing for His joy has gone I must sing for His joy has gone Let's just stay standing. As we move now into Psalms of wisdom, Psalms of instruction. These are Psalms that praise God for His truth, for His word, for His law. And the reason these Psalms are praising God for His truth is that God's truth gives us wisdom to live our lives. It gives us wisdom to know we need to put our foot here and not there because if you put it there, you're going to fall and you're going to hurt yourself. So the Psalms of instruction are Psalms that praise God for the help he gives by telling us the truth about how life works. One of the most remarkable Psalms in this regard is Psalm 119. It has 176 verses and we're going to read every one. No, we're not. but we are going to read Psalm 19 just a few verses out of this as we declare praise to God for the truth of his word that helps us live our lives let's read this psalm the law of the Lord is perfect reviving the soul the statutes of the Lord are trustworthy making wise the simple the precepts of the Lord are right giving joy to the heart the commands of the Lord are radiant giving light to the eyes. The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever. The ordinances of the Lord are sure and righteous altogether. They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold. They are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb. By them is your servant warned. In keeping them there is great reward. Who can discern his errors? Forgive my hidden faults. Keep your servant also from willful sins. May they not rule over me. Then will I be blameless, innocent of great transgression. You may be seated. I'm going to ask those last two verses to stay up on the screen because they transition us into the next category of psalms called penitential psalms or psalms of confession. Verse 12 of that last psalm says this, who can discern his errors? Forgive me of my hidden faults. We live in an era of great technology, as you know, where things like x-rays and CAT scans help us spot toxic things in our bodies that if undetected could kill us. So the ability to spot those hidden things is a great gift to us. What about those toxic things, those hidden things that do not damage the body but damage the soul, that sear the conscience, that paralyze the heart? To paralyze the heart would be a bad thing on this journey of the heart. Verse 12, who can discern our hidden faults? The psalmist says, God can help. In one of the best-known psalms of David, Psalm 139, verse 23, David says this, By the way, when you begin to do this kind of inventory of your heart, you need God's help. Sometimes when we just try to do it on our own, we move into kind of neurotic fault-finding and false guilt. It isn't helpful at all. Or we do what Keith talked about in his sermon a couple weeks ago about repentance, where things that need to be dealt with in deep ways, we treat them like weeds and we just mow them. So when we're doing this kind of work, we really need God's help. We need to invite God into those hidden places. Psalm 139, search me, oh God. I'm just going to invite you in. I don't even know. I just want to be open to what you have and know my thoughts. Test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there be any offensive way in me and lead me in the way everlasting. So let's do that. No preacher yelling or screaming, nobody telling you what you ought to do or what your sin is. I don't know. I don't know that. Bow your heads with me. No defensiveness. No stiff necks. In fact, do a little exercise right now. It might feel odd, but if you even notice a place of tension in your body, just relax it. Just intentionally, just relax it. Now, invite the searching, convicting, gentle, forgiving, healing ministry of the Holy Spirit of God to do in your heart what He does. Among other things, to reveal and then to heal. as you confess, as we confess, repent. Amen. Thank you. Out of the depths we cry to you, O Lord. O Lord, hear our voice. Let your ears be attentive to our cries for mercy. If you, O Lord, kept a record of sins, who could stand? But with you there is forgiveness. For the Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in love. He does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities. For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him. As far as the east is from the west, as far as the east is from the west, So far has he removed our transgressions from us. Which means, among other things, that sin and guilt and regret don't get the last word. And all God's people said, Amen. Last one. Psalms of enthronement which basically affirm that our God reigns. These Psalms were particularly important for the people of God historically in times of trouble, in times when prayers weren't being answered, when problems weren't being solved, when the people of God were under the oppression of the Assyrians or the Babylonians when Jerusalem and the temple and their homes and everything that they held dear was a distant memory. They would continually come back to the Psalms of enthronement that basically said this, though I cannot discern God right now and though there might be another king physically who looks to be on the throne, there is a king in heaven who is eternally on the throne. They would remind themselves with these psalms that our God reigns. I'm going to wrap this up with a corporate reading of a psalm of enthronement, Psalm 96. I'd like you to stand with me. As we again continue to declare truth about our God, Reading together. Ascribe to the Lord glory and strength. Ascribe to the Lord the glory, do his name. Bring an offering and come into his courts. Worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness. Tremble before him, all the earth. Say among the nations, the Lord reigns. Let's sing together. Oh Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder Consider all the worlds I have set away I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder Thy power through all the universe dismay Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee How great thou art, how great thou art Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee, how great Thou art, how great Thou art. And when I think that God is not sparing, sent him to die, I skisk and take it in. That on the cross My burdens gladly bearing He bled at night To take away my sin Oh, then sing to my soul My Savior God to thee With a shout of acclamation And to take me home What joy shall fill my heart And then I'm so In all of the man of nation And there proclaim My God of rain Let's proclaim it together In all of us in my heart All of us in my heart Sing the chorus again. Oh, then sing my soul, my Savior God to me. How great Thou art, how great Thou art. Oh, then sing my soul, my Savior God to me. I'll break the heart, I'll break the heart. and now may God the God of peace make you holy in every way and may your whole spirit soul and body be kept blameless until that day when our Lord Jesus Christ comes again and all God's people said Amen Amen.
