The scripture reading this morning has been taken from John's Gospel, the first, third, and 20th chapters, along with Matthew 28 and Acts 1. Using Eugene Peterson's translation of the message in John 3, we read, This is how much God loved the world. He sent his Son, his one and only Son, and this is why, so that no one need be destroyed. By believing in him, anyone can have a whole and lasting life. God didn't go to all the trouble of sending his son merely to point an accusing finger, telling the world how bad it was. He came to help, to put the world right again. So the word became flesh and blood and moved into the neighborhood. We saw the glory with our own eyes, the one-of-a-kind glory, like father, like son. Then one day he said to his followers, that just like the Father has sent me, I am now sending you. And with that he breathed on them and said, receive the Holy Spirit. And then in Matthew 28 and Acts 1, he said, God has authorized and commanded me to commission you, so I want you to go. Go out, therefore, and train everyone you meet far and near in this new way of living. Mark them with baptism. instruct them in practice. I'll be with you as you do this day after day right up to the end of the age. And then not many days from now you'll be baptized with the Holy Spirit. And when you are, you'll receive power to become my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and even to the remotest parts of the earth. This is the word of the Lord. I have no idea what this is doing here, so just kidding. Got a bigger laugh in the first service. Fascinating picture. When Jesus said what he said to the disciples in John chapter 20, even as the Father has sent me, so in the same way he sent me, the incarnation of God into this neighborhood, this world, I'm now sending you that same way. I'm now sending you, I want you to go, but wait a minute. Before you go, you need the breath. You need the breath before you go. So we breathed on them and said, receive the breath of God. Receive the Holy Spirit. Matthew 28, same thing. I want you to go. I want you to go. The direction is go into all the world, but wait a minute before you go. You need the breath. You need the life. Wait for the Holy Spirit to come upon you, and when he does, you'll have what you need to go. Last week in my return from sabbatical, I tried to share with you to kind of give you a picture not only of where we went on sabbatical and what we did, that is, Bonnie and I, but also to talk about the things that had grown in me because that was the expectation. That is the expectation of Sabbath. It's our understanding of Sabbath, that when you let the ground go fallow is the metaphor we've been using. You just let it rest for a while. Some things will begin to grow in you, in the soil that is you, that otherwise wouldn't grow and maybe couldn't grow because those things that needed to grow were getting trampled or ignored in the context of everyday life, not necessarily a sinful thing. Just everyday life and the busyness of life kind of tramples on some things that might in you and I need to grow. And usually the things that grow during these sabbatical seasons when you just let the ground rest are embedded things. Talked about that a lot. Maybe the things that grow are forgotten things that like seed in the soil that's gone dormant when given a chance, when given some space. Not trampled underfoot, the life that's in the seed begins to grow because it had a chance to grow again. So what were those things that were growing in me and in us was the question I was asking on my return to open door. And while it might take some time, I think, for me and for us to sort out all of those things, because you've got to pay attention to what it was that was growing and it might show up in unexpected places, the thing I noticed first, and I began to talk about this last week when I came back about what was growing in me, particularly as it relates to us as a church, is my belief and conviction that our vision as a church, our vision that's designed to, among other things, prepare us as a people for next, whatever it is that's next. And we've even put a time span around that, the year 2020, to prepare us as a people for what God is doing among us next. And next also includes the next generation of leadership that we feel a real urgency around calling out the next generation of leadership because that is what is next. And one of the things I care about relative to the next generation of leadership, biggest question I have, is do you have the kingdom virus? Do you have the kingdom virus? Do you have the breath of God in you? We need to find those people, prepare those people. It's part of preparing the people for next and preparing us as a people for the next iteration, whatever that might look like of what Open Door is going to be as a church in the world, in this community. What is it going to look like? Who are we going to be? And how do we prepare for that has grown in me. The urgency of that and what grew in me about all that as well is my belief and conviction is that vision and that task of preparing us as a people for next by the year 2020 is a compelling one but also a challenging one indeed quite daunting if you think about it and I think about it a lot for a number of reasons I think it's daunting not the least of which is something I touched on last week when I touched about the fact that we live in what's being described quite commonly as a post-Christian culture. It's not a Christian culture we live in. It is a post-Christian culture. That means it used to be. What some are actually now referring to is a pre-Christian culture. Now, get your head around that, a pre-Christian culture. Like before, it's this way past post, this is pre-Christian. That's almost like, seriously, this is like first century church culture. There's no context for authentic Christian life. There's a pre-Christian culture dynamic going on, and that's a term that research experts like the Barna Group are using more and more and are attaching that designation more and more to an age demographic in our culture we've come to know as the Millennials, or Generation Y, because the Millennials, Generation Y, whatever you call them, they are Generation Next. And preparing a people for next means preparing a people for what's actually going on in that kind of cultural demographic and reality, ranging in age from 18 to 30. Most in this particular age group see very little or no value at all in going to church, no matter what kind of church it is, how invitational or attractive it might be to you or me. There's just no interest, by and large, in this group. indeed, according to every research group that you can find. And I would encourage you to just Google that millennial thing and see what pops up. The dynamic is this, the trend. It's not even a trend. It's just this bold reality that this particular age group is leaving the church in droves. It says Daniel Burke, religion editor for CNN in his May 14, 2015 article in CNN.com. I'm using that as just simply one out of the air. It's not a religious thing. It's a CNN deal. And when they leave church, they're not coming back. But it isn't just church relative to the reality of this dynamic. It's institutions of any kind. And churches are just kind of part of that institutional thing that many in this millennial generation don't interest in because they don't trust institutions pretty much of any kind, particularly if it's big, because this is the deal. If it's big, it must be bad. And that didn't come from nowhere. It didn't get birthed in a vacuum. The thing that they've experienced, most of these young people from age 18 to 30 in their life and what they've seen in the big institutions is that the way you get big is to be corrupt and to be power hungry and to be abusive or coercive. So if it's big, it must be bad because you can't get big without that. which leaves us as a church if we're worried about survival with a smaller and smaller percentage of the population and that's a true thing whether we talk about the millennials or not that's a true thing in our culture today smaller and smaller percentage of the population that would even consider going to church of any kind be it an invitational church or an attractive church it doesn't matter what kind of church the percentage is smaller and smaller, resulting in what Alan Hirsch refers to, this guy that I mentioned last week in his book, The Forgotten Ways. He refers to, it results in a feeding frenzy among churches, among evangelical churches, all competing for that slice of the population pie. Indeed, in the pie chart that he uses, I referred to this again last week to illustrate this, He refers to that slice of the pie that is competing for the people who, in our culture, about 13 to 15 percent, who would go to some church. He refers to that slice of the pie as the red water. And the red water is red because it's full of blood. That's the metaphor of the feeding frenzy. While the blue water, which is the rest of the pie chart, the 80-some percent of the vast majority of the population, remains virtually untouched by this institutional church that is trying to get everybody in that piece of the pie to come to them. So in the piece of the pie where churches are attracting people, some churches grow, they go down, but it's still within the context of this particular percentage of people who would show some interest, some way in a church of some kind, all of which calls for, indeed I think it demands, and it's something that's growing in me, a very different paradigm for church ministry than what many of us grew up in, that what many of us are used to, and it's part of, I think, what I think is necessary to prepare us as a people for next, and this conviction around this is growing, because what many of us grew up in, myself included, and are used to, and even have a kind of view as being successful relative to church, What we've talked about a lot around here lately is this thing called the attractional model of church. It's the church as destination model as well. And it's a model or a paradigm of church. It's been around for years. When I say church as destination, you probably don't know what I mean. I'm going to unpack that a bit. But what the church as destination model says, and we're just kind of all into this. This is what I grew up with. It basically says this, and it's saying this to everybody, but to the culture, it's saying this. You need it. We have it. Come and get it. It's here. 11 o'clock on Sunday morning, God is here. Come and get it. It's here. You have to come here. So the point is there's a destination. The destination is the church. And when the culture was somewhat Christianized, and, you know, 30 years ago, 35 years ago when I began ministry, We're railing against the culture and how evil it was. But there was still enough in the culture that there was this openness. Yeah, you go to church. Of course you go to church. I mean, you don't know why you went to church. But when the church or the culture was somewhat Christianized, that model of church as destination, we've got it, you need it, come get it, it's here, seems to work, at least to some degree, because people went to church. Even nominally committed people went to church. People who would even say, I don't know God at all, they would go to church. And some of you would tell that as your story when you were a kid. Yeah, we went to church. You just went to church. It's just what you did. Everybody in my neighborhood went to church. And when they didn't, because we kind of noticed that sometimes they didn't, and sometimes they used to, but they didn't. We had this assumption, talked about this last week, that if you just fix the church, they will come. Or they will come back, because they were born at church, and now we'll make it an exciting church. and we did that kind of thing and there were all sorts of movements in the church in my own lifetime that were all about fixing the church and we fixed the church by becoming more this or more that less this or less that more contemporary, more inviting, more friendly, more fun more entertaining some people got sick of that and said we're going to be more serious we're going to be more conservative, we're going to be more biblical others hear that and go no, we're going to be more liberal well that's fine but the deal is whether you're liberal more liberal or conservative, even more conservative, you're still dealing with this model, this paradigm we're not even aware of is there most of the time. And the paradigm is this. It's the church as destination model, which says basically this. We've got it. You want liberal? We got it. You want conservative? We got it. We got it. You need it. Come get it. It's here. Church as destination model. that model that's deeply ingrained more than we know results in what George Hunsberger in his book entitled Sizing Up the Shape of the Church results in a church that is now seen by many people even who go to church as a vendor of religious goods and services where members and participants expect the church to produce a range of services from a certain kind of music to fellowship options to sports leagues, to a certain kind of preaching or theological perspective that they agree with, so they hear it every week, and it just emboldens their belief in what they already think. And in this view or paradigm, other churches, this is chilling to me, but it's true, in this paradigm of church's destination, other churches actually become competitors in what he calls the religious marketplace. Isn't that bizarre? Where's it in the Bible? I would like to find that verse anyway. Religious marketplace. Competitors in the religious marketplace for the energy, money, and affiliation of the people that they are attempting to attract and keep satisfied through the services they offer. To keep them satisfied through the services they offer sounds pretty consumeristic, blah, blah, blah to me. So we offer people things, and we market ourselves, and we advertise in one way or another what we're like. We want people to know what we're like so they know what to expect when they come that we're the different church or we're the fun church or we're the really serious church or we're the Bible church or we're the not so much Bible church or we're the hip church or we're the unchurched church because we don't, whatever. Because we want you to come here. It's a destination model because we got it. We got the unchurched thing here. We have it. You need it. It's still the destination model. Come and get it. It's here. One church I heard about recently offers movie tickets if you come to their church. And while that's a pretty blatant example of the destination model, the attractional model, and it's pretty easy to spot as being an example of those two things. And it's something that we would never do, because we wouldn't. Because what we would do is we're not giving you theater tickets. We're giving you God. We're giving you the Bible. Okay, that's really good. It's really holy. We're going to give you a certain kind of preaching and a certain kind of worship. But here's the deal. You strip that down. You strip that all down. It gets a little scary. I don't even like thinking this stuff. We may still be operating in ways that we're not conscious of because the paradigm is so deeply ingrained. We're operating with a paradigm that still is seeing church's destination because we have it. What is it? I don't know theater tickets. I don't know the Bible. But we got it. you need it, come get it it's here, church has destination we want you to come here and we do want that but I believe and it's a belief that's growing in me that part of preparing us as a people for next involves preparing us as a people for a fundamentally different paradigm of church ministry not church as destination but church as incarnation and you might be a little clear about what I mean by destination incarnation maybe not so much let me get now to the board I know this is very high tech that's all I can do I actually stole this illustration from Reggie McNeil whose talk I referenced last week and had quite an effect on me actually when he talked about the culture and the world that we live in as being divided he can be explained in these simple, actually very complicated. Don't you think this is really, there's our world right there. Those lines. Sorry. And over here in this arena of life, there is the political arena of life. There's the arts. You've got the artistic world, the educational world. You've got sports world. Can you read my writing? Can you read that? That's good, isn't it? I write in tongues. So I'll be your interpreter this morning. There's education, business. There's the business world. There's family life world. I have no idea what that word, that's just. And then over here, the church has made its own little silo. That's the church world. And the paradigm of the destination model is this. And the expectation and the belief was this. We're just going to fill this whole silo up. by people coming from all these places of life to us. They're all going to come to us and fill this thing up. And while the culture supported this kind of thing, because it was somewhat Christianized, people would come that way, and the church model would work as church of destination model. And then when we realized people weren't coming, we figured we needed to fix the church, and so we became more contemporary, more fun, more serious, more something, because the model was still, however, with this attractional thing, to get him to come, it was still church as destination. We got it, you need it, come get it, we'll make you laugh, or whatever. We'll make you cry, or we'll give you God, or whatever. Because if you fix it, they will come. But I believe, and again, it's a growing belief, that preparing us as a people for next is preparing us with profound awareness that what we need is not trying to figure out how to do this better, to get more people to come. What we need is a fundamentally different paradigm than church as destination or the attractional model. The incarnational model is what we need to start to get our head around. I'd like to cast vision for that, help you begin to see that, stir up a longing in you for that. In many ways, we see it in ways that are fabulous but we need to notice it and notice that this is the goal, this is the desire, this is in fact the church because there are reasons to go to church if we're developing this incarnational model and the incarnational model basically says this, we're not looking so much to get all these aspects of the culture to come to church, that would be great, but we're not doing that. Our goal is to create a group of people, equip a number of people who are full of the life of God, the breath of God is in them they've come alive to God they aren't perfect but they're becoming fully alive they're being formed into the image of Christ their character is changing they have the fragrance of Christ and then realize that all of that formation remember God became man moved into the neighborhood for all of that life in you to move into the neighborhood to move into the culture bringing the life and breath of God wherever you go not because you've got a speech and you're preaching to everyone, but because wherever you go, that life is in you, that breath is coming from you. The paradigm is, how do we get more people to come here? No, it's, how do we get more people to go there? And quite frankly, that changes if you get this paradigm, and then this is something that really affects what we talk about behind the scenes. And even with many of you, when you begin to get this, it changes the leadership question. that we're asking from how do we attract more people to come here, which is a significant question, and people spent hours on that. This is a different question. Because now the question is, how do we adequately equip and empower more and more people to come fully alive in God and then to realize that that full aliveness in God is not to stay in here, it's to go out there. questions we now are asking in a new paradigm is, or a different paradigm, is this, and this is a scary question, are we actually, or are we just blowing smoke, are we providing reliable means? If we want people to be formed into the character of Christ, and then to be on mission in a context of a community that's in this thing together, are we providing the reliable means for people to do that, for people to discover? It's one of the key words around here. We talk about discover, connect, and serve. So, are we providing reliable means for people to discover in authentic ways who God is, who God really is, and who we are, who we are together, and why we're here, and why we're here is for the sake of others. Are we providing reliable means? It's why we come up with things like a formation center, because we think that kind of thing is a reliable means. Is everybody going to come out of that fully formed? I look just like Jesus. No. Because I went through one of those and I still don't but but it it's a reliable means to teach people how to hear God and create space for God so they know where they're supposed to go and what they're supposed to do to become a people who are becoming more and more alive in God being transformed by the character of Christ by the reality and power of the spirit at work among us so that when we go I mean that's the whole formation piece so that when we go we have something more to give than an invitation to church something more to give than a track a Christian track that's telling people how they might avoid hell and that's a very different paradigm formation, character formation mission, there's a lot of missional talk these days I don't know if you're aware of these things but in the church there's a lot, it's all about mission, it's all about mission and everybody's going and that's great go, but if you don't have the breath on you if you don't have the kingdom virus stay stay it's just no different than anybody else, we're part of a different kind of movement, we're part of a different kind of paradigm than what some of us are used to, than what some of us grew up in than what most of us see today in the evangelical church, still operating, I think, to a very large degree with what I'm describing here as a church's destination model and an attractional model. I much prefer what we've talked about before here, and I'm not going to unpack it a lot, this locker room model that at least acknowledges that the church and coming here is not the end game because church is not where you play the game. You play it out there. We prepare for it here. And while I'm calling that a different paradigm and wanting us to see a different paradigm, it's really important that we know what I'm trying to describe here, either very well or not very well, what I'm trying to describe is not a new paradigm. In fact, what's growing in me is the reality of a very old paradigm, one that finds its origins, beloved, and the very character and nature and activity of God, who according to John's Gospel that Lisa read just a few moments ago, there was a God who loved this world so much, and the people who were in it, his lost creation, that he said himself, I will go, I will go. So he sent his son, his one and only son, Not to condemn the world or to point an accusing finger at the world, but to reclaim this world and the people in it that he loved, to restore it, redeem it, reconcile it to himself. And so the word, I love how Eugene Peterson says this, the word that is God became flesh and blood, and then in flesh and blood, like you and me, physical, That flesh and blood, God-filled flesh and blood moved into the neighborhood. Which means God, if this was God becoming flesh and dwelt among us, moved into the neighborhood, God wasn't going, you know, they're not coming to me. I'm going to them. So he, God, moved into the neighborhood, came this way, into all of these, I'm going that way. And he went that way and sat with them and ate with them and drank with them and loved, became a friend of them before they got it right and fixed it up and repented of their sin. In fact, he was called a friend of sinners. He got in all sorts of trouble for that. He loved them, ate with them. Indeed, what I'm describing here, you learn about this stuff in seminary, and I love using big words like this. What I'm describing is the classic doctrine of Missio Dei. The mission of God. This is the mission of God. I want you back. Not to come here. I'm going there. I'm going there. I'm going to flesh and blood move into the neighborhood. It all began with God who sent his son. And guess what happened then? The son then sends the spirit. And guess what happens then? And the Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the breath of God then sends us, the church. Wait for the Spirit to come upon you. And when he does, you'll have a witness. You'll be a witness. You'll have the breath. John 20, 21. Again, Lisa read this earlier. Jesus is saying to his followers, in the very same way the Father sent me, I am God. I took on flesh and blood, human, fleshy, normal, smelly, human stuff, and sent me into the world. I'm now sending you this very same way, to be my hands and feet, my eyes and ears, to be incarnational is what that word means again. And then he did this very important thing. He says, I'm sending you, but wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You need the breath. And I'm sending lots of people, I'm on a mission. I'm going to, you need the breath, you need the breath. Don't just go and, you know, fix everything out there. You need the breath. And so he took a deep breath and he breathed on them. He breathed into them the Spirit. We're saying, receive now the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit. You've been around Open Door. We've been teaching on this. That Hebrew word is the ruach of God. The Holy Spirit is the ruach. It is the breath of God. Receive now the breath of God, the life of God. And when he breathed on them, something in them came to life. And it was something essential. Until you have that, you're not ready to go. But when you do, you don't have to be perfect. You don't have to know the sentences. You don't need to know the speeches. You just go and what comes from you is life. began in the garden, Genesis 2, 27, when it says, he, that is God, that is the spirit, breathed into their nostrils the breath of life, and they became a living soul. My favorite text in the Old Testament around this is what Tanya's saying. Well, they all sang it, but I kept hearing Tanya. In Ezekiel 37, this picture of the valley of dry bones, And obviously the dry bones are a metaphor. They're symbolic of people who are dead, physically dead, spiritually dead in their dry bones, which means they've been dead for a long time. So there's no hope here. And in that kind of context, the Lord says to the prophet Ezekiel, prophesy over these bones and say to them, I want you to tell them that I, even I, will cause breath to come into them, and they will come to life. And when they do, they will know. Not because they heard a speech or a sermon. They will know when the Spirit comes in them and they come to life. They will know then that I am the Lord, their God. And I will put my Spirit in them and they will come to life. It's all about coming to life. And I believe that part of what it means, and this is growing in me, and part of what it takes to be preparing us as a people for next is to be continually aware that the life, that our hope for life and even more life is in the spirit. It's not in you or in me and our ability or our whatever. It's in the spirit that only he can generate this life and create this life, which if we continually remember this, because we'll forget it because I do, it will keep us continually in an uncomfortable but very important place of dependence on that breath and that spirit to move. Holy Spirit, come. Because what needs to happen most in our flesh, we can't do it. And we ask and keep on asking. And if you ask for bread, when Jesus says this, by the way, he's not anything, he's talking about the spirit. You ask for the spirit, he won't give you a stone. He'll give you that. We can't make life come. All we can do is go. And as we go, we touch people and love people and sit with people and listen to people and care about them and help them and whatever. And all the while, realizing there's things I can say here and there, but we learn maybe to pray, Holy Spirit, come and breathe on me and breathe on them. And I don't know how to fix that. When you hear, you ever hear anybody's story and just go, wow, there's nothing. I got no advice. And you don't even want to sound religious, so you may be under your breath. Oh, God, breath. Wind of God. Breath. I hate not knowing what to do or how to fix it, but actually, when I dial into this, it really sets me free. I can't fix it. I can't fix the millennials. They don't even like me. Yeah, they do. Yeah, they do. Some. I don't like them, that's the problem what they need is the breath what you need is the breath so we pray Holy Spirit come then in Matthew 28 he does the same thing same thing happens this is prior to his ascension Jesus is risen he's about to go to the Father and he gives this charge in John 20 it was as the Father sent me I'm sending you and in Matthew 28 he says is I want you to go. Go, therefore, and build really big churches for people to come to with laser lights and fog machines and comfortable chairs and feel-good sermons and smoking hot bands. And I don't think any of those things are evil. But he didn't say that is all. And there's nothing wrong with really big churches. There's nothing wrong with doing it well, all that stuff. It's just not what he said. He said, go and make people who know how to follow me, And then we'll have the life of God in them and then send them, because the goal isn't to get everybody to come here. I want you to go there. Because this going there, it's a fundamentally different paradigm from what you're used to, from what most of us grew up on, from what we see as even being successful in the church world. And so he said, go. But before you do, Acts 8, verse 1, just one little thing. Before you go and do the missional thing, I want you to wait in Jerusalem for the promise of the Father. And the promise of the Father is the breath of God, the Holy Spirit. And when the breath of God comes on you, you will be my witnesses. By being his witnesses, it doesn't mean what I grew up thinking being a witness was. I got to go door to door and talk to people. I don't know. You're going to hell, by the way. Just being a witness. Now the witness there is if the life of God comes into you, the breath of God brings you alive, you were a witness of the life. You know, you know, you know I'm alive, I'm alive, I know. Not perfect, not close. But the spirit came on me and I know it. And now you're ready to go. The same way I want, says Jesus. If the breath is in you, you're ready to go. As the Father sent me, I want you. now to go with this breath in you. You don't need a speech. I just want you to go and be with them. Love them. No, stay in that job where the people are, you know, they're so liberal. Stay there and love them, love them. I need to fix them. Don't need to fix anybody. What they need is the breath, not your advice. Sit with them and hear them and eat with them and befriend them. He was a friend of sinners. And maybe one day you'll breathe on them and they will come to life, but it wasn't your breath. I had the opportunity this week to sit with a young emerging leader in our church and hear her story of her coming to faith. It was a fabulous story that left me in tears, and I'll explain why in a second. Her childhood was difficult. A mom who was angry, a dad who was absent, a brother who was angry, and she was too, and about 14 years old. Something happened in her brother's life where a neighbor, a couple doors down, a Christian family who loved on her brother, and she didn't know exactly what happened to him, except he became kind and generous, and who are you, and that was weird. But dad was gone all the time, and on one particular moment, day, they had gone someplace to meet with their dad. Their dad was going to show up this time, and so they went to the place where he was going to be, and he didn't come, and he didn't come, and he didn't come, and they waited two hours, and they realized he wasn't going to come, which is what he normally did. He didn't come, so they started walking home in silence without nothing to say, and then when they got home, they went up on the roof of the house, which is where they went to talk a lot. This young woman at 14 and her older brother, where they'd sit up there and talk about what scared them and what delighted them, And after a while, her older brother broke the silence as they're thinking about their dad who didn't come. And he said, we have a father. We have a father in heaven who loves us. So profound. And then she's sitting across the table. Her name was Lindsay. She's sitting right over here. She's sitting across the table from me. And she said, my brother said, we have a father in heaven who loves us. And I've been following Jesus ever since. And I was doing this then. And so what happened there? Her older brother, what a speech. I know what happened to her. The spirit of God breathed on her on that rooftop with her brother, and she came to life. And she's been alive ever since, not even near perfect. Alive. And becoming more and more alive. Let me close with a couple questions. Do you have that life? Do you have this life? How do you get it? You know, all you have to do is ask. Ask for it. And if you ask for bread, he won't give you stone. I have nothing more fancy than that. And we pray, Holy Spirit, come. Let me ask you another question. Has it been a while since you experienced that life, since you smelled that breath? Because some of you can remember when. But it's been a while since you smelled the breath. And I know that's a bad metaphor because most breath is bad breath. You're like, no. No, but you know what I'm talking about. It's been a while since you felt the wind of God. You tasted the wine. another question are you acting like it's all up to you because I do that and if you are acting like it's all up to you if we're going to win the millennials if we're going to win you're real tired dial it down a notch and let's start praying a different way out of a different paradigm I'm Holy Spirit come breath of God. Breeze on us. Wind of God blow. On us, in us, through us. Would you stand with me as we close? it's not a new paradigm it's an old one rooted in the character an activity of God who said I will go and so he did he sent his son and his son sent to us I send you now but wait a minute you need the breath Holy Spirit I have no idea how to make it happen. All we can do is ask Holy Spirit come and breathe on us and people who maybe don't even know they need it and to people who desperately want it and to people for whom it's been a long time since they sensed it. Holy Spirit, come and breathe on your people so that when we go into our ordinary lives this afternoon and then tomorrow, we might have something more to give than an invitation to church, which is fine, but that they might smell something of the fragrance of Christ, that it might smell to them like life. we pray these things in Jesus name and for his sake and all God's people said Amen God bless you as you leave Thank you.
