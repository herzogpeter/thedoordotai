Thank you very much. It's quite daunting hearing all of your involvements already in this whole area. I feel like, I hope there's something new for you to chew on or maybe put together in a different way. But it feels like the Twin Cities are very similar to Los Angeles where the world has come to these two major metropolises. And some of the churches, unfortunately not most of the churches, are just kind of waking up to all of this. But I do want to thank you for the great invitation to come out here today. The picture you have up on the screen, I found this picture on the Internet, and it reminded me of the little game we used to play as kids. You know, he's like, here's the church, here's the steeple. Except, you know, you open the door, and the way we played it with your own hands, He opened the door and says, all the same kind of people, right? And this, if you look closely, this is a white hand and a black hand. I don't know how they severed bodies and, you know, got these people to do this. But I thought, boy, what an evocative picture of what is on God's heart. And this is a continuing journey for myself as I'm relatively, like many of you, new to this table. But passionate about it. And we're going to be going through three sessions today. And if you go to the next slide, I'll give you an overview of what I'd like to cover and how it's organized. This first session, we're going to talk about shifting the race paradigm. And if you're not familiar with the term paradigm, paradigm is simply a concept that was popularized sort of in the 90s in organizational talk. It's another way of talking about model. When a paradigm shifts, everything goes back to zero. All the rules change. And we're going to spend most of our time in this first session actually shifting what most of us think about race. And I think there's some fascinating research that has just come out. And you're going to have to bear with my life science background. I don't know how many life science majors are here that never thought they were going to be a pastor. But, you know, that's me. And without you having to go too far into chromosomes and DNA and all that stuff, I think it's startling what secular anthropologists have now decided is true about the human race. So we're going to be spending the first session talking about that. The second session this morning is the church as redemptive community. And that's where I'm going to be breaking down this concept that I don't know if it's original to us, but we use it a lot. Even instead of saying racial reconciliation, I'm on the board of Westmont College out in Santa Barbara. And I'm on the diversity committee. I was also head of the multi-ethnic committee for InterVarsity's board for many years. And one of the things we're going to talk about in the second session is, I think among many white Christians, there is diversity fatigue. I think a lot of people, especially white Christians, are just saying, you know what, I'm done with this diversity thing. It's just PC. It's political correctness. I don't need to hear this anymore. And I think even when we look at percentages and ratios as we, you know, are want to do, it actually can get us focusing on something surface, not necessarily deep. So redemptive community will be defined. And then third, bringing God's coming future now. How do we rehearse, as many of us already understand, how do we rehearse heaven now? How do we show that in our churches, this is what heaven is going to be like? So that'll be our afternoon session. this first session's text is taken from a very very familiar portion of scripture Genesis 127 to 31 and essentially it says God created human beings he created them God-like reflecting God's nature he created them male and female God blessed them prosper reproduce fill earth take charge be responsible for fish in the sea and birds in the air for every living thing that moves on the face of the earth. God looked over everything he made. It was so good, so very good. And the simple point I want us to begin with here today is to appreciate that from the scriptural record that God created one race from the very beginning. He didn't create multiple races of humans. He created the human race. And this is really the point of this first session is even our language today still presumes that there is more than one race, okay? When we talk about racial reconciliation, it presumes that there's different races that have to be reconciled, and it gets us off on the wrong track, okay? And it's one thing for those of us who revere the scripture is to say, well, the Bible's always said that, right? The Bible's always said that even though we don't act like it, even though we don't talk like it, even though we don't think like it, And I'm going to suggest to you today that science is catching up to the Bible. And in this particular case, there's a book that's just come out last year called Mapping Human History. Mapping Human History, Genes, Race, and Our Common Origins. And the writer is Steve Olson. He is a science writer, I think, for Newsweek and something like that. The basic conclusion is in looking at fossil records of human skeletons at the DNA level, that basically we all come from Africa, and we're all related, that there is only one human race. In spite of the physical differences that we tend to categorize each other by, those are all more environmental adjustments that beneath the skin, I mean, literally, this is only skin deep. there has always only been one human race. And so the rest of this session, I've pulled some quotes here so you don't have to read the book, because I know some of you won't. And even with my science background, sometimes they get really into it, you know. But it's very, very fascinating stuff. Let's go to the next. Okay, you got it up there. Scientific biases abounded. In 1758, Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus gave human species its formal name, Homo sapiens. So that's where the whole term homo sapiens first arose. And then he proceeded to subdivide homo sapiens into four subcategories. The first was red americans or red americanus, and he characterized them as ill-tempered, obstinate, contented, and free. Then he said yellow Asians, and some of us resemble this, Asiaticus, characterized as severe, haughty, but desirous. What the heck does that mean? You know, it's like, oh, hot or we desire many things. You know, I'm not sure what to do with that. Black Africans are Afro, crafty, slow, and foolish. Okay, and then white Europeans, Europeans, active, very smart, inventive. Gee, was there any bias in this study at all? Now, this was passed off as science. okay this is where this whole thing started rolling out when european scientists decided they came in with this whole homo sapiens thing came up with the four subcategories and we started going off into different racial categories okay and does it surprise anyone in this room probably not in this room that because it was a white european coming up with all of this that the only one that has all positive descriptions are the europeus okay and sad sad enough to say even though this is now obviously pseudoscience if you read into this you see a lot of stereotyping going on that is that is endured even to today okay maybe even some of our own minds all right now this this next quote is very interesting we come from a common pool of ancestors Everyone in the world today is most likely descended from Nefertiti. Remember that very beautiful bust of an Egyptian queen with the headpiece? From Confucius and from Julius Caesar. One need go back only a couple of millennia to connect everyone alive today to a common pool of ancestors. Being descended from someone doesn't necessarily mean that you have any DNA from that person. The DNA now in our cells consists of bits and pieces of the DNA that was in thousands of people's cells a millennium or two ago. Our DNA is a patchwork quilt stitched together from the DNA of our ancestors. Now, I know that's kind of hard to get your hands around, but essentially, again, these are secular scientists, many of them evolutionists, who have no biblical bone to push. They don't have a biblical agenda, but what they're saying, just looking through our microscopes, we've come to the conclusion that every male on the face of the earth is descended from the Y chromosome from this one guy in Africa. Over the centuries, it's like this is kind of how it's all turned out. And from mitochondrial DNA, which they trace only in women, it goes all the way back to mitochondrial Eve. So they're saying, I mean, it's kind of cool when you look at certain famous people and think, gee, you know, I'm kind of related to them. I mean, that kind of gives you a boost. And what they're saying is, just based on all of this intermarrying, you know, all of this stuff, it's like everyone's carrying just bits and pieces of the DNA of everybody that's ever been in the world. And it's just kind of already at a subcellular level, we're already all one family. Next quote, given our intricate genetic histories, what does it mean to belong to a human group? First, most of the groups to which we belong have nothing to do with biology. We are bowlers, farmers, veterans, cab drivers, politicians, dancers, soldiers, divorcees, beggars, nuns, computer technicians, retirees. Perhaps a group originated among people of a certain ancestry, but unless it enforces membership restrictions, the association between the group and ancestry tends to blur over time. Islam, for example, originated among Arabic people, but today the majority of Muslims are Asians. Most human groups are the products of culture, not biology. And I would even think nationality sometimes can fall into that. I mean, I don't see myself unless I'm looking in the mirror doing my hair. And so when I just think of myself, I think of myself as an American. and so wherever I go in the world I think American I you know and whatever that means to me it means American but I don't necessarily automatically think of myself as ethnically Chinese okay but then when people see me right there's oh well you're Chinese like no I'm American well no you're Chinese right then we go back and forth it's like okay I'm two two two things in one Right? There are stronger associations from the things that we actually grow up with or join or part of than all this stuff of physical characteristics. That's what they're saying. So don't make too much of this. Again, that everyone still has this common ancestry. What about racial and ethnic groups? Racial and ethnic groups are also products of culture. I thought this was interesting. When we label someone an Egyptian, Eskimo, or Asian, We are using physical and cultural characteristics to put that person in a culturally defined category. Without such categories, we would have to describe the person as having medium dark skin or an epicanthic fold or an extra layer of epithelial fat, which really tells us nothing of any interest about that person. So it's so superficial and yet so common for us to just go, oh, I know all about you because I have this visual picture of you. And yet, who we really are is so much more than just our outward appearance. And again, they argue through the whole fossil record of tracking DNA and how things proliferated over time out of Africa, that basically every physical difference that we actually make such a big deal about was more over time, over thousands of years, a response to environmental conditions. So like everyone that lives at the equator, the ones who didn't die of skin cancer, they just got darker. right and so you can find even amongst you know what people we would subdivide into like asians and africans the people that live at the equator tend to be darker like i'm cantonese from southern china right and so i'm darker than people from northern china uh it's it's all that kind of stuff yet you're responding to that and yet we make such a big deal about it we really are a family from a DNA perspective. Real physical differences exist between the average Nigerian, the average Norwegian, and the average Filipino. Most members of these groups, however, share a common biological history which is reflected in their DNA. In terms of our DNA, all humans overlap. Now, I remember early on, way before I really got passionate about this area, I would be part of different ecumenical gatherings, And I think one time I was actually at a divorce recovery thing. I was accompanying someone from our church who was going through divorce, and she didn't want to go to this thing all by herself. And so I said, hey, I'll go with you. I'm engaged to be married. But, you know, so it was kind of interesting going to divorce recovery where, so where are you in your, well, I'm actually engaged. I've never been married. What are you doing here? I was like, I'm pastoring one of my members. And one of the subjects that came up for some reason in our small group was, would you marry someone from another race? see you see how that comes in right and there was this woman from some other church with red hair and freckles and she was like well you know god never intended for the races to mix see and uh it was like and she was doing the whole thing of you know the people of israel and how they were commanded to keep their their genealogy pure and i said wasn't that to produce the messiah we already got one you know it's just like that there was a point to that but but but see what I'm saying again is this thinking even exists, I think it exists pervasively even throughout the church, because this is how we've grown up, that there is more than one human race, and it helps our theology to be undergirded by scientists who aren't even Christians who are saying, folks, we're all related, okay? And it's a big difference when you realize that you're actually from the same family. Years ago, actually, it was 2001, I had spoken at Urbana, and after Urbana, I got an invitation to go to Birmingham, Alabama, and I've never been down south. I have a sister-in-law who's Caucasian, and she's from Birmingham, Alabama, but they're from a very wealthy family in Birmingham, and so she couldn't tell me anything about where I was going because I was invited to speak at a four-night crusade amongst all the churches in Birmingham, but Birmingham was like 85% black. And so basically, it was a black youth crusade, and I was the first non-black person invited to be the speaker at this. It's kind of interesting. And I waited until my second or third message, so it was like the third night of the crusade, to share with everybody that my sister-in-law's son is adopted, and he's African-American, right? And boy, was that an interesting issue for her family, Because the one time I went to Birmingham for their wedding, I mean, the only black people in their house were serving us. And so for her to make the choice to bring a son into the family who's African-American, Caucasian, was huge. And I told this predominantly black church, I said, you know, when I came and I accepted this invitation to come speak to you, it was a little intimidating because this is like way out of my comfort zone. But I said, what made it a lot more comfortable for me is already knowing that there's someone in my family that looks like you. And then I said, in all honesty, do you feel better about me knowing that my nephew is African-American? And afterwards, this older member of the church comes up to me, this African-American fellow. He goes, now, Reverend Fong, I knew you was a brother. But now I know about your nephew. You're a brother. And I said, you know what? And this is before I knew about this research. I said, in Christ, we're all one family anyway. We don't have to wait for adoption and marriage and all of that. That God has already done this for us, it's just that we keep in these rigid categories, and I think it's really keeping us apart. The failure of all categorizing. Over the last few decades, scientific efforts to divide human beings into discrete categories have all but collapsed. And I think it's interesting that at the social level where just non-scientists operate, the categories still exist so rigidly. But among scientists, they've collapsed them all. The categories were clearly artificial since all groups blend into each other. And the campaign to define human races came to be seen for what it was, a misguided attempt to use the methods of science to excuse the inexcusable. So basically what we're saying is, at the core of it, using our Christian language, people are sinners. And part of being a sinner is I need to feel better about myself at the expense of somebody else. And so that's called superiority. So I need to think, and you look at those four subcategories, I need to think that, and believe me, it's not the purview of only white people. I mean, I remember growing up as a Chinese American, and my uncle, who was a medical doctor, He was telling me, he says, do you know why Japanese people are hairier than Chinese people? Right? And I'm like, you know, six years old. I go, no. He goes, because they're closer to the monkeys. I'm like, oh. Right? Right? I mean, it was just, I mean, Pete, everybody's a snob. Okay? Everybody's a snob. Everybody's looking. I think that's our original fallen nature. That's our original sin. We can't feel good just because of the worth that God has placed in us as being his children. That's what I'm going to be talking about at Open Door this weekend. And that's why it's so important that we connect that way to worth than to say, I'm better than you because you're lazy and we're not, right? Or, you know, we're more athletic and you're not. I mean, you get into all these stereotypes and it's all to feel better about yourself at the expense of somebody else. and they're just saying that up till now, science has been used to excuse this inexcusability. And yet, in fact, in spite of what science has done for us, racism remains. The failure to define races scientifically has not ended racism. On the contrary, the pronouncements of racist organizations and individuals are as bigoted as ever. And as pervasive, if less blatant racism remains deeply embedded in the broader society, despite all the progress that has been made against prejudice. In other words, racism is deeply rooted. And so you could declare every week the findings of these secular paleoanthropologists, and you can have people who went to medical school who would go, oh yeah, I can't argue with that, and yet deep down inside, they would still feel like there's different races. And I want my kids to not be with these kids. I mean, one of the issues that, if you haven't confronted this already, as a part of this whole multi-ethnic, multicultural push, is where it really comes down to it is dating and marriage and children. right and and we're finding in our church that until you start addressing how people feel about those issues they could go to the same bible study for 20 years love each other hug share food and then their children you know grow up together they meet fall in love one day and they come home and then you say you know but we don't marry their kind right and that happens even in churches that are trying to push this forward i had a lady in my church she's chinese american and if if you didn't know you didn't see her face you talked to her on the phone you would swear you're talking to a black person from South Central. Her name was Irene. We called her Aretha. She went to almost an all-black high school. This woman can shake it when she dances. She's like, what are you talking about? That's how she talks. Yet, she hasn't joined our church as a member after all these years. I gave her a call recently. I said, what's the deal, Aretha? She says, I'm so uncomfortable with the direction you're taking our church. I said why she says because I know I don't have a biblical leg to stand on so I give her that much credit okay other people would argue otherwise but she's listened to our teaching I don't have a biblical leg to stand on but I have four babies I have four children and when I pray over them at night I imagine someday them walking in the door with either a Chinese or Japanese person and nobody else and I can't help feeling that and I said you know what I said everybody has a preference. If you're a parent, you're trying to imagine who's going to walk in the door someday. It's like, we all have that. It's not just ethnicity or culture. It's educational background. Hopefully it's Christian. And I said, for me, it's a certain kind of Christian. I don't want a Pentecostal holy roller, hopefully, please. No snake handlers. And I'm not sure about Episcopalian, you know. I'm a Baptist. So I said, hey, it's on one level, having a preference is understandable. I said, on another level, someday when your child actually walks in the door with somebody, and you don't know them at all, but all you see is their physical difference, and it doesn't fit the grid, and you reject them out of hand, and your child calls you a hypocrite and a racist, the label will fit. And I said, so what we're trying to do right now is we're trying to rehearse for the inevitability of living in Southern California. And I said, if anyone's got to deal with this, it's me. Like my nephew is African-American. He's a Fong. For a while, he was the only male in our family with Fong as the last name. His biological father plays for the Timberwolves. He's seven feet tall. He's now on your team. So he's already, he's like this much taller than my daughter. And this is all my daughter's known as. His mom is blonde, and he is who he is. And so when she was two years old, we were playing in Sacramento, where I'm from, and she went through this park and there's this little other kid, African-American kid, that ran by about the same age as her cousin and she thought it was her cousin. So I said, Aretha, if anybody is going to bring home somebody that probably doesn't look like me, it's going to be our daughter. And so I'm saying it's understandable that you have a preference, but when does a preference hide a prejudice? And as a Christian, as a disciple of Jesus, at that very basic level, we need to start seeing redemption of even those feelings and it doesn't get any more real than who's going to be in my family picture folks okay it doesn't get any more real than that okay so just as we start off in genesis 1 science is now saying the same thing that god has always said there's only been one race from the very beginning and that's human by comparing the dna sequences of people from many locations around the world geneticists have been able to measure the genetic differences between individuals and between groups. So in other words, looking at the different, what we would up till now understand as racial groups, they would say, let's measure all the diversity within a group, and then let's look at the diversity between what we would see as distinct groups, okay? What they have found is that about 85% of the total amount of genetic variation, not how people look, but at the level of genes, occurs within groups and only 15% between groups. In other words, most genetic variants occur in all human populations. Most conservation biologists hold that group genetic differences have to exceed 25 to 30% for a single species to be divided into subspecies or races. By this measure, human races do not exist. Now, do you understand that? They're saying that scientists who study these things say that in order to, like if you look at dogs, right? They would say, in order to really say, okay, all dogs are dogs, but in order to say, this is a German shepherd and this is a Cocker Spaniel, when they look at the genes, it has to be a 20 to 25% variation between these groups to really say that's a completely separate species. And they're saying there is more variation within what we would think is a subgroup than there is between different groups. And so they said just objectively, there is only one human race. Multiple races do not exist. All right, now we shift to my questions and actually some of my statements here. Why is it still so difficult, therefore, to shift the racial paradigm? Okay, why is it so hard? And these are just five of my thoughts on this. Number one, we typically walk by sight, not by faith or science. Okay, we are still so visual, and when we see certain visual cues, we just kind of instinctively come to the wrong conclusion in spite of what the Bible says, in spite of what some of these scientists are saying. And so we will continue to use false terminology like racial reconciliation. Now, you know, sometimes I feel like, man, you know, I'm just like picking at stuff. But when I talked to some of my friends who are championing this whole racial reconciliation thing, I said, man, we got to come up with a better term because racial reconciliation presumes that there's more than one race that has to be reconciled together. right and it's like oh yeah but it's too hard to change the language now right I mean that's what people say I go but it perpetuates the wrong thinking and language is so important I don't know if you figured this out yet but language is so important so maybe one of the things that you know we can all work on today is we want to work on biblical reconciliation in fact that's the thing that I've been kind of landing on better is biblical reconciliation because what what we're finding in our church, it's not just what we would previously categorize as race difference, but it's socioeconomic difference. It's class difference. It's circumstance difference. And there are so many other things going on, like these scientists are saying, that really speak to the real differences that people have. We're fighting with all the different groups that are coming to our church right now, and we have incredible complexity right now. The thing that joins most of the people together in a homogeneous way is college education, right? So we're getting a lot of former inter-varsity students who get joint chapters that champion biblical reconciliation, so they wanted to go to church that did that, and they came from all different backgrounds, but what they have in common is everybody went to UCLA, and it's tougher. We had a gentleman now from the community come to us. And he's on disability. I don't know what he does during the day. He always looks a little shabby, you know, but he's a wonderful guy and he's now joined our church. And I'm always worried about him every Sunday because I'm thinking, you know, are we talking like too college-y here? You know, one of the things I started stripping out of my, you know, asides in my sermons was references to like football game results and stuff like that. Because the previous church, when I was an associate pastor, there was a rivalry between USC and UCLA, right? And so the former senior pastor is a UCLA grad, and there's a bunch of SC grads in the congregation. And so everyone knew after some UCLA, USC basketball or football game, whoever won, someone's going to say something from up front. And that was kind of like a big inside joke. And I started to realize, I said, you know what, that leaves out, number one, everybody who didn't go to those two schools, like me, right? And number two, it just leaves out everybody who didn't go to college. and so one Sunday I just said you know what we're not going to talk about this stuff anymore I know my one Korean friend he actually asked people to take off those college decals off their cars and you know he says don't wear all those sweatshirts he says that's tribalism right and it's just it's just it's it's like especially for us Asians it's like bragging you know it's like bragging without saying anything like Harvard right and it's like East LA College You know, it's like we don't have a sweatshirt, you know. So what we're finding is, is that there are other differences that actually are more divisive than these racial categories. If you kind of scratch the surface a little bit. OK, so that's number one. I think we still have to work on getting beyond what we just see with our eyes. And we start to understand it's there's a lot of commonality there. Number two, because we are stricken with something called aversive racism. Ever heard that term? Aversive racism. Aversive racism essentially means I have a personal aversion to thinking of myself as a racist. Because the view that I want to believe about myself is I'm such a good person, I couldn't possibly be a racist. And so I think there's a lot of people in our churches that actually have averse of racism. They have an aversion to even thinking that they could be racist in any way. Two years ago, when we had our biannual church camp, we made the whole theme racial reconciliation. This is before I read this book. My wife didn't even want to go. She said, you know, it's like a one-note samba. I mean, this is all you guys keep talking about. And I said, no, that's not. When we talk about this whole kingdom church, I mean, coming together across these different ethnic, you know, cultural things, that's just one piece of it. She says, well, that's all I hear. Besides, I'm not racist, right? So why should I go? And it's like, wow, because you're my wife and I'm the senior pastor. Okay, there, I pulled that card. You know, I don't pull that card very often, but I just said, you gotta come, right? You gotta come. And we had John Perkins, you know who John Perkins is. His son, Derek Perkins, was the executive director of the Harambe Center in Northwest Pasadena, just doing amazing urban ministry work. And we partnered with them, and we had he and his wife come, who is now the executive director, Rudy Carrasco, and they were our speakers. And probably the attendance at the event dropped by 20, 30% because, I think, of a verse of racism. Even in a church that's trying to move down this road, people are like, well, I'm not a racist, so I don't need to go to that whole thing. And my wife went, still thinking she wasn't a racist. She came home still believing she wasn't a racist, but the thing that changed, she said, you know, I realize that even if I think I'm not a racist, if people are suffering racism and I don't care, that's bad. Right? She was thinking, as long as I'm a good person, and I think I don't do any racist sort of things, then there is no problem. And she says, as a Christian, it still is a problem if there are people experiencing racism and I don't care, I don't feel their pain. I said, oh, thank you. She says, you know, you guys are on the right thing. I was wrong. So that's two times in our married life. That was good. All right, so I think this is a helpful term, aversive racism, where you realize that what you're up against is people's self-concept. They want to believe, especially as a Christian person, that they're a wonderful, nice, good person. And a wonderful, nice, good person simply wouldn't be racist. And I think you'll find that this is also prevalent or it's present in people who are champions for biblical reconciliation. I was telling Dave and Keith yesterday that when I was on the board at university, we read The Predecessor to United by Faith, Divided by Faith. Anyone read that book? Very fascinating book. We'll talk a little bit about some of the implications in a moment. But when you're on the boards of these national Christian organizations that have been historically Caucasian, Some of them, I think, moved by the Holy Spirit, are really moving to diversify. And not just in the line ministries, but even in the administration. And many of the wonderful friends that I have on the board of InterVarsity were very frustrated because as an organization, senior management was still all white. And just getting really impatient with that. There was a time, even when then President Steve Hainer, he told the board, he says, you know, this is taking so long to get a person of color into senior management that I'm willing to either resign so we can put someone right into the presidency or I'll be the vice president, right? And that just blessed us. And then all the people of color told Steve, you know, Steve, we really love your heart, but you got to understand something. If we do it that way, people are just going to be suspicious that this person doesn't deserve this position. And so you're dooming them. It can't work that way. We've got to change the system. We've got to grow these people. They have to be obviously, you know, right for this. So while we were waiting for this to all happen, and it still hasn't happened, we replaced Steve with Alec, Alec Hill, who's Caucasian, okay, and he's doing a wonderful job. I had him read Divided by Faith, and I said, okay, let's kind of look at this book. And I said, for all of you who are so frustrated that intervarsity as an organization is taking so long to change. I said, the authors in this book say, so what are you as a champion of racial reconciliation, what are you doing in your own personal life to live in a diverse neighborhood, to send your children to diverse public schools, to go to an other than all-white church, right? And so I started going around the table asking all these champions for reconciliation. Okay, so as you're waiting for intervarsity to change, you don't have to wait for yourself. How you doing, right? And every single one of them was in an all-white situation. And I said, okay, see, so why? Well, I know we're not racist, so it's just because we're more comfortable doing that. See, and to me, now, I say, well, that's a verse of racism. It's like, if we have the choice, even though you're waiting for something big like an organization to change, your church to change, but you use your power of choice to perpetuate your insulation and isolation, could be driven by aversive racism. Number three, we keep choosing, this leads to this, we keep choosing to stay segregated, insulated, isolated, and ignorant in order to be comfortable, okay, in order to be comfortable. One of the conclusions that the authors of Divided by Faith came to was they said most middle-class white evangelical Americans who are trying to champion this whole reconciliation piece. They're going to continue to fail miserably because, again, they use their own power of choice to stay isolated. So one of the questions they asked in the survey was, okay, so you're a champion of this. How many people of color have ever been in your house? Right? And most of them was like, none. Like, how many people of color do you really know, and you know the issues of their community? It's like, none. And he says, and what they found, was you can't champion something that you really don't experience. You can't. And so they said, I remember when the promise keepers was doing their big stadium things and was breaking down the walls. And I give promise keepers a lot of credit for trying to hit this unpopular sort of issue. And I didn't go to the one at the LA Coliseum. Some of the people from our church went. I don't know if you went to the one at the Metro Dome. But at these events, they would ask all the white men to stand up as a kind of confessional repentant act for all the racism of their white ancestors, right? And who was telling me this? Someone was telling me there at the Metrodome was like four guys stood up out of, you know, 64,000 or so. And a lot more stood up at the LA Coliseum. But the thing was, then they were told, go hug a man of color and say sorry, okay? And so they talk about this in Divided by Faith because this is classic, okay? This is classic. So all these well-intended white men feeling sorry for all their ancestors and maybe a little bit for themselves. They're trying to find a man of color to hug. And, you know, some of the men of color from cultures aren't very huggy. So that was very uncomfortable. Okay. And as they hugged him and said sorry and please forgive me and all this stuff like that, it says the white men left the stadium thinking, there, it's solved. Okay. And they say, when you ask the men of color, they go, didn't solve nothing, man. My shirt's wet. You know, and it's like, it's because you don't experience structural injustice. You don't know about social evil. When I leave this coliseum, I still find the glass ceiling. I'm still people, I get in the elevator and women clutch their purses, right? It's like, you don't know what that's like. And because you don't experience that and you don't have any close friends that will reveal this to you, then you think it doesn't exist. And one of the startling conclusions they said is, These folks, these well-intended folks, they don't think that racism is a problem in this country. It's just we have some racist individuals. And the solution is converting individual hearts. It's not a societal and a structural thing. And he says because they don't have to experience it on a daily basis. And as I read that book, I thought, you know, this isn't just true for white American middle-class evangelicals. It's also true for many Asian American middle-class evangelicals. Any group that has, quote-unquote, made it, right? Because once you've kind of found your niche and you have access routes into different places of power and voice, you think that it's open to everybody. It's just some people don't want to work hard enough. And that's just a trap. It's a real trap. Number four, our deep-seated attitudes about marriage and family. We already talked about that a little bit. I mean, it doesn't get more real than that. As you champion, as I champion these things, you say, Okay, so what is that going to look like if this all really starts rolling out in our family picture? I'll tell you a little bit more about my extended family. Let's see, it was about three years ago, and it was Chinese New Year's. And we're not a very traditional Chinese family. I grew up eating with a fork and a knife, and I learned to use chopsticks when I was in high school. That was because we were in Chinatown, San Francisco, eating in a restaurant as a family, and my parents did what they always do. They asked for four forks for the kids. And the waiter came over and he lambasted my parents. Believe this. He scolded my parents. Like, what is wrong with you? Your children are Chinese. They should be using chopsticks. Look at those white people over there. They're using chopsticks and they're not even Chinese, right? I said, all right, all right, right. Didn't bring the forks, bought the chopsticks. And we were just like shoved, it was like hockey, you know? So if you want to learn how to use chopsticks properly, do not look at my hands. Okay? Because I don't do it right. but so Chinese New Year's rolls around and there's my daughter who was two years old at the time in a high chair next to her favorite cousin Christian who's African-American right and they have chopsticks and they're banging them on the on the on the metal trays and they're going and now is in Cantonese and I'm thinking this is bizarre on two levels number one our family doesn't say I don't think we do but obviously someone must be saying this because they're picking this up. I said, number two, my nephew, who does not have one drop of Chinese blood in him, but now from this genetic thing, he's like, well, maybe the DNA. I don't know. We're making a virtual Chinese person out of him, right? And it's like, that's an interesting metaphor for how what we typically do in reconciliation, what really goes on. We're saying, we'll make you virtually what we are, and then we'll all like each other, okay? And I said, something's wrong here. So I went up to my mom first, and then my dad. I said, hey, mom, you have nine grandkids. I said, yeah. I said, six out of the nine aren't Chinese, or aren't 100% Chinese, and the two boys, one's African-American, Caucasian, and the other one is Guamanian, Filipino, Chinese. Okay, they're the two fongs. And so the next generation of our family's already arrived, and every one of their mothers is not Chinese. My wife's Japanese, his mom is, you know, Caucasian, and the other one is from Guam. Okay, so I said, here's the million dollar question. When do we who are Chinese in this family stop saying this is a Chinese family? Because we're obviously not already. I was like, wow, I didn't even thought about that. I said, yeah, but we're not. And I think it's cool that you love all your kids, but we're not a Chinese family anymore. When do we start changing our language? And she goes, okay, so what are we? I still don't know what we are. I said, we're a family. That's what we are. We're a family, right? And it's been really fascinating just watching the recalibration of my own extended family as we're trying to do this. Because I thought, you know, this was true even before these kids arrived. Because all the women that married the sons, they're not Chinese. And so we've just said, as long as you act Chinese, it's cool. And then I went back to our church and I said, we're doing the same mistake at our church. We're saying, we'll make everyone here who's not Chinese or Japanese virtually Chinese or Japanese. So don't bring your culture here. Don't try to change anything. We're just absorbing you. And it's like, you know what? Even though there's, for the time being, always going to be some kind of majority Chinese-Japanese sort of mix here, part of, I think, kingdom value is when you have the power is you divest yourself of the power. You reach out to the margins and you bring people in. And we're going to talk about that in the second session is about how do you see the Holy Spirit build something called redemptive community. Finally, number five, our failure to grasp and pursue the redemptive purpose of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the church. I think at the heart and soul of it all, we fail to see that this is the heart and soul of God, that Jesus died passionate to bring people back together. He destroyed the dividing walls of hostility. I had a chance to speak at chapel yesterday at Northwestern College, and I had lunch with some of the students. And I think after you, Jen, I'm the second Asian male that's actually spoken in chapel there. It's bad when they can actually remember. Right? Oh, yeah, you're number two. It's like, I hate being number two. I'm used to being number one. But just hearing the pain of these Asian and Hispanic students sharing with me what it's like to be minority on a Christian, historically predominantly white college. It sounded exactly like the stories I'm hearing at Westmont College in Santa Barbara. And they were like, man, you know, we're getting all this hostility. We're being accused of being postmoderns. We're being accused of ruining the unity of the body of Christ because we have an Asian group or Hispanic student group. And it's like, man, you know, all these students to a person was saying, I'm just getting burned out. We've actually had some students of color at Westmont get depressed and have to drop out for a year. And I was thinking, do we even realize what we're doing to some of these students? Are we talking to their parents honestly and saying, you know what, basically your kid's going to be Jackie Robinson. It's not just going to be, hey, it's all the kingdom of God. It's like, no, a lot of these students, these white students, they've grown up in white enclaves, and going to this Christian liberal arts college is to continue and perpetuate that enclave. And so they're not expecting this. They're not wanting this. They're not celebrating this. Now, they're college students. We need to help them get it together. But one of the things I told this group of students yesterday, I said, you know, this isn't just a biblical reconciliation issue. This is a gospel issue. This is a gospel issue that if you don't fundamentally get excited about going over these bridges that Jesus has built with his own broken body, If you don't get excited about that, I question whether or not you've signed up for the real deal. And so last fall at Westmont, as we were getting very frustrated at our college, I said, well, maybe we're making an assumption that's not true. Maybe we're assuming that these kids are really disciples of Jesus. Let's not assume that anymore. Give me a week, and I'll mess with them. And so they were crazy enough to give me a week. So I did three chapels, and we based it on the Matrix movie. And I called it The Message Reloaded. so and we did this at our church we actually had red jelly belly and a blue jelly belly we gave it to everybody right and i came dressed in a neo cassock and the whole thing right and i just said okay here's here's what scripture says of if there's a chance that you may think you know jesus and actually he doesn't know you and what does it mean if you really know jesus if you really love him you obey his commandments okay and so i said on the first day red pill blue pill i i encourage all of us to take the red pill and be rebirthed let's not assume for the next five days that anyone here is a true follower of jesus christ let's suspend our assumptions about ourselves and then the second chapel we did the message reloaded and we went back into scripture the ministry of reconciliation all this stuff and i said this is what the gospel this is the heart of jesus all right and then on friday we had an altar call okay and it's like okay jesus doesn't want us pretending to be followers of his. He wants us to be hot or cold. And I told the administration, I said, now I'm going to leave town after this and you're going to have to deal with their parents. It's like, I sent my child to this college as a Christian and they're telling me now that they're not. And it's like, well, maybe that's a good thing because maybe they're really hearing the gospel for the first time. But we didn't focus just on biblical reconciliation. We focus on what it meant to be a disciple of Jesus, right? Because this reconciliation stuff is the subset of that, but if you're not clear on what does it mean to pick up your cross and follow Christ, right, and into this place of discomfort, then, and you think this is optional or PC, politically correct, then I don't know that you've really signed up for the right thing, okay? So I think that's really a huge issue, is our failure to grasp how this is the heart and soul of what the gospel message is all about. Now, here's some questions, and I'd like to deal with this with all of you. Number one, how does it feel to hear that in this case, science is affirming what the Bible has said all along? Are you truly now convinced that there's always been only one race of humans? Okay, so let's just, we can, this is
