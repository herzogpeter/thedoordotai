I would like to start with a word of prayer, but I'm not going to ask you to bend the knee of your heart. What is that heart? Bend our hearts and bowels. Bowel. Bowel our hearts. How does that happen? Is that physically and biologically possible to bowel your heart? Evangelically. I think the vowels would have trouble. But anyway, I would like to ask for help on that. Let's pray together. Father, thank you for the opportunity to come and be with these folks and to hear out of my own experience and out of your grace. Let's pray, Father, that you would take this and eliminate it and anoint it and give you life and not just words. I'm going to be here shortly, and he'll be doing a different aspect of the same issue around the misuse or abuse of spiritual gifts in prayer. Most of my focus will be from more of the psychological state, but also just my own journey. I think the most valuable thing I bring to you, the most important credential, is my own healing journey. I think education is very important and good skills and valuable, but if there isn't this own authentic transformation happening in our own lives, I don't think it has the same amount of factor of life-giving power. So that's my best credential, I think, is that God is working in changing me. But I do have some training. I have a master's degree in counseling psychology from Liberty University. And so I'm coming from that angle. My thoughts and sharing will be from that perspective, although I do use the scripture, so it's just not this total humanistic, psychological, even stuff being facetious there. If I can just give a little quick opinion about that whole debate, in a nutshell, all truth is God's truth. Psychology has basically just stolen from God's truth, relabeled as man's discovery. It's almost like saying, I'm going to go study this car. I'm going to study how a plant grows and claim to be the authority or the creator of that plant or that car. You're simply examining a design. And when you examine the design, you learn more about the designer. So psychology is a study of human emotion and cognitive processes. It's not the creator of that observation. It's merely observing truth. So that's my premise, and that's how I can very comfortably integrate psychological principles in teaching because it's already in the scriptures anyway. It's already there. It's just been related. And men, women have tried to take glory or responsibility for creating the truth. I want to start with the first point here. We're going to be looking at prayer and spiritual gifts. They're good things. God intended them to be a place where we connect with His Spirit and His healing. But like many other things, in our imperfect and fallen and needy state, We can misuse good tools, and people get hurt in the process. So I just briefly wanted to look at the psychological state of prayer. What's going on for a person, a human being, as they are moving towards what they understand God to be, who they understand God to be? There's an emotional vulnerability, and in that vulnerability, there can be healing, health, and experience or encounter with a living and true God. that's the optimum opportunity there. It doesn't always occur for various reasons. Another point would be an openness to the influence. When you go before who you believe God to be, you are open because he is the almighty, the powerful one. So you, in a sense, you let some normal guards down when you say, come, in to me. So there's a vulnerability, an openness, the influence to hear God's voice, prompting, conviction. Those are some of the labels or words we've put on this encounter. God spoke to me. I was prompting. There's also our receptivity to truth, to teaching, to experience. There's also a trust. I mean, you don't normally do that in our culture, open yourself up unless you feel a certain degree of safety. So the psychological state would be to say, okay, I'm going to trust you. and be open and vulnerable. So I'm laying this out just to paint a picture of what could happen and what sometimes does happen in a hurtful way. Point two, I just want to lay out, I believe, the primary purpose for prayer. There are many purposes for prayer, many benefits, but I think the primary one, in my opinion, is to experience intimacy with God, to encounter relationships. We've heard Ken talking about the Father's heart. The most important thing is your relationship, being with you and not responding to you. In Psalm 62, there are many verses. I just picked one of many that would picture that, that openness or that intimacy. Psalm 62, 5-8 speaks about waiting in silence before God only and pouring your heart out before him. There is that openness of the reception. I'd like to just list a couple areas of risks and considerations or responsibilities when coming around individuals, coming alongside people who are in need or who are wounded. And because of my own journey, my own victimization, I have a lot of energy for what I think could be potentially dangerous for somebody. And I'm listening as a therapist to someone's story, and they're talking about a scenario that looks dangerous to me. I respond to that. I have energy around that. We have to work as therapists to separate our own journey from somebody else's so that there's not this transparent on to the client's journey. If you want them to do what you did, because that's not respecting what God's doing in them. personally in their own time. But at the same time, I'm sensitive to that. I have a radar. I'm aware that people can be misused. It doesn't have to be a conscious part on the caregiver. But I always tune into that from my own experience. And I may have time to go into that if time commits later more specifically. So I just want to lay out this, particularly for those in leadership positions, those who are coming alongside and helping others. That's who I'm speaking to right now. You have to be aware that there can be an emotional bonding or intimacy that can begin to develop and enmeshment with you rather than a deepening intimacy with God. Point A, the caregiver, the person who is perceived as the one offering and giving to help, can be hooked, like I mentioned earlier, from their old unhealthy patterns of caretaking, which would be like the need to be needed. And we heard references earlier this weekend about how relationships can be turned upside down, and there's many different contexts in which that can happen. I just listed a few here. The sheep being there for the shepherd, the child being there for the parent, the client being there for the therapist, the lady being there for the pastor. All those are upside down, inappropriate, potentially hurtful and dangerous to both parties, but particularly to vulnerable parties. So you have to be aware of that. Unfortunately, many in the caregiving fields and ministries aren't aware of how simply that can happen, how easily that can happen. There needs to be developed in those relationships clear and strong boundaries. They need to be maintained. You will also sometimes have to state the roles that you are in from time to time. It's so easy to get them confused. They can start out really clear and real established that through time and through being with each other, they can get blurred. It's a natural tendency within those types of relationships. So I have found it so helpful to occasionally check in with each other. Like Jeff was saying, which hat are you wearing? We're interacting with which relationship, what role are we doing? Because dual relationships are a part of our culture. You can't avoid them. What's important about that is noticing them and maintaining them, particularly if you're from a small, rural town, The person who you run into in the grocery store and you're working there can also be someone in your church. They may have a business. There may be other ways that you're going to relate to that person. So you need to be aware of that and keep those roles straight because they can get ennast or confused. I want to move on to point three, the psychological effects of prayer. Particularly prayer that is not helpful. Prayer that brings the person to self rather than to God. And these are more personal experiences that I have been wounded in and receiving healing from. The slow erosion of the individual ego strength. For example, the shepherding movement or traditional deliverance ministry. And then there's a lot of different deliverance ministries out there that operate, in my opinion, in a really harmful way around bringing freedom from bondages to demonic influences. What can happen in those scenarios, rather than encouraging and building confidence within the ego of the individual, they're again told through various means that you really can't figure this out on your own. You need me. You need me praying for you. I have this special ability. I have the call of the deliverance ministry. That's my call. And so it builds this dependence on the caregiver. Point B is a scripture that speaks of the priesthood of the believer, and that's another undermining of that biblical doctrine that can happen between these unhealthy relationships through prayer or the sign gifts. Hebrews 4, 14-16. Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. But we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are, yet without sin. Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. So the overall goal of any ministry or prayer, in my opinion, is to foster individual confidence in one's position in Christ, not to reinforce dependency on knowledge. So we all as believers have equal access to God through Christ. And it's really interesting to hear the messages of the general sessions because reinforcing what I've prepared for, so I'm really interested in that. It's just like, wow, God has a theme here, and he's emphasizing it in different ways. But it's really encouraging to see. And I think one of the most intriguing points that I've heard from Kent is that if that gets deeper and deeper into your heart and your mind, you won't be abused again. You know who you are in Christ. I'm not going to spend too much time on point C because that's been spoken of before. We have to be careful, and I think we're easily influenced when somebody says they have a word of wisdom or a word of knowledge and they act real confident in that. Come with, well, I'm not positive on this, but I believe or I think I want to give this to you for your consideration and your prayer. Because you are a priest before God is well and I am. I think that is the proper chance to take when you're delivering something you believe God is giving you to somebody else. You have to be very careful about that. Because we are on the side of heaven sometimes to get so we don't always hear everything completely clear. So I think part of humility is saying, well, you know, I trust your ability to pray through this. I'm not sure of this. I'll just give this to you. Bring it to others. You trust. I'm going to say, well, this word. If there's a pre-existing, this is more of the psychological angle, if it's a pre-existing condition of the fear of men or idolizing of people in positions of authority, and we're really set up to repeat, like in step two, seeking approval of father, the father wound in society and the soul, and you've heard about that. Basically, in our culture, with fathers being so absent from families, and now mothers are also giving permission to be having a career and drop the kids off to the daycare. And I don't mean to directly, and my insurance is not to shame anybody who's doing that, but it's just something that's growing in our culture, that it's okay, we'll let somebody else raise it. So you can repeat what you learned in your family of origin in the family of God. It's real easy. It's an easy application to make. So you need to be aware in yourself as someone who is receiving ministry as well as someone who may be giving, that someone could be repeating this hunger for approval of men or women, wanting to somehow please fathers. Children, most of their life, really want fathers approval. I'm speaking, I'm making more emphasis on the fathers because I think that's more common. can be just as much wounded as around the mother and the father and daughter, the father and son, so many ways in which, you know, in our families we can be wounded. But it's easy for me, at least it was, in my own journey to translate the dysfunction of my family onto my church family. So the more we learn about that, and we're feeling from our own wounds and our childhood, we're less likely to be just re-examined or wounded in it. I just want to solve the religious system. Point D, dangerous of a lack of self-awareness and a caregiver. Again, here, she will be less likely to notice or self-monitor with her own needs. This can result in an attempt to get these unidentified needs met through someone who is not in a place to meet them. Point two is unconscious insecurity on the part of the caregiver who can contribute to an abuse of the position or the relationship. So again, I made reference a little bit earlier to that. The caregiver has to be really aware in doing their own work so that you're not an unsafe person. You're able to know, okay, what is my need that I can get met over here with the appropriate people versus using the vulnerable person who is in the place to do that need. And the basic way I see that is the person giving the care or the prayer ministry or the cooperating in the gifts is that they have some unmet needs. It's the need to be needed. And often people get into it. I heard Keith mention this in this workshop that a lot of the original motivation for getting into helping the profession is you need to be needed. And that's not the place to get it. Validate it. that's real natural, you can be feeling from it and you can use it in appropriate ways. But often a lot of abuse happens because the perpetrator has their own unresolved childhood issues and they're trying to use these vulnerable people to get those issues. And point E is a lot of transference of projection. Transference, again, is what I was just describing. and there's unresolved issues from your childhood. You bring them into the adult scenario, and you end up hurting somebody else in the process. So you need to be aware of that. And what happens is often, at least in my experience, is first, the person can be idolized by the wounded person, the person receiving ministry. You step in there, and you're either the mother or father they never had, or the big brother, or you represent God. And so therefore, you are it. finally I found this person I can trust, and is he going to hurt me? Can you idolize them? And then even if they don't abuse you directly, if they let you down or hurt you in some way, they can be demonized. They become a monster. And all the unresolved pain and woundedness from past abuses gets dumped onto this adult. And that can be very destructive and confusing. If you don't understand, I'm not sure anything else happens. I'll spend a little time just hearing from my own journey, the personal testimony piece. I think I've got about five minutes or so. Two things for me, the clergy abuse situation. When I was in college, I had other abusive situations that kind of groomed me, set me up for this. So I wasn't a total doorknob, if you're wondering. And often the question is, well, how did you, why didn't you, can't you, why, I mean, hello? I mean, and it's so obvious when you say it. Why didn't you see it? I see it. You know, and so you can really feel like, I don't know if I want to share this, you know. Because when you share it academically like this, they don't have all the backdrop, all your past, all your shattered stuff to make more sense. And it really doesn't make sense. Really. But anyway, in a way it does because there's a grooming that happens, there's a setup. But anyway, I was in, that's my little protection team. But, please like me afterwards. When I was, first year of college, I was like enamored with a young lady. And she was in a music ministry. That made it all the more spiritual and wonderful. and so I really believed that in time we would get married. I wasn't ready for it, but I thought, well, just in time, I'll get it together and do the lead thing. So anyway, I was very much attracted to her and very much drawn to who she was in Christ, the confidence in Christ. It took a lot of pressure off me. It was like, oh, she knows who she is, I don't have to be the thing I can't be for her. So anyway, I met her father. They come out of a Lutheran background. Her father was a Lutheran pastor. Lutheran pastor. See what it is. They got the robes and all. Anyway, this man was in the charismatic movement, in my own spiritual journey, because I knew there was sin in my life, and I wanted to be pure and holy, and whatever it took, I was going to do it. I was ready to jump on any of the latest things. You know, because I thought that was how God worked. These things. So I was like, yes, now I want holiness. So this group, the singing group, where this young lady was a part of, was a charismatic group. And God did a genuine work through the charismatic movement in my life. It wasn't like the whole thing was negative. Mostly it was wonderful, great. So I noticed that, too. So anyway, I think it was like a Thanksgiving dinner or something over at their house. I don't care where I am, I'm not too much here, but we live in the United States. And I had a meal with them and didn't know their parents. So I gave this guy a lot of power. My future father-in-law, he's a man of God, and he also has the insight on the spirit of God and how he's in the back of his spirit. He figured that out. He had quite figured it out. So he had that power, too. So I was wanting whatever, and this was like 76 or 77, so I'm really old. So he's offering to do a special commissioning, laying on of hands, anointing of my life. And I'm like, I was just really honored. I'm going to press it back, too. You know, I might be marrying his daughter. So there's my setup. We go to this back screen porch area, and this man knew his Bible. He had scriptures spewing out of his mouth, you know. And he began, he wanted to lay hands on me, and that was a little different. But, hey, who am I to resist what God wants to do and getting the fullness? So he began to start with the Ephesians, you know, the helmet of salvation. He just went through all the word pictures of my mouth to speak the truth. the breastplate of righteousness. So anyway, needless to say, he had a scripture for virtually every part of my body, and I was like, okay, I don't think so. I said, no, yes, no, yes, no. I was like, I'm not sure about this. So eventually, he was talking about the seed of Abraham, and my children to come. So it was pretty slippery, pretty sly, and pretty evil. So he eventually was asked for permission to place his hands there. And in my conclusion, I'm sure he was sure. So it wasn't until biological responses kicked me off, his heart rate. He was slowly leaning in closer and closer, breathing heavier, heart rate's up. I can feel his chest pounding on mine. I'm like, I don't know. Finally, just my gut reaction was to push him away because it just became too obvious to me at that time. I won't say anything. But I kind of just instinctively pushed away because it was just getting too strange. And he kind of broke out of his psyche, his trance. When you're into a cycle, regardless of what the addiction is, it can be food or religious behavior or sexuality, you get into this France-like mode. And me pushing away physically kind of snapped him out of the cloud he was in and quickly he closed him there. And I went back to living in this kind of days. What was that? And wanting to find something good, I've learned to find a blessing and something out of that. And I couldn't even talk to the gal about it because it's your dad after all. So it just left me really confused for quite a while. And so I was able to trust it with some friends. And they were helpful. I'm not really attached to this emotion right now. It's a big deal, but I'm just getting this back. So you never know when you're going to get ambushed by your emotions. You're going to be 10 or 15 years out of it. And you're going to get to it. But I think, well, that's not happening right now. So what was that? Why am I sharing that? First of all, just to give hope and encouragement to those who may have been victimized that way through prayer, laying out of hands. And that's a real ripoff. I mean, what that really did, one of the wounds that did for me is hard to trust men in the world. That's really good. And mom's trying to feel something because that guy's sitting over there. And God is huge and profoundly. And I'm sure. So that's me. So that's me. I'm going to continue. And I trust Tom. That's a blessing. That's a healing. I'm surprised again. So I think I'm just leaving with that every time. But that's just a piece where I'm coming from. God is bigger and more powerful than any of you than you can ever imagine or experience. He's using that in my life now. It was not His will. He did not want that. He did not want that. But He's transforming it for His glory in terms of healing about His soul. That's a good thing. So I think I'm going to turn over to Tom now to set your... I'll try to accomplish a lot in a few minutes and then bring Bob back up here if you have any questions for either of us. Jack Haker tells of a prophetic experience he had where a man stood up in the midst of a congregation and said, I must say to the Lord, God of hosts, as far as I know, I have nothing against you. And you've got to sift through that because that's typically what you have to do with most of the words from God that come. And unfortunately, in the way things have been presented and packaged in our culture and in our environment, in our lifetime, it isn't always presented that way. But the bottom line in our introduction is our goal in the use of spiritual gifts, as it is in prayer and really in anything in the ministry or in any type of health and profession, is not to make people dependent upon us, but to empower people in their own walk with God by modeling God's love and exercising healthy discipline and godly leadership. And that's really what it comes down to. So the first part of our outline here, when I talk about the use and the misuse of gifts, I'm just going to give you just a very condensed version, and I'm going to skim through this intentionally quick, because I teach this over time in our classes, but this class was the use and misuse, and so I thought I'd take about two or three minutes to cover the use. And obviously that's not going to get to everything. But in our view, in my view, and I don't want to put my view upon even everybody in leadership in our church, because we have a diversity of opinions even in the leadership of our church about some of this, and I'm grateful to be in an environment where that can happen. But in the view that I teach on this is that the lists that we find in Scripture about gifts, spiritual gifts. They're lumped into a big category of spiritual gifts, and I think the confusion that we experience around this is because we put everything in the same category, as to the gifts. And really, I think that that term is appropriate only in the description of the list in Romans chapter 12. Romans chapter 12, verses 6 through 8, speaks about gifts that are, I call them residential gifts, because I believe they're imparted by God from the moment of conception. He put this into you as part of his plan. And it began to work itself out for your environmental experiences, your behavioral experiences growing up. And they become spiritual gifts when the Holy Spirit comes inside of you and begins to utilize what God already deposited there and bring spiritual life to you. And I call them residential because they reside within you. 1 Peter 4, 10-11 talks about as each of you has received a gift. And he's talking about doma, the Greek word doma, which is what we have in Romans chapter 5. As each of you has received the gift, employ them in the service of God as beneficiaries of or recipients of or guardians of the manifold grace of God. It's speaking and speak, as it were, the oracles of God are serving and serve in a way that honors Christ. And so you've got your speaking and serving gifts, which is how I think the motivational gifts in Romans 4 break down. This is something you receive, you possess. If you're not a believer and you have the gift of giving that God imparted to you, you become a philanthropist. You become a person who gives and gives and gives and serves and serves and teaches and teaches and administrates and administrates and exhorts and exhorts. And the problem we have and the reason we confuse it with the list in 1 Corinthians 12 is because it has the word prophecy there. If you don't understand prophecy, then you have problems because you've got to understand that prophecy is a general term. It was not a specific term. The scripture is used in secular Greek, and it spoke about proceeding and proclaiming truth. So perceiving and proclaiming truth can be done in many ways, including outside of the church, outside of Christ. Perceiving and proclaiming truth is something people can do. Seminary professors perceive and proclaim truth. Psychologists perceive and proclaim truth, if they're good. And so what we're dealing with is a general term here. And so that's why it can show up in Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12. Because in 1 Corinthians 12, we have what I call the manifestations. I'm skipping down to number 3. Manifestations are not residential. You don't possess them. They are of the Holy Spirit. That means a genitive phrase, meaning possessed by the Holy Spirit. So the nine manifestations, healing, miracles, faith, words of wisdom, knowledge, and prophecy, tongues, interpretation, and discernment of spirits, are possessed by the Holy Spirit. All nine of them are possessed by the Holy Spirit. And if the Holy Spirit dwells in you, then all nine of them are in you. And it says in that passage, 1 Corinthians 12, the Holy Spirit distributes them as he sees fit, whenever he sees fit, in whatever situation he sees fit. And so they're situational, I call them, because he decides, the Holy Spirit decides, and now he gives us permission in that passage to ask for them and to invite them to be released, and to eagerly desire them, and to move into them and try to excel at them, but they are the property of the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit lives in you, and you are the property of the Holy Spirit, And he chooses when to distribute them. So that's how we teach. Offices in Ephesians 4.11, I include that only because these are developmental. They develop over a period of time, and they are proven over time. And the reason that it's important to include those in this list is because the infamous passage in 1 Corinthians 12.28 really uses a combination of all three of these lists. Pulls a couple of paths, pulls a couple from the offices, pulls a couple of motivational gifts, It pulls a couple of manifestations, lumps them all together, and creates tremendous confusion for the church for the next 2,000 years. And we're trying to figure out what our spiritual gifts are. And I've seen the lists. I've seen the lists of 19, 28, 37, 54, 110, that have been pulled from all over Scripture, and then little tests have been formulated to try. So you can figure out how God's put you together. And in our church, we have a workshop where people discover which of the seven they have primary and secondary in, and then we have classes that teach on them the functioning and use of the manifestations. So I kind of filled that out for you there, and now I'm going to get down to misuse. I know there's probably a million questions around that. I just tell you how we utilize them. I'm not speaking ex-cathedra here. I'm just telling you what we have been right into. Foundational problems, I think, in the misuse of gifts are basically the ones that we've been talking about for the last three days. part of them are just human nature. They tend to be self-focused. They tend to interpret reality based upon our own personal experience. And Francis McNutt is the first person to tell me this. I know Richard Foster teaches this also. But denominational differences have become almost passing. As the baby boomer generation has grown up, which is basically a non-institutional group of people, they are not loyal to institutions, denominational differences and infighting is going to die out with the generation before us. And as baby boomers come up, we're not going to argue and fight over denominations. That's not going to be the issue. What's going to be the issue is rooted in our human nature, and that is we tend to interpret reality based on how we experience it. So now what becomes the issue is how we experience God. How did we experience God? And how we experience God is how we are going to fight. Those are our fights. So if we're an evangelical, we experience God through the Word, the Word only. If we're a charismatic man of gospel, we experience Him through the Holy Spirit and the power of the Holy Spirit. If we are contemplative, we're out of a liturgical tradition, we experience Him in the quietness and the stillness of silence. If we are a social activist, we experience Him in the faces of the poor. And you aren't really doing church unless you're ministering to Jesus by ministering to the poor. And then Richard Foster has a fifth one, which is the holiness movement. I still struggle with that one. I don't see how that is as applicable. That doesn't connect with me as much. But I certainly connect with the first four. And there are people in South America, I am told by Francis McKnight, who do not believe anyone from North America is going to heaven because we don't care about the poor. And the only sign of true, authentic Christianity is if we care for the poor. And so we've got to understand that this is how people experience God, and we fight for that because that's our reality. And if we experience Him through the Word, and the Word is precious to us, we'll fight against anybody who wants to experience God in the quietness of their heart as opposed to the text of Scripture. And that's where the battle lines seem to be drawn. The problem with that is we need all of them. We need every one of them. And the goal of our church, and the goal, I think, of the body of Christ should be to recognize that there are ways people have experienced God outside of ours that are very valid and very real and very wonderful. And the older we grow and the more we get exposed to them, the richer our heritage becomes and the more we realize how idiotic we were when I told my friend at the age of 12 that his dad was going to hell because he drank beer. That was my experience, and that was how I experienced God. So as we get older, we get wiser, hopefully, and we understand that how we experience God tends to be how we interpret reality. The problem we have is that we keep applying this right down the road. Baptism of the Spirit, for instance. How we experience God is how we interpret reality for others. What happens if when you got saved, you also got filled with the Holy Spirit, baptized the Spirit? How are you going to interpret reality for others? You're going to interpret reality for others, it all happens when you get saved. What happens if you get baptized in the Holy Spirit ten years after you got saved? How are you going to interpret reality for others? and say it's a second work of grace, it's a second blessing. You've got to have a second blessing. You've got to get filled with the Spirit. Have you been filled with the Spirit since you were saved? No, I haven't. Well, then you've got to. So we interpret reality and impose our doctrine on others because we can't. So I think that's a fault that we have. We need to be aware of that, and that will help us navigate our way through and be less abusive in our approach to others in this arena. Another human nature aspect is a desire, a need for significance. We all have a need for significance, and part of the way that fleshes out is our desire to be right, our desire to be in control, and our unwillingness to yield to the sovereignty of God. And that's a hard place for us to be. And we need to recognize that we have that propensity that can guard us, pull us back a little bit, if you will, from ministering in ways that are going to be dogmatic and abusive. I also think that the desire to be right, the desire to be in control, And the need for significance can be reasons why victims can be stuck in the hardness of their wounding and have a difficult time trusting the sovereignty of God. 1 Corinthians 13, 9-12, I include that there because that's just kind of an echoing verse for me throughout this whole teaching. It keeps coming back to me and back to me and back to me. And I don't think it's surprising that Paul planted it right in the middle of 1 Corinthians 12 and 14. finds itself in the 13th chapter, and it goes like this. For we know in part, we prophesy in part, but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. When I was a child, I talked as a child, I taught as a child, I reasoned as a child, but when I became a man, I put away a childish thing. Now we see but a poor reflection, then face to face. Now I know in part, then I shall know fully. That idea of not knowing fully, I don't know of anybody that 1 Corinthians 13 doesn't apply to. I haven't found a person yet that has gone beyond 1 Corinthians 13 and can say, I know for absolute certainty that this is from God. This is a prophetic word straight from the throne of God. I don't know of anybody that that applies to. It says we prophesy in part, and there's an element of mystery to it. There's a dark glass that we're rubbing our hand against, trying to see clearly through it. And we learn to hear the Master's voice as much as we possibly can, but there's always a mystery to that. There's always our humanity. There's always the part that says in the prophecy, as far as I know, I have nothing against you. There's always that human element, that if that prophecy was partially true, the partial true part was, I have nothing against you. Obviously, the false part was, as far as I know. But there's always an element of that, and the thing about it is, we usually know too much to put something out there that's diametrically opposed to Scripture. So the challenge that we have when we get into the subjective arena is discerning what the Scripture says. So that's the passage we keep. Our fallen condition contributes to our potential for misuse of gifts. Our false belief systems. Ken did an incredible job this morning of healing us through speaking truth. Our religious performance means something to God as a false system that sets us up for abuse. God is a mean, nasty God. I'm empty and worthless. These are all false belief systems that contribute to us trying to find meaning and purpose in God and putting God's name on it. And I'll tell you what, if you want to find meaning and purpose, you get into the subjective arena of the spiritual gifts, and that's a great place for you to find meaning and purpose, find power, and experience power in ways that can be very abusive. I think in addition to our fallen condition, it continues to the fact that there are very cool models of this for us. We don't have a lot of people to look to who are modeling this for us in ways that are God. And then we don't know. And Bob's example was a good one because here was a godly man, as far as he knows, who was modeling the very essence of what God desired to become. But there was confusion there. And we have poor models that have been part of our past and part of our experience. And the goal is to trust again. But how do we trust? Because I trusted before, and that turned out to be a bad one. And how do I get past that? Well, that kind of wounding and the poor modeling that we've had contributes. I think one of the poorest models that we've had for prophecy has been the old Pentecostal movement and a lot of the charismatic movement. It has modeled prophecy, New Testament prophecy, on an Old Testament academy. And we don't do that. They don't equate, but the logic involved has done that. And so we are now modeling prophecy according to the Old Testament. And they don't equate. Wayne Gooden's written a wonderful book called Prophecy in the New Testament Today, in which he discusses the differences. I just got a letter the other day from a woman who believes that she has been given the mantle of Jeremiah and the call of Isaiah. I wrote her as straight a letter as I could back, and as loving a letter as I could, but she's under that delusion that there's somehow a mantle of Jeremiah being cast around today, He hasn't, because this Old Testament model has been pushed upon us. Well, let's look at some specific problems and try to finish this up here. Again, moving very quickly. Those are general problems that I've tried to, are a fallen condition and the need for significance and the tendency on our part to be self-focused. But specific problems, healing miracles and faith, I think the wounding that we experience in our past contributes to the fact that once again, here's that desire, that tremendous desire to be in charge and to be right. And therefore, when it comes to this arena of the manifestation of healing miracles and faith, we want to have the answer. We want to have a formula. We want to have something nailed down so tight that there aren't a lot of questions, there aren't a lot of wondering, there's not a lot of whys. We've got all the answers nailed down because if we can get all the answers nailed down and put it in a nice tight package, guess who's in charge? Guess what we have fed? We have fed our desire and our need to be in control. And so we find, not surprisingly, that we have groups that say, you should always be healed. It's your right to be healed. Go before God. It's your right. It's your birthright. It's something you can demand. And if you don't get it, it ain't my fault. There's something wrong with you. Figure it out and get what you've got coming to you. that's a nice little new package and if I was in the religion business just to have a nice church and have a nice system that would be the system I go for and the reason that's true is because all the people who get sick all the people who have financial struggles leave that kind of a system because they don't fit in so that makes my pastoring pretty easy I don't have to deal with any of the people who struggle with the realities of life because the only people who stay and feel comfortable staying are the ones who are always sick and have always got money. Because they fit into that system real nicely. The other system on the other side is a system that says it never happens. So don't expect it. Don't expect God to do anything. Just hang on until the rapture and be glad there's no sickness in heaven. Okay? And so now you've got that nice little neat package. There's not a lot of wondering there either. But if you go to the middle of those extremes and try to live in the middle, You're in the middle of tension. You're in the middle of the tension of saying, I know God's brought the kingdom. I know the ministry of Jesus goes on today. I know that there's stuff that can happen. I just wonder why it isn't happening now. And there are reasons it doesn't happen. We can go through our list. The people over here aren't here for no reason. There are reasons why people don't get healed. There's reasons of sin. There's reasons of not discerning the Lord's body. There's reasons of demonic oppression. You can go down your list of reasons. But the reason that they leave out on this side in this exchange is the biggest reason of all, and that's the mystery of the sovereignty of God. And they don't include that in their list. So they've got that list narrowed down to a nice package that drains you if you're not healed. In the middle, so when we wrestle with people, and we know God can heal, and we know he can distribute these gifts, the Spirit of God is the same yesterday, today, and forever as Jesus is, and he still is carrying out that ministry, and we beg him, and we earnestly seek him, and we desire him to pour it out, because that's our heart, is to be free of sin and sickness. Jesus taught us to pray, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. It gives us permission to pray against all the evil that we see in the world, because there is none in heaven, and it's his will for that to be here on earth. So we have his freedom to do that and press in, but when that person does well, when they continue to struggle, we have to stand in that place of tension and wonder why, and not have any answers. and that's a hard place to be. But that's what I believe is what he's called us to, because what we have to lean on at that point is not ourselves and not our systems and not our ability to figure it out, but upon his sovereignty and on the trust that he is loving. And I don't understand how he can be loving and allow this to happen. But that's the place of suffering. That's the place of pressing through the sufferings of Jesus and learning something about God in the midst that we could never learn in the extreme. prophecy. I include Paul's thorn there because some people would argue that Paul's thorn is not physical, but I think Paul's thorn is a great example of what was going on in Paul's day. Whatever Paul's thorn was, and I'm not one to argue that it wasn't physical because I follow that argument. 2 Corinthians 12, 7-10 talks about that. Paul's thorn, he petitioned God earnestly to have removed, which means he knew God could remove him. But in the petitioning of God, and the agony of the no answer and the wondering why, he came to a place of peace in the midst of tension, the place of being content in all things, as Paul talked to God. And he was willing to trust in the sovereignty of God. He somehow heard God say in the midst of that, I'm going to demonstrate my power, and I'm going to make it perfect in your weakness. And he was content to live in that system. But he didn't just say, well, God never removes thorns, and he didn't say, God always removes thorns, what's wrong with me? He said, I'm willing to live in the middle of that tension and discover what it is God wants to work out to me. Prophecy, wisdom, and knowledge, this is probably the most abusive of all. I shouldn't say that because all of them can be abusive. Prophecy, wisdom, and knowledge, these subjective of little impressions that we get, and we can go around and we can destroy people's lives with them. I'm going to just say, thus saith the Lord, we have outlawed that phrase in our church. Now it probably goes on, and I've given people permission to rebuke it and confront it when they hear it. Not because I don't think it's biblical, I find it is found even in the New Testament, but because I think it is unnecessary. Let's say it to the Lord, putting God's name on something. I give people complete permission to say that about words that God gives them for themselves. If you get a word for yourself and you want to attribute it to God, go ahead. You have my permission to do that. But if you start messing around with somebody else's life, and you start messing around with my life, and you start putting God's name on it, that I will use them. And I will confront that, and I give my people permission to confront that. And the reason I do is because it is totally unnecessary. Isaiah 55. And if you think about it, it just makes common sense. Why do you have to put God's name on a word that God spoke to you and that is really from him? Isaiah 55 says that his word shall never return void, but it will accomplish the purpose for which it was intended. You don't have to put his name on anything. He has promised that if it is truly a word from him, and whatever is a word from him, it will accomplish the purpose for which it is intended. So don't put his name on it, because we see through a glass darkly. We know in part, we prophesy in part, stop putting his name on stuff. I went to my voicemail this morning, and one of the intercessors who's been in shooting for this conference called and left a message on my voicemail. She said, God's just directed me to this passage, I can't get out of my head. At the conference, I'm going to pray for it. Forgive me for taking up your time. I guess I haven't really even completed my work yet. Well, it's a passage that she gave me, and I'm trying to remember where I wanted to start reading. Here it is. It's Ezekiel chapter 13. I wanted to come up here at the end of Ken's message this morning and read the passage that she laid out, but the whole chapter is incredible. It says, The word of the Lord came to me, Son of Man. Prophecy against the prophets of Israel, who are now prophesying. Say to those who prophesy out of their own imagination, Hear the word of the Lord. This is what the sovereign Lord says. Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and see nothing. The prophets, O Israel, are like jackals among ruins. You have not gone up to the breaks in the wall to repair it for the house of Israel so that it will stand firm in the valley of the earth. You hear that? You're prophesying, but you're not going up to do the work of healing. You're not going up to heal the walls, to repair the walls. The visions are false and the divination is a lie. They say, The Lord declares, when the Lord has not sent them, yet they expect their words to be fulfilled. Have you not seen the false visions and uttered lying divinations when you say, The Lord declares, though I have not spoken? Therefore, this is what the sovereign Lord says, one bubble billion. Because of your false words and lying visions, I am against you. And because they lead my people astray, saying, Peace when there is no peace. And because when a clumsy wall is built, they cover it with whitewash. Therefore, tell those who cover it with whitewash that it is going to fall. Rain will come in torrents, and I will send hailstones twiddling down, and violent rains burst forth. When the wall collapses, people will not ask me, where is the whitewash you cover it with? It's a great task for this whole conference in terms of the whitewashed walls are going to come down. And when it comes to this whole arena, I just get real big about it. I just can't help but feel that we go around messing with people's lives in the name of God, and this is one of the ways we do it in this subjective arena. And if we are insecure and looking for significance, this is a place where we can get it. We tap into the manifestations of the Spirit, and that's exciting, and it's powerful, and it's real, and we can validate ourselves a great deal in that arena, so we have to be very careful. Discernment of tongues, interpretation of tongues, false badges of maturity. I include fruit versus gifts, and it's extremely important for us to understand when it comes to these gifts, especially tongues and interpretation of tongues, this is not a sign of maturity. None of these manifestations are a sign of maturity. If we look through the book of Acts, and we see how these manifestations were experienced in the lives of brand new believers who had just come into the faith, and then we go to the church at Corinth, and the church at Corinth was a carnal church, a fleshly church, that they have the manifestations flying all over the place, we realize that the manifestations of the Spirit do not equate with its maturity. Maturity is demonstrated in the firm through the character of the fruit of the Spirit. The fruit of the Spirit comes from abiding in Christ. That's how we know it's character, because the only way it comes is when we've been abiding in Christ, and it comes over time. So the manifestations of the Spirit do not equal maturity, and we make a huge mistake with them. discernment of spirits can be another name for suspicion. Suspicion can be our way of suspecting someone of something evil when it isn't that God at all is doing it. We had that happen in our church. And there was a person who was being singled out as a witch. This person was not a witch, but these independent words were coming, all in the name of prophecy and protecting the body. And it was really of the devil. These were wonderful people doing it, and they had good hearts. But there was a suspicion going on. And the suspicion was coming, I believe, through people's own woundedness. And maybe they've had a person like that that was evil to them. They weren't even conscious of it, but there were things coming up that were not of God. We had to rein in these people, and we had to confront them about what they were getting. Either they were getting something that was not being interpreted properly, or they were getting something that was from the wrong source. And in any case, we had to bridle that in. The tension is you don't want to stop people from trying to excel at the gifts that build up the church. At the same time, you want to protect the body from being abused by those gifts which can build up the church. Concerns addressed, need for accountability. I believe this is kind of an internal concern that we address. Reality checks. Is it really God? Don't be afraid to check things out. Words, impressions, feelings. If it's God, it will stand up to the test. If it's not, it's not necessarily a lack of faith to check these things out. Send people to doctors. Have it validated. Check the words out. Make sure they're real. Do a reality check when you've done something. Make sure that God's, Jesus sent the lepros to the priest to show themselves to the priest. Go show yourself to a doctor. Check out the day. We don't have to pretend in this game. If it's really a God, it'll check out. We're members one of another. Another thing we need to remind ourselves of is that the body, we are the temple of the Holy Spirit. Did you know that? My body's the temple of the Holy Spirit and we are the temple of the Holy Spirit. And there's this community aspect of the body of Christ that we need to recognize. And gifts are not done in a vacuum usually. The whole teaching of 1 Corinthians 11, 12, 13, 14 is in the context of when we come together as a church, when we gather together as a community, these gifts function best there because one bumps off the other, and eventually God's voice is heard, and no one person gets the credit. So there's a beauty in the community of the believers. Let's not forget them. And then the need for boundaries. We need the clarity of the word of God. We need to be like the Bereans who search the scriptures out to see if what Paul was saying was true or not. We need to be willing to do that. We need to be able to understand grace and impart grace to people in godly leadership. And I've included a handout. I'm just going to close with this. I've included a handout that we use here for our healing team about boundaries. That respect people's boundaries on a number of different levels. including the physical level. We've discovered as a prayer team, both in doing intense prayer sessions as well as praying at the altar, that people who come that have been abused, if we don't ask them, and not only ask them, but empower them. If I was asked if God came to me and I didn't know him, and he was asking for prayer, and we were going to go into a prayer time, I'd say to him, Bob, is it okay if I lay hands on you? Now, if the person's really wounded, they don't even have the power to say no if I ask that question. So I have to ask Bob, it's really okay for us not to. We don't have to. It doesn't matter. God can do it, or without it. You have a question. Now I can empower him, because I've got the power, and I'm the pastor. Even our lay ministers who minister at the altar, they don't like this. They want to push this away. But the fact that they're up there with the name badge and they're praying at the altar, They're representing the church. They've got this big God thing behind them, and you've got to be very careful and respectful of that because people have a hard time when they fight against them. They don't have the name pastor on themselves necessarily, but they've still got that whole weight that can intimidate people. So we look for ways in which to empower people so that we don't shut them down. If a person comes to me and is abused and they aren't comfortable with touch, and I touch them, we think the prayer is going to go very far. We've just destroyed everything that we desire to accomplish. And we've done it innocently, but we've done it. And so the goal then is to create an environment of healing that keeps us on the same level, empowers that person to experience God and not become dependent upon me. So, that's it. Maybe it's time for a question or two if anything is unclear. Yes. Thank you. to fall out from that. If I would start to see some negative consequences and start hearing about negative consequences, I would. Because I think it's the same thing. It's saying it in a little softer way, maybe. A euphemism for the best so of the Lord. Are you sure that it was Bob Mumford who did that seat, or was that Charles Simpson? I was thinking Mumford owned the abusiveness of that system, and Charles did not. That's my understanding. I think Bob did. I don't want to put a whole lot on this. I know Charles has been more hesitant to come out with admission of guilt in this. Bob, from what I understand, did. Eric Prince left that shepherding movement early on. He was the first one of that group, that Christian leadership group, from Fort Lauderdale to leave the group and separate from them. Charles has been a little bit more hesitant, and I know some of it has come out under the Catholic charismatic, so does the spirit community has perpetuated some of that. I don't know if you want to speak to that, Bob. The Inarchical Fellowship will hurt mine and be included. I would like to say something. I'd be a little stronger than Bob, and that is that I would say that the system is bad because it implements a hierarchical system which Jesus abolished and came to serve. We gain authority by serving, not by lording it over as the Gentiles. And the shepherding movement was a hierarchical system that did not empower people, but it made them dependent. It made them dependent upon the leadership above them. Some of this spiritual authority thing can be traced back to a lot of stuff Watchman Nee wrote, or didn't write, but was written upon his lectures. And the spiritual authority that he wrote, he perpetuated some of that Godfrey-umbrella kind of hierarchical authority. And I think we have to go back to Scripture and decide whether Scripture teaches that kind of system or not. And when we get outside the realm of Scripture and institute the Lord over the Gentile system, it's not surprising to be so. Thank you. I think we have to be careful in any of the cases. But my suggestion, in the case of prophecy, I encourage people to go ahead in safe environments and prophesy. We know each other. This would be a safe environment. We share a prophetic word. Encouraging people to discern whether that's of the Lord. What's of the Lord and what's not of the Lord. That's what we do need to discern. When it comes to quoting scripture, we can throw Scripture out there and be confident that that's the objective revealed word of the Lord. So I'm not going to say that. In terms of applying that Scripture to a particular situation, I think we have to be careful about that because that's where the subjective comes in, saying that this applies to you now and you have to accept it. But I think to throw it out there and say, just let this be. Let's suggest this. I think maybe the Lord is saying this. That's how I would deliver a personal word. You know, my sense is the Lord may be saying this. Maybe not. Here, take and receive that. If I give that to you and it's of the Lord, God has promised us that it will have its result. Just a gentle way of giving people the power to reject it if it's not of the Lord. Thank you.
