Open your Bibles with me to Matthew chapter 23, verse 37 to 39. As you do, I just want to remind you of the fact that we are entering this morning into the final week of a seven-part series that has emerged out of our normal flow in the study of Matthew as we specifically came to chapter 23. Chapter 23 turned into a series called the Marks of False Spiritual Leadership, or the marks of a false spiritual system. In the first 12 verses, what we discovered was that Jesus gave to us a gift, and the gift was this. He revealed to us who false leaders are. He gave us tools so that we could spot what a false system looks like. The first thing he indicated to us and to those who were listening originally was this. They operate with a false basis of authority, verse 2 of chapter 23. The second thing that you can spot and look for is they operate with a lacking in integrity. That is, they say, but they do not what they say. The third thing they do, and the third way to spot a false spiritual system, is that what it does is tie heavy weights on people rather than lifting off the weight with the message of grace and the message of God's mercy. The fourth thing they do is they wear their religion, and when you see that, you need to get out of there. They do their deeds to be noticed by men, not because it's a genuine work of the Spirit on the inside. And the fifth thing they do, and the fifth way to spot these systems, is that they require the accolades of other people. Then in verses 13 to 31, Jesus went beyond telling us who they were. He then went on to say, this is what they do. And what they do is not a benign thing. You see, these characteristics in a system or in a leader literally has the capacity to shut off the kingdom from people who are trying to enter. Not only that, it devours people. They reproduce themselves in other people. They lie, that is, they don't talk straight. They invert spiritual values. You will find them straining at gnats, things that don't really matter, but swallowing camels, putting up with grievous kinds of sin. They spiritually rape people. They contaminate everyone who comes near to them and climbs into their cup. And they have this strange way of honoring the prophets of the past and really appreciating what they said. But when prophets in the present say the same thing. They hate them. In verses 32 to 39, we saw Jesus not only reveal who they are and what they do, but in these verses, he revealed to us what they get. And what they get is judgment. What they get is wrath, the wrath of God. And that was point number one of a three-point sermon that's basically taking two weeks. Point number one we dealt with last week was the wrath of God revealed. And what we learned last week was that the text from verse 32 to 36 revealed two things to us about the wrath of God that is being expressed upon these kinds of systems and the leaders of those systems. The first thing we found out was that his wrath toward them is personal. Fill up then the measure of the guilt of your fathers. It is a command. Go ahead, do it, keep it up, because the more you do, the more judgment I'm going to bring. And there's a sense of justice involved in this personal attitude that he is expressing. You serpents, you brood of vipers, how shall you escape the sentence of hell? There is clearly a personal tone to what he's bringing to them. The second thing we learned about his wrath towards systems like this and people who perpetrate them is that the wrath they are going to get is not only personal, it is cumulative. Verse 34 and 35, therefore, because of everything you've done here and the lifestyle that you have exhibited, behold, I am sending to you prophets, truth-tellers, wise men, scribes. And these truth-tellers will come, but you will kill them, crucify them, scourge them, and chase them from city to city. In other words, you will not listen to the voice of God. And I am sending them to you, verse 35, that upon you, remember the hapas word there, the Greek word, for the purpose that upon you may fall the guilt of all the righteous blood shed on the earth from the blood of Abel until now. So you're not just going to get the guilt for your spiritual abuse, but you have, by doing that in this generation, placed yourself into the cup that began way back in Abel's generation of spiritual abuse, and you are guilty of their sin as well and also will receive their judgment as well. That's a very big thing. We move now into verses 37 through 39, into point number 2 and number 3, and that is point number two, where we see the grief of God expressed after the wrath is revealed. The grief, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, I wanted to gather you, but you were unwilling. That's grief. The grace of God being extended is verse 39. Even though you don't see my face right now, if you would simply say this, or the expression of your heart would be this, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. If we would recognize Jesus as the blessed one, our only hope, you would see my face again. There is potential for restoration. Before we dive into the text we're going to deal with today, I want to deal briefly with a question that commonly emerges, and I think very likely would emerge, in light of the thing we talked about last week, wrath, judgment. The question would be simply this. Is there judgment for believers? You know, last week, Dave, you talked about judgment and wrath, and nobody likes to hear about that. I don't enjoy preaching things like that, but you aren't able to tie all the little knots together. And I think a pretty common question would be, is there a judgment for believers? And if there is a judgment for believers, is the judgment for believers like the one you described last week? Is it personal? Is it cumulative, that same sense? Is there going to be, like I've always had this terrible sense that there's going to be a day when my whole life is on a screen like this one? hopefully it'll be smaller if it happens and and and yeah you ever thought that you know the judgment seat i want to be glory for me i'll be in heaven and then they're going to show my whole life this is your life want to see dave when he was 13 huh want to see dave in college let's look at dave in college and i'll be going i mean that doesn't feel like heaven to me what's it going to be like the answer to that question is there a judgment for believers and is it like the one we saw here is yes and no. Yes, there is a judgment of sorts for believers, but no, it is not at all like the one we have seen here. I want to delineate that before we dive back into our text, but I want to pray before we start. Let's do that now. Jesus, I thank you for the immeasurable wealth that you have disclosed to us in this 23rd chapter. In the context of incredible tension and stress, just days before your death, you took a stand in the temple of the Gentiles, in the temple, the courtyard of the Gentiles of the temple, and you broke the cycle of spiritual abuse for us, and you stood there fighting for us. And God, as we've gone through these weeks, we have seen ourselves as, in many ways, being victimized by the same kind of system that you have described. But Father, as we've gone through it as well, we've opened our hearts a little bit and seeing that not only are many of us victims of systems like this, but we have ourselves been perpetrators of that, and we've had to come to you for a cleansing and a forgiveness and a renewal in our spirits. God, as we bring it to a close, we pray that we would again hear your voice, that you would indeed be our teacher and the energizer of all we think and do and say right now. We pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. To answer this question, there are a number of judgments spoken of in the Word of God. Don't always know that. There is a judgment for demons. I don't know if you knew that. I didn't really think about that. I don't think about that often. There's a judgment specifically for Satan and all of his minions. As far as we're concerned today, the only two judgments that are of concern for us is the judgment seat of Christ and another thing called the great white throne judgment. Let me delineate between the two. The great white throne judgment is a judgment that is spoken of in Revelation chapter 20. It is the judgment of the unredeemed. It is at the great white throne judgment that the people we have been speaking of in these texts in chapter 23 will appear. They will be the unredeemed. In fact, at the end of the sermon last week, I gave you three categories of unredeemed people. Remember that? When we were talking about something else that was kind of uncomfortable, and that was levels of judgment. At the great white throne judgment, that is the judgment of the unredeemed, there will be, as I mentioned last week, the pagan. And that is the person that we see as the evil worker in the world. The embodiment is seen in the Sodom and Gomorrahs of the world. The typical or the basic bad guy. This is not only, however, a guy who is just a bad person or a woman who is an evil woman. This is a person who didn't know God, didn't know of God, and because of a lack of knowledge and revelation about God, though there is judgment, There is not the same accountability as another group of people we talked about last week that is at this same judgment, and that is who we call the pew sitter. Remember them? Matthew 11. This is embodied in cities like Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum. People who heard the word of God from Jesus himself, who saw the work of God through Jesus himself, who experienced the life of God through Jesus himself, who was there. And the parallel of that today would be, to me, someone who grew up in the church all their life, heard it, saw it, experienced it, and all their life ignored it. It will be better for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than it will be for you, Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, because you heard, you saw, you experienced a greater degree of judgment. That person is going to be at this great white throne of judgment unredeemed. Religious, but unredeemed. The third group at this particular judgment will be the preacher, the prophet. it. The leader, who was a false leader, a false prophet, a false preacher, who had the word in his mouth and had the word, the revelation of God, in his hand, but instead of using the word that was in his hand and in his mouth to reveal the glory of God and the reality and the power of the kingdom to direct people into the kingdom and into the presence of God, they used that word and revelation of God, to establish personal authority, to build personal kingdoms, to tie heavy weights on people, to shut people off from the kingdom who are trying to enter, to devour and destroy. This person is found in Matthew 7 saying, Lord, Lord, didn't we do this? Didn't we do that? It was all in your name. And he said, depart from me. I never knew you. Again, they are religious. They may be doctrinally right, but they are not redeemed. they are not regenerated. All of that goes to the great white throne judgment. There is another judgment. It is called the judgment seat of Christ. This is the judgment of sorts for believers. It is mentioned in 2 Corinthians 5.10, 1 Corinthians 3, Romans 14.10. And again, it applies to the redeemed. The key issue in the judgment seat of Christ, and this needs to be, I don't know, whenever we talk about this, other than now, and so we need to delineate this, but the key issue that you need to understand about the judgment that you and I will experience as believers is this. There is no sin in view. There will be no screen of my life parading in front of all of you, all the foibles and all the inconsistent. There's none. Why? Because my sin has been washed in the blood and so has yours. No sin in view at this judgment. None. But there is a judgment. Nothing of wrath. Literally, it is a place of reward. That is the sense of the judgment seat of Christ. No punishment involved. 1 Corinthians 5.10 says it this way. All of us must appear before the judgment seat of Christ. All of us, meaning all of us who are redeemed, will appear before the judgment seat of Christ. The word judgment seat is the thing that really helps us out. It is the Greek word beematos. It is a word that is borrowed right out of the culture in Corinth. In Corinth, there was an Olympic arena. And in the Olympic arena, there was a place called the bema seat. the Bema, Bema, whatever, the Bema seat, and at the Bema seat was where all of the participants in the events who won their event went to receive their reward. And so they would ascend these steps, and there was a tremendous sense of exhilaration because I am going there because I qualify to be here. Now, if you transfer that over to the redeemed, I am going to ascend those steps, if you will, to the Bema seat of Christ, and I qualify too. Now, it's not because I ran a good race. It's not because I performed so well. The only thing that qualified me is the blood of Jesus. That's what qualified me. And because of the blood of Jesus applied to my life, sin is not in view, and I have the ability to walk into the presence of God and receive from Him a gift, a reward. It's going to be wonderful. Now, while all of that is very exciting, there is, in some sense, some aspect at this judgment of my life being examined. But again, I already know that what is being examined is not sin. So there is not any screen with my life and all the, oh, humiliating, none of that. What is being brought as I'm coming for reward are all good things. They're all good things. Every good thing I ever did is being brought. And I'm bringing it maybe. I don't know if you know if that's the pattern or not, but I kind of picture that. I'm bringing all my good stuff. Some people will be bringing their Sunday school attendance pin. some people will be bringing you know their timothy award they won an awana some people will be bringing their phd in theology people will be bringing in their minds a little list of all the people i have helped years of service 50 years he's got this is going to be good i can't wait i will bring all my sermons where you go what do you think some people will be bring churches they were pastors of a church elders in a church isn't that a great work. People will bring Christian organizations that I have founded. What do you think? And it's all going to be put in a fire. Wonderful. Oh, and that will be glory for me anyway. First Corinthians explains to us the nature and the purpose of the fire. And you know what? It's a good thing. It's a good thing. In verse 12, it's speaking of the foundations upon which we've built our lives. Some on sand, some on Jesus, speaking again to redeemed people. And some of the ministries of our life have been as the expression of Jesus in our life, working his life through us, and it has produced gold, silver, precious stones. But a lot of people have been cranking out all sorts of behavior, having nothing to do with the life of God in them. It wasn't an expression of the Spirit. It was an expression of their own flesh and their own effort, and that ends up being wood, a stubble. And the fire is what helps distinguish that. All the good stuff, institutions I have founded, get thrown into the fire. And it says in that day, verse 13, each man's work will become evident, for the day will show it. Not unbelievers, this is believers, because it will be revealed with fire and the fire itself will test the quality of each man's work, not whether it's sin or not, whether it's worthy or worthless, whether it's born of the Spirit or born of your flesh. and again it says in verse 5 of chapter 4 again what the fire reveals verse 5 therefore do not go on passing judgment before the time don't go deciding you don't you don't know about ministries look at you know we have this little criteria and many of us struggle with this how can you tell a ministry is really valid maybe it's because we're american i think it's because we're human if it's big it must be god oh there's a big great work of god over there just because it's big God. You don't know. Sometimes if it's little, it must not be God. You don't know anything. Don't go passing judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the things hidden in darkness that you don't see, and also will disclose the motives of men's hearts. What is going to be disclosed about all the good stuff we did was not what we did. We know what we did was all good. What's going to be disclosed is why we did what we did. Was it born of the spirit? Was it born of the flesh? Was it born of fullness? Was it born of emptiness? The answer to the question is yes, there is judgment for believers. No, there is no wrath involved. But one of the things I get a sense of as I look at this is that there is going to be a sense maybe in me and maybe in you where an awful lot of the things that maybe I thought were real important, I'm going to find out they weren't oh boy, they weren't as important as I thought. Poof. And I would like to think that a word that I give about this would simply confirm the message we hear over and over again that comes pulsing over this pulpit in a variety of different forms and that is this. We've got to keep going inside. We've got to keep going inside. We've got to go past promoting or producing a group of people who are learning how to policy outside of the cup, get on the inside and allow the Spirit of God to look at our heart and disclose ourselves to ourselves, to continue to come and purify and change and transform and make new. With that little piece of teaching, let's get back to the text. Last week, verse 32 to 36, the wrath revealed. Today he comes with a good word, the grief expressed, the grace extended, the grief expressed, verse 37. Well, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, stop right there. In the repetition alone, just saying it twice, that fact by itself communicates pathos. It communicates grief. It communicates the sadness in the heart of God. It is much like David, who when he went to war with his own son, speaking of some sense of judgment, there was a conflict between the two, Absalom. Upon Absalom's death. Remember what he cried? He said this, Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son, I went to war with him, and we were in incredible conflict, but in his cry of Absalom, Absalom, there is grief, there is sorrow. The point is this, as we move to verse 37, coming right out of this incredible indictment, personal and cumulative wrath, we hear the pathos, the grief of God, and the point is that while the wrath of God satisfies His strong desire and indeed need for justice, we need to understand He takes no joy in it. None. Jeremiah 13, 17, He comes to the people of God through the prophet Israel and says, I want to call you to obedience and I want to call you to worship. And I need to tell you this as well, that if you do not move in obedience and if you do not move in worship toward me, and I don't mean just the moving of your lips. I mean from the heart, a life that loves me. There will be consequences for that, and there will be judgment. But you need to know this, that even while the judgment comes, my soul will sob in secret at your pride, and my eyes will bitterly weep because the flock of the Lord has been taken captive by its own sin. And in Luke 19, this is just before, Luke 19 is just before the cleansing of the temple. It is just before he is about to turn the tables over and bring a judgment of sorts upon the temple. Just before that, he looks over at Jerusalem, and it says that Jesus wept as he looked at Jerusalem. The reason he wept was as he looked at Jerusalem, he said, You have had a day of visitation. God, that is me, I have moved among you, you have heard the truth, you have seen the power, and you have missed your day of visitation. And because you have missed your day of visitation, and you heard the word, and you saw the work, and you still ignored it, what that means is judgment is coming. And in just a minute, I'm going to turn all the tables over. But just before he turned the tables over, does it minister anything at all to you to realize that he wept before he did it? It's because he will do it, but he takes no joy in doing it. Then he describes this city in this verse, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her. You kill the truth tellers. You stone the ones who are the voice of God. You have silenced the voice of God among you and you have turned off the light of God. All by itself, that carries a tremendous amount of weight. That's a pretty heavy statement. But one of the things that really brings this home in terms of its weight is when you realize what the God intended characterization of Israel really is. What its name really is. While he is saying here, you are murderers and stoners You are those who silence the voice of God and turn off the light of God. The name Israel means something entirely different. Their genuine character, or at least desired by God, is that Jerusalem is not a murdering city. It's a what? A holy city. Jerusalem is a city of peace. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you are the sanctuary of God, the hill of the Lord, the community of the righteous, beautiful for habitation. And now he looks at Jerusalem, who was designed by God to be all of that, and says, you are none of that. You are not what I created you to be. You are not what you claim to be. You're not a holy city. You're not a city of peace. You're not a sanctuary of God. You're not the hell of the Lord. You're not the community of the righteous. You silence the voice of God and you turn off the light of God. When I hear that, one of the things that clicks in my mind is as I see him coming with those kinds of words to the people of God in that day, I wonder if he ever comes to the church like that the answer to that is yes I wonder if Jesus ever weeps over the church I wonder if he ever comes to the church the way he came to Jerusalem and maybe in some metaphoric way looking over some hillside looks at the church and just says oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem oh church, church oh ecclesia, oh redeemed of the Lord body of Christ, bride of Christ who is preparing herself for the coming of the groom you are the light of the world you are a safe place You are a holy place. You're a high place. You're the sanctuary of God. You are beautiful for habitation. But sometimes I look at the church and I cry out. Just like over Jerusalem, I cry out and I say, you are silencing the voice of God among you, and you are turning off the light of God among you. And because of that, you are not a safe place. You are not a holy place. You are not a high place. You are not the dwelling place of God. You are not beautiful for habitation. You know, this series, in taking off the cover of spiritual abuse and identifying false spiritual leadership and systems, has created a response in many of us of indignation. As many of us have seen these characteristics, even in the church, especially in the church. And it's resulted in a measure of anger. And I need to say, first of all, that Jesus is angry. Jesus is indignant about that in the temple of the Lord that these things would be happening. And to be indignant is an appropriate response to the defiling of the Word of God among the people of God. But somewhere along the line, the Spirit of God needs to be generated in us so that when we see these things, we become more than indignant. Maybe we ought to weep. Maybe we ought to look at the church and begin to weep. Because in all too many places and in all too many times, it is not a safe place. It's not a holy place. It's not a high place. It is not really the dwelling place of God. It is not a beautiful for habitation place. But we need to understand, even as I say that, and even as Jesus indicates the reality that they are not a holy place, they are a murdering place, he says this, how often I want it to gather your children together. How often I want it to gather. Stop right there. last week we saw something in the character of God that we need to know we need to know that the wrath of God is real we need to be affected by that we need to be exposed to that we need to understand that the sense of God's justice is strong but I'll tell you something we need to see this in equal measure we need to understand and we need to see that the heart of God is to gather his people not to judge he doesn't enjoy to judge the heart of God is to draw people to himself to bring people to his bosom to redeem people to set them free to protect them and to heal them if you want to get an accurate picture of God if you want to get an accurate picture of Jesus it needs to be a picture of Jesus or God with his arms extended with tears streaming down his cheeks oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem how I would have gathered you saying things like this with arms extended come unto me all you who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest. Come unto me. Even the disobedient, come unto me. The vilest of sinner, come unto me. Even the Pharisee, even the perpetrators of systems like this. If you would see what you were doing and turn around and come to me, I will heal, I will forgive. I got a heart to gather. I got a heart to gather. You have no idea, even those of you who are killing the prophets, how much I wanted to reach out my arm and bring you in. he has a heart to gather I have a picture in my mind the last thing Jesus did on this earth was express his desire to gather people to himself Jesus hanging in agony on the cross said these words among the last words ever to come across his lips father forgive them for they know not what they do you know what that is that is an expression of the character of God that says I really want to gather you I want to bring you in. And so he extended verbally forgiveness. They didn't receive it. They didn't respond to it. So even though he had a heart to gather, those people there weren't being gathered. But even as I consider that, as he hung on the cross, extending with his lips forgiveness, expressing his desire to gather, there was one, there was one who said, I want to come. I want to be with you. There was a thief next to him, writhing in agony as well, looked over at Jesus and said, remember me. And Jesus, in grace and love, reached out and pulled him in. In his dying breath, he pulled him in. You're coming with me. Today, you will be with me in paradise. Last thing he did, boom, he brought somebody in under his wing. He brought them under his wing. He's got a heart to gather people. That's what he's got a heart to do. The analogy. How often I wanted to gather you. the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. The way a hen gathers her chicks. I don't know a lot about chickens. I don't need to know a lot, neither do you. The picture is pretty clear. It's one of protection. How often I wanted to pull you in to protect you. How often I wanted to nourish you. How often I wanted to give to you my life. The picture is clear of a farmyard. A mother hen chicken taking care of the chicks. And while they're under the mother, there is protection. And the predators would come and possibly something like a chicken hawk flying overhead. You never really see it until it's got you. But as long as you stay there in a dependent position, in a dependent posture, realizing that as long as I stay here, I'm okay. Picture yourself as a chick. By the way, this ties in right with something Jesus said to the disciples earlier, a few months ago when we went through this. Who is the greatest in the kingdom? Remember that? And Jesus said, the one who comes like a child. The one who becomes dependent like a child, like a little chick who realizes that their only hope is to stay with the mother hen. That's your only hope. If you stay there, you're going to be great in the kingdom. You will come into the kingdom. You will experience the life and the power of the kingdom, but it is a lifestyle of dependence. And as this little chick kind of under the wings there, you know what dawns on me? It dawns on me that the chicken hawk could come down upon the mother hen. I could be the chick under the mother. The mother hen could be fighting off this hawk, and I wouldn't even know it. You know what that says? That says that God fights for me, and wages war against the enemy of my soul in times and ways that I don't even see. And I walk through life like a dumb chick, hanging on to God, hanging on to God. My only hope is Jesus. I can't figure this whole life thing out. I don't know all about spiritual warfare. You give me little glimpses and you empower me to do certain things, but if I was able to see the conflict for my life that is going on over my head in some sense, to destroy my life and to destroy yours and destroy this church, it would cause us to cower in a corner. I want to tell you something. The wings of the Father spread over His children if they are willing to come and say, our only hope is you, and He protects us and fights for us in ways that we don't even see. And you're saying, oh, I have incredible battles. I know you've got battles and incredible battles, but I want to tell you something. There's some that you don't ever get because He's got a heart to gather. He's got a heart to protect. but I can't force it. You have no idea how much I wanted to gather you and bring you in but you were unwilling. God would, they wouldn't. And like arrogant, ignorant, rebellious children you said no. And sometimes we say no. And it sounds like this. It's my life. I'm going to do it my way. Leave me. Stick with the hen metaphor and the little chicks. It's like a little chick walking away from the mother going, you know, I can do it. Leave me alone. I can handle this. And he gets out there in the middle of the farmyard, and he's doing okay, and he's kind of clucking around there, doing his own thing, and he has no idea about the chicken hawk. He's got no idea about the enemy. And as long as he hasn't struck, as long as he hasn't come, struck and stricken, hit, thinks I'm safe. I can handle this, no problem. What it reminds me of is Jeremiah 2, verse 13, where God, through the prophet Jeremiah, says to God's people, incredible. One of the reasons I want to give these verses, I hope this strikes you, that God has been saying the same thing to his people over and over and over again, from the beginning to the end. You've forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and if you would have stayed with me, you would have had life. You would have had the water you needed. If you would have stayed with the mother hen, you would have had the protection. but you wouldn't and you forsook the water of life and you went out here to dig your own well in the middle of the farmyard there's something you need to know about digging your own well your well leaks it will not provide the nourishment you need it will not provide the protection you need and you think you're real safe but you are an incredible danger anytime you want to come back i would gather you anytime you want to return i would gather you and i hope that while you're digging your own wells you don't die and i hope that while you're running away from the protection of the mother hen you You don't die. And I hope that while Isaiah 50, 11 says, you've left the light that I provide to build your own fires, and I hope that while you're building your own fires to provide your own light, you don't lose your way and are lost forever in some sense of confusion and despair. How often I would gather you as a hen would gather chicks under her wings, but you said no. The result of that, you're on your own. You're on your own. I can't keep you from digging your own wells. I can't make you follow the light of God. If you want to light your own fires, I can't make you not do that. But I really hope that while you're out there digging your own wells and lighting your own fires and walking away from the mother hen, the chicken hawk doesn't come and kill you and destroy you and lose your life. I hope that doesn't happen. I hope you get back before then. But you will get what you want. and your house will be left to you your house is being left to you you can do what you want but what is being left to you is desolate i looked up that word desolate in the dictionary didn't even do a greek thing on that yet just looked it up in the dictionary desolate it simply means barren empty vacant uninhabited cold you are being left a barren house an empty house a vacant house you ever seen any churches like that? Barren, vacant, empty. God no longer plows the ground. You know, I don't like it when God plows the ground in my heart. It's a painful thing. It's a messy thing. It's one of the greatest gifts God ever gives me is when he moves with the plow of his conviction through my heart. It's one of the greatest gifts he ever gives you. And you can get away from that. You can get away from the convicting plow of the Spirit of God. Just don't let him have your heart. Just close it up. You can do it. And he can't do it if you don't let him. And God no longer prunes the vine, but he also no longer plants the seed. He also no longer waters it with his spirit. And he also no longer protects if we decide to go another way. And the hand of God and the influence of God is removed. And Ichabod is written, the glory departs. Ichabod is an Old Testament thing. In the Old Testament, what happened was the Ark of the Covenant was removed from Israel or removed from Jerusalem. him. And when that happened, a woman named her son Ichabod, which means the glory has departed from us. And since that time, Ichabod became a synonym for the glory departed. The glory has departed. Ichabod is written. The hand of God removed. The influence of God is gone. I remember meeting two and a half years ago a man for the first time. I met him for lunch in a restaurant around here someplace. And he was beginning to just relate to me some of his ministry experience. He began to talk about a church that he'd been involved with for about 10 years, and he talked about some of the chaos and some of the problems, and he was being very careful to not say this was a perfect church. He had all sorts of weird things, you know, goofy things going on. But what he said was this, and I never forgot it. He said, the whole time I was there, the whole time I was with those people, I experienced, and we experienced as a body, the hovering presence of God. The hovering presence of God. It was just there. We all knew it. You know what a desolate house is? A desolate house is a house that has no hovering presence. No hovering presence. That hovering presence, even when I talk like, what is a hovering presence? You can't put your finger on that. You can't define it. But I'll tell you, when it's gone, you've got a desolate house. And the way it happens is when you decide to go on your own. To fully get the picture of this, 38th verse, Behold, your house is being left to you desolate. One of the things I think we need to do, at least it helped me, was to recreate the picture. See, sometimes we get so lost in the nuances of the text, you know, all the little specifics, that we forget that we're in the middle of a drama. Picture again, if you will, where he's saying this. Let's go back to that. Get the scene. Get the movie that's going on here. Where's he saying this? It's in the middle of the temple. It's in the middle of the temple. One day previous to the saying of this phrase was the day that he cleansed the temple. And the day that he cleansed the temple, he came into that temple and he said this, this is my father's house. One day later he is coming into that temple and he is saying this, this is not my father's house, this is your house. When I saw that phrase, your house is being left to you desolate, that caught my attention. I did then look into the Greek. The desolate word there isn't even in the Greek. That is a word that has been brought in to try to describe what the phrase is saying, and it's appropriate. But the literal translation of the Greek of this phrase says specifically this. Behold is left to you the house of you. Think about that. I am in the temple. I look around. You have left the protection of the mother hand. You've dug your own well, and as I look at this temple that a day ago I recognized as God's house, I recognize this now as your house, and behold is left to you the house of you, the house that you have built, not God. This isn't God's house. It's yours. So you get to keep it, and I'm leaving. In a human level, you could have someone come into your house, and they could walk through, and they could see the way you decorated it, and the way you decorated it was a reflection of your personality. And at the end of their little tour, they would say something to you in a complimentary way, meaning it in a complimentary way, and it would be, you know something? This house is really you. That's a good thing. Jesus, in a way that was not complimentary at all, was walking through the temple and saying as he walked through, you know something, you guys? This house is really you. What I mean by that is this. It isn't God. I see all sorts of religious activity. You're still fasting twice a week. You still pray loud and long. You still give all sorts of money. You have all sorts of postures that you're going through. but I see nothing of the life of God. This is your house, not God. There's no way for me to recreate in you the heaviness that that is for me. One of the things that I think of is of Jesus not moving into the temple, but moving through the church. Moving through the church. and just wondering what he would say if he moved among us. My deepest desire is that he would move among us, and as he moved among our people, that he would see a stumbling and silliness and some chaos, I suppose. But my deepest desire, and I believe it's your deepest desire too, is that as the Spirit of Jesus would move among the church, specifically our church, that as he'd look around, the final assessment would be, this is my Father's house. The most frightening thing I could possibly hear or think of, hearing would be as if Jesus moved among his church and said, huh, this is really you. This is really you, because it isn't me. A desolate house, a barren house, an unprotected house, Ichabod has written the glory to parts. If you're struggling with the fact that maybe Jesus would do that to the church, because maybe some scholars would like to say this is speaking specifically of Jerusalem and Israel, and it's speaking of the time that they were cut off and the church was grafted in, and now we're the church, and this never happened to us. It happens to us. If you have trouble with that, turn to Revelation. Revelation chapter 1. I want you to turn to that. I want us to look at something where Jesus moves among the churches. The picture here is Jesus literally walking among the churches. The churches are pictured as seven lampstands, and in the hand of Jesus are seven stars. The seven stars are the pastors of those churches. And while I believe that these churches that are being spoken of our physical historic churches. I also believe that they stand for every church of every generation. And the first church he speaks to is the church in Ephesus. And he says this in verse 1, to the angel of the church in Ephesus, write this, the one who holds the seven stars, that is the pastors in his right hand, and the one who walks among the seven golden lampstands, that is Jesus. Jesus says this to the church, I know your deeds, your toil, perseverance, that you cannot endure evil men. You put to test those who call themselves apostles and they are not. You found them to be false. That's very good. You have perseverance. You have endured for my name's sake, not even for your own. You've even got right motives and you have not grown weary. I know your deeds. I know your deeds. This is a great church. This is a mega church, by the way. Some estimates put this church at somewhere around 3,000 people. And in this particular area, that is incredible. Acts chapter 19 indicates that the power of the redemptive work of the spirit in these people's lives was so effective in that city that it literally turned the economy of that city upside down. It caused a riot. People got redeemed. They began to burn their idols, get rid of them. The whole economy was built on idolatry and all these little trinkets. People were getting rid of it. I know about your toil. The Greek word is kapos, hard work to the point of sweat. I know about your discernment to be able to tell who a false teacher is and a real teacher. You've got tremendous teaching, great doctrine, but verse 4, I have this against you that you have left your first love. Somewhere along the line, your hearts that one day were hot began to grow cold. Oh, somewhere along the line, it quit being about Jesus alone. Somewhere along the line, you left the protection of my wings and you were no longer dependent. Here is a church that had a powerful impact, significant ministry, solid doctrine, but very subtly, in a way they didn't even see when they were doing it. It could being about Jesus. Jesus says their only hope was no longer their battle cry. It quit being his house. It became their house. Behold, the house is left to you, this house that is of you, a desolate house. I think if we could hear their testimony, they would say things like this. We got so busy. We got so important. We were so right. We got so slick. We were so necessary. The world needed us. It was so urgent. We became a machine, a slick machine, and we left the protection of his wings and we went on our own and we became a desolate house to the church in pergamum verse 12 the angel of the church in pergamum right the one who has the sharp two-edged sword says this i know where you dwell is satan's throne you hold fast my name what he's saying there i know where you dwell where satan's throne is you your church is in a tough place you are in direct conflict with the forces of hell. And you have remained faithful. You'll hold fast my name. Do not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas when there was incredible persecution. But I have this against you, a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam. Stop right there. I don't have time to develop the whole concept of their sin, but let me tell you a little bit about Balaam, who they began to follow. Very telling. Balaam is revealed to us in Numbers 22 as a true prophet of God, a man who spoke for God, a man who heard from God, a man who was deeply dependent upon God, a man who had incredible impact not only among the people of God, but Numbers 22 reveals that he had an impact even among secular people because there was wisdom and authority in what he said. It made sense. But somewhere along the line he got proud and somewhere along the line he began to believe that God's victories were his victories and he lost what I would call a godly fear. There is a fear that is born of the enemy, okay? There is a fear that is born of the pit of hell and when it comes on you, its result in you is it causes you to shirk back and be afraid and not move forward in any kind of kingdom activity. That is born of hell. We need to come against that and bind that. And that's the Spirit of God to set us free from that. But there is what I would call a godly fear. A fear that is a holy thing that simply says this, with a constant awareness, God, I realize that as I continue to walk through my ministry and walk through my life, I have an overwhelming awareness that if your spirit does not continue to move, does not continue to speak, does not continue to empower and direct, We have absolutely no hope at all. He was no longer desperately dependent. He came to a point in his life where he said, I can do this. I can preach. I can do this. Instead of confronting the system, he began to dance with the system. As he began to dance with the system, because now instead of Jesus or God being his only hope, he needed to be connected with the system. He began to lead people astray. When people got led astray, he ended up with a house that was desolate. Ichabod was written, the glory departs. Church in Thyatira, chapter 2, verse 18. Another great church. Verse 19, I know your deeds, great deeds, in your love and faith and service and perseverance, and that your deeds of light are greater than that at first. Incredible. You're growing. You're getting better. Verse 20. But I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel who calls herself a prophetess and she teaches and leads my bond servants astray so that they commit acts of immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols. I gave her time to repent and she does not want to repent of her immorality. This is the church that tolerated sin. This is the church that tolerated sin. This is not a group of people who saw this Jezebel who was leading people into immorality and said, ah, immorality is a good thing. Let's everybody be immorality. They weren't doing that. They saw the immorality and they didn't do anything about it. They didn't confront the sin. They tolerated sin. The word Jezebel there, I don't know if that was actually her name. That is a name that could stand for a woman borrowed from the Old Testament of some significant power and authority. And maybe because she had some power and authority in the church, Everybody was walking around going, oh, we can't confront her. We can't confront him. If we confront this person, that'll cause all sorts of problems. Man alive, they give a lot of money. It'll cause a split in the church if we confront that. If we say that out loud, we'll have all sorts of problems. Let's just keep it quiet. Let's pacify. They've been here for many, many years. Behold, your house is being left to you desolate. You just make sure you keep all that stuff together, and I will leave. Church in Sardis, chapter 3. verses 1 through 6. And to the angel in the church in Sardis, write, he who has the seven spirits of God. And the seven stars says this, I know your deeds, that you have a name that you are alive, but you are dead. You have a name that you're alive, but you're dead. It says on the front, church of the open door, you have a name, Baptist Church, First Baptist Church. You have a name that you're alive. Think of the rhyme of the ancient mariner. It says this, the corpse is man, the ship, Dead men pull the oars. Dead men steer the vessel. The church is still there. The program is still going. The parking lot is still filling up. The pews are still full of people. The bells are still ringing. People are still singing the songs. But Ichabod has been written. The glory has departed from us. Wake up, verse 2. Strengthen the things that remain, which were about to die. Laodicea is the last church that gets a confrontation. chapter 3, verse 14. The amen and the faithful. The true witness, the beginning of creation of God says this. That's Jesus says this. I know your deeds that you are neither cold nor hot. I would that you were cold or hot. But because you are lukewarm, I will spit you out of my mouth. Because you say I'm rich and have become wealthy and have need of nothing. And you do not know that you are wretched, poor, miserable, blind, and naked. This is another great church. They're rich. They're wealthy. They see themselves as having a need of nothing. We've got a great church. We've got all sorts of people. Nice building. Wonderful budget. We're making our budget. Is that incredible? This is a church living with a false sense of security. And because the chicken hawk has not yet struck, they think they're safe. Jesus says to them, the best thing that could ever happen to you would be that you would see your miserable, poor, wretched, blind, and naked. Not so that you could be humiliated, but if you really did see that you were miserable, wretched, poor, blind, and naked, you know the first thing you'd do? You'd run faster than you can possibly you imagine right back to the mother hen, right back to the source of living water, right back to the only source of life and light, and that is Jesus and God, and you'd get back there faster than your head. It'd make your head spin. But because of all that, behold, is left to you the house of you, a desolate house. Let's close with the last word, the grace extended. You see, there is a way to bring back the presence of God. For I say to you from now on, you won't see me, no presence, you won't see my face until you say, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Again, I don't have time to develop this. There is an eschatological view here. This is speaking specifically to the Jew of an end time event when the spirit of grace, according to Zechariah 12, 13, and 14, is going to be poured out on all the Jews, on Israel as a nation. A corporate redemptive work is going to happen so that all the promises to Israel will be seen as absolutely sure. and at the end of it all as Israel looks at their Messiah again at the end times just before the culmination they will be mourning and they will be weeping because they will see him as their only son meaning this they will see him as the Messiah that he always was but they didn't see him and after there is the redemption of Israel it says in chapter 14, 1 and 4 that he will touch his foot on the Mount of Olives and all of the culmination of history will happen. That is what's in that verse to the Jew. But there is a timeless truth here for all of God's people at all times who have lost their focus, whose house is desolate, who see not his face. Whenever you say, blessed is he, you are the blessed one. I will show my face again. First Chronicles, he did it. Second Chronicles chapter 7 verse 13. I will shut up the heavens. I'm speaking of judgment here. There is no rain. I will command the locusts to devour the land, send pestilence among my people, but I want to tell you this. While even that judgment is coming, you can get the presence back. If my people who are called by my name would humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven. I will forgive their sin. I will heal their land. Now my eyes shall be open and my ears attentive. I keep listening and I keep looking for people who are coming to me broken and hungry. In morning Revelation 2.5, he says to the church in Ephesus, remember the things that you came into when you were first redeemed. Repent and then repeat. Do the deeds you did at first. Remember. Remember. Think back. Remember when it was just Jesus and Jesus was enough. Remember that? Remember when you could sing, all the thrills my soul is Jesus and it was true? All that did thrill your soul was Jesus. Remember when you really loved people? Remember that? Remember when you served out of love, not out of obligation? First thing you need to do is remember that, and then you need to repent, and that means to turn, and then do the deeds you did at first. That means to return. Repeat, rather. Repeat. Do the deeds you did at first. What were the deeds you did at first when your heart was full and your heart was hot? Was it the mad activity that has caused you to lose the light of his son? the deed you did at first that brought the joy and brought the life and brought the power was that you just kept you just kept getting under his wing remember that you just kept running to the mother hen like a child absolutely dependent and it was so simple and was so new and you wondered if it could be this simple and you absolutely knew without a shadow of a doubt my only hope is jesus for salvation for sanctification for service my only hope is you and you lived in the reality of that and the life of that. You need to remember that, repent, and get back to that. Wrapping it up, the wrath of God is real. To the people it's going to land on, it is personal, it is cumulative. The grief of God is clear. I will judge, he says, but I will sob in silence when I do it. I want to gather people to myself. The grace of God is extended. to people who simply say, my only hope is you. Blessed is he. You are the blessed one. And whenever he hears that, whenever he hears that, he comes, he heals, he forgives, he graces, he blesses, he redeems. Let's pray. I want you to stand with me as we close. We're not going to sing a song in closing. I want to give you the opportunity to just let in some of what we've said, to listen to what God has to say to you. If you need to respond, we invite you to come. If you need to sit where you are and just listen to what the Spirit of God is saying to you in any arena, you need to feel free to sit and just stay where you are. Those who need to come, people will meet with you and pray. After I pray, the rest of you will be dismissed. Let's pray. Jesus, I don't know the kind of gifts that you want to give your people this morning as it relates to protection, redemption, healing, conviction. But I pray that the work of your spirit would be released among us to bring about the kind of response to this that needs to happen. Those who need to have hands laid on them and prayed for, for a real restoring, for a real reworking of their focus, maybe a redemption. I pray that you would give them the courage to come and kneel and get before you with people who can pray for them. Those who need to just sit and listen and be with you for a moment, to give them the courage to let their family go and let their friends go and spend some time with you. And those of us who leave, I pray that the word that has been implanted would be watered by your spirit and bring forth life and an awareness of how serious this kingdom life is and how wonderful your grace is and how you have a heart to gather. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
