We are continuing today our series of sermons that we've come to call the pain of porneia. It is born of a word in Acts 15, as most of you know from the Apostle James. He was instructing a group of new believers in Antioch, Syria, to abstain from fornication. The Greek word there that we've been using interchangeably is porneia. Now our approach to this whole thing has been to not just proclaim the prohibition, but to reveal the pain of ignoring that prohibition, thus the title, The Pain of Pornea. We are dealing at present with the third of four whatabouts. The first was, in light of the pain of pornea, what about healthy sexuality? Does it exist? Several weeks ago. The second was, what about singleness and sexuality? The third is what we're dealing with right now into the second week. What about when in the arena of our sexuality we have lost control? We have lost our ability to say no, our ability to choose. What about when loving God, when reading our Bible, when knowing and genuinely caring about doing the right thing and not doing the wrong thing doesn't keep us from doing the wrong thing? What about when, like the Apostle Paul in Romans 7, the good that I really do want to do, I don't do, and practice the evil that I really do hate? Now, last week we clarified that as it relates to that out-of-control struggle of the Apostle Paul in Romans 7, we do not know, and I do not mean to assert, that Paul's out-of-control struggle was in the arena of sexuality. We don't know that. What we do, however, know is this, that in some arena of his life, at some time in his life, Paul knew exactly what it felt like to have behaviors over which he had lost control. Now, the biblical word for that dynamic is slavery. The contemporary word for that dynamic is addiction. The word that I am using for that is a phrase, out of control. I further clarified last week, and this is extremely important that we understand this theological piece because it is going to carry us on for several weeks, that there is a major difference between a Romans 7 struggler with sin and a Romans chapter 1 promoter of sin. Last week I introduced you theologically to the fact that in Romans 1, It speaks there of a people who have found indeed a form of freedom as it relates to their sin. But they have found that freedom by embracing it, by celebrating it, and now by promoting it. Romans 1.32 says they not only practice these things, but give hearty approval. That is, they promote those who do. For them indeed the struggle with sin that is seen in Romans 7 is over. They have, in fact, found a form of freedom, but they are not free from sin. They have instead set themselves free to sin. They have found their freedom in their sin. The sad news, I believe, for that group of people is that they are not experiencing freedom, though that is the word they are using. They are experiencing death. They are dead in their sin. The good news for the Romans 7 struggler is that the struggle itself, as much as we hate it and feel bad about ourselves for sometimes even having it, the struggle itself is a sign of life. It is an indication that your conscience has not yet been seared as with a hot iron as it speaks of in 1 Timothy 4, verse 2. You are still in a place where you are feeling the kinds of things God built in you and me to feel, quite frankly, for our survival, for our health, and for our humanity as men and women. Let me say this plainly and as clearly as I can. People among us who struggle, if I could identify you and look you in the eye, I would want to say this to you. People among us who maybe right now today are not doing very well in the struggle. Meaning maybe you're in that phase of Romans 7 where the things you hate you're doing. No matter how vile, no matter how unspeakable, no matter how hopeless you may think it is, you need to know that you are welcome here. And if you are still in the struggle, we believe here there is hope for you. There is healing for you. There is grace for you. The gospel is for you. But I also want to say to those among us who are struggling and maybe right now, again, not doing very well in the struggle, don't bail out in the middle of the struggle. Recognizing in my own mind that some among us may be at critical places in this struggle. The loss of control struggle. The best I can do, but please hear me, is this. In that critical time, don't now exchange the truth of God for a lie and settle for a false freedom born of what right now may look very enticing, born of embracing that sin with which you struggle, celebrating that sin with which you struggle, then ultimately promoting, because you'll need to promote it. You'll need to get other people to move into the things you are to validate yourself. My word to you is this, that will not be freedom, that will be death. Final clarification. I want to restate from last week is this, that at the core of any out-of-control behavior, whether it be in your sexual arena or another, is shame. and shame does to men and women now what it did to men and women in the very beginning. In the garden when Adam and Eve moved into sin, their first response was shame. Their first response to the shame was this. They hid. And in their hiding, they were brought into silence. And there is an evil about that. For sealed in silence, The struggle that we find ourselves in leads quickly to despair. Silence, you see, isolates me and it isolates you. And if I or you am isolated, we are alone. And if I am alone in whatever the struggle, I have no hope at all. So it is about this issue of out-of-control sexual behavior, we have decided to not be silent. And while, again, about this issue of out-of-control sexuality, all that could be said and maybe should be said is not going by me to be said. We don't have time. Hopefully, however, enough will be said to push all of us a little closer to health, a little closer to hope, and a little closer to healing. The push today will simply be picking up where we left off last week, indicating that this week we would deal with the issue of how it is that people, good people, sometimes find themselves set up for this out-of-control behavior trapped in this out-of-control behavior and because of it find themselves in a kind of despair about ever being able to get out of it. Patrick Carnes in his book that I mentioned last week, Out of the Shadows, gives us some help in answering that question, how do we get set up for this, when he speaks of what he calls four core beliefs of people who are out of control sexually. And these core beliefs are at least part of what does indeed set us up and what does indeed hold us in these kinds of patterns. The first core belief, according to Karnes, is this, that I am basically a bad, unworthy person. Now, before I say anything else about that, elaborating on what Karnes means by that, I want you to connect that concept up with what we said last week about what the three core needs of every human being are and connect it up with what we said about how it is that the gospel ministers to what our core needs are. Let me remind you very quickly of what they are. Number one, we need to be convinced that we are loved and accepted without conditions. I need to know that somewhere in my life, God the Father's yes toward me does not change and hopefully your yes for me does not change just because I perform maybe even better. That it doesn't get a bigger yes because I do extremely well. I also need to know during those times that I stumble and don't do very well that his yes toward me and that your yes toward me doesn't get smaller. I am no more loved when I do well, no less loved when I do poorly. The love is consistent and that allows me to live a life of stability, deal honestly with my failure, and wonderfully celebrate some of my success. Because the love is constant. I need to be convinced of that. Second thing is this. We need to be convinced that we are loved and accepted. No, I'm sorry. The second one is we need to be convinced that we are valuable and capable and special. The Word of God addresses that as well. We are chosen in Him before the foundation of the world. We are gifted by the Spirit. We are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus. third core need is this, that we need to know that we are not alone as we face life's problems. And I hear Romans 8 echoing in my ear, nothing will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. We are not alone. And God designed those core needs to be met with more than a theology about God and his unconditional love for us. He gave to us more than that. He gave to us amazing grace. He gave to us himself through his son. He gave to us also himself by the indwelling spirit. But even more than that, he gave to us what we call around here, Jesus with skin on. In the garden, God said to Adam, it is not good for man to be alone. And so it is, Eve was brought onto the scene and relationships were established. That's not even enough. We need family. That's not even enough. We need the body of Christ, all of which are designed by God to be places where my core needs, by the working of the Spirit, always getting my life from there, but cemented in relationships that we are loved, accepted, valuable, and not alone. The problem that we cited last week, however, is that sometimes those very things designed by God to minister those realities to us minister, in fact, the opposite realities. All of us have been, at some level, the recipient of messages and experiences that said you are not loved unless, you are not valuable or special unless, and you are pretty much on your own. And isn't it interesting, in light of all of that, that a secular writer named Patrick Carnes that I am now quoting, who may or may not know the gospel, in simply observing people, men and women, who are out of control sexually, says, you know what? The first thing I notice about people like this is this. They have a core belief of themselves that they are fundamentally bad people. Unlovable. Not only unloved, but unlovable. I'm quoting him now, page 78 of his book Out of the Shadows People out of control conclude from their family experiences That they are not worthwhile individuals Feelings of inadequacy and failure dominate The desperate struggle around sexual compulsivity Meaning the out of control sexuality absolutely confirms this belief that they're worthless and enhances the feelings of low self-esteem. Addicts are committed to hiding the secret reality of their addiction at all costs because of their unworthiness, yet it guides almost all of their behaviors and almost all of their decisions. So, for whatever reason, implicit or explicit relationships with an individual or a family or in a church, somehow the messages or experiences came to me enough that it got cemented in my soul or in yours that fundamentally I'm a bad kid. Grow up a little bit. I'm a bad man. I'm a bad person, woman, whatever. Now, if that is the core belief about yourself, it occurs to me that for a person like that, that even amazing grace is going to have a hard time punching through that. It occurs to me also that that is why, at least in part, from this pulpit, we are constantly looking for ways that we can remind people of who they are, to constantly put people in remembrance of who they are in Christ, that because of Christ and His performance, you are loved, you are accepted, You are special. You are gifted. And you are not alone. And we need to hear it over and over again. But it also occurs to me that for someone who at their core feels bad, that a real easy way to feel real good, real quick, is sex. And so it is people who are out of control sexually very often learned early on that they could indeed use sex to alter their mood, to medicate their pain. We dealt with most of that last week. The second core belief, according to Patrick Carnes, is this. If people knew my sexual secrets, if they knew what it was I was struggling with, and maybe how poorly I was doing in the struggle, they would despise me. So I add those two core beliefs together. I'm already a fundamentally bad person, unlovable. But on top of that, if they knew what was really going on in my life, I would be more unlovable, more isolated, more despised than I am already. You know what that results in? Secrets. Well-guarded secrets, elaborate lies, defended behavior, double life, protected with my life secrets. One of the interesting profiles of people who are out of control sexually, according to Carnes, is that sometimes these people are particularly hard to spot. This is not the constant profile, but one of the reasons they're sometimes hard to spot is that sometimes they present protestations of high sexual morality and real intolerance for people who struggle with the very same thing they're involved in. Well, why would that happen? It's not something they designed, but it is a good way to diffuse attention and suspicion away and keep my secret safe. If I am the one most concerned about morality, who would suspect me? that's the kind of picture of the double life but if I would begin to disclose my secrets I would be despised so I elaborate I develop elaborate lies therapists who deal with this on a consistent basis speak of people coming to them to break their secrets and when they break their secrets they speak of extreme physical reactions as they're sitting, the man or the woman in the chair, profuse sweating, uncontrollable shaking. And the reason for this physical response is because when they begin to break their secrets, they are violating some of their survival instincts that they have developed since sometimes they were little boys and girls. And they're breaking their own rules. And it takes enormous courage to do that. Continually will they preface their disclosure With things like this I know you're going to hate me When I tell you this I know you're going to despise me I know as soon as I'm done telling you this thing That in my opinion is the worst thing on earth You will lose all respect for me And then they go about the painful process courageous is what it is of sharing with you what they think is the worst thing on earth. By the way, back off that person who's making the disclosure, and let's think about us as a church in response to people who are in that kind of pain and need to make very painful disclosures. In a kingdom context, we need to constantly be aware of and maybe readjust in our own thinking if it slips, what it is we respect, what it is we value, what we hate and despise. You're going to despise me. Well, what is it that we despise? Is it the sin? Do we hate the sin? Yes, absolutely. The sin is incredibly wounding and damaging to people's souls. Let's hate that. But let us also hate the secrets that come around that sin and let us be a place where encouragement is given to people who start breaking the silence on those secrets. What do we respect around here? What do we value? How about respecting and valuing? And I think we do, but let's say this out loud. Respecting and valuing the courage it takes for men and women to begin to break their secrets. State out loud as a value among us that if you begin to come and say out loud what's really going on in your life, your stock around here goes up, not down. You will be embraced, not despised, comforted, not condemned. And that posture toward this kind of issue has, I believe, the authority of the Word of God, God Himself, for it is Jesus who said in Matthew 5, blessed are those who mourn. Blessed are those who get out here what's really going on in here. You are the ones in a kingdom context who are going to get the comfort that you need. Just a little side light on that as I'm giving all sorts of permission and embraces to people who need to break silence. Let me talk about just briefly the people we need to come around to whom those secrets are being disclosed. Be a husband for a moment who is about to hear the courageous work of a wife who is now going to tell secrets. Seems to me we need to get around that wife and support her and let her know you are not going to be despised. You are going to be supported and comforted. Seems to me we've got to get around this husband as well who is hearing for the first time some secrets that he did not know. Got to get around him too. Let's be a wife over here who for the first time is going to hear some secrets from her husband. Let's get around that man who is doing this agonizing work of breaking his secrets support him. But we better not forget the wife to whom those secrets are now being broken to get around her as well because the pain of it is going to land on both of them big time. If I tell my secrets, I'll be despised. And so the secrets get bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more and more protected. Listen to the pain of a man named Bill as he began to bring his disclosure in a context that was relatively safe. I'm reading from Three Compulsions to Defeat Most Men, a book I mentioned last week by Vincent Gallagher. The first time Bill entered my office, he was dressed neatly in his tie and white shirt. He had come directly from his office where he managed business accounts for a national insurance firm. As he sat down and looked across the desk at me, I immediately noticed the look of desperation in his eyes. I need help, he began. I've tried everything and nothing works. Can you tell me what you're struggling with, I said. I think I'm out of control sexually. Well, tell me what you mean, I said. He squirmed uncomfortably in his seat. Well, he stopped to clear his throat. I can't seem to stop thinking about it. My fantasy life is totally out of control. I see. And lately, well, I've been masturbating quite a bit. He sat back and looked at me nervously as if he thought I might order him to get out of my office. Instead, I just urged him to keep talking. After I masturbate, I say to myself that it was the last time. that I'm going to stop. But it seems like I always go back. I've tried everything. I asked him if he had talked to anyone else about this problem. I talked to my pastor and he told me to stop it. I guess I feel like a failure spiritually. He punctuated that last statement with a deep sigh and a brief shake of his head. What are you feeling right now? I asked. Like I said, I feel like a failure. I just can't stop. I asked God's forgiveness, but my pastor said that if I go back to it, then I must not really be sorry. He paused for a moment. But I am sorry, he finally said, and I hate myself when I do it. There's three things that immediately strike me about Bill and his struggle. The first thing that strikes me is this. He believed that what he was doing was the worst thing on earth. Thus the shame. You heard the shame language in there, I think. The second thing was this. What it was that he was involved in was way out of control. We heard that from his mouth. He said those words. The third thing is this that strikes me. It was very hard for him to talk about. Because if anybody knows this about me, I will be despised. Now, with that as a backdrop, Bill's pain, the core belief that Carnes talks about, that if I break my secrets, I will be despised. Let's talk about something that for some among us is, in your mind, the worst thing on earth. Out of control, possibly, and very hard to talk about it. And if you were to talk to someone about how you're struggling in this particular arena, you're pretty convinced you would be despised. We're going to talk about masturbation. Now, why am I doing this? let me talk first of all about the silence that's around this thing. And just talk real frankly about how hard it is to talk about this. I talked to my parents this last week, and in the course of the conversation, one of the things that always comes up, seems to, is what are you preaching about now, Dayton? And I told him, in fact, he's getting a tape, so he knew. But I said, this week I'm going to deal with masturbation. My mother said, oh my. Oh, mom, help me. It's hard to talk about. A few weeks ago when I tried to broach the subject and did broach the subject, kind of warning you that we would talk about it, I talked about masturbation. Remember that? And the fact that I did that and muffled it for the first time and the fact that you did several weeks ago what you just did now as you left indicates no big shame, but I'm uncomfortable talking about that and you're uncomfortable hearing about it. Think about it. I sure did this week. This is what dawned on me this week. I don't think there's anybody here who thinks in their mind that masturbation is a more serious thing than, say, adultery. Now, maybe somebody does, but I think generally we don't think that. Adultery is a serious thing, a very damaging thing, but I don't think anybody here would cringe if I said the word, adultery. We can't even say the word. Let's take a look at that. It occurs to me that we could spring that word on some people, knock them right over, knock them right over. I mean, my darker side comes out. I think, man, I could spring that word on some people, and they would buy it right there. Here's the deal. The silence around this issue has given it way more power than this thing ought to have. So what we're going to do is drag this thing out, bring it into the light. We're going to put it right here. Ew. Put it in the light. Declaw this thing. Demystify this thing. Everything has more power in the dark. So here we go. What's the deal on this masturbation thing? Is it normal or is it not? Is it healthy or is it sick? Is it sin or is it in some context even sanctified? What do you think? What you really want to know is what do I think? Lots of opinions. Everything from, you really will go blind. Two, this is God's greatest gift to mankind. one of the difficult realities of this issue is the scripture is silent there is one place in the old testament that seems to speak of that but this is not the core issue that's being confronted so we don't have a lot of help there surveys about this issue are interesting this month March 1st The St. Paul Pioneer Press came out with an article on sexuality. I don't remember what it was all about, but about this issue, it said this. Masturbation in America is a national pastime. This survey indicated, according to their estimate, that 55% of all men and 38% of all women masturbate regularly. That's the key there is regularly. And among professional women, the percentage is closer to 50%. lots of surveys they all say something different another survey I was made aware of this last week was one made among Christian men and women even boys and girls younger there's a survey taken over several years at camps and retreats and youth groups and the like and the survey there indicated not regular masturbation but have you ever done it the have you ever done it percentage among the boys was 90% Among the girls, it was less than that. The speculation on the survey was of the 90% who said they did, the 10% who said they didn't were lying. That's what the survey said. Now, let me say something about that. I don't believe that. I think there are people, boys, who don't, who never have. Lots of opinions, lots of surveys. where are we going to land on this thing? What I'm coming to on this is a different question than is it sin or is it not? Is it healthy? Is it sick? The question I'm dealing with right now is not whether masturbation is a sin but when is masturbation a sin. Now, just saying that is going to get me in trouble with some of you. Hang on, let me explain. I believe that quite possibly as it relates to this issue there is a continuum of health to unhealth I could still be in trouble having said that I'm not sure I'm going to be out of trouble when I'm done but let me keep going here explain what I mean by that continuum thing I believe that for a significant portion of the population, masturbation is a normal, healthy part of, hear this, self-discovery. Hear that, self-discovery. One therapist put it this way, when young boys and girls enter into this and self-discover how their body works, their response is pretty much, oh, that's how that works. That's how this works. This is how my body works. some would say not only is that a healthy and normal part of sexuality and growing up some would argue that it's an important part of self-discovery not like my opinion I back off of that I mean that's like saying you really need to I don't think you need to I will stick with a normal healthy part of self-discovery For this segment of the population, masturbation is experienced neither with a lot of shame nor with a lot of preoccupation. It can be by this segment of the population experienced and put back up on the shelf. There it is. I know about that. Possibly even brought down from the shelf and over the course of the year intermittently experienced. the key that I want to put over this particular portion of the population as it relates to this is this it's no big deal masturbation is no big deal it's there, I know about it I've experienced it but it's no big deal however for another portion of the population it's a real big deal daily ritual two to three times daily for some some getting compulsive enough about this obsessive enough about this that men and women report having hurt themselves seems to me when we're getting there, it's something of a problem. Now, I don't know how you're hearing this, but I just would imagine that if you have a problem with this, or even if you don't, some of you are going, okay, okay, where am I on this whole thing? He said daily, and then two, three times a day, and oh boy, okay, daily means you're indicted. But I'm not daily, I'm not daily. Well, okay, I am daily, but I'll cut it back now. I'll cut it back to, and I won't be, I won't be, I don't have a problem. Okay, forget the frequency thing. Forget the frequency thing. Take that off. How about this? Not the frequency of it. Preoccupied with it. Preoccupied with it. A sense that you can't live without it. Let me just as gently as I can say that if that is a reality for you, that that ought to just raise a flag for you. Let me just for you raise a flag. Let me just raise a flag and go. Something to take a look at. Something to ponder. I want to also say this. This is not the worst thing on earth. It is no worse than any other well we go to to quench our thirst, to medicate our pain, to feed our hunger. But it is no better either. This is very odd. It's almost as if I would like to take the whole group in this gymnasium and make you a person. My son, my daughter, let's have our talk. It's out of control. Let's have a talk. I'm not going to yell at you. But I do want to ask you some questions. And you know what? I want you to ask these questions of yourself. If for you this has become a big deal, Would you stop a minute and think and ask yourself these questions. Why has it become such a big deal? How is it that this thing has become so important? Why am I doing this? Why does the thought of not doing this anymore or even hearing someone tell me I can't do it anymore very threatening to me? Why do I have to have it? why do I feel like I can't live without it now I want to tell you real frankly some of you are going to need help to answer those questions that's okay go get it go get it find somebody you trust find somebody who knows a little bit about the whys of this that can help you figure out why it's become so important and help you look inside a little bit more that's okay but I would like you to consider the possibility that the answer at least part of the answer to the question why has this become so important to me is this that masturbation like a drug like alcohol like other forms of sexuality can be used to do more than experience something physically they can be used to alter our mood. They can be used to medicate our pain. And they can be used to, I think, falsely break through our senses of isolation with our family and with our world. Drugs do that. Alcohol can do that. Sexuality can do that. And so can this. And like a drug, I can go to this every day. And you know what? Every time I go to it, It's there for me. It's there for you. It works. It feels good. But also, like a drug, beloved, after the pleasurable experience subsides, the painful experience begins to emerge, indeed re-emerge. And if I have been using it, even unconsciously, and if you have been using it for this, It has been unconscious to alter my mood, to medicate my pain, to break through my isolation. When I am done, my mood quite possibly might be worse. My pain, indeed, might be worse. And my sense of isolation, indeed, might be heightened. Wow, now I feel worse. And then I'm asking this question. What might I be able to do to not feel bad about this anymore? I feel bad again. I know. I know what can make me not feel bad anymore. Take the pill again. Drink the booze again. Pull out the pornography again. For not all of you, pornography is involved. Pornography is involved for many of you. That brings up a whole other issue I don't have time to get into in terms of the images that are involved in this when it becomes compulsive especially that are very demeaning to women and very demeaning to men as well. If I pick that again to medicate my bad feeling, now you've got the cycle of being trapped in this thing. Therapist that I have tremendous respect for As it relates to this issue especially Keith Hankinson said Related to this Solo sex I quote Solo sex is a constant reminder That I am alone It's a constant reminder that I'm alone And if I'm breaking I'm using it even unconsciously to break through my isolation, it does exactly the opposite. Mike Anderson, another counselor that I have a lot of confidence in as it relates to this issue, and others as well, said this about this issue, that at best, even in the self-discovery area, at best, masturbation is an artificial connectedness. And the real danger of it comes when if I am disconnected from my husband or disconnected from my wife or disconnected from my world, rather than go toward my husband, maybe feel the pain I need to feel in order to move toward real intimacy or go toward my wife and deal with my feelings of disconnectedness, open my heart a little bit, allow myself to feel a little bit vulnerable and scared and hurt, but move toward that thing called intimacy and rather than move toward my world that is big and scary, and I don't know what's going to happen when I do that. If I have found a way to deal with all that disconnectedness by going over here, taking a pill, drinking some booze, entering into inappropriate sexuality, or even this, the danger is now I don't ever have to deal with my disconnectedness. I never have to deal with my husband, never have to deal with my wife, never have to deal with my world. We can just kind of go through life. The danger of this issue, I hope I've made clear, is not just the act. It's that it becomes a very dangerous place, a potent arena, where I could begin to go to quench my thirst, to medicate my pain, to alter my mood, to break through my isolation, And the truth is, that's a place that's going to make all of those things get worse, not better. And if any of this raises flags for you, start asking yourself some questions and get some help. That's okay. It's okay. Third thing Patrick Carnes talks about as it relates to people who are out of control and their core beliefs is this. They have a core belief that they can't trust anyone else to meet their needs. The core belief is this. I am on my own. Featuring an 11-year-old boy. This was in my mind as I was listening to a tape, again, of a therapist that I have great respect for in this arena. Asking the little boy, how is it, young man, that you plan on surviving your abandonment issues? Your father is an alcoholic. So is your mother. You're pretty much on your own. How are you going to handle that pain? His response was this And this isn't a direct quote I'm sure from this little boy Indeed a compilation of people Who say this I'm going to be tough I'm going to be strong This pain will not get to me I've already hit one kid this week And I'll beat up the whole class If I have to Now the whole time this little boy is saying This tears are pouring down 11-year-old cheeks. The way I'm going to meet my needs is to deny my needs. The way I'm going to meet my needs is to not need friends. The way I'm going to meet my needs is to be hard as a rock, and no one will hurt me anymore. I will hurt you before you hurt me. Unintervened on, with a caring counselor, with parents that maybe learn how to be parents, deal with their issues, then can begin maybe to minister to their kids, unintervened on anywhere, with the amazing grace of God that can heal the heart of 11-year-old boys. Let's meet this guy unintervened on at age 40. What do you think it might take at age 40 to break through the wall he has built around his heart to make sure he doesn't feel any pain, to once again feel the pain that are being manifested in the tears of this 11-year-old boy? What on earth would it take? Before you answer that question, add to the mix of the energy he's got to create this wall of protection, something like alcohol. Just throw alcohol in there. Or throw in drugs. Or throw in something like work. And my ability to crank out my stuff at work, I'll fire you before you fire me. I'll quit before you fire me. And I will build, even through my excellence and through my advancement at work, that'll just be part of the wall I build. And my success will medicate me as well. Add to that mix sex. And if for this person what has been added is sex, to alter the mood, medicate the pain, break through the isolation, protect this wall of protection I'm building. That would then lead to the fourth core belief that Patrick Carnes outlines in his book. The fourth core belief of people who are out of control sexually is this. Sex is my most important need. And if you have as a core belief that sex is your most important need, you will be somewhere along the line out of control sexually. Even if all it is is manifested with your wife or your husband and out of control, I've got to have this manifestation. If you believe that, it's going to be out of control. It will be a taking thing, not a giving thing. If I believe that sex is my most important need, I will, you will do anything to get it, Pay any price to keep it. It will be far more than a biological urge. It will be for you life. I've got some energy around this. Part of the reason I have energy around this is because I think people are taught this. I think little boys are taught, If not explicitly, implicitly, guys, your number one need is sex. In Christian circles, that is taught. Man and a wife in counseling session. Well, what you need to understand about each other, wife, you need to understand this about your husband, that his number one need in life is sex. What does that say to the wife? That means, wife, your job is to have enough sex with him that he doesn't commit adultery. That he doesn't wander. That he's fully satisfied as a man. And by the way, men, you need to understand that your wife's number one need is something else. Probably not sex. It's something else. What is that message to me? The message now to me is that I'm going to be the source of my wife's life. It's my job to feed her idolatry. It's my job to feed his idolatry. sounds like I've got some energy around this, don't I? I do have some energy around it for a number of reasons. One, I think that belief that sex is our number one need damages people. I think it does serious damage to people, to men and to women. I think it's a lie. There's another reason I have energy about this. I believed that lie for a long time when I entered into my marriage with my wife I never articulated it like this but I had a core belief that sex was my biggest need I didn't have the pornography I didn't have the other things but I had that core belief and you know what that did to my wife for a couple of years in our marriage you know what it did to her it made her without her being able to put words on it either feel used. You know why she felt used? Because she was. When the power of that, when that lie to me was disclosed and the power of that lie in me was broken, it changed powerfully how it was that my wife and I began to interact. Because I discovered that my fundamental need was not sex any more than my wife's was. In fact, I discovered that my core need was the same as my wife's. I needed as much as she needed to be loved and to love, to open up and to enter in. That was my core need. And I had some garbage in the way that kept me from moving into the glory of that. Some lies in the way. And now, our sex life has changed. Our sex life now is absolutely none of your business. I scared you, didn't I? Didn't I scare you? I love doing that. Oh, you were so scared. I just don't. I feel like my son right now. okay just lighten this up it was time to lighten it up so sex bad hope you don't hear me saying that i don't think you do it's a wonderful celebration of intimacy as as as the physical expression among two people a man and a woman a husband and a wife who have already opened up and entered in emotionally and spiritually. Sexuality is a wonderful gift and a genuine joy. But please know this, married or single, sex has no power, none, to meet your core needs. And if you use it to meet your core needs, the truth is that the exact opposite of meeting your core needs will happen. You will be more thirsty, you will be more hungry, you will be more lonely, you will feel more pain, and you will feel less special. That special piece is important. I think people do get involved with a woman or with a man. If I had her, I'd feel special. If I had him, I'd feel and if it's in an inappropriate context, you'll feel less special when you're done, not more. Proverbs 6 has an incredible imagery about that when it says, for on account of this, for on account of porneia, one is reduced to a piece of bread. That's not very special, is it? There's one last thing about this I want to say. That for every person, individual, here among us that is out of control in the arena of their sexuality, there is a circle of people around that man or woman who is being powerfully affected by their out-of-control behavior. They are experiencing you, if you are one of those people around someone who is out of control, you are experiencing consequences in your marriage or in your life, just in your friendship, that you may not even understand. And they're painful. That dynamic, important to deal with, is going to be dealt with next Sunday. But it's not going to be me. Jeff Van Vondren is going to come and deal among us, consistent with the pain of Porneus series, that issue that I just gave to you. I want you to know, I don't always tell you this, but next week, this Sunday, I'm going to be in Dallas. I'm going to be at Youth With a Missionary Base, ministering to missionaries at this time. When you see Jeff, I want you to think about me. I want you to pray for me. Deal? I will pray for you. I will be thinking about you. Think about me. I'm going to be gone. Jeff will be here. The following week is communion. I want to kind of let you know where we're going with this. I think you're aware of the fact that on communion we do things a little differently. We have the table. We have a healing service. We give ourselves some freedom to break with whatever series we're in. But on this communion we're going to stick with the series and we are going to begin the what about homosexuality piece of all of this. The way we're going to do that is by me introducing to you at that time a new friend of mine. named Joe Hallett. Joe Hallett is a young man who was in the gay lifestyle for several years. While he was involved in that, he contracted AIDS, not HIV positive. He has AIDS. He has had it for, I believe, eight years, which makes him a medical miracle. Joe is going to be with us and share with us to begin our series on that, a message of hope. and healing. I encourage you to be here. Let me close with a word of hope as it relates to the way out. I said some of this last week. Number one, the way out is to recognize and realize if you're out of control, that you're out of control. Quit denying it. Recognize it. The second thing is this, to break the silence and reveal the secret. Psalm 32, When I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away. When I confessed my sin, forgiveness came and there was freedom. The third thing you need to know, you need to know that Romans 8 is true. That there is now therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ. There is no condemnation for you when you begin to break the secrets. No condemnation for you in your struggle. You also need to know later on in Romans 8, is also true when Paul says, Nothing can separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Nothing can. Not even your struggle. Not even saying it out loud. You also need to know that Matthew 5 is true. From the words of Jesus at the beginning of his ministry, the truth is, blessed are the broken. Blessed are those who recognize they can't. To use the terminology that is contemporary, blessed are those who know they're powerless to deal with this thing by themselves. Jesus said, theirs is the kingdom. The kingdom is for you. It's also true when Jesus said, blessed are those who mourn, that those are the blessed ones. The blessed are those who get out here, what's in here. You're the ones who will get the comfort. Know this as well, and this is something I didn't say last week, that if you're out of control in this arena, you can't get well alone. You can't get well alone. You're probably not going to get well by hearing even this word and resolving not to anymore. You know, part of what traps us in these kinds of out-of-control behaviors is the isolation. And in the isolation is the trap that needs to be broken through. Everything I've read, everything I've personally experienced, everything I've seen work for healing for anybody else, came in the context of some form of community. Some relationship of accountability with someone who knows you. Some kind of support where comfort is given as you go through your struggle. Some kind of help. And if among us any flags have been raised, any revelations have been made, get some help. Get some help. We have at our disposal, I think, some people who are real good entry-level people, people who when you disclose your heart will give you comfort. We also have, I think, here at our church, a real good extensive network of where we can send you to get the kind of help for issues like this that you need. In the bulletin next week, because there's a lot of shame around this, I don't, make it easy for you. In the bulletin next week, we're going to have a list of places you can even call if you need help in an arena like this that we trust. But know this as well. after all the help is given and all the talk is done as necessary as all of that is the bottom line is this he is Jehovah Rapha the God who heals I'm going to close with a poem written by a young woman in our church a young mother as I read this and even reflect on all the other poems I've gotten these weeks and letters I've gotten from many of you one of the things that dawns on me is that we have a rich group of people among us. And this might even sound a little corny to say, but I am really proud of our people. I am really proud of how people here at Open Door are willing to tell the truth, are willing to take off the lid on their own stuff and lean into their pain and as they're doing it, hang on to Jesus the whole time. That's a good thing. That's a kingdom thing. would you hear this woman's heart make me whole I'm on a search for words unsaid broken promises need to mend ways of coping have hurt my soul I need you Lord to make me whole I've been pressing on with all my might but my strength is not enough to win this fight I'm feeling small and full of shame worthless, helpless I'm to blame tired of hiding, afraid to come out stung and burned by winds of doubt I need to know you're there for me that my waywardness is not all you see that though I've caused disappointment and pain, your love for me will never wane. I need to know that. And to her I say, there is now therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ and nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. Amen. Let's stand. I'm going to ask the altar ministry to come. People who need prayer, you come. Maybe for issues totally unrelated to this, you come. Let's close. Jesus, by the power of your spirit, I pray that you would move among us beyond this word, that was given to reach powerfully into our hearts, into our relationships, into our families, and bring, in Jesus' name, by the power of your spirit, healing. Break the power of lies that have long held us in bondage and bring us your healing and grace and life. Set your people free. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
