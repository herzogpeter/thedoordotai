Continuing studying the book of Matthew brings us to Matthew 18, verse 11. If you've been with us these last several weeks, you're aware of the fact that we are in a section right now that goes from chapter 16 all the way up through chapter 20. And it is a section we are coming to know as the discipling of the disciples. The intensive ministry that Jesus has been having up to this time has been with the multitudes, with the Pharisees, large groups of people. But the cross right now of Christ is imminent. He is about to die. And so the focus of his ministry has changed to really hone in on his 12 disciples. And he is using this period of time from chapter 16 to 20 to prepare his disciples for their ministry when he leaves. The form of the preparation is taking the form of teaching, encouraging, and confrontation. Matthew 18 is very much a confrontation. The section we are going to be dealing with is verse 11 to 14. Let's get to peace and then begin to break it apart. Here's your preparation for ministry for the day, disciples. The Son of Man, you need to be reminded, has come to save that which was lost. What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and search for the one that is straying? And if it turns out that he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray. Thus it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that even one of these little ones should perish. Let's pray as we begin. Father, we are made mindful again of the fact that unless your Spirit move among us in supernatural ways, bringing your gifts, bringing your touch, that nothing of significance can happen here. we could maybe understand some new things we could be enlightened in certain ways but nothing of eternal value happens and so it is in Jesus name we ask that your spirit come and move among us empower your word bring life to the words and to the understandings change our hearts God I pray that as we identify these little lost ones these ones who wander away and we also identify the role and the function of the shepherd who comes after them. I pray that you would be our shepherd today, that you would be the shepherd for many here who may be wandering away and need to be brought back. I pray you do your work this morning. Amen. It's very important in order to really understand what Jesus is driving at in these four verses that we set the context once again. As I mentioned just a moment ago, chapter 18 is very much a confrontation. on the disciples. The confrontation was precipitated, as you know, by an incident that happened in verse 1. The incident was when the disciples came to Jesus, having already walked down a road with the other disciples, arguing about who was the greatest in the kingdom. Verse 1, they come and say, Jesus, we want you to settle it. Who then is the greatest in the kingdom? A couple of weeks ago, what we discovered was that that question revealed to us a couple of things, at least a couple of things, to us about the disciples. Number one, it indicated to us and revealed to us that even though the disciples were indeed followers of Jesus at this time in their lives, they were at the core still performers. They were still in a position where the way they lived their lives was by striving to get it themselves, by earning their way. And that's why the question comes, who's the greatest? What we want to know is how we're doing. Not only does that question reveal that they were still performers and kind of earning their little place, but they were keeping track of their performance. They had a personal grading system. As I mentioned before, they were walking down the road arguing among themselves who was the greatest. They all had an opinion about who was the greatest. This question, again, was not coming from bewilderment about what kingdom greatness was really all about. They all had an opinion. Some thought it was Peter, some thought John, some thought James, some thought Andrew. We brought it into our arena by thinking of movements, where God has moved. And some people think the greatest in the kingdom are the fundamentalists. Others think it's the charismatics. Others think it's the evangelicals. Others think it's the Lutheran or the Baptist, on and on. We really think we're all in the kingdom. We're all in it. We just want to know who's really doing it right, hoping that he affirms us. We're doing it right. We have the whole truth. We're moving in the things that really matter. All that really demonstrates is not a hunger for the kingdom. That simply demonstrates that we have a ranking. Our fundamental operation mode is performance, and we're not functioning in the power of the Spirit. We're not getting our life from that. We're getting our life from how we're doing, how we look. The confrontation on them was one they couldn't have expected. He took a little child, put him on his knee, and began in verse 2. It goes through verse 14. It has three basic elements. We've given you two over the last couple of weeks. We're going to get to third today. The first element of his confrontation on them was this. When I hear this attitude from you, I really am concerned about your entrance into the kingdom. In fact, unless you are like this child, become converted and become like this child, change and become like this child, you won't even enter in to the kingdom. You won't enter into, if you are redemptively in the kingdom, you won't enter into the deep levels of the kingdom, the power of the kingdom. It was especially shocking to these disciples because it never entered their minds that they weren't in. They were, as you remember, doing demons, exercising authority, preaching the kingdom. Everything they were doing was God's stuff. And the question would be, if we're not in, who possibly could be? The answer, as he put the child on his knee, was someone like this. We looked with the disciples at that little child and determined that the characteristic of that child that qualified him or her for the kingdom and for deep levels of kingdom power and authority and movement was not necessarily the kid's behavior. I'm not supposed to look at a little child and become like a child in behavior. Because while sometimes children are incredibly wonderful, delightful, obedient and compliant, many times they are none of those things at all. And so it was that we discerned and were able to understand that this word child, paideon, even defined for us who it was. who was a little toddler from maybe three years old up to seven, no older than seven. The characteristic in that child that Jesus was pointing out to the disciples and to us was this, dependence. Dependence is what qualifies people for the kingdom. My only hope is Jesus. Dependence is what empowers people for sanctification. I cannot live holy by trying hard. My only hope is you. Dependence is what empowers people to serve in the gifts of the Spirit and the power of God, realizing that the things I want to do for God, I cannot do. My only hope is you. That is the ingredient that gets you in and then keeps you moving deeper and deeper into the reality of kingdom life. That is not something you have right now, disciples. The disciples were categorically independent, self-sufficient, in control, big, strong, and adequate. That's why they wanted to know, how big am I right now? How adequate am I? Am I more adequate than him? Who's the greatest in the kingdom? They were doing what Jeremiah 3 and Isaiah 5 warned about when God came to the people of Israel through those prophets saying this, you have left the fountain of living water, dependence on me, and gone to dig your own wells. You're still doing God's stuff, but you're doing it on your own, by yourself, and you're trying to light your own fires. And I got a word for you. Those wells might look spiritual. They might look good, but they leak. That light might look real nice, but it is dim compared to the light of God. I'm worried about your entrance. That was the first concern. The second concern was what we dealt with last week. That was when Jesus said in verses 5 through 10, I'm not only concerned about your entrance, guys, I'm concerned about your influence on other people, your ministry. You see, if you continue on in this spirit of verse 1, dig in your own wells, and all of it's in the name of God, it looks real nice. But if you continue on in that spirit, not only are you going to defile yourselves, but you're going to defile other people around you. You see, you're going to draw them away from this childlike dependence on me for doing the God stuff, and you're going to begin to get them to do it the same way you do it, on your own, trying real hard, in the flesh. And they're going to start digging their own wells and lighting their own fires, just like you. You will pull them from childlike dependence and panting after God as their only hope for salvation, sanctification, and service. to self-righteous performance and wondering who is really the greatest. And I've got a word for you. If you do that, it would be better for you to have a millstone hung around your neck and thrown into the middle of the sea than to cause one of my little ones to stumble. And remember the stumble? Again, just to reiterate this, stick it back in your head. The stumble was not get them to do bad things necessarily. That would include a stumble. But the stumble was to move away from a dependent relationship on me for every aspect of your life. And if you get them to move over here to doing it on your own, that's to stumble, and it would be better if you got thrown into the middle of the ocean. Today he moves on from there and says basically this, not only am I concerned about your entrance and about your ministry, I'm concerned about your memory. I need to remind you of some things, disciples. I need to remind you of what it is that I am committed to, what it is that I came to do. I came to save those who are lost. I came to restore those who are stumbling. I'm like a shepherd who when the sheep goes away I go after that one the will of God in heaven is that none of those little ones who stumble perish and the reason I need to remind you of that is this number one, this whole context is to prepare them for ministry right? so one reason I need to remind you of that is this if you're going to be involved with me disciples you're going to be involved in this you're going to be involved in healing broken people bringing back stumbling people finding lost people but if you maintain the spirit you've got right now of independent self-sufficiency you're not only going to pass that on but you will not only you will not be able to minister to broken people you know why because you will be breaking people you will not be able to minister healing because you will be inflicting wounds you will not be able to find lost people Why? Because you're lost. I need to remind you of some things, guys. I need to remind you of, number one, with a priority of the Son, verse 11. I came to find the lost ones. I need to remind you of the parable of the shepherd, verse 12 and 13. And I need to remind you of the promise of the Father, or the heart of God, verse 14. Before I dig into that and give you all the little details of that, there's another little thread I want to weave in here that we need to catch. On one hand, what we need to hear is a confrontation by Jesus on the disciples. On the other hand, what we need to hear at the same time is a call to the disciples. It is one of gentleness. It is one of comfort. There is a strange blend of a hard baboom hitting them, as it were. And on the other hand, a careful coming to them and wooing them back to himself. You see, while Jesus is giving a teaching about my priority, my priority is to save the lost. My priority is like the shepherd to find the sheep. God's will is to that no one stay lost. That is the truth. That is the thing you need to know. Disciples, there's something you need to know even as I give you that truth that right now you are the lost ones. You are the ones who have wandered away from dependence. And right now, while I talk about wandering sheep, you are the wandering sheep, disciples. And right now, disciples, while I talk to you about shepherds, theoretically, that go after their sheep, and wouldn't it make sense that they do that? I am the shepherd who is coming to you. And as he's giving them the principle, he's doing it to them. Do you understand that? The reason that's important is because I really believe that's the heart of God this morning. Even as we're hearing the principle, even as we're hearing the teaching, I really believe that the Spirit of God, His design of this text, His desire is to be the shepherd this morning. Even through the words of confrontation, you hear the call of the shepherd as He moves among us, calling the lost ones back. Let's look at the three points. Take, first of all, the priority of the Son of Man when it comes to people who get lost. I have come to seek and to save those who are lost. In my Bible, that verse is in brackets. Now, it depends on what kind of Bible you have. Some of yours doesn't have that in brackets, and some of your Bibles do. Mine's in brackets. What that means is kind of troubling. I don't want to get into text criticism here and get you off wondering all about inerrancy and all this kind of stuff. But what it means is that this particular verse is not in some of the original manuscripts. It is in many of the manuscripts, but as archaeological digs happen and we get more and more information and we find earlier manuscripts where the gospel was translated, this little phrase here was not in some of the earlier ones. What that means is that somewhere along the line, a scribe reading this and knowing the flow of it, decided that this verse fit real well there. It kind of went with the flow. It was added by a scribe later on. Earlier in the week when I was looking at that, I thought, I don't know what I'm going to do with that. I don't know if I should just skip it because, you know, it's not the original. And then I read it, and after a while, I started agreeing with the scribe. It does fit. You need to know while this might kind of get you going and go to seminary now and figure this whole thing out and how does this work. Jesus really did say this. These are words that the writer heard him say. They are taken specifically from Luke chapter 19, verse 10, where Jesus said, The Son of Man has come to seek and to save those who are lost. What's significant is this, as we put this together. When Jesus said those words in Luke chapter 19, the context for his saying that was dealing with lost people who were redemptively lost. They were not in the fold. They were not in the family. The actual incident was the coming of Zacchaeus. I learned a little song when I was a little kid. Zacchaeus was a wee little man. A wee little man was he. He climbed up in a sycamore tree for the Lord he wanted to see. Remember that? No, you don't. You didn't go to Sunday school. little slimy guy nobody liked him tax collector stole money from people he climbed up in a tree saw jesus jesus saw him there was a transaction happened a heart was changed he repented of his sin and he went to dinner with jesus and his people were upset that that jesus this guy who said he was a godly man was having dinner with this slimy guy he explained it by saying this you don't understand. I came for people like this. I came to seek and to save those who are lost. And in that context of Luke 19, he was speaking of redemptively lost people. They are out in the world. They do not know God. In this context, the same words are being used to apply to redeemed people, saved people, children of God people who are lost. And it is not evangelism that is on his mind when he goes to find these lost little ones. It is renewal that he has on his mind. It is restoration that he has on his mind. It is revival that he has on his mind. And the thing you need to understand is he is in verse 11 saying, the priority of my ministry is to find my little ones who've gone astray. I'm going to find them. I'm coming after you. I will not let you go. two principles I've already said them you've probably already picked them up but I want to nail them down for you so you hear them so that some way you can't miss them the first principle out of this verse is this you need to know that Christians believers like you and like me sometimes we get lost sometimes we get hopelessly lost now for some of you that word in a strange way might be a little confusing how could a Christian get lost for some of you that word might be oddly comforting because you know what it feels like to get lost even though you're redeemed you know what it feels like to not know where you are all of a sudden and wonder what happened and you need to know that a normal thing from time to time is for even his little ones to get lost. And sometimes the lostness, not in terms of redemption, but in terms of our living, our experience of God's reality and power in our lives, sometimes our lostness seems even to be worse than the lostness of people we know who aren't even saved. Do you know anybody like that? Has that ever happened to you where you know you're saved, but in terms of your enjoyment of life, your fullness, your healthiness as a person, Your ability to genuinely feel joy, not just have a happy face on, but genuinely feel joy is not even what your neighbor has. You're not experiencing the power of God. It's possible for Christians to get lost. There's a couple things about this kind of lostness that we need to define. It really needs to be kind of, we need to put our finger on it. The lostness of a little one, the lostness of a little child, one who does belong to God, is a lostness that in the beginning stages of the lost procedure is undetected. What do you mean by that? What I mean is this. Stick with the metaphor of the little child, because Jesus is, this child picture is going through, all the way through chapter 14. You need to get this. When a little child is from age 3 to age 7, and they wander away, their wandering away is not willful disobedience. That's not the picture. If they were an adolescent and they left, that might fit a little bit better, but we're still dealing with a child. When a child wanders away from home and gets lost, one of the reasons they get lost is because they saw a little butterfly. Oh, look at that. Oh, and all of a sudden they see something else. A stone. Look at the stone. Oh, there's another one over there. And before they know it, it's over. Where am I? sometimes the lostness of the believer sometimes the lostness of the little child isn't him going I want to get out of here they were just playing remember last week I had the picture for you of being in my home with my children and I'm their father and there's a safe place there they go out and play but I keep my eye on them and it's okay and then some guy, some fiend if you will comes up in a car and it's that picture we all fear of somebody, don't talk to strangers that's what we tell our kids some guy pulls up in a car and he goes hey come on in here and he offers him a little lollipop and it's someone from the world or someone from some religious system comes and says hey i got i really like you come on and get in the car and they didn't get in the car saying ha i don't want to be my dad anymore i'm gonna go with you it wasn't like that at all they just quit thinking about that see they quit thinking about they quit thinking about home and the safety and they got into a very dangerous place and they got lost the thing about the lostness here for the believer for the little one, is that at the front end of the lostness, it was undetected. You didn't even know it was happening. Classic example is the disciples. When the disciples came to Jesus saying, who then is the greatest? They were absolutely shocked that they got confronted. You know why? They didn't realize that they had wandered off. They didn't realize that this was a demonstration and a manifestation that they were no longer living in dependence on God at all. In fact, they were feeling pretty good when they came to him. I think Jesus is even going to like this question, because we don't care about money and businesses and all that earthy stuff. We care about the kingdom stuff. They had no idea how lost they were at that time, how far from living broken and hungry and dependent on Jesus for their life they were living right there. They thought they were doing great. At the front end of our lostness, we don't even know it. Not only is it undetected, it is unintentional, and I've kind of already alluded to that already. it isn't that we tried to get away but one day we looked up and we looked at our life and you wonder how did i get here you ever experienced that you just look up one day and you go where did this attitude come from where did this what happened here something has gone awry i don't know where i am there was never a time in your life when you decided one day i know well, I'd like to shipwreck my life. Today I'm going to go out and ruin it. You didn't do that. You shipwrecked your life, okay? You made a bad choice, but the choice was not generated from a desire to get away. It was, you got enticed. You got pulled away. It was a stupid thing you did. It wasn't a rebellious thing you did. That's the picture of a child. There's another picture you need to get. Not only is it undetected at the beginning and unintentional at the beginning, and even as you keep on going further and further away, The other thing is that it's desperate. There's a desperate sense to lostness. What I mean by that is this. When you do finally look up, having chased a little butterfly, or whatever that was, and then you look up and you realize you're not at home anymore, and this isn't a safe place, this doesn't feel like a secure, I'm not near my dad anymore. By definition, what it means to be lost is that you don't know how to get back home. Think about that. See, if you knew how to get back home, you wouldn't be lost. get it so what you're doing is you're sitting out in the middle of nowhere wondering how did I get here this is terribly frightening and I'm absolutely helpless because I don't even know how to get home the best I can do is go hear me I hope he does because I'm lost beloved you need to know that sometimes redeemed people get that lost you need to know something else that comes out of this verse the other thing is this you need to hear this that the priority ministry of the spirit of God of the son of man is to be about the business of finding lost little ones like you and like you and like you and like me who unwittingly unintentionally get so lost that they cannot possibly put the pieces back together does that do you any good to know that I picture one of my kids getting lost again kids that age I have two that age from toddler up to seven that would be Chris and Caleb I mean it's real easy for me to picture them getting so wrapped up in playing that they're all of a sudden a mile and a half somewhere else and they look up and they don't know where they are and spiritually it's real easy to just make the connections but just keep it with the picture the little guy looks up and he just starts to cry where am I? where's my dad? where's my mom? you know what at that point that little guy has one hope and it's the only thing he's going through because I can't find my way you know what he's hoping? I hope my dad is looking for me I got a word for you right from the mouth of Jesus I came to look for you I am seeking to save those of my lost little ones who've wandered away. I am committed to reaching the lost redemptively, but even after they get redeemed, a goofy sheep, they wander away. I'm going to get them. I'm coming to get you. I'm coming to get you. What might I do to get found? You know, if my little guy, I was running yesterday, and I think about my sermons while I run, and I was just kind of going through concepts, and I run in a place that's real hilly, and I was thinking about one of my kids being lost, and I'd be out there looking for them, and I kind of run far away from the house, so it's not familiar to them. And I thought, you know, I could be looking for one of my guys, and they could be like 15 yards away from me, and I couldn't find them. See, if they were right down that little hill, just that little hill right there, and they were right at the bottom of it, and they were still chasing the butterfly going, and they didn't know they were lost yet, I would be going, where are you? And they wouldn't know, and they'd be sitting there. But if they were down there and they realized they were lost and they were crying and going, help, that's how I'd find them. If there's an illustration of our need to respond so he can find us is we have to ask for help someplace. By the way, to underscore this priority of the Spirit, to find the lost ones who belong to him, I'd remind you of Matthew 10 that we dealt with quite a long time ago. Matthew 10, verses 5 and 6, when he was dispatching his disciples for their first ministry. And what he said to them was this, Before you go out and minister to the Gentiles and the Samaritans, and before you preach the kingdom and do the kingdom among them, first of all, bring the kingdom, preach the kingdom, and do the kingdom to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Because my first priority is to bring back the wounded ones who already belong to me. My first priority is renewal, revival, restoration, healing in the body of Christ. And as my little ones come back, and as I find them, and as I heal them, they get raised up and then we'll go get the world. Little thing there, evangelism begins not by saying, let's evangelize. Evangelism happens when revival happens, when renewal happens, when the little ones get found and restored who already belong to him. That's his priority. The second thing is the parable of the shepherd. And I'm sorry, but the parable of the shepherd is just going to say the same thing I just said a different way. It's going to reiterate it. It's going to clarify it. It's going to restate it. What do you think, disciples? If any man has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray, gone astray, stop right there, what that means. Again, now we're not thinking of a child, we're thinking of a sheep doing the same thing. It means to wander off, to be distracted, or enticed. It is very important that we make a very clear distinction at this point and kind of draw some lines under things. Again, we are not dealing here in this parable that Jesus is giving with willful disobedience. It is not angry rebellion or stubborn defiance. The reason I want you to underline that and note that it's different is because we treat that differently. In our ministry with one another, we treat angry rebellion, stubborn defiance differently than a lamb who just kind of wandered off stupidly. The picture that I get of willful disobedience, angry rebellion, is the picture of the prodigal son. The prodigal son does not stir up images of somebody just wandering off. The picture of the prodigal son is, get out of here. I don't want to have anything to do with the father anymore. I hate this house. It's a real drag. I'm going to go get my own life, and I'm going to get it over there. That is willful, that is angry, that is stubborn. I'm going. To that one isn't, oh, please don't stay here. Hang on to him. Enable him. Pay all his debts. No. The response to that one is grief and pain and weeping on the part of the father. But in that kind of situation, the father says, you're going to have to go, and I'm going to have to let you go. I can't make you stay here. You're going to have to go. he doesn't respond okay fine get out of here I don't care about he grieves but he lets him go and in rebellion when that kind of thing happens the response at least the desire of the father and our healthy response to things like that isn't going after them oh please I hope they hit the wall and I hope they hit the wall in a way it doesn't kill them I hope they hit bottom so the brokenness comes so they come back home and all the father can do is pray and pray and pray and when he comes, the father runs to him. I make the distinction because we have to in the body. We have to make that distinction. 1 Corinthians 5, there's a distinction. 1 Corinthians 5, there was a guy who was living with his stepmother, his dad's second wife, in a sexual relationship. Paul said about this, you need to cut that leaven out. Again, that's a different picture. That isn't going after a stumbling lamb that isn't even dealing with rebellion. That's saying, you're here, you want to be here. You're living in such a way that's inappropriate and we're cutting you out of the fold. We're putting you out. Different response to a different issue. What we're dealing with here is someone who wandered. They got distracted. They got enticed. They chased a butterfly. Their desire wasn't to leave the Father but now their life is shipwrecked. It's what happened in Galatians chapter 5, verses 7 and 8. The Galatians, again, we talked about them last week. They were living in dependence on the Spirit. they're getting their life from the Spirit Judaizers came along and said the really way you get life is perform, look good, get circumcised and all of a sudden the whole focus of their Christian life was how they looked and they made sure they were, it wasn't anymore about just fixing their eyes on Christ and Paul said to them this, you were running well, you were running straight who hindered you from following the truth this persuasion that you're involved in now did not come from the one who called you, they listened to the persuasion not because they wanted to leave the Father, but they heard another voice. And they were following Jesus, and all of a sudden they heard this, and they just followed it. They didn't say, I want this, I want this. They didn't realize what they were doing. Paul in Galatians 3 doesn't call them angry, rebellious Galatians. He calls them foolish Galatians. You're like a sheep. Pay attention. Guard your heart. Don't listen to every voice. Hebrews chapter 12, verses 1 and 2 says, we need to run the race with endurance, this race that is set before us. And the way we do it is we fix our eyes on Jesus, who is the author and perfecter of our faith. To call Jesus the author of my faith means he is my Savior. He is my Savior. And I fix my eyes on him for my salvation. My only hope is Jesus. That's what it means to fix your eyes on him. But he is also the perfecter of my faith. Know what that means? He is my sanctifier. My only hope for salvation is fixing my eyes on Christ. Not trying to crank out sanctification myself. I fix my eyes on him. And every once in a while we look away. And then we stumble. Galatians 6 verse 1 says, If anyone is caught in a trespass, you who are spiritual, come to that one and restore them in a spirit of gentleness. Being caught in a trespass is the same kind of thing. It's not angry rebellion. It's someone who looked away. And now they stumbled and they fell. And it says, You who are spiritual, go and restore them in a spirit of gentleness. Just a little side note. the reason we need to deal gently with people who have stumbled. Again, we deal differently with angry rebellion or things that are leavening the body. But someone's wandered away. The reason we do it gently is because they have stumbled. The picture I have in my mind of someone running the race, looking away and falling down, is not a pretty one. Have you ever seen anybody stumble while they ran? They're running along and all of a sudden, boom, boom, boom, boom, and they fall flat on their face. I have never seen anybody fall and look good when they did. It is the most humiliating experience that can happen to you, especially to one, now it's spiritual again, who is redeemed, who loves God, who's following Him, running like crazy. All of a sudden they, like a sheep, look away. Now they're going a whole different direction. They fall flat on their face. And when they get up bruised and bleeding, you know what they're convinced of? I will never be able to run again. I will never be used again. And you who are spiritual, go to such a one, pick him up, hold him up, and build him up, and get him back in the race. There are some of you here right now who are just like that. You really do have a heart for God. There's a lot of junk between that heart for God and how you're living right now. But you're like a child. You're like a sheep who got distracted and drawn away and enticed. And it doesn't even matter what it was that you chased. you can fill in the blank but you are in a place where like that sheep you wandered away like that child you walked away, you didn't even realize you were doing it when you did and maybe right now you're at a place where you look up and you're saying this how in the world did I get to be where I am? how did I get out here? how long have I been out here? you find yourself asking questions like this when was it that my heart grew so hard? It didn't always used to be this hard. When was it that my eyes grew dry? I remember when I could sit in worship and I just sensed the presence of Jesus and I adored him and I loved to tell him that I loved him. When did that dry up? When did my view get so dim? When did my life get so empty? I look up and I look at my life and it's, yeah, I'm a Christian, but it's not even that bad. Like, I'm not evil. I'm not doing vile things necessarily maybe you are but it wouldn't even need that it would just be empty dust it's dust I'm doing all sorts of religious things even it's just dust you look up and you ask when did my marriage die it's dead when did that happen when did I lose my kids if that's you you need to hear something this morning you need to hear verse 11 the priority of the son of man the priority of the Son of Man is to seek and to save little ones just like you who've wandered away. You need to hear the parable of the shepherd. You need to hear it right now. You need to know that if for whatever reason you've wandered away and you chased that little thing for a long time and you didn't even know what you were doing and now you've looked up and you're lost, you need to know that your shepherd is looking for you and you're going, when's he going to do that? He's doing it right now. Even as you hear me say these words, he is moving among us right now looking for his lost ones. some of you need to make a noise some of you need to go I'm over here I need your help my life is so empty my joy is nothing but this I don't have any joy I don't have any fullness I need your life in me and yes I have it redemptively I know all that but I am not experiencing your life your grace, your power I'm just doing it all myself and I don't even know how to find my way back you need to hear the word of the shepherd when he says to you I want you back and I'm coming to get you make some noise so I can find you verse 13 and if it turns out that he finds it truly I say to you he rejoices over it more than the 99 which have not gone astray two things about that verse one of the things about that verse is scary did you pick it up? look at it and if it turns out that he finds it I didn't like that when I read that. I thought, if it turns out, that means that maybe he won't find it. I want to push that away and reject it, but you know what? I can't reject that as I just bounce that off of my experience of people, of my experience in the world and even in the church, because the fact is I know people, and so do you, who have lived their entire Christian life without any fullness of life, without any real joy of their redemption. They have lived their entire redeemed life lost. They have never learned to drink from the well that Jesus offers. They've dug their own wells. I don't have time to tell the whole story, but the person I think of there, you have people in your life like that where you scratch and you even wonder, I wonder if they're really redeemed. And after you went through that whole process, You thought, yeah, they're redeemed, but they just don't, they're lost. They're just lost. My grandmother, I remember at her funeral, she was a redeemed person. Dried up, bitter, harsh lady. I preached at her funeral. I talked about grace. What came to me, and I even shared it, and I didn't defame her in any way. I honored her in some really neat ways. But one of the things I said about Grandma, you know, Grandma had a hard time just receiving and living in the reality of God's love for her. Such a hard time. In fact, she died not knowing the touch of the Spirit. What comforted me was that she was redeemed. And even as I was speaking in the funeral, I got a picture of her. She gets it now. She gets it now. But she lived the course of her life dried up. Redeemed, but dried up. If I find them, that's a joy. But some of them stay out there and perish out there. They go into eternity without really knowing intimacy. Their whole Christian life is just a bunch of following little formulas like a computer. It's no relationship. But there's some good news here too, wonderful things. It says if he finds them, he rejoices. Even more than over the 99 that didn't stray, he rejoices. You know what that means? If you're a lost little one today, it means that when he finds you, he doesn't yell at you when he finds you. He doesn't scowl and he doesn't scold. He doesn't say, I told you so. Why do you always walk away? When are you going to learn to listen to me? There was one response when the shepherd finds the little one who walked away. The one response is this, absolute joy. Again, it helps me to picture me if I found my kid. And I saw them and they got lost and they're crying and they're scared and they're bleeding down there. I just, I run like a maniac. I would run through a tree to get to that kid. I'm coming. And that's all there is. It's just joy. You're home. You're home. Oh, I'm glad to have you back. You know what? I'm kind of convinced that one of the reasons when we wander off, that after we realize we're lost, that we don't start screaming for help. You know, that's what you need to do. You need to go, help me! One of the reasons we little ones, we little kids are on the other end of that hill and we don't go, help, Dad! Help, Jesus! It's because maybe in our relationship with our dad, when we got away and wandered off, when he found us, he beat us up. You stupid kid! So once we get lost, what we feel most of all, after we realize we have wandered off, isn't, I want to get my dad. It's shame and fear. I don't want him to know, and we almost hide. You hear about that, don't you? Kids who wander off, and they couldn't find a kid because he hid someplace, because he was afraid what dad was going to do when they found him. You need to know that your father in heaven doesn't respond like that. One response to the one who wandered away. Joy, joy. He'd run through a tree to get to you. Just tell me you need help. Make a noise so I can find you, kid. And I see him coming to some of these little lambs like you and like me. And some of them are pretty beat up. And some of you here might be real beat up. It's not just that you're lost. When you got lost, you ran into some people who beat you up real bad and you fell into some sin that has wounded you badly and you've got some scars and you're smelly and you're bleeding and he picks you up and you're hurting and he puts you on his shoulders. That's how they would do it too, by the way. They'd just wrap him around their neck and he brings you back over here to the rest of the sheep and he puts you down and he says you're home and then he starts the process of picking out the birds and giving you a bath and sanctifying you with his word and healing you with his grace and sometimes it takes a long time. I don't want to both smoke at you. It's all better now. You might have a broken leg and that's going to take some time and the healing power of God is going to come but you're going to be healed. Verse 14 is the heart of the Father. I'm sorry but it's the same thing that he says in verse 11 and it's the same thing he says in verse 12. It's just from three different people, the Son of Man, the Shepherd, and now the Father. It's not the will of your Father who is in heaven that any one of these little ones should perish. It doesn't mean to perish. I've already told you. I needed to find a word for you. For an unredeemed person to perish would be what? An unredeemed person to perish would mean they go into a Christless eternity, the judgment of God. For a redeemed person to perish, and that's a weird concept, but I believe, according to Scripture, that redeemed people can perish. That does not mean you go into a Christless eternity. What that means is this, that you finish the course of your life without ever experiencing the intimacy of dependence on God. You never experience the life of God in you. You have the life of God in you, but you never experience passion. You never experience life. You never experience joy, except the joy you put on, it's never from the inside, because you got your life from Jesus. You were digging your own wells. That kind of Christian is a perished Christian. If they finish their life that way, that's a Christian whose life was fundamentally useless. What do you mean useless? Automatically, I think you think of behaviors. Useless means I didn't do... The uselessness of this person isn't that they didn't do good things. The uselessness of this person is that they never lived feeling what it felt like to say, my only hope is Jesus, dependence for salvation. I want to be holy. I can't be holy. My only hope is Jesus. I want to serve God in power, so I'm going to go to seminary and get real smart. Go to seminary. But if that's your hope, you're not understanding the life of Christ in you. My only hope is Jesus for power, for effectiveness, for service. That's my only hope. And in that position of dependence, that's where life is. Life is there. Some people die. Go to heaven. Experience it there without ever experiencing it here, and that is a waste. God says, am not willing that any of my little ones live like that. I give them eternal life, but I want them to have life now, abundant, abundant life now, meaning dependence drawn from me. I don't know where you may be today. I think a crowd decides that it's foolish to think there aren't some lost ones. In fact, I feel pretty strong that there are some lost ones here. I felt real strong all week that this was going to be an important day for some people. It could be that some of you are among us and you're lost, but you're in the place of lostness like the child that you don't know it. You know, you've kind of, you're like the disciples. You're not stumbling into terrible things or anything like that, but your focus has changed. Your priority is a little goofy here. And you're chasing a butterfly. I don't even know what it is. It could be a bad thing. It could be an immoral thing and you're starting to move that way. It could be a ministry. Ah, good thing. But all of a sudden, it's not coming from here. It's just kind of you doing it. Do you dare stop and take a look at your life and say, God, I need to know where I am. I need to know where I am right now. I need your protection. I need your protection. Do you ever feel like that? That this propensity to get lost and to hear another voice, You almost need to kind of almost daily say, Jesus, if you don't protect me, I'm not smart enough to not go away. I need your staff to get around my neck once in a while. Go, Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave. Come here, come here, come here. There's only one kind of smart sheep. Sheep are not very smart. The smartest you're ever going to get is to know that you're not all that smart. And the best place I can be is going, looking at the Father all the time, just going, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. no, no, here this is as smart as I'm ever going to get and to say, God, I need you to I want to give you access what do you do if you're kind of wandering and you don't know it? what would I do, Dave, if I am wandering and I don't know it? how would I find out? here's where you get in with the psalmist David where he says, God, I need your staff I need your staff and what I mean by that is search my heart right now, while I'm sitting here in open door church this morning I want you to search my heart and see if there be any wicked way in me. See if I'm wandering off. I want you to tell me. I want you to give me a word of knowledge here. I want you to give me a word. Give me a picture. I want to see the things I'm beginning to get my life from that aren't you. And I haven't even, I'm not even noticing that I'm gone yet. I need to know. Do you dare do that? I'll just do that. So bring a staff. I'll stick it around your neck and I'll go back here. There are some among us who have gone past that stage to wandering off and not knowing it. that you've come to the point where you've been wandering for quite a while. You didn't know it. It wasn't intentional, but now you've looked up. And you may be what I described a while ago, where you're saying, how in the world did I get into this? Where did my heart get so hard? How did my marriage get ruined? What is going on here? And you feel lost, and you're absolutely sure there's no way back. Marriage is ruined. At least it feels like that. Your relationships are incredibly unhealthy. your ministry, and I don't mean a ministry like you were a pastor. You might have been, but I don't mean like that. You remember a time in your life where life kind of came through you and you had influence on people and it was a good thing and a healthy thing and death's just gone. And you're so far out there on a ledge that one of the lies you're hearing right now too is that you've gone too far. See, you've gone so far and you've been out there so long, you need to know the shepherd can't reach you out there. And that will keep you from asking for help. You need to hear something. If you've been away a long time, and now you're looking up and you have no idea how to get back, you need to know that the priority ministry of the Spirit in the body of Christ is to save the little ones who got lost, like you. The priority ministry of the shepherd is to go after the one who wandered away. The will of the Father is that not even one should not experience the grace and the healing and the power of God. Not even one. You know what you need to do, though? You need to make some noise. You need to ask for help. You need to say, Jesus, I am lost and I don't know how to get back. I'm doing all the religious behaviors. But I look up and I see emptiness. I see dryness. I see dullness. I don't see real joy. I don't see real power and peace. I'm just kind of cranking it out. and I need you to find me because I can't get my way back. You need to know that just like the disciples were hearing a lesson, they were getting more than a lesson. Jesus was at that time doing to them the lesson. You have heard a lesson, but I believe with all my heart that the Spirit of God is here this morning doing this for you. Hear His voice. Hear His voice. Dan's going to come and do two things. He's going to sing a song that we just want it to be our prayer. Just let it soak in. Let it be your prayer. Let the truth of it minister to your heart, especially if it's a lost one. Then we're going to have you stand, and we're going to sing a song together after he sings the first song. And that song is going to be an invitation for the lost little ones to come. and I just promise you that that if you ask for help that if you make a noise that he's going to meet you the shepherd is going to meet you if you come forward we just ask you to kind of come into this area the ministry team will meet with you and come and find you and pray with you you don't have to come forward we encourage that we'd like to get our hands on you sometimes what the spirit can do is even while you're sitting there just being alone just being quiet that the Spirit himself can come and minister his grace and his healing and his restoration to you. But just hear this one more time. The Son of Man has come to save his lost ones. That is not just redemptive. That is restoration. That is renewal. He wants to do it to you now. Spirit of God, in your name I release the power of your Spirit among us. I pray that you would be for us right now in some powerfully intimate ways, our shepherd. I can't conjure this up. You have to do it. Be our shepherd. Come alongside your lost ones. Let them hear your voice. Give them the courage to ask for help. We pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
