Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the ninth hour, the hour of prayer. And a man who had been lame from his mother's womb was being carried along. whom they used to set down every day at the gate of the temple, which is called Beautiful, in order to beg alms of those who were entering the temple. When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he began asking to receive alms. But Peter, along with John, fixed his gaze on him and said, Look at us. And he began to give them his attention, expecting to receive something from them. But Peter said, I do not possess silver and gold, But what I do have, I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, walk. And seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up, and immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened. With a leap he stood upright and began to walk, and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. And also from the book of John, chapter 1. And the word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory so we could see him. And finally, from the book of John, chapter 3, the wind blows where it wishes and while you hear the sound of it, you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. You cannot see it, but you see the evidence of it in the swaying of the trees. This is the word of the Lord. Amen. Where it wishes. which means you can't control the wind. You can't make it blow. The wind is the spirit. You can hear the sound of it, but you don't know where it comes from or where it's going. You can't see it, only the evidence of it, only the manifestations of it in the swaying of the trees as the wind begins to blow. You can't see the wind, but the wind is real. As most of you know, if you've been with us these weeks at Born of Our Work, in the book of Acts, particularly the last couple of weeks, Acts chapter 3, where Peter and John healed a lame beggar at the gate of the temple, which is the text story that Al just read. We began to examine what the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 12 kind of born of that Acts 3 experience, what Paul refers to in 1 Corinthians 12 as the gifts of the Spirit. but in particular because of what Peter and John did, the supernatural gifts of God's Spirit that we've been discussing, gifts like healing and faith, words of knowledge and prophecy, the effecting of miracles too, which are precisely the kind of miracles, the manifestations of the Spirit that Peter and John in Acts chapter 3 are moving in and experiencing at a pretty significant level when they fixed their gaze on this blind beggar, this guy that they walked by. Remember this? Every day they saw him. He was at the gate every day, but on this day, they saw him. The Spirit of God was moving. The wind of God was blowing in a different way, and this day they saw him fix their gaze on him and said to him something they didn't say every day. In Jesus' name, walk. And he did indeed with a leap, it says in verse 8. He stood up and began to walk, and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. He entered the temple with them. Remember that? Because a couple weeks ago, he made a big deal of the fact that he entered the temple with them because before he entered the temple, he'd been at the gate of the temple. A very significant shift here because this being now in the temple speaks literally and figuratively to the fact that prior to this healing, he was outside the temple. It's a very on-purpose thing in this text. He was outside the temple at the gate of the temple, which means he was excluded from the temple, cut off outside, but now by virtue of the wind of God that blew, that brought this physical healing, it also brought a different kind of healing because he was not only physically healed, he was spiritually brought near. He was included. He was inside, no longer cut off, no longer at the gate. He was in the temple. He was brought near, which sounds, as I said a couple of weeks ago, an awful lot like Ephesians chapter 2, verse 12, where the apostle Paul says this, that at one time we were all out there at the gate, separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth, strangers to the covenants of promise. Key word, separate, excluded, strangers, having no hope, just like that blind, that lame beggar at the gates of the temple and without God in the world, but now, in Christ, you, all of you who were formerly far off, cut off, excluded, you were at the gate, have been brought near by the blood of Christ, you have been healed, which obviously does, I think, speak to a different kind of healing than physical healing, and it's a kind of healing, I said a couple weeks ago, that we really need to keep in mind whenever we talk about healing or the supernatural manifestations of the Spirit that produce and attend those kinds of healing. And it's also the kind of healing that I want us to keep in mind and kind of dial into at the beginning of this talk, even as we prepare ourselves to come to this table. Some of you coming to the cross, many of you, I hope, will avail yourselves of the prayer team people and come for prayer. Because this healing in Acts chapter 3, this manifestation of the spirits that produce this healing is functioning at more than one level. It's important to know this for more than one purpose, because there's more than one way to be sick and need healing. You can be physically sick, lame, blind, deaf, even dead, but you can also be sin sick. It's actually a more serious thing, having eternal kind of ramifications. You can be spiritually sick, lame, blind, deaf, even spiritually dead. The guy in Acts 3 was both physically lame and spiritually excluded. He was spiritually, he was heart sick, that's for sure, having no hope and without God in the world. And so we pray as we come to the table, as we gather as God's people, as we kneel at the cross. Holy Spirit, come into all the different ways. I can't even get my mind around all the different ways that all of us in this room right now need healing in a variety of ways. And while we know that the wind blows where it wills, we can't control the winds. And while we know that we can hear it, we can't see it, only the manifestations of it, as the trees begin to sway, we pray that the trees would begin to sway. Can't make them do that. But we can pray, Holy Spirit, come. Move the trees. Bring your gifts. Of healing and faith. Words of knowledge and prophecy. The effecting of miracles too. Yes, yes, even that, yes. Ring that. We can't make that happen, but we can want it. Because anything short of that, God, won't be much help for the kind of sicknesses that we have in this room. I'm not kidding. Leanne Payne in her book, Healing Presence, a book I highly recommend, particularly for the season of life we are in as a church around the gifts of the Spirit, makes this very important distinction, kind of clarification. In her dealing with the gifts of the Spirit, the manifestations of the same, when she refers to the gifts of the Spirit as manifestations, not just of the Spirit, but of the presence of the Spirit, which may not sound like much of a clarification. I mean, what's the difference? Well, just listen, because it's subtle, but it is a little different, I think a little more inclusive. Here's what she says, that the power to heal and be healed, The power to heal and be healed is available because God himself is in our midst. Not just his gifts, but God himself is in our midst. His presence and his power are mysteriously one. And we who live and move and have our being in God are called to preach and to teach and to minister in the awareness of, like wake up to the fact that his presence and power are connected. real. Oswald Chambers says it this way, that when Jesus in Acts 1 verse 8 says that you shall receive the power of the Holy Spirit, it isn't just the power as a gift from the Holy Spirit. The power is the Holy Spirit, not just something he imparts like a gift, though he does impart it. What you're experiencing is not just a gift, you're experiencing the Spirit, the presence of the Spirit. Therefore, Leanne Payne says, we become ministers of God's healing, love, and power as we learn to invoke and invite. You can't make the wind blow, but you can invoke it. You can invite it. As we learn to invoke and invite the presence of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, she calls it practicing the presence. And by that practicing of the presence, we, we, ordinary people, just like you and me, learn to become vessels through which he ministers his life and power in our midst. Now, this practicing the presence thing sounds maybe a little weird and maybe a little far away for you, but actually it happens all the time. It really does. And indeed, many of you do it, and you don't even know you do it. You maybe wouldn't call it, I'm practicing the presence right now. Indeed, some of you are doing it right now. as you're dialing into, as you're becoming aware of, I don't know, God. Even in this room, you weren't aware of God. I mean, it's not that you didn't love God. It's just you didn't come in here going, God. You weren't aware of it when you came in, but you are now, more than you were every week. On Tuesday, if I'm preaching, on Tuesday I go into my office and start to study. And I don't know what you would imagine goes on there, but if you were to see a video of it, it's pretty ordinary stuff, and you would be bored very quickly. I pull out some books, and I start to think, and I go to the text, and I'm really glad because, okay, what do I do? I don't know, verse 3. Let's look at that. Ideas begin to come. Thoughts begin to flow. Maybe some good idea here, maybe some interesting insights there, but then there comes this awareness. It happens, I don't know, almost every week, comes this awareness, and it actually comes sometimes with some anxiety that as I'm writing all these things, oh, this is a good idea, this will be a good joke, whatever, I become very aware that without the active presence of God, even in the preparation, before any of you see a thing or hear a thing, all this work and all these words might be good and interesting, maybe even helpful. Oh, that was good. But I won't be enough to help a lame man walk, It won't be enough to help a blind person see or a deaf person hear or a dead person rise, and there's more than one way to be dead. Nobody in here is dead physically. You're all alive. Some of you are spiritually dead. Blind, lame, deaf. And I got a talk that's going to fix that. No, I don't. No, I don't. Ironically, I said anxiety comes with this for me often. Actually, when I realize that only the Spirit of God can give you what you need, it actually relieves the pressure. It ain't up to me. So we pray, Holy Spirit, come. Touch and move and breathe on this. Be in the preparation. Be in the presentation. Be more than a good talk. Because nobody here needs that. Every week we pray for our worship team as they come. Pray for the prayer teams, the people who are going to receive you for prayer. On a weekend like this, we pray over our communion stewards who come to church the same way you do, with the stuff of life on you. You walked in this door with stuff on you. Some of you had fear on you and lust on you and anger on you. Some of you had depression on you. You walked in with it. You don't know this, but we've been praying to get off of you all morning. But some of our worship team and prayer team and pastors walk into this kind of thing the way you do, feeling like I have nothing to give, I have nothing to say, I have nothing to offer, nothing. And so we pray, whoa, better be a God. Holy Spirit, come and give us what we do not have to accomplish what we cannot do. Every week here at Open Door, there are people who move through these seats. They just literally will walk through these seats before you ever get here, praying, invoking the name of God, inviting the presence of God. Why? Because they're weird. Trust me on that. Now, here's why. Here's why they do that, why we do that, believe in that, because the power to heal and be healed, says Leanne Payne, is available because God himself is in our midst. His presence and His power are mysteriously one, and we who live and move and have our being in God are called to preach and teach and minister in the awareness of that presence and power, and so we pray, Holy Spirit, come. Do what we can't do, accomplish what we can't accomplish. Do you know that our worship time that we enter into every weekend is not a song time. We sing songs. What it is, among other things, is a practice the presence of God time. It's a bring yourself present. It creates an environment. It creates kind of a discipline that we can enter into where no matter what it is you came in with, you can bring yourself in this season, in this moment, present to the presence of God. And while some among us, I know this is true and it's really okay. Some of us come into this room when we begin worship, and you observe it the whole time. You're just kind of holding yourself distant from it. That's just fine. Everybody's at a different place. Sometimes you're critiquing it. You kind of like this song. You don't like that. So she's got a great voice, or he doesn't. It's kind of off there. Others among us, during that same thing, it's amazing how I think that people's experience of church can be so radically different, because others are using the time to become present to the presence, to the God who is here. But here's the really good news in this. At least I think it's good news because I think we can do this. I think anybody can do this, become present to presence. But here's the key, and it is the key. You're going to have to do it. that is come present to the presence, come to the table, to the cross, you're going to have to do it just the way you are. Which is actually not as easy as it sounds. It's easier said than done because some of you had a terrible week. You had a terrible week. Full of your own failure, maybe your own sin. I had a friend of mine sits right over here a couple weeks ago, lost his job. I was looking at him across. He lost his job yesterday. You lost your job yesterday. You lost your wife yesterday. Somebody had a fight on the way to church. I love that. It's so great. So you're feeling mad at your spouse or your kids and shame to yourself. So when you're like that, how do you come present to God? See, I think all that junk is perfect. Come that way. Make yourself present to God right now that way. Don't get all different with God. Don't get all holy first. You don't have time. Thank you for laughing. That's true. You don't have time to get holy. If you've got to get holy, you can't come to the table. You can't come to the cross. You don't have time. Others of you are full. You're full of life and joy, and you're just so grateful. That's perfect. Come that way. well get all somber and serious forget that well come all serious and somber be in his presence as grateful and joyful as you are dancing and leaping and praising God some of you are grieving you're sick and afraid confused feeling hopeless perfect it's not perfect but come that way the table is perfect for you as we gather together and invoke the name of God invite the presence of God expecting the power of God because his presence and his power are mysteriously one and so it is we pray because we can't make the wind blow invoking the name inviting the presence no need to yell or scream get big in Jesus name just ask and as best you can become present to the presence, to the God who is here. For some this morning there may be gifts of healing for you, but keep in mind as I say that there is more than one way to be sick and need healing. You can be physically sick, lame, blind, deaf, even dead, or you can be spiritually sick, lame, blind, deaf, even dead. You may be heart sick and need some healing of your heart. there will be some healing here for you, I think. For others, there might be gifts of repentance here. As God shines his light on something just while you're sitting here, minding your own business, wasn't looking for repentance, and God, by his Spirit, begins to blow. The wind begins to blow, and all of a sudden, the light is shining on something you've been hiding. You know what it is right now. Something you've been denying or minimizing. It's time to be healed. It's time to bring it out into the light where the God who is here can forgive it and cleanse it and restore it and heal it and heal you. Indeed, one of my favorite examples of manifestation of God's presence and power is found in Acts 16, 14, where it says this, Acts 16, 14, a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple fabric, which is, I could go into that. I mean, she was a professional woman, and she just kind of came to church one day, like some of you just kind of wandered in here, came with a friend, maybe, came to church one day when the Lord, it says in verse 14, opened her heart to respond to the things spoken of by Paul. And I am quite sure that the things spoken of by Paul that day were good things, well-spoken things, deeply thought things by Paul, but Paul did not open her heart. God did. And that's power. That's the kind of power that comes with his presence, and you can't make the wind blow. It's why we pray, come. It's why we invoke the name, invite the presence as we come now to the table to receive the sacraments of Christ's life and his death and his resurrection. Because in that symbol, there is real presence. There is healing presence. As some of you, in a few moments, kneel at this cross or come forward for prayer from some very ordinary people, there is real presence. There is healing presence. Let me leave you with a picture, and then we'll go to the table. The picture is this. I can't make you see this. I ask the Spirit of God to help you see that. The picture is of God in this room right now, and the picture I see in my mind is of God the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit doing what I've referred to in the past as the dance of the Trinity. The Trinity, the triune God in this room right now dancing, and they're kind of doing what they always do, and in this dance, the first thing I hear is this, the Father, the Father, God the Father in this dance looking at God the Son and God the Holy Spirit, but also dancing over us with joy and great delight. God the Father says, hey, hey, hey, you know what I'm gonna do? I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna do, here's what I will do. Out of this dance, out of my great joy and delight for my people in this room, I am going to give. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give. For God so loved the world that he gave. His only begotten Son in this dance, all of a sudden God the Son, hearing God the Father, saying I will give. God, the Son says, if you will give, then I will go. And he emptied himself, becoming obedient unto death, even death in the cross and the Holy Spirit in this dance, this dance of the triune God, with great joy and delight, says to the Father and to the Son, Father, if you will give and if you will go, then I will pour. Indeed, I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh. And their sons and their daughters prophesy. Young men will dream dreams. Old men will see visions in everyone. Acts 2.21. Who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved. There are so many ways we need to be saved. So it is as we come to the table and kneel at the cross and receive prayer from some wonderfully ordinary people who will be standing up here. I'm not going to yell and scream. I'm not going to get big. I'm just going to ask Holy Spirit come we invoke the name we invite the presence believing that His presence and His power are mysteriously one Thank you.
