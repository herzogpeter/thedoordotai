I'd like you to open your Bibles with me to the first epistle of John, the second chapter where you pick our study up this morning in the 18th verse. It introduces to us a large section of thought proceeding from verse 18 through actually parts of chapter 3. We're not going to cover all of that, but probably the rest of chapter 2. We're just going to begin by reading. Begin with me. You'll see the words on the screen if you don't have your Bibles. We read these words, children. It is the last hour. And just as you have heard that Antichrist is coming, even now many Antichrists have arisen. From this we know that it is the last hour. They went out from us, but they were not really of us. For if they had been of us, they would have remained with us, but they went out in order that it might be shown that they are not all of us. But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know. I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know the truth and because no lie is of the truth. Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the Antichrist. Any question about who the Antichrist is in the previous verse, it's revealed right here. It's the one who denies the Father and the Son. And we're going to find out that there's a number of ways that that can happen. Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father. The one who confesses the Son has the Father also. As for you, this is what I want you to do in light of all this. Let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father. And this is the promise which he himself has made, eternal life. These things I have written to you concerning those who are trying to deceive you. And as for you, the anointing which you have received, some of your Bibles at this anointing place say Holy Spirit, and in some cases there are some scholars who believe that that's actually a better translation. the Holy Spirit which you received from him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you. But as the Holy Spirit teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it is taught you, you abide in him. Now little children abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink away from him in shame at his coming. If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who also who practices righteousness is born of him. very easy section of scripture to understand I'd like to pray as we begin this is my prayer father that by the power of your spirit you would assist me in making clear the centrality and the glory of your son that is what I pray in Jesus name amen i've entitled this section with all the questions that it raises maybe it didn't for you but it sure did for me when i started studying it so here's what i've entitled it remembering and remaining in what you know the title is drawn from verse 24 where john said this to his beloved children let this abide in you the word abide means to remain let this remain in you which you heard from the beginning if you if what you heard from the beginning abides in you or here's the title of my sermon, if you remember and abide in what you know, my paraphrase of the rest of the section is that you will be safe. Now the reason John is delivering this exhortation is because he has a great concern. His concern is this, that followers of Christ, those he has endearingly referred to throughout this epistle as his dearly beloved little children, are being intimidated and confused by a group of people that John not so endearingly refers 2, as deceivers in verse 26, liars in verse 22, deniers in verse 23, false prophets in chapter 4 verse 1, and antichrists in chapter 2 verse 18. And the scary thing about the antichrists, whoever they are, it says in verse 18 that there are many of them. Well, the fact that there are many of them simply adds to the confusion and the intimidation that they are allowed to kind of reap or sow among people, even among believers. They're coming from many different directions, these false teachers, deniers, and deceivers. They're saying different things, and all of them don't look evil. If they all looked evil, that would be easier, not so much to be okay with them, but at least I'd be able to spot them. Well, since there are many of them, how do I know? Well, John gives us some help and the original readers some help in that as well by saying this. These false prophets, alternative Christs, basically do two things in a variety of ways. Number one, they deceive. Verse 26, these things I've written to you because they are trying to deceive you. Number two, they deny that Jesus is the Christ. More than that, more subtly than that, they deny that Jesus is central and the Christ. We saw that in verse 22. Who is a liar? The one who denies Christ. Who is the antichrist? This is the Antichrist, the one who denies the centrality of the Son as being God. Now, sometimes this denial of Christ that these people John calls Antichrist, false teachers do, sometimes it is blatant. I think it was a week ago I was opening the Sunday paper, and they have this little entertainment section, and there's kind of this big section on that. And on the front page there was a picture of a guy named Marilyn Manson. Yeah, a guy named Marilyn Manson. If you're a kid, you probably know who that is. If you're a parent, you may know as well. But without going into the details of who Marilyn Manson is and what he does, just understand this. If you saw him, you'd feel like you were looking at the Antichrist or Antichrist. And the lyrics of his songs are Antichrist. I mean, they are anti-God and as revolting as I find what he does. I'm not real worried about a guy like that pulling off many authentic believers. I mean, that's pretty obvious. When something is, I hate God. I mean, okay, I'll stay away from that. Sometimes it's blatant. Sometimes it's obvious. The time it gets scary, at least for me, relative to true believers, is that sometimes it gets subtle, these antichrists, these alternative Christs. Sometimes it gets dressed up as the American dream. See, antichrist, anti does not just mean against Christ. Sometimes it can be rendered alternative to Christ. We dealt with the American dream idea as being an alternative to Christ a couple of weeks ago when we dealt for two weeks with the section just previous to this in verse 15 where John says, don't love the world system or that which drives the world system, which is the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life. And when we're buying into that world system, basically we are serving an alternative Christ. See, what I want you to get when I talk about antichrist here on the front end is that when John makes reference to Antichrist, he's not speaking of the Antichrist. And a lot of us kind of have conjured up images of end times Antichrists. He is speaking, and just kind of broaden out your understanding over here, he is speaking of anything that diminishes the authenticity and the centrality of Christ as being God in the flesh and Lord of all, including Lord of my life. Anything that pulls him away from being central to my life is anti-Christ. I'm not calling him the anti-Christ. It's anti-Christ. It's an alternative to the authentic life of God at work in me and you. And sometimes that anti-Christ, alternative Christ spirit can show up even in church. Well, that's what was happening to the people to whom John was writing. We met them a couple weeks ago, both the believers and the deceivers, As we acquainted ourselves with the story that 1 John is, I'd like to get reacquainted this morning so this text will make some sense to us. You may recall that this epistle was written not to one particular church, like Romans was written to the Romans, or Ephesians was written to the Ephesians who lived in Ephesus. This epistle was written to several groups of believers, scattered throughout all of Asia Minor, meeting in various house churches. Many of them had begun their journey of faith with Christ under the influence and ministry of the Apostle John himself. Thus the consistent terms of endearment that John uses in speaking to them when he calls them things like dearly beloved little children. Well, many of them were in fact his dearly beloved children in the faith because they came to Christ under his ministry. You may also recall that I referred to them a couple weeks ago as a simple people with a simple but authentic faith. You see, they just love Jesus. remember that that was all they knew and they had known that love for jesus from the beginning confidence in jesus as lord and savior redeemer and friend master and teacher was all that they knew and that was all they needed to know obedience to his precepts abiding in his truth desiring to walk even in a manner as as he walked that was just all they knew and that was all they needed to know remember the picture of who it is that John is speaking to in all the best most endearing ways they were like children but one of the things I haven't told you yet about this epistle is this when John uses the term children we always see it rendered in the English as being children but there are two Greek words for that word child or children and John uses both of them all through this epistle one word for child or children is the Greek word technia the other is paideia, technia, simply means offspring with no reference to age. For example, I am 47 years old and that means I'm not a child anymore, but I am still my parent's child. And I will be my parent's child when I'm 80, if I'm ever 80. I will still be at that age my parent's child. I will be their technia. Chapter 3 verses 1 and 2, John uses that same word technia. See how great a love the Father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the technia, the children, the offspring of God. Beloved, we are the technia, the children, the offspring of God. That is what we are. So when he's using that word, children, he's often using that. Other times, however, in the same epistle, he uses the Greek word paideia. Now that is a Greek word that speaks to a child with reference to age. And generally, most scholars believe that paideia would be speaking of a child somewhere between five, six, seven years old, four to seven years old, somewhere in there. We get the word pedagogy from the Greek word paideia, pedagogy, which means to instruct someone who doesn't know. The picture is of a small child who needs instruction, who needs some help. Need to understand, just a little piece here, putting together the puzzle, when in verse 18 John calls them children, he is not calling them technia. He is not just calling them the offspring of God, which they are, he is talking in a very specific way. He is calling them paideia. He is not referring to them in this section as the young men and young women of verse 14, just a few verses previous, who are strong and overcome because the word of God abides in them. They are not rooted deeply in those things. They are far more like the children or the paideia that Paul speaks of in Ephesians 4 verse 14 who are susceptible to being tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine. Now, being tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine because you're a paideia, or a little child, are you being tossed to and fro because you're bad? No. Because you're rebellious? No. Disobedient? No. Why are you tossed to and fro? Because you're a child. Little children, paideia, precious, simple believers, but vulnerable believers, all of which introduces us to something we need to be aware of. It's very important in this particular section to understand who he's talking to. And what we need to be aware of is this, that while simple childlike faith is precious and endearing, it is also marked by danger. And the danger is this, that while simple childlike faith that just believes makes you precious and endearing, it also makes you vulnerable. Because the same openness of spirit that allows you to respond so wonderfully to truth, if that openness of spirit responsive to truth is not seasoned, is not rooted, is not deepened in the reality of who Christ is, in the depth of his word, that same openness that made you open to truth can also make you open to error and deception. I think every parent's worst nightmare has to be when their children are paideia age, when they are, you know, from four to seven in there, is that they might innocently, because they're a child, just because their spirit is just open to everybody, just walk right into danger. Why would they walk into danger? Because they're bad? They're not bad? Because they're evil, rebellious? They don't have a rebellious bone in their body, unless they're talking to you, of course. But that's not why they're wandering away they're just open everything the very same characteristic that makes them open to you makes them open to things that are dangerous i mean the picture we have it's horrifying picture the big shiny car pulls up in front of our house opens the door the nice man's not a nice man has a candy bar hey little boy hey little girl get in the car with me and the little kid starts to go where are you going this kid this person's not your friend why do they go are they They're rebellious? No, they're a child. They're a child. See, the same spirit that makes them open to a parent's love also makes the paideia open to a stranger's deception. What do we do with children at that age? Well, we do at least two things. We try to do two things. We try to protect them. And number two, we try to teach them and warn them. Maybe as a parent. I think we all kind of have gone through this. If you have children, there's this age at which you, with some, maybe a great sense of regret, you finally realize, I've got to tell my kids some things that are going to break their little bubble of innocence. But here's what you need to know. Dear precious child, not everyone is safe. You can't get into everybody's car. Not everyone is telling you the truth. I love your open spirit to everything, but you've got to learn to close your spirit to some things. There are many deceivers. John says, particularly, this is his dad talk to the little kids who need to grow up. He's saying this to the Pidea. There are many deceivers, many false Christs, many liars, and you cannot afford to be naive about that anymore. Enter now the deceivers. We met the believers, the simple believers, the paideia, the little children. Now let's meet again the deceivers. While John refers to them simply as liars, deniers, false teachers, and antichrists, he doesn't seem very gentle with them. A couple of weeks ago when we met them first, we find out that they had real names, theological camps, schools of philosophy. We met the docetists. I'm not going to tell you all about them this time, but just to remind you, We met the Cyrenthians and the Docetists and the Cyrenthians eventually in the second century became known as the Gnostics. Some scholars, and this was actually a help to me because I didn't have to get lost in the Docetism business and the Cyrenthian and Gnostic stuff. Some people, scholars, referred to these false teachers collectively as the separatists. They were the secessionists because that is what they did. See, these false teachers were in the church, called themselves Christians, but they separated themselves from other believers. Now get this, they separated themselves primarily because of what they thought they knew. I want you to think about that. See, what people think they know is often the cause of great separation within the body of Christ, even among believers. It might begin with love for Christ. And the sad thing is, as I say this, I want you to just register the fact that you've probably seen this many, many times. It begins with love for Christ. But then you get enamored with some teaching about Christ that you know and others don't. And maybe it's not a teaching about Christ. Maybe it's even an experience with Christ that you've had and nobody else has had. And maybe it's a good experience, an authentic, legitimate experience that God really did. And maybe it's a good teaching and the insight you have really is a good insight. But what really feels good about it to you isn't just that you know it or you felt it. It's that I got it and they don't. This just kind of feels kind of, you know what it's appealing to? Believe it or not, the pride of the, the boastful pride of life. All in the name of God. Before you know it, you're not saying these words, but you're living. Maybe you are saying these words, but you're living in this way. I know and you don't. And it's not just about Jesus anymore. It's about some little nuance of theology, some little piece of Jesus truth that you've kind of latched on to. And I know something that you don't know, so you're out. You don't have the insight or the perspective on this particular section of Scripture that I have, so I just think you're off. Maybe you're not even orthodox. I think you're a heretic. And you're saying that to someone who doesn't have the same perspective of some certain thing of theology, but guess what? They bow their knee to Jesus. They love Jesus and so do you, but you've chosen this other thing to separate out over. Happens all the time. In a variety of ways. I don't have time to dress it all out. I'll just tell you one. Malcolm Smith tells a story that is kind of typical, sadly. He grew up in a church that was a thriving church as a young boy. There was a certain group in that church after several years that got very excited about their study in the book of Revelation, a book that we wonderfully enjoyed just some months ago, and got really enamored with and taken up with the study of eschatology. This group within this church began to develop and embrace very, very strongly the idea that there would be a seven-year tribulation and then a millennium after that, which is fine. That's within the realm of orthodoxy, that's for sure. But what they thought they knew about the end of the world, very subtly, but very quickly, became the most important thing to know. I mean, everybody in the church, not everybody, but the vast majority of the people in church just love Jesus. But now all of a sudden, the thing you really needed to be able to hang on to was this particular eschatology. Well, there was a problem in the chair. See, there was a few people who didn't have that view of what was going to happen at the end. It wasn't going to be seven years. Some people thought it was going to be three and a half. Oh. Over time, what happened was this. Those who held whatever view they held began to feel superior about the view they held. And they felt superior to the people who didn't know what they knew. and guess what that did to that church? It divided that church right down the middle. It separated them from people who love Jesus just like them, but they decided that this was more important than that. You open up another church right across the street. And guess what? Once you've bred that spirit, that spirit does not die. And it grows. And that church that started out another church, believing that we would get it right this time. Everybody's saying they love Jesus, but we would get it right this time. Guess what happened? In a couple years, they found another little group who had another little view of some other little thing, and they split off. And then that happened again. And then it happened again, and Malcolm Smith, at the time of the teaching that I heard from him, said that there were five churches. Let's say glory to God. It's church planting. That's not church planting. That's antichrist. Are you calling them the antichrist? No, I'm not calling them the antichrist. I'm saying that they got off Jesus as being central, and that is an alternative Christ. That is anti-Christ. And little paideia, you better know that happens and not yield to that. They were called the separatists. The particular separatists in John's day thought themselves superior because of what they knew. They viewed themselves as being enlightened and separated themselves from these simple believers. They were in their own minds the elite. They saw themselves as having ascended to a higher level of spiritual knowledge and insight. They claimed special revelations and anointings from God reserved only for a select few. They were, in a word, I gave you this two weeks ago, they were, in a word, the knowers. They were the knowers. Everybody else would say, oh, they don't know so much. Indeed, the word gnostic, remember this? In its original form simply means to know. And what these particular knowers knew, that these simple believers who just loved Jesus and kind of were stuck there, didn't know was this. What these great knowers knew was that obedience to Christ, holding precious precepts, loving the brethren from the heart, just wasn't necessary. It just wasn't very enlightened at all. In fact, the docetists ended up being what I would call the original liberal theologians in the process of their great enlightenment and deep insight into life and God came to believe that though Jesus was certainly good, he most certainly wasn't God. I mean, their minds were so developed and enlightened, they just came to the conclusion, how could a man be God? That's what an absurd thought. So the whole idea, being born out of the Docetists and the Syrenthians and the Gnostics that Jesus died for our sins. The whole idea that he rose from the dead, ascended to the Father, lives now in men and women by the indwelling of the Spirit was just ludicrous to them. And they began to rule that out. And their perspective toward simple believers who did believe those things was simply this. Oh, how quaint that you believe that. But no intelligent, enlightened person like us, no thinking person like us could ever believe that. now the impact of that theology especially since it started in the church and then they went out leaving the simple believers behind this this theology coming from people who seem to know particularly on the paideia the little ones was to confuse and intimidate them as these people who seemed to know began to leave claiming a whole different perspective on the gospel where jesus was no longer central. These simple believers were kind of left there thinking, well, maybe we are stupid. I don't like feeling stupid. Do you like feeling stupid? When somebody makes me feel stupid, you know what I try to do? I try to convince them I'm not stupid. There's a number of ways to do it. One way is to agree with them. Oh, yeah, you're right. I don't know what I'm talking about. Oh, yeah, you're right. Maybe we are missing the boat. Maybe we don't have the real deal. Maybe they have the real deal. and born out of this growing sense of inferiority. They're smart, I'm stupid. They have it, we don't. These simple believers were just this close to wandering away from fidelity to Christ, just this close to climbing into the big shiny car and taking the candy bar from the guy who says he cares about them and he's got what they need, but he doesn't. Now, with all of that kind of necessary background for understanding, Let's wade through the text again. Come back to verse 18. Children. What's he talking to? Paideia. Little ones. Simple, open-hearted believers. Let me tell you, says John, about these people who present themselves as superior to you. Let me tell you about these people who present themselves to you as the knowers. They went out from us, verse 19, because they were never really of us. Here's what he's saying. In other words, you simple believers who just love Jesus, you better know they went out from us, not because there was something wrong with you and they were superior, which is what you've begun to think. They went out from us because there is something wrong with them. Do we hear Father John, as it were, fighting for his children? Don't be thinking it's out there. You already have it. They're the ones who are defective right now. They claim to be enlightened, says John. Some even claiming special revelation, but I am here to tell you, verse 20, that you are the ones who have the anointing from the Holy One, and you are the ones who know. You think they know. No, you are the ones who know. Verse 21, I have not written to you, little ones, because you do not know the truth. In fact, in this section, I am not going to tell you anything you don't know already. In fact, You don't even need a teacher for what I'm about to tell you because you already know what I'm going to tell you. What you already know is this, that Jesus is the sweetest name you knew. And you have known that from day one. You have known that from the beginning. Don't you dare let these so-called knowers intimidate you. Don't you let them convince you that they know and you don't. that just because they use fancy words and have a PhD at the end of their name that they have the inside track, that they have something you lack. You are the ones who know, not them. Beloved, your safeguard, he is saying to them and he is saying to us, your safeguard against all of the so-called knowers, all of the separatists who know what you don't know, all of the deceivers, deniers, false teachers, manipulators is to do verse 24. What is verse 24? Let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. Here is your safeguard. My sermon title, remember and remain in what you have known from day one as a child of God. And if you remember and remain in the thing that you knew the day you came into faith, you will be protected from the deceivers. Here's the question. What did you know day one? I can tell you what you knew day one. You knew this, that Jesus was the sweetest name you knew. John said it this way 1 John 1 verse 1 started the Holy Pistol with these words what was from the beginning what we have heard what we have seen with our eyes what we have beheld and our hands have handled are all things concerning the word of life and this word of life was not some vague philosophy about life for the word I'm talking about became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth. You see, this life that was manifested, John says, it was made visible in Christ Jesus whom we have seen, bear witness to, and now proclaim to you. And that is what you knew from the beginning. You knew that from day one. And you don't need a teacher right now to tell you that. Because if you know Christ, that's what you know. And in all your knowing, you've gotten off of that. here's your protection from all the deceivers the deniers the separators the knowers who make you feel inferior who make you feel stupid because they know and you don't and so you start following after a thing after their little tangential teaching hoping you'll get their approval and maybe feel as smart as they are like they have it and you don't here's your protection let this abide in you let this be the thing you come back to every single morning of your day it's what you heard from the beginning what you hear from the beginning Jesus is the sweetest name I know what you hear from the beginning that Jesus is the radiance of his glory you knew that day one maybe you didn't say it that way but you knew that day one the exact representation of his nature upholding all things by the word of his power you knew that day one SM Lockridge says it this way, of Jesus. And these are the things you know. I'm just going to read what he wrote. I love this. And just the framing for this is these are the things you knew from day one. Here's what you knew day one. That Jesus is unparalleled and unprecedented. He is the centerpiece of civilization. He is a superlative of all excellence. He is the sum of human greatness and he is the source of divine grace. His name is the only one able to save and his blood is the only power able to cleanse. He is the key to all knowledge and he is the wellspring of wisdom. He's the doorway of deliverance. He's the pathway of peace. He's the roadway to righteousness. He's the highway to holiness. He's the gateway to glory. He's the all-sufficient King. And you know why you knew that day one. That's why you came into faith. He is the King of the Jews. He is the King of Israel. He's the King of righteousness and he's the King of the ages. He's the King of heaven. He's the King of glory. He's the King of kings and he's the Lord of lords. He is enduringly strong. He is entirely supreme. He is eternally steadfast. He is immortally faithful. He is imperially powerful. He is impartially merciful. I wish I could more accurately describe him to you, but he's indescribable. See, that's my problem. He's incomprehensible. He's invisible. He's irresistible. And guess what? You knew that day one, didn't you? That's all. You know what? If That's all you know. Yeah. Do you get the flow of the text? There's these little precious believers who are being made to feel stupid because they don't know something they're supposed to know. John is saying, you already know everything you need to know. Jesus is the sweetest name we know. That's all you need to know. And from there, you can grow and start. I'm going to finish this SM Lockwoods thing. I've got some more that we know. Here's what you already know about him. You know this, that the Pharisees couldnít stop him, but they found they couldnít, the Pharisees couldnít stand him, but the found they couldnít stop him. Pilate couldnít fault him, Herod couldnít kill him, death couldnít conquer him, and the grave couldnít hold him. Heís the Alpha, heís the Omega, heís the first and heís the last. Heís the God to the future, heís the God of the past. His name is Jesus, and you From the beginning, if you abide in what you knew from the beginning, that is your safeguard, beloved. From every deceiver, from every denier, accuser, manipulator, so-called knower. And you know what? And this is what he means by you don't need teacher. When he says that in verse 27, and you don't need teachers, he is not saying we don't need teachers. I mean, teaching is a gift of the Spirit. Teachers have been given to the church for the building up of the body. John is giving us a teaching right here. What he's saying is this. Relative to what you need most to know, you don't need some fancy teacher with a Ph.D. behind their name. You already have what you know. You already know what you need to know. What is it? Jesus is the sweetest name I know. You know enough. You know enough. And from there you will grow. I have confidence that you will grow. And if he really is the sweetest name you know, you will obey. And you'll be that simple believer who holds precious his precepts, who walks in his ways, who loves him from the heart, who turns from a paideia to a young man or a young woman who rooted in the word begins to run with courage and conquering. This anointing that we have. You know, when we think that's another thing, you have this anointing, That's this protection as well that he mentions. You don't need to worry. You have this anointing. Remember I said earlier that that's the Holy Spirit, the indwelling Spirit. When we think of anointings, at least when I think of anointings, I think of empowerments. And I think that's accurate. Generally, when you think of an anointing, if you hear, for instance, a sermon that you think is particularly powerful, you might say, boy, that was really anointed. I would say that as well. And we associate it with tasks that people do that require supernatural power, whatever it might be. And if we do it and we feel the power, we say, boy, I really felt anointed. Or if you see it, you say, boy, that was really anointed. Again, this special kind of power. But there's this kind of specialness to that. You know what I'm saying? Kind of it comes on you for this task, and then it might fade, and that kind of thing. He's not talking about that in this text. When he speaks about the anointing, he is speaking about the indwelling spirit, which is the anointing that all of us have all of the time. In fact, 2 Corinthians 1.21 says it this way. Now he who establishes us in Christ and anoints us with his Holy Spirit is God, who with that anointing seals us and gives us his spirit in our hearts as a pledge. You know, one way maybe to even describe this anointing and confirm in your own heart that you have it. Just a few minutes ago when I was reading that truth about Christ, the stuff you already know, and you clapped. The reason I think you clapped was because as I was reading those things, something began to rise in you. You know what that was? That was the Holy Spirit in you, rising toward the truth that what? That you already what? You already knew. I wasn't telling you one thing you didn't know. Now, I might have been putting some words together in a way you never said it before, but everything I said was stuff that in your spirit was going, I know that, that is the truth that I believe, and that is the truth I came in on. I'll tell you what that truth you came in on is the truth that's going to take you through and that's the truth that's going to take you home that's all you need to know there are many false teachers beloved many anti-Christ alternative to Christ there are many knowers I know, nobody else knows there are many deceivers there are many separators sometimes they are obvious and they'll be easy to avoid sometimes they are subtle They will even be in the church, drawing us away from Christ as being central, as being the only thing that matters. The safeguard is remembering what we've always known. Thursday night, I close with this. I went to a conference with Tom Johnson, a consultation, actually is what it was, at First Covenant Church, Twin Cities Pastors Consultation, at this event on Thursday night, and then all day Friday, were somewhere around 250 pastors. These 250 pastors were from 39 different denominations. Catholics there, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists, Charismatics, a few CMA people, Baptists, whatever. You pick it. They were there. They were there. It was a wonderful connection. And the reason we were there was simply this, to get together and wonder together how we might impact this city for Christ. Let me ask you a question. How does that happen? How do you get 250 pastors from 39 denominations to come together in the same room and worship together and just wonder, just wonder, how can we together, with all of our differences, how can we together affect this city for Christ? Well, let me tell you how that happens. That happens when we all abide or remain in what we've all known from the beginning. And I'm just going to say this about the 250 pastors that were in that room, what they all remember and what they all abided and what they came in on was this, simply this, Jesus is the sweetest name I know. So yeah, I differ with you about this point of theology. And I'm really thinking you're a little weird over here about that theology. But I don't care about any of that because Jesus is the sweetest name. And no, I know. And I will join you there. And people come together. Jesus is the sweetest name I know. That, beloved, that simple thing is the safeguard for the little children. That is the safeguard for simple believers like you and like me. Remember and remain in what you have heard from the beginning. And what we have heard from the beginning is what? You tell me. Jesus is the sweetest name I know. One of the things that affected me early when I started studying this text was this is a very confusing text. I told my wife, I told her, I said, I'm really having a hard time with this text today. She said, why? I said, read it. But you know what's odd for me as I've spent the whole week trying to dig out what this means? This is a very confusing text with a very simple message. Jesus is central. It's all you need to know. I'd ask Dave to come and lead us in a song to allow you to express the centrality of Christ in our life. And the song is one you know. It's all about you. It's all about you. Turn your eyes upon Jesus. It's all about you. Dave. Let's come into his presence. Just adore him and then maybe lean on his breast the way that John did at the last supper and give him this prayer of confession that I'm coming back to the heart of all things and it's all about you, Jesus. Praise the name of Jesus. Praise the name of Jesus. He's my rock. He's my fortress. He's my deliverer. Will I just praise the name of Jesus? Jesus Jesus Holy and anointed one Jesus I'm coming back to the heart of worship And it's all about you It's all about you, Jesus I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made But it's all about you It's all about you Jesus I'm coming back to the heart of living Heart of living And it's all about you It's all about you Jesus I'm sorry Lord for the thing that made it But it's all about you It's all about you Jesus the heart of all things coming back to the heart of all things and it's all about you it's all about Jesus I'm sorry though for the things I mean and it's all about you it's all about you Jesus There are many deceivers. And we could spend our whole life trying to figure out who they are and get our guard up and study, study, study who are the deceivers. Here's your protection. Remember and remain in what you knew from the beginning. That's all you need to know. You already know everything you need to know. Jesus is the sweetest name I know.
