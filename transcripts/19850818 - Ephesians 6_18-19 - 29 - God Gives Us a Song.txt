In our last study, we learned that the filling of the Spirit is living every moment as if I'm standing in the very presence of the Lord. We learned that to be filled with the Spirit is synonymous, remember, with Colossians 3.16. To let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly. It's just another way to say exactly the same thing. We also learned that this filling of the Spirit is not some sort of mysterious, mystical experience that just kind of hits you on the head, not when you're kind of expecting it, and it's not the kind of thing that we have to beg God to do. I don't go on some sort of quest to receive the filling of the Spirit, as if there is on God's part some sort of reluctance to give me all of Himself. And somehow that reluctance needs to be broken down. And so I go from one experience to another, and I go from one meeting to another, hoping against hope, that somehow an experience will just kind of come and zap me in the head and I will be forever filled. We learn that God's greatest desire for me as His child, His chief aim in the life of the believer, is to control me. His chief aim is to fill me so that I will be full with all the fullness of God, so that He can permeate my life, and so that I can look more and more and more like Christ. The problem is on my end of the side. If anything needs to be broken down at all, it needs to be something in me. We looked at the negative side. The problem is twofold on the negative side. The first thing is this, is God's greatest desire in me is to fill me, to permeate me, to bear me along by the wind of His Spirit. The problem with me on the negative side is that I grieve the Holy Spirit, remember, with my sin. And the sin in the life of the believer acts like a roadblock, as a frustration. I'm not even sure that I can relate as much as I used to with the idea of God going, Oh, when I sin. As much as that word grieve, meaning to roadblock, to frustrate God's desired work in my life. To quench the Spirit was the other negative dimension that we mentioned. And to quench the Spirit is just the way it sounds. It would be like dousing the fire with water. To douse the fire, to put the lid on it and keep the power and the energy and the life and the enthusiasm and the excitement shut out and die. And the way I quench the Spirit is to just live without faith, to have a lack of faith, to think small. One of the ways I quench the Spirit is when I get tired of caring. And I think a lot of us can relate to that, more than some of these things about lack of faith. Sometimes I just get tired of caring. Sometimes I just get tired of giving. and sometimes I just get tired of loving you and ministering and pouring it out and I get tired and I say no more and it quenches the Spirit and He can't work through me anymore. And we learned just last week that both of those problems, when they're working, when I am grieving the Spirit because of an attitude or an action or something like that, or when I'm quenching the Spirit because of a lack of faith or a lack of trust, both of those problems, by their very nature, change the function of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer. Do you remember that? His chief aim is to what? His greatest desire is to what? Is to fill me and to permeate me and work through me to you. And the same thing in you. His chief desire in you is to fill you so that you will be filled with all the fullness of God again and he will be working through you to build the body. And that's how the whole concept of the building of the body is there. But when the grieving of the Spirit is taking place and the quenching is taking place, He is no longer working through me. He is now working on me in a whole different ministry to the believer. And that is one of convicting the believer to disciplining the believer to chastising the believer. That is all review. We have seen in the text that it is broken down basically into three segments. The first segment is the contrast. Be not drunk with wine in which is dissipation. The contrast, verse 18a. And we discovered that the real thrust of this, and I just trust that this timeless truth that we discovered is something that you will be able to hang on to all your life. The real issue in that thing wasn't wine at all. I've heard preachers take that and just go on for three or four weeks talking about what our attitude toward wine is to be. Well, maybe we should preach a sermon on that sometime, but not from that text, because wine isn't even the issue there. Wine there is simply a good illustration to that Ephesian church of an external control and excess thereof. People looking for something outside of themselves to fill their lives up with joy and then just to overdose on it. And that is what is wrong. External control and excess thereof. We talked about the fact that if Paul wrote that letter to us here, he probably would have used a different illustration. Most of us have this problem of wine under control. He would have written to us, very possibly, be not drunk, dear people of the open door, with your career in which is excess. Something wrong with a career? Nothing wrong with a career unless you're looking to that to be the fulfiller of your life. Unless you're looking to fill your life with that, there's nothing wrong with it. The problem is excess and external control. Be not drunk. Somebody mentioned to me that they had a problem with television. The great seducer. Wouldn't that be a good one? Be not drunk with the TV. Don't let that be the thing that's filling up your life. And if you think I'm overstating that, all you need to do is watch the TV a little bit and understand some of the video and audio-visual things that are coming out now to absolutely dominate our thinking and our lives. You never have to go out of your living room. You never have to do anything. All the games you want to play, all the interaction, all the computers are right there. You never have to talk. It's great. I think you might even say that. Don't be drunk with that in which there's something wrong with it. Not necessarily. I think we understand the principle. Let's move on. The contrast. He contrasted that to an internal control, remember? And we stated it this way. We saw a contrast and then we saw a command. Be filled with the Holy Spirit. The first thing we caught, and we have got to continue to understand this, is that the filling of the Spirit in the life of the believer is not an option. It is not an option. We are not allowed the convenience and the luxury of allowing to kind of form in our church two or three little groups. We have the saved and the unsaved, but in the saved there's two little groups and it's really okay, no big deal. if you want to be committed, that's okay, and if you don't, that's okay too. We understand that in our church, there are believers who are walking in the flesh, and the flow of their lives seems to be a real inconsistency, and maybe it's you, and maybe it's me, maybe you're even feeling that. And we know that very often as Christians, we stumble and fall, and we have tremendous struggles sometimes. What we need to understand is that while that can happen, it is not normal. The problem for many of us, however, is that when we see that kind of mediocre Christianity being pervasive and everybody kind of stumbling along and everybody, well, we all do stumble along. I want to take that back. A pervasive lack of desire to grow. Let me say that. A pervasive lack of desire to grow. Really thinking that this is all there is. No real life. No real joy. And we look around and that's all we see. We kind of get to think that's normal. It isn't normal. Normal Christianity, as John R. Stott would say, is spirit-filled living. We learned that the filling of the spirit is not a celestial zap. I've already mentioned that just a little bit. It happens and bam, I am full forever. One shot and you're good for the whole day. Remember that deodorant thing? It's not that at all. We learned from the Greek very simply and very clearly that it says this, be being continually kept filled. It's a moment-by-moment experience. It's an hour-by-hour experience. It's a day-by-day experience. It's a week-by-week experience where I am walking through my life and asking the Lord Jesus to fill me, yielding myself to Him over and over and over again, continually yielding myself to Him. I make decisions all day long, and every decision I make, I bring it to the Lord, and on and on and on, a walking that way. It's a commitment for now, not the future. It's a commitment for now, not the future. Do you know that God is not interested at all in your future commitments. None whatsoever. He's interested in now. You know something else. In fact, you're not interested in future commitments either. You aren't. My wife comes up to me and says, Dave, do you love me? And I say, I'll tell you what, see me in a week and a half and I'll let you know. You know what? I get a frying pan right in the head when I say that. And the other thing is she's not interested in a week from now. She's not interested in a week and a half. Maybe the commitment in a week and a half will be real and right. But that doesn't matter. What's interested is in now. It's a commitment for now. Maybe the best way to look at the filling of the Spirit in terms of understanding it theologically with the greatest amount of accuracy is looking at the metaphor that Galatians 5 uses to talk about the filling of the Spirit. It says, walk in the Spirit. I like that. That's very good. That really connects with what we're learning here. Walk in the Spirit. It's what? It's moment by moment. It's what? It's a step at a time. I put one step forward. I put another step forward. It's not wham, I'm done. It's all my life. I walk in the Spirit. Galatians 5.16 makes a real neat promise. It says this, walk in the Spirit, moment by moment, yielding to His control, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. So it's a walk. And as I go to work, and as I answer the phone, and as I deal with the kids, and as I talk to a friend, And as I come to church, it's coming to Him and saying, Lord, I'm Yours. And the best way I know how, and I know that I may not feel real zippy today, but the best way I know how, I just give myself to You and I love You. And walking in the Spirit, walking in the Spirit. Let's say we're there. Okay? Let's say we're there. We're filled with the Spirit. We just sense in our lives, again, this is not something that means you're always going to be on top of things please you know we come and we hear sermons like that and we kind of feel I'm a little down today I must not be filled with spirit listen I don't believe that I think maybe that's the part in your life where you need to begin to exercise faith that if you to the best of your knowledge and ability to the light that God's given you are responding to Him and open to Him and you don't feel it you need to just say Lord I believe you that you're there and you're in control and if there's something wrong you reveal that to me these vague senses of guilt I think are from Satan not from the Lord when the Lord convicts you of something in terms of sin he'll be real specific you know what he'll say? he'll say John you need to go over there and say you're sorry because you did that and he'll be real specific you'll know vague senses of guilt just claim that as being from Satan and believe God okay okay let's say we're there we're being born along by the Spirit of God we're permeated with His presence we're full of His person we see the contrast we understand that we have responded to the command we've brought ourselves to the Lord what are the consequences, what are the results of a spirit-filled life, verses 19 through 21. Now, I am not going to claim that the consequences that are given here are exhaustive. All I'm going to do is give you the three consequences that this text deals with. The first consequence of a spirit-filled life is very personal. I love this. Excuse me. I love this. I just hope that as we go through this, your heart will catch the joy of what this is dealing with. The first result of a spirit-filled life is this, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord. The first result of a spirit-filled life is that we sing. It's a song. It's a song. The second result of a spirit-filled life is not personal. It's not something that's done in me. It's something that's toward God. By the way, I'll be getting to this in a couple weeks going on, but there's no way in the world that I can give anything to you unless I'm full. There's nothing, the song doesn't come unless I'm really full. I can sing the song and I can pretend, and it's not there. The song will be a spontaneous result of the filling of the Spirit. But it's me, it's about filling my heart and my life with His love. The second thing is relation to God, I say thanks. I'm filled, I sing, and when I'm singing I say thanks. And the third result is real exciting, and that's toward God. I mean, that's toward each other. And that is submitting, verse 21, be subject to one another, serving. And all of this ties in with John 7, 37 and 38. If any man is thirsty, let him come and drink of me. And when he does what will happen, he will be full. And when he is full, what will happen out of him from his innermost being will flow rivers of living water to everyone around him. And so in these three consequences of the Spirit-filled life, we've got every relationship that you could possibly be involved in, taken care of, filled up. I am full. And when I am full, I say thanks. And when I say thanks, I give it to you. A neat kind of thing happening there. By the way, just to note this as we're teaching this particular part, the third result, this submitting one to another, this serving one another in verse 21, and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ is going to become the basis for the entire rest of our study. I need you to know that as we're trying to hold this whole thing together in the book of Ephesians. The entire section from verse 22 to the end of chapter 6 is going to be an exposition of what it means to subject yourselves one to another. Do you see that? I want you to see that. It's really important. It's like saying this, be subject to one another. And what I mean by that, wives, is be subject to your husbands as to the Lord. And what I mean by that, husbands, is husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and that means you give yourself for her. That means you might even die for her. That means basically you're subjecting yourself to her. Be subject to one another and what I mean by that, children, is obey your parents. Be subject one to another and what I mean by that, slaves, is obey your masters. And what I mean by that, masters, is cool it. You'll see when we get there. take it easy on your slaves and so the remainder of this study is going to be a study of spent discovering the results of the spirit filled life and by the way the final result of the spirit filled life you know what it is the final result of one who's really submitting one to another is this he's going to run right into the enemy and that's when we're going to begin to talk about the weapons of our warfare today let's begin just by looking at this very first result and I think you know also that our sermons, we have three-point sermons here, but the problem is the three-point sermons, we take three or four weeks on each point. We're in the first point of the third point. There's two more in the third point, and then we'll go on to three or four more there. And if you understand that, you're doing better than me. The first result of the Spirit-filled life is singing, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord. I love this. I love this. This is so simple. I've been waiting all week, and I just hope you catch the joy of this. think for a moment when you think of the spirit filled life maybe before we did this series when you think of the spirit filled life the results of the spirit filled life in your kind of little calculations of what that means what would be the result in your life of the spirit filled life I mean you'd really know it was there because what I would do when I was spirit filled I would do great and mighty acts I would be able to heal the sick and raise the dead and I would preach and people would respond and I would teach and people would learn and there would be great clarity and all this wonderful stuff I'd be able to say to that mountain be removed and it would be you know it says here it says you'll sing it says you'll have a song real amazing thing to me and very exciting is the role that music has in the economy of God even its role in eternity it's something you know I sometimes wonder if we come to church and we sing and we think you know I would really hate to have singing gone because I really enjoy it and I really like it but I wonder if we have really ever considered the power and the theology that goes into our singing. Do you know that in heaven there's not going to be any use for me anymore? There's going to be no more preaching. There's going to be no more expositing. We won't need it anymore. All we're going to be doing is what we were intended to do in the beginning and that's saying thanks all the time. And that means we're going to sing all the time. It's the song of the redeemed. It's the song of a soul set free. Some people say I hate to sing. You know, this is really bad news for me because if in heaven all we're going to do is sing, that's going to be a real drag for me because I hate to sing. And somebody else says, but I love to sing. And the problem with both of those little observations, if I'm picking them apart correctly, is this. That my hating to sing and my loving to sing is really based on my ability to sing. Right? I have a good voice, so I love to sing. Or I have a lousy voice, so I hate to sing. We're missing the point. The point of the song that is born in the heart of the Spirit-filled life has nothing to do with singing the right notes, singing on key. It even doesn't have anything to do with anybody being able to listen. Sometimes the song of the spirit-filled life is one that is totally silent. Maybe for some the song goes something like this. I finally discovered that I don't have to pretend anymore. And there's a song. And maybe for someone else it goes something like this. I finally believe and I finally have received my forgiveness and I feel forgiven and there's a song and I feel loved and I feel accepted and there's a song. And you know what I do when I really when it first begins to dawn on me that I am forgiven and I am accepted and I am loved and you love me and I love you and I'm experiencing those things. You know what I do? I sing. And you know what my song is? Thank you. Thank you. I finally see it. I finally experience it. And then you know what I do? I give it to you. I give it to you. Submitting, serving one another. All three of those things. I wrapped up. You know what? I can't sing at all. All you have to do is ask our choir how I sing. I mean, they're going... I get excited and they start going crazy. You know, guys sitting next to me, they go a little nuts. But I have a song. I have a song. And I trust that in even the year we've been together, that somewhere along the line you've heard my song. I trust you've heard my song and you know what if you know the Lord and if you love the Lord you have a song and it doesn't necessarily come out with perfectly put together words and phrases it's the song of the redeemed it's the song of the soul set free it's the song of the one who realizes he doesn't have to pretend anymore he doesn't have to come to this church and put on a show you can come just like you are and let the Lord begin to put the pieces back together and that sets me free and then I sing and then I say thanks and then I want to share it with you. And I'll tell you something, when I'm set free and when I begin to really realize those things, I'm going to sing it as loud as I can. I heard a story of a guy who was getting ministered to through a tape ministry. He was in prison. And he accepted the Lord through this tape ministry and his life was just changed around and he made a tape and sent it back to the pastor who was responsible for that particular tape ministry. and he began to do his testimony. He says, I just wanted to give you my testimony and here it is and you've had a real impact on me and the word of God has really reached into me and it's changed my life. And what I want to do is sing. And so I got a guitar out and it was pitiful. I mean, you know, in the first measure he hit about five different keys and 12 different notes and they were all off and they were all squeaky and the room, the sound was just bouncing off the walls. And this pastor who was listening to this began to just say how it didn't matter. The words were there. And what he heard was his heart and he laughed because it sounded so terrible, but he cried because what he heard was a song that was born out of a heart that was full. God loves music. God loves music. I want you to catch this because this is terribly theological and fundamental to who we are. Music, music is the language of the soul. Music is the language of the soul. Do you know that even our salvation is tied up with music? there's no getting around it. Music is tied up with salvation. We've been talking these few weeks and several months about the newness of life. We use that word new. The newness of life and we're new creatures in Christ and there's a new kind of life and a new birth and a new nature. All of those new things. And all through the Bible there's a new this and a new that. Do you realize that the word new is connected with song more than any other word and it's always dealing with redemption. It's always dealing with salvation. The result of redemption is a new song. That newness is not in chronology. It's new in kind. It's new in type. It's new in the kind of song it is. The song of the redeemed. The song that God has given is not like any other song that's ever been sung. It's the song of the soul set free. It's the song that is born of the Spirit of God. Psalm 33.1 says this, Sing for joy in the Lord. Who is to do that? You who are redeemed are to do that. Why? For praise is becoming to the upright. You know what? Praise looks good on you. That's why. Psalm 40 verse 3 says this, But he put in your mouth a new song. A song of praise to our Lord, to our God, and many will see it and trust in the Lord. Psalm 96, 1 and 2 says this, Sing to the Lord a new song. Proclaim good tidings of what? of His salvation from day to day. Redemption and salvation result a new song. Psalm 98, 1 and 2. Sing to the Lord. What? A new song. Why? For He has made known His salvation to me. Always the song is the song of the redeemed. The song of a heart that understands that they've been set free and bought out of the slave market. Revelation 5, 9 says this, and we dealt with this already, and they sang a new song saying, again, a new song. It wasn't like any song ever sung. Worthy art thou. Worthy art thou. Why? Because you were slain and didst purchase men for God with thy blood from every tribe and tongue and people and nation. The song is the song of the redeemed. There's only two times in all of Scripture that we're told that the angels sing. Some of those things the angels sang when Jesus was born. The angels spoke then. They didn't sing. The times that the angels sang, the first record of it, is way back in Job, the book of Job. You know that's the very first book ever. It isn't that way in the order of our Bible, but it was the very first book. And Job records that the angel sang before the fall, before there was ever any sin, before there was ever any separation from God and men. It was all the way it was designed to be by God. And the next time you hear the angel sing is in the book of Revelation. When Christ is coming to set up his kingdom, the fall is being reversed. He's coming to gain paradise back and what they do then is break forth in song. And in between the fall and when Christ comes to gain paradise back, there's no song. Why? Because the song is the song of the redeemed. Exodus 15, Moses. We could just go on and on and on with the value of song and the result of that. Exodus 15. Moses was leading his people out of Israel and they had just come from this tremendous bondage. They weren't free. They were bound to someone else they couldn't do what they wanted their lives were as dead and now God came and pulled them out of that literally redeemed them from that and that's exactly what this whole thing of the people of Israel moving out of Egypt is a picture of is a picture of redemption you know what they did in Exodus 15? it says they sang they sang what was the song? it was a song of redemption come it says and let us sing to the Lord for He is our strength and He is our song and He has become our salvation and He is our joy and He is our life and we will sing. Judges 5. We see the first example of the first duet in the Bible. Barak and Deborah. Again, this picture of being delivered from bondage. The people of Israel were by their leadership delivered from bondage and you know what they did? First thing they did, they sang. the song is the song of the redeemed and when you're redeemed you sing you know what and when you sing you say thanks and it's all to God all through the Old Testament one of the examples of the Old Testament is that of the 38,000 people I believe this is 1 Chronicles 16 where David is dealing with all the people who are ministering in the temple of the 38,000 people who ministered in the temple 9,000 of them were musicians 9,000 musicians and they were taking care of the choirs and all the musical instruments that were being used in that day. Exodus 15. We see the first example of the women's choir. Miriam led it. In 1 Samuel 10.5, we have the first men's choir. And you know who made it up? The prophets. Can you imagine that? That's incredible. Thousands of prophets just filling up a choir loft and singing. Prophets of God. I got a feeling their theology was straight. I would have liked to have heard that. And why did they sing? They sang because they were full of God. They were lost in His love. They knew the salvation of God. And I just have ringing in my mind when we think of the song of the redeemed, it says, let the redeemed of the Lord, what? Say so. Maybe the most important dimension of our worship service is the singing, not the preaching. If my preaching is to do anything, it's to point us to God. And hopefully, one of the things that we would do as we grow and grow and grow would be I'm going to say get away from this but I don't know if we could I'd be out of a job but to sing to sing the song of the redeemed to let the things that God has done for us hit our hearts and then tell them things 1 Chronicles 13.8 says the whole congregation sang and you know what it did it says that they were doing it says that they were celebrating before their God. You know what else it says? It says they sang with all their might. They sang with all their might. You know what I think that means? That God likes it loud. Somebody said amen. I heard that. I can't sing, but I'm loud. And if you think it's loud now, you wait till we get in heaven and you shout, you know, I think that some of our reservation in singing and telling Him thanks is because we don't see. I wonder if we see His glory and see the salvation of God and if we let it really hit our hearts because I don't know if I can keep from shouting when I think of it. And all of it is directed to God. Please understand that we could just be noisy and it wouldn't be a glory to God. But when you've seen the salvation and you know you've been redeemed and you know you've been set free and you know you're loved and you're accepted and you don't deserve it, how can you help but sing? And all of it's directed toward God. I could go on and on. 1 Chronicles 16, David, the master musician, got a choir. Why? Because they were supposed to celebrate God. They wanted to celebrate God. 1 Chronicles 23, 5, Solomon, 4,000 voices in his choir. You know what? We need a bigger choir. I mean it. We need more people in the choir because it's about praise. It's about celebration. Psalm 68 says they even had chanting. They had all sorts of different musical instruments. There are some people who believe you shouldn't have musical instruments. I can't see that. They had every kind of instrument. They had wind instruments and they had percussion instruments and drums and harps and they even had a ram's horn. I loved it. When I was doing my study, a ram's horn, all you had to do was take it and blow it. That would have been mine. It wouldn't have been the right notes. but blow that thing. It would be great. You come to the New Testament, it's no different. It isn't any different. The last thing Jesus and the disciples did, remember when they were at the table and they were facing this grievous thing, and by the way, the music isn't just skippity-doo-dah-day. The music is the music of the soul, and it isn't because I feel great necessarily. Paul and Silas in stocks, wondering if they were going to die. And I don't think they started singing, something skippy. I really don't believe that, but I think that as they thought about their death and the fact that they were going to give their lives for Christ, I think God gave them a song. And I think they just sang, all that thrilled my soul is Jesus. And if I die, it's okay. God gave them a song. And sometimes when you sing, it comes out like that. Jesus and His disciples, And that dark night when they shared the table together, you know the last thing they did? They sang. They sang. They joined hands and they sang a hymn. The Word of God tells us that. Acts 4.24. One of the first hymns the church ever sang. Look it up. Same thing we have one in Colossians and Philippians, I believe, are big hymns that the early church sang. They came, and when they came to gather together, you know what they did? It was the responsibility of the believers not to come and hear Paul preach. Paul would preach and teach. That was important. But they came and they had a responsibility to the body to come with what? They came with a song. They came with a hymn. They came with a praise to share. That's what they did. That was their worship. It's amazing to me that Duane mentioned some of those things he did at the beginning. Because I've sensed that same stagnation even in our church, in the office all week long. It's just been a, I don't know if it's post-holiday or what, you know, there's a, and maybe many of you are feeling that kind of dryness in your soul and we're right in the middle of the filling of the spirit and I can't feel like that and as I was going through this and I was dealing with my evening service sermon as well and I was just about ready to do it and I thought you know what this isn't going to fit and I'm making an announcement right now you know what we're going to do tonight we're going to come back we're going to go downstairs and we're going to come together and we're going to sing that's all we're going to do there's not going to be a message there's going to be scripture read but we're going to sing and we're going to sing the song of the redeemed and we're going to say thanks to him for everything he's done. And you know what you need to do? You need to come tonight with a song. And you need to come with a hymn that's prepared and maybe a word of thanks and maybe something to share. And we're just going to come together and worship the Lord. Maybe you're sitting there now and you're going, I don't have a song. I just feel so wiped out. I don't have a song. We're going to get to that in a few minutes. Hang on. Just so we know what to do when we come tonight. Let's look at the text because the text tells us. Here's the three dimensions of this text. When it says to speak to one another, the first question I would have is, among whom do we sing? It's real clear. Speaking to yourselves, speaking to one another in Psalms, speaking to one another. The singing of the Spirit-filled life, the singing the song of the redeemed is for us. I want you to really see that. I don't know what words I can use to impress that on you. The song of the redeemed is for the redeemed. It's not for anybody else. And I know that sounds real exclusive and real kind of cutting everybody else out, but it is. The song of the redeemed is for us and that's who music is for and it's all designed to go to him. By the way, I'll go into it next week. Too much is too much. The song and the singing I'm talking about is not to be evangelistic. It is not to be evangelistic. You know these times when we come together to worship? This is not a time to get people saved. I know that might really grate on some of you, but it isn't. This is the time to worship, and it's all directed toward God, and it's the song of the redeemed. Now, I would just invite you to bring people who don't know the Lord, and as we direct our praise to God, they're going to see something of a spirit-filled life, and they're going to be attracted to that, and it might prick their heart. But the song of the redeemed is among us. It's for us. One of the things that really bothers me deeply is I see people cash in on what I would call Jesus' music. You know, Jesus is really, it's not as much as it was in the past few years, but Jesus was a hot item. I mean, the Jesus music thing and the Jesus people thing made the born again thing and the Jesus music thing really popular. You see it on TV and somebody ends their show with a spiritual song and the whole show along they've been dancing around with hardly any clothes on and just all sorts of weird stuff and then they end with a hymn. Isn't it precious? I think it stinks. That's the song of the Redeemed. They're singing my song. It's not theirs. One of the most bizarre things I remember, it didn't bother me then, it bothers me now, was when the Doobie Brothers came out with a song Jesus is just alright with me all the kids know it really neat rhythm and stuff like that Doobie Brothers I'm sure they know the Lord I'm sure they don't pushing drugs that's the basic thing of their whole music thing and the very cover that that album I don't even want to describe it the guys were half naked and it was disgusting and you know Jesus is just alright with me and everybody goes yeah isn't that neat no it isn't neat this is for the redeemed this is our song the song of the redeemed that's for us and that leads me right to the text not only is it for us not only is it among the believers and we come together for this very precious song that God has given to us but it's from the heart speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs making melody with your heart literally that could be translated making melody caused by your heart the agency of the song is caused by your heart and to sing without your heart being right is to sing in sin and I mean that you know sometimes in our effort to get you to sing we want you to smile and tell you to do it maybe we should kind of can that a little bit I understand the reason to do that but if your heart isn't right don't sing don't sing Israel had been taken into Babylon under captivity and you know what it says they didn't have a song because they were in captivity and again we would see this we could draw the parallel of redemption and people being in bondage to sin. And when they're in bondage, there is no song. Psalm 137 verses 1 through 4 says this. We sat down and we wept because we thought of Zion. We thought of the time that we had been free. And because we were not free now, we hung our harps on the willows. And our captors demanded of us a song saying, sing us one of your songs. And the emphasis would be there. The parallel I would just make. It'd be coming to church. You're in bondage. You don't feel like it. You're not in tune with the Spirit. You need to confess your sin and you come and you go, sing a song and we go da da da da da. And they said no. We cannot sing a song of freedom because I know I'm not free. And I'll sing when I'm free. And I'm not going to entertain. And I'm not going to go through the motions. And it's not going to be showbiz for me. The show must go on. So you've got to sing anyway. I just challenge some of us choir people. Some of us people who sing special music or something. If your heart is it right. Deal with that. And the answer again is not don't sing. The answer is confess your sin. Deal with your sin. Let the Lord touch you. And he'll give you a song. But people sing for money. And people sing for fame. And people sing for pride. And people sing because it's in the bulletin. And that's what we do on Sunday mornings. And the song that is flowing from a spirit-filled life is something that they don't even understand and never experience and don't know anything about. I want you to remember something in Amos 5. these people were singing and this is where the rebuke comes and this is why I feel so strong about it. This is not my idea. Amos chapter 5 comes along and these were people who kept on singing and they kept on bringing their offerings and they kept on going to church and everything was wonderful and pleased. This doesn't mean stop going to church. What it means is start getting your heart right and start quit going through the motions but they did and they weren't getting their heart right and they kept bringing their offerings thinking naively that God somehow accepted it because they went through the motions. Verses 21 through 24 God says this I hate and despise your festivals. I do not delight in your solemn assemblies. You come and you bring your offerings, go through the motions, and I will not accept them. He goes on in the 23rd verse and says, I don't even want to look at your sacrifices. I don't even want to see them. Take away from me the noise of your song. Remember before I said, God likes it loud. If your heart isn't right, it's just noisy. Take away from me the noise of your songs. I will not even listen to the sound of your harps. but let justice roll down like waters and righteousness flow like a stream. In other words, till you get your hearts right, I'm not interested in your music. I'm not interested in your praise. God wants to hear the song of the redeemed. God wants to hear the song that is born of a heart that is full of his spirit. In other words, music in and of itself is not the issue. You got that? Music in and of itself is not the issue. You could sing or I could sing the most beautiful God-glorifying words that were ever put on paper and they could be absolutely magnificent and proper and God-glorifying in their words. But if my heart isn't right, if I'm in it for me, if I'm going through the motions, if I'm putting on a show, save it. I don't even want to hear it. On the other hand, you could sing like me. Or you could sing like most of you. And if your heart is right, whatever it is that you're singing is sweet music to God and sing it loud. Just sing it loud. Let it go and say thanks. Say thanks. I do think sometimes we need to get lost in it. I really do. You know how I fight against a big emotional thing and I would. And the problem with emotion is not emotion. The problem with emotion is too often it isn't ground in the truth of God's word. But if our hearts are right and we know the word then sing and do it loud. music isn't the issue it bothers me when we lose sight of that and I am guilty of this and we are guilty and I think our evangelical community as a whole is guilty of this as we pile up and heap glory on stacks of musicians and singers and even preachers the same kind of shallow thinking and we promote them and we push them and they're glorified all through the Christian community and the reason they're glorified and the reason it's so wonderful is because their voices blend so well and their music is so nice and I like the rhythm and we've missed the point, right? Guess what? God's not interested in their song if their heart isn't right. I don't care how nice it sounds. And I'm just trusting that as we grow together we're going to get less and less and less and less satisfied with anybody coming in here and wowing us with entertainment. Yuck! Revelation 18 says God one day is going to stop all the music. All the music is going to stop right now. All the world's music and all the music that is religious and not really directed to God from a spiritual life. He's going to stop it right now. It says the music will stop. Your instruments will cease. Can you imagine the world without music? We depend on music. It's unbelievable. We go on the car, we turn on the music. We go to work, the music plays. It just kind of keeps us going. Music is great that way. It's wonderful. It soothes us. It excites us. It's great. It's a gift. but he's going to stop it all and in the end the only music that is going to be sung is going to be the song of the saints who are making up the kingdom and it's going to come from a full heart and we're going to sing like we never sang and the only reason it's going to be better than now is because we're going to see better than all he's done for us and we're going to see his glory like we don't see now and we see now tiny bits and when we do we go nuts but then we're going to see it all and we're just going to sing when we sing it's among the redeemed it's our song it's our song and I'm jealous of it and it's from the heart and the last thing just closing real quickly it's to the Lord how simple can you get making melody with your heart to the Lord we've got to get over the idea choir and piano and organ player and song leaders and special music people we've got to get over the idea that we're singing to you. I think we give lip service to that, but it's hard. Maybe I need to, I like walking in the spirit. I need to remind myself of that all the time. I remember talking with some people who were going to do special music and they were telling me how nervous they were. They were going to do special music and they were really nervous. And that's understandable. I get nervous every time I come up here. I couldn't possibly do it without getting nervous. But one of the things we need to remember sometimes when we're doing that is who we're singing to. is it for you no it isn't for you yes it is it's for you but it's to him it's to him and I just love it there are people in our church and most of you I can just sense that you're singing to the Lord sometimes we forget I don't want to mention any names but I but I'm gonna that doesn't matter I think of Gloria when she sings Sunday nights every once in a while and she just closed her eyes and sometimes her voice cracks because she starts to cry why? because she was singing to the Lord she got lost in it it was great it's to God our song is not even just for God you know we sing for the Lord we say it isn't just for him it's to him it's to him I remember talking to Dwayne and we talked about the fact change the word so we sing it right to him so we sing it not about God but to God every once in a while somebody will sing and we clap for him I think that's great I encourage loosen up with that do that more it's just kind of telling him we appreciate what he did and he was a blessing to us so we clap do it more but you know what I think when I think of this concept of our singing being to God that he should clap you know he should be the one going yeah that was good 2nd Chronicles I close with this I want you to turn to it 2nd Chronicles way over where the pages are white 2nd Chronicles 5 neat things were happening here the temple had been built and they were going to come together to dedicate the temple and have just a tremendous celebration and the Levites who were the singers were arrayed in their white garments and all of these the fine linen the cymbals and the harps and the lyres were there they were standing on the east of the east of the altar verse 12 and with them 120 priests blowing trumpets could you see that? just blowing trumpets I mean if we had one here to blow us right out of the place. 120 trumpets, thousands of voices singing. And it says this, in unison with the trumpeters, when the trumpeters and the singers were to make themselves heard with one voice. By the way, that's in the singular. And it's in the singular for two reasons. One, they were good. They were just good. It was one voice. The sound was together. The other thing was that they were singing and their hearts were one. And God was so pleased with their sacrifice of praise that it says this, so that the priests could not even stand up to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord filled the house of God. We need to sing. Hebrews 2.12, Jesus is speaking, and he's speaking to the Father, and he's speaking of his intercession for the church, and at one point he says this, In the midst of the church, I will sing. Jesus said that. Do you know what that means? That means when we come together tonight, and we who are the redeemed sing from a spirit-filled life, and we lift our sacrifice of praise to God tonight, and we just sing, you know what happens? God takes all of that praise. Jesus takes all of that praise, and he stands in the midst of us, precious believers, and he's the one who sings to God. I love that. he takes our offering and he puts the melody on that I can't supply and he puts the music that I'm so lousy at and you are too and it doesn't matter and he takes what's in my heart and he translates it to God and it's all for him and it's all for praise and it's all because we're one and now I'm reminded again that maybe some of us here are thinking boy that sounds great and I'm glad you got a song because I don't have a song. And I remember when we were dealing last week with the quenching of the Spirit and the grieving of the Spirit. You know what you quench when you quench the Spirit? This is what you quench. You quench the song. You quench the song. There's no song. When you grieve the Spirit, what you grieve and what you frustrate is the song. Maybe to me needs to be the day that before we go downstairs tonight and sing, that before I do that, I come to Him and say, Lord, restore to me my song. give me back my song restore to me the joy of my salvation Lord I want to deal with this thing that I've been burying for months again I'm not talking about that vague sense of something I'm talking about something specific that right now God is dealing with you and you know exactly what it is and until you confess it until you deal with it you won't have a song and you can't sing and maybe you need to come today and let God give you a song and confess it and let him deal with it and maybe that's not it at all maybe yours is more just that vague sense of yuck and you feel stagnant and you feel dry and you just feel like you've lost touch and where's the glory and maybe you're just having a lot of pain maybe your transmission on your car blew up this week doesn't matter but maybe it's something serious like your marriage and you're not connecting with your wife and you're not connecting with your husband and you're with the kids all day and you're just going nuts and where's the song? I come here, you talk about it but where's the song? and you haven't done well you haven't done well I got good news for you we do not have a high priest who is high and lofty and unapproachable. And we do not have a relationship, Romans 8, of fear and intimidation, but a relationship of adoption as sons, whereby if you haven't done well this week, you can come into his presence. Thank you.
