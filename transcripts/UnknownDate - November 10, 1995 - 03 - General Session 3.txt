I don't think Dave actually gave you a definition of spiritual abuse, did he? So I'm going to talk about what is spiritual abuse and what isn't spiritual abuse. But before I do that, I wanted to just read you some letters, give you an idea of some of the letters that Dave and I have gotten about the issue of spiritual abuse. Some of you who have read our book have seen examples of these in the book. I have another book out called When God's People Let Me Down. and basically the difference between the two books is an authority issue. For spiritual abuse to occur, it has to happen from a place of authority or perceived authority. So it doesn't have to be a church leader, but it does have to be someone that you think has authority to tell you something. So it could be a friend that you respect or something like that. In the book on spiritual abuse, we talk about the misuse of authority and what happens to people when people misuse their authority. When people wrote us that again, probably half the letters, all the letters were like, this is helpful, it put words on what we were going through, we found out we weren't crazy, we're not the only ones, things like that. But then people would write a story. They'd say, this is what happened to us. Half the stories would not be what I would call spiritual abuse. Half the stories would be what I would call getting hurt spiritually. When someone gossips about someone in church, that's not spiritual abuse, but it really hurts like crazy. It's an example of an unhealthy living skill that someone learned or didn't learn somewhere, and now they've brought it into their new family, and instead of talking to the person that they had the issue with, they talk about the person that they had the issue with. And that's because their parents or somebody didn't teach them that they need to go talk to the person. And if they would, it would be settled. And they wouldn't have to go around all this kind of thing. That's not spiritual abuse. That's just getting hurt in a place that we thought was supposed to be really safe. So that's what that other book is about. But this is about the misuse of authority. Here's an example of a bulletin that we got. Those of you who, you know, read our book and saw these examples, this is the copy, actual, you know, copy. Check yourself. If all people were like you, would they be in Sunday school next Sunday? Would they be on time? Would they bring a Bible? By the way, these aren't bad things. You understand? go to science school, it's okay, bring your Bible, it'll be on time. Would they have studied the lesson? Would they bring an offering? Would they attend the preaching service? Would they make an effort to worship during the service? Would they bring someone with them? Would they invite a new visitor? Give yourself 10 points for every question to which you can answer yes. If your score is 100, you're a perfect example. If it's 90, you're just about right. If it's 80, you're slipping. If it's 70, watch your step. And if it's close to 60, you're an emergency case. Now, see, when you put that little thing on the bottom there, it puts a spin on doing these things that are or aren't good or bad in and of themselves. And all of a sudden, you're doing things that, you know, maybe are good to do, but you're doing them for the wrong reason. Now you're doing them to look, I mean, tell us, first line, look at yourself. You know, look at yourself and see how you're doing. See how, if you're being a good example for other people. So that would be that one. And this other one, this is a newsletter from a pastor to his congregation here in the Twin Cities. It's called Fallings and Grace. It had to happen. What goes around comes around. Sooner or later, history repeats itself. The sun rises and sets, only to rise again. Yes, it finally happened. You're probably thinking, oh, the field goal kicker from Chicago had his string snapped at 25. Actually, I wasn't thinking that myself. 25 on Sunday night. No, not that. although I did see the glaring technicolor. It's even worse. You think, well, maybe it's an incredible, unbelievable two-game winning streak of the Detroit Lions and the embarrassment of the Cleveland Browns and the New Orleans Saints. No, it's not that, but I did see the end of both games done to the point of temporary paralysis. I just have to say that when I read that line about he saw the end of both games, I had a chuckle because the reason he doesn't see the beginning of the games, he's because he's in church when the games start. But it brought back a memory for me when I was a kid. I never saw the end of The Wizard of Oz until I was an adult. Because it was always on on Sunday night. I don't know if you remember that. It was always on on Sunday night. And then right before it turned to color, we went to church. So I never saw the end of it. So, I mean, this is a big joke at my house because I remember the first time I thought it was in color, I thought, well, like, did they invent color in the middle of making the movie, you know? I mean, but I wasn't an adult until I saw the end of it, because we were always having to leave to go to church. Well, here's what he says. No, it's worse than being beaten by Detroit. And you may find that hard to imagine. It's worse. Last Sunday, we fell below the 200 marks for the first time in 13 weeks. Our 200-plus attendance mark has been stopped at 13. It happened. We fell from grace. Which means, then, that the way you get grace at this church, even like if you get grace, you guys in the front row get grace, is if these guys come and put us over 200. And all of a sudden, attendance has another spin on us. It's not just about, here's this place that's a safe place so you can come and grow and fellowship and give comfort and support and learn some new stuff. But now it's about grace. And you don't want to lose it, so you better come. And not only that, you don't want them to lose it, so you better come. Don't expect too much deep theology in this article. Okay. Now listen, this is a very important line. It's the week of our yearly meeting, and I'm wearing the prints off my fingertips trying to get my yearly report ready to go. When I read that, I thought, now why is this guy wearing the prints off his fingertips trying to get his yearly report ready to go? And it's because, and those of you who've been in spiritual use of systems need to know this. People who perpetrate these and perpetuate these systems, eventually the system comes back around and gets the person who does it. We need to know that because he's created a system where people are measured by performance, and now it's his turn to report all the performance he's done in the last year, hoping that these people that share so much about performance now are going to let them stay another year and perform. You understand how this works? And eventually, the system gets the person. And I think Dave maybe mentioned that last night too. So that's a strange form of encouragement, I suppose. You don't have to get the person. The person gets the show. I would really, however, like to see all of our folks join together for worship during these next four Sundays and help 1989 go out with a bang. We can make it a banner year here at our church. We've got great attendance, great giving, great participation in all of our programs. It's so great here. It's just really great. No grace, but it's really great. Let's set the stage for a brand new decade by getting, quote, grace up again. This is the last 10 pages, handwritten both sides, of a 70-page letter that Dave and I got. It came like, the envelopes were like balled up. They were like balls of letters. They weren't like nice, flat little letters. Of course, you couldn't fit the thing in one envelope, but it came in pieces over about a three-week period. And this is a guy who was a cat burglar. And here's a really good one. And that's what he did for a living, and he never got caught, and it was great. but he became a Christian, which really messed up his career. So what happened was he got involved in a church that was really focusing him on his performance and totally consumed with finding God's will. Of course, because you have to find God's will so you can do God's will. I talk a lot about this in that second book, too, that for a lot of people, God's will is just like this kind of divine to-do list, and so you better figure out what it is so you can do it, because you don't want to get on God's plan D will or his permissive will. You want to be on his perfect will, right? But, see, the way that Scripture talks about God's will is the same way as anybody here who has a will. Who has a will? Yeah, like that. I don't know if you've ever thought about God's will like that, but God's will is like what he's left in his ears. And our job isn't to figure it out and do it. Our job is to enjoy it. But anyway, this church was like, you know, you don't want to get on God's plan, be will. And this guy stands in front of the refrigerator trying to figure out if it's God's will for him to have milk or orange juice. And I have seen examples of people who have gone crazy, like lost their minds trying to live holy lives. They have lost their minds trying to, because they're so obsessive. about figuring out what God wants them to do. They've lost touch with reality. They've lost their minds. Well, this guy, of course, comes to a point where he figures out that if this is what a Christian is, he can't do it. I mean, there's just no way he can do it. And he gives up. This is what being a Christian is like. I can't do this. But there is one thing he can do, which is what? Virgo, yeah. So he goes back to cat burglary, but this time he gets caught. So now he's in the Pennsylvania State Penitentiary, and he runs into a chaplain there who understands grace and tells them all about God's grace. And so this is 70 pages of I am really kicked. You know, like, I really got ripped off here. That's what that's about. Okay. This is a membership card that you get if you go to this church in Atlanta. And it says, as a member of this church, I purpose to understand and live in covenant. And basically, once again, this is not evil. It's like this church is saying, which I think is okay. It's like it's saying, well, if you want to be part of this, you just need to know what this is about. So you can make a good decision about whether you want to be part of this. That's okay for churches to do that. Here's where we're going. You want to go here? Well, okay. Then you need to know where we're going. So you can decide about that. As a member of this church, I purpose to understand living covenant, which is repentance, water, baptism, the Lord's table, tithing and keeping the Lord's day, obedience to spiritual authority. We're going to find out a little later why that's in there. Be available and faithful to God's army. Set my will under the command of God. Give seed faith offerings once a month. And then they tell you what that is. It's 10% plus 50 bucks. Now you understand that as soon as I tell you what your seed faith money is, It's not about faith anymore. And number five, and this is a really important one. This is speak only bold letters, life in this ministry. Speak only life in this ministry, which being translated means something like that. Be called that. Yeah, don't notice any bad stuff. Don't have any negative confessions. How many know that phrase? Don't have any negative confessions. See, because the reason why we don't want you to have any negative confessions is because we are so powerful as human beings that if we say something negative, we can actually make it happen. See, that's a lie. There's only one person in the universe who's powerful enough to make something happen with a word, and that's God. He says, let there be light is light. Why? Because he said it. He's the only one that can do that. You're justified. You are. Why? He said it. He did it with the word that became flesh. He still did it with a word. Do you understand? This, you know, don't have any negative confessions. Don't say anything negative. Don't, you know, that's like rabbit's foot Christianity. That's like, you know, don't spill salt because bad things will happen. Very quick, you know, fix it by throwing it over your shoulder. Don't walk under ladders. Because living a Christian life is like a superstitious person instead of like an insightful person who knows what's going on and can tell and can think. Okay, well, whatever. But on the other side of this, it says God's security card. God's security card. Now, whatever else those things are, even let's just say they're okay things. Let's just say that. Now, it puts a spin on it. Now it's about, what does it mean if you don't do these things now? If this is really God's security card. You want to know what God's security card really is? It's the Holy Spirit. It's God's security card. Who's been given as a seal and a pledge from God's blood. Here's a letter. Here's a thing that people get in their deal that they pass to the end of the aisles. You know, sign up for every week. Okay, look around and see who's missing. On Sunday, such and such a date, I noticed that, you know, was missing from church. And then they put it in the office plate, then the staff gets it and tracks these people down in the afternoon. Now, first of all, let me just say something about this. If you care about people in your church, and you look around and you notice they're missing, give them a call. It's okay, you know, it's okay to say I'm worried about you, where you've been, like that. But what this does is this kind of targets them. And also, as a staff person who works in staff situations in church, this would tire me out. If you guys looked around and saw who was missing and wrote them all down, and it was my job to go find them all, that would be abusive to me. It would burn out me. And you know what else? I'm not the one who's supposed to go look for them. If you care about someone, go care about them. But we don't have to fill this out then. Do you understand? So, anyway, it just puts a spin on it. Here's an Ann Lander's article someone sent me. Dear Ann, this is in response to your column about the mock robbery in the bank in McPherson, Kansas. I know firsthand the trauma these people went through from a similar and equally disturbing experience in my former church. Imagine the horror of sitting in a place of worship after the offering of this collection. three men in dark clothing and ski masks, burst in and announced to the stunned assemblage, this is a robbery, don't anybody move. After demanding the money from the defense, they left taking the pastor's teenage daughter along as a hostage. Since our city has made national headlines in recent times for gang violence and horrible schoolyard shooting, this scene was all too believable. Only a few individuals knew it was a staged event. After the robbers departed, the pastor broke the news to his petrified congregation that he had staged the whole thing to illustrate how people who do not give 10% of their income to the church are robbing God just as surely as the bandits had just rob the church. The next week I returned to the church hoping the pastor had recognized his blunder and would deliver an apology. Instead, he attempted to excuse that outrageous performance by saying he was sorry so many people had been frightened. And by the way, that's not an apology. An apology is an, I'm sorry, you're so sad. I'm sorry you were affected. I'm sorry you're, you know, basically what that is is a coded message to say you're over-sensitive. An apology is, here's what I did. It was wrong. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done it. I will do whatever I need to to make sure it doesn't happen again. That would be an apology. He was sorry so many people had been frightened, but he wanted to do something dramatic to get his points across. Any thoughts on this hand? Signed, found a better church in Stockton, California. This is the back of a greeting card that a mother sent her son as he was taking his family to the mission field. Prayer list. Number one, pray for your 79-year-old mother you are leaving again. Number two, this is the lighter side of spiritual view. Number two, pray for your brother who will have to make all the necessary trips and arrangements in case of the sickness and death of your mother. but now you just do what the Lord tells you to do pray for your brother also who will have to shoulder all the clearing up of the estate he has a full time job too finally shifting your son out to a strange family is quite a risky thing but it's your responsibility remember God, the same God whom we love and adore took your dad away my son eventually left me and I've been void of human and family love and companionship for all these years. But God does not give us more than we can bear. One last letter. Dear sirs, we need information on spiritual abuse. We're a very legalistic church. We work for the school they have. We are seeing a lot of wrongs done to people. The church and school are run like a military camp. Our small source of income is provided by teaching there. Although we don't get paid on time, and then we're told it's a word of faith. Money is misused a lot. There's never a financial report. The leadership looks high in the hog. While others don't have enough bread for their children's lunches, we are threatening a lot with pay cuts. Recently, the young boys who play football have lost many games, so the leadership had a rough five-hour practice with no brains. Two boys had to go to the hospital. One had fractured ribs. All have bruises all over their bodies. All this is so the leader would not look bad at losing games. Parents are mad but afraid to speak out. Punishments are severe, to say the least. You have to try to put yourself in the place of someone who feels this way. What would it be like to live this way right now? Even by writing this down, it causes me to shudder at the thought of being found out. Now, this is a person in Oklahoma City, writing to a strange guy who wrote a book in Minneapolis. And she's worried that somehow this guy might know somebody in Oklahoma City, and this letter's going to come back around, and that person's going to end up with the letter, and then she's going to get nailed to writing the letter. What is it like to live like that? I see more of the problems than my husband. Well, that's because it's about men's and women's radar. You know, like women have this radar, like it's about satellite dishes on top of big skyscrapers, you know? And then men's radar is like a bent-up cone hanger to the beach. So am I lying or what? No, I'm not lying. I think the reason why this is, truthfully, is because I think that men typically get more invested in the system and women typically get more invested in the people. I can't prove that. But I think that's something that I know as a student. I'm so worried over sending our children to that school, but see what they keep doing. They keep speaking. They have no love or kindness, absolutely no grace, and scare the entire work, but they keep it. My heart is not right for getting itself very hard. Each day I face a new trial of a problem that is wrong done to someone whose feelings are hurting. How do you get bitter hatred out of hearts? My own bitterness is sometimes too great. It causes me physical illness. My husband has stress-related problems every day. My 13-year-old also. Almost anyone I talk to has all these skin problems in their homes. Why do 300 people allow one man to rule their every move, even when they know it's not right? We are not allowed to ever voice an opinion at all. Every action is taken into account and filed away for use against you in later life. Now, that's a very common dynamic, by the way. You know, we're really safe here, and you can tell us anything, and we really care, and we're just here for you, and stuff like that. So people spill their bets to the counselors and the pastor or whatever about what they're going through, and it's like, oh, yeah, you know, whatever. But then later on in the business meeting, if that person disagrees with something or asks a question that puts the leader accountable, then all the stuff that's supposed to be confidential gets dragged back up again and used it as evidence that something's really wrong with this person and you should just pump their comments or their questions. Lots of you nodding your heads, but that's very common. We're kept in poverty because that makes it impossible. It makes it impossible to leave and move. They charge big C's for schooling, but these people without education in the teaching field or these burned-out missionaries who are also uneducated, these people know nothing about the other kids and their needs. The children are abused a lot. Parents can't say anything. I've tried to get in a lot of trouble for saying anything at all. Women are treated very badly. Every problem a man has is the causes of a woman, even mother, grandmother, sister, aunt. These cause all of a man's problems. Men would be close to perfect if women hadn't caused them all their trouble. That's the message that they get there. If we go to an independent, fundamental, slow-winding, Bible-believing, separated Baptist church, maybe that will help you see where we are at in our needs. Our needs are great. Any help you can give will be so welcome. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I spend a lot of time crying with pains in my stomach. Thank you ahead of time. I do remember we're afraid for this to get into the wrong hands. Hurting in Christ. Signed, hurting in Christ. Yes, it's illegal for a work like this to not pay people when it's supposed to. And I just have even more. Let me tell you what isn't spiritual abuse. What isn't spiritual abuse is simply saying or doing something hurtful in church. That's not spiritual abuse. Not automatically. Saying or doing something hurtful in church. If I stood up here and said something hurtful to someone, like something that hurt someone here for some reason, that's not spiritual abuse. If you came to me and you said, here's what you did that was hurtful, like you tried to hold me accountable for what I did, here's what you said and I was hurt. If I heard you, if I could understand what you're saying and saw it, I'd apologize. I'd say, thanks for telling me. I'm sorry. I can't be over. If I didn't see it, if I couldn't hear what you were saying, I'd say, I don't understand what you're saying. I don't see it, but thanks for telling me. I'll think about it. I wouldn't roll and pretend to be sorry if I wasn't. I wouldn't pretend to see it if I didn't see it, but you wouldn't be in trouble for telling me. But if when you come and try to hold me accountable for my behavior, I drag out my spiritual authority as a leader or whatever to tell you that you don't get to do this, like something's wrong with you for even trying to hold me accountable. Who are you? You know, touch not the words and write it, blah, blah, blah. That's the spiritual abuse. It's not the hurtful thing that I said. That's just a hurtful thing. You understand that? That's just a hurtful thing. Hurtful things happen in relationships. It's going to happen. But if I use my spiritual authority to not be accountable, Scripture says leaders are more accountable, not less accountable. So if you see a leader using their authority to be less accountable, that's spiritual abuse. And now you're the problem. So trying to point out the problem, that's the spiritual abuse. Not the fact that I did or said something to a person. That just happens. It's going to happen. So that's not spiritual abuse. Disagreeing with someone about ideas or directions is not spiritual abuse. Frankly, if I'm a leader here, then I'm going to lead. And if you disagree, you can disagree. And I might still lead in a different direction. But you won't get punished for disagreeing. I'm not going to make an example out of you or punish you for disagreeing. And I would expect that you wouldn't punish me for disagreeing either. if you don't get your way, getting on the phone and calling a bunch of people and, you know, toasting me with these people, because that would be spiritually abusive to me. So just the fact that we disagree is just like another thing that happens in relationships. But if I'm the leader, then I'm going to lead, and we might disagree. That's not spiritual abuse. Disagreeing and then leading in another direction despite everyone's protest is not spiritual abuse. That's just called leading, you know. And the truth is, if I'm leading in a direction that you don't think is a good direction, don't follow. And maybe I'll end up there all by myself, in which case I'm not the leader I thought I was. But don't follow. Follow a leader that is going where you think is a good place to go. Church discipline is not spiritual abuse. Now, I've seen church discipline used very abusively because we kind of have this rule here that says, church is supposed to be the place where people don't have issues, you know, where people where it's a nice, clean, squeaky clean place, you know so if you have an issue we're going to get rid of it and that would be an abusive of church discipline there are basically two examples of church discipline that I can see very clearly that talk about the different ways church discipline is applied one is in Matthew 18 and basically that's the person who, that's the brother who sins against you and they're somewhere else. And that's why Jesus says go. Go to that person. And you go and it says if they don't listen, they don't listen. Go again. Then it says if they won't listen, then there's a difference between don't and won't. Don't is they can't hear you. Understand? If they can't hear you, try again. but won't is they won't hear you. Now that's an unsafe person. And if you try one more time, and if they won't hear you, then let them be a tax-gathering gentile. That's about, they're an unsafe person. A tax-gatherer is somebody who is a Jewish person who collected Roman Catholic. This is somebody who's supposed to be on our side who's working for the other side. Somebody in your life that is, or in the life of the church, that is sexually molesting his daughter is somebody who's supposed to be on the daughter's side who's working for the enemy. So they're like a tax gatherer. And what Jesus says is, let them be. Stay away from them. They're not saved. That's one church discipline. The other church discipline is in 1 Corinthians 5, where the person isn't somewhere else. The person's right here having an effect on people, eleavening the body, and that's a church discipline issue. Frankly, I've seen people discipline out of the church for overeating. You want to overeat? Overeat. It's not any of my business as a leader. Overeat. You start going to the junior high group and trying to get them to overeat too. Now it's my issue. That's a pretty mundane example. But all of a sudden, your issue isn't just yours anymore. Now it's having a leavening effect. You want to struggle with the things you struggle with? You can struggle with them here. You want to do it in a way that hurts other people? Now it's a leader issue. That's the first Corinthians 5. But I've seen churches, and that's not abusive. That's like, you know, as a shepherd, you have one way that you stand toward the sheep, and you have another way that you stand toward the people who hurt the sheep, or the wolves, or the bears, or whatever. And you're still acting like a shepherd, though. That's not spiritual abuse. shaming you for having a struggle and eliminating you from the fellowship because you do, that would be spiritual abuse. So here's what Dave and I mean when we say spiritual abuse. What is spiritual abuse? It's a mistreatment of a person. It's the mistreatment of a person who is in need of help, support, or greater spiritual empowerment. And by the way, where is the person that is not in need of help, support, or greater spiritual empowerment. Everybody just needs that. So everybody's susceptible. It's mistreatment of a person who is in need of help, support, or greater spiritual empowerment with the result of weakening, undermining, or decreasing the person's spiritual empowerment. So instead of making them less tired, it makes them more tired. If you come to me with a struggle in your life, and you're already tired out and doing it, you're already toasted and you're trying as hard as you can. If I give you more to do, I'm making you more tired than what I'm doing. Tired people need to rest. Tired people don't need more to do. So if you come for help as a tired person, you get more to do, that would be spiritual abuse. Spiritual abuse is the mistreatment of a person who is in need of help, support, or greater spiritual empowerment with the result of weakening, undermining, or decreasing that person's spiritual empowerment. And by the way, usually with good intentions. Serious. Usually with good intentions. Nevertheless, the good intentions explain it. They don't justify it. In my family, I'm the dad. I have bigness, fastness, loudness, strongness, experience. My job, authority, my job is to come underneath my daughters and to serve and build and equip them and set them free to do what God has made them to do, which I don't even know what that is. Do you understand that? I don't know what God has made my daughters to do. But God knows. These are source. I'm a resource. and my job is to serve and build and come underneath them and lift them up. So if I use my bigness and fastness and strongness and loudness and authority and position as a dad, whatever, to come over my daughters and get them to jump through a bunch of behavior hoops so that I can feel like an okay dad based on how my daughters are acting, that would be an abuse of my authority. Follow that? And we're going to have tired, sad, disillusioned daughters. You know, daughters are not here to perform so dads can feel okay. Daughters are not here to act a certain way so I can have a good day. I mean, I have a, I know a person who on their refrigerator has a little slip thing, a little, it's like a big, big magnetized deal. But it says, it says, today, mom is sad. Or happy. So little kids, they get up in the morning, they walk in the kitchen, they look up that today's mom is sad. What does that mean? It means that they've got to have to serve right now that day because mom is sad. Because somehow it's their job to make sure either mom isn't sad or at least make sure mom doesn't get sadder. And if she's happy, you don't want to wreck that. And now all of a sudden the daughters are carrying the weight of the well-being or the emotions or the mood of the parent. And now the daughters are supposed to act more like an adult than the parent is supposed to act like an adult. In the church, I'm a leader. I have authority, credibility, figness, fastness, strongness, loudness, gifts. I can talk. I have a sign on my door that says, get help here. You know, I have a title, I have training, I have expertise, I have years of experience. My job is to come underneath the members of the body of Christ and to lift them up and to build and serve and equip and set you guys free to do what God has built you to do, which I don't know what that is. But God knows what that is, and I'm a resource. He's the source. Do what he wants you to do. And I might not like it or agree with it, but you're not here to please me. and you're here to please him, I'm here to serve you. Not to be your slave, but to serve. To give myself, not to be taken, but to give myself. But if I use my bigness, fastest, loudness, strongest, gifts, position, authority, training, to come over to members of the body of Christ and to get them jumping through a bunch of hoops so I can feel like an okay spiritual leader based on the buildings that you're building and all the numbers that are coming and all the programs that are running, which, by the way, buildings are not evil and programs are not evil. But if I'm measuring myself by your spiritual performance and trying to get you to perform so I can measure myself higher, that's a misuse of the purpose why God gives authority. Now, I have to tell you, I feel uncomfortable being cast in the role of this big expert on spiritual abuse, because I have to tell you that I think I spent a significant part, maybe more time, I'm not sure about this, it's getting maybe even enough now, but as much time in the ministry spiritually abusing people as I had helping people who spiritually do. I mean, I wish that I could get every talk back that I gave to junior hires back in 1975 to 77. You know, I wish I could get every talk back. Because, you know, if you had been looking at that, watching that, watching my interaction, my ministry with the junior hires I ministered to, what it would have looked like to you is that I was just trying to help these kids stay off of drugs, and I was trying to help them, you know, care about Jesus more and read the Bible more and, you know, serious, marital sex and all this kind of stuff. That's what it would look like to you. But for me, you see, the reason I was doing what I was doing and I didn't even know this at the time. I know this now because I know myself better and I'm looking back on this, okay? The reason I did that was because I needed the junior hires to line up like a nice little great looking junior high group so I could feel like an okay junior high pastor so the parents to get off my case so I could keep my job. So the junior hires were there for me instead of me being there for the junior hires. That's a misuse of authority. Understand that? I didn't understand that at the time, but I understand it not. The first time that the phrase spiritual abuse, and I know that that doesn't originate with Dave and I because I got a letter from a woman in building Montana that said that we had a lot of guts in that because she thought of that 20 years ago. When it came into my head, you know, when I went, ah, this is what this is. It was right here in this building. My office was in that door right there. And people who came for counseling would come into the reception area and then come across into this area right here. There was no wall here. And there was a step down from that place into this meeting area. So people would come in. My secretary would give me a call. I would walk across. greet them, we walk back to the office. So I got a call from a Christian counselor in Minneapolis who said that she had a woman that she wanted to be able to see me for an hour. Would you see my person for an hour? That's it. An hour. I said, well, yeah, I would do that, but I want to know what you'd hope to accomplish in an hour. Like, what's the agenda here? She said, if this person can sit in a church building with a male clergy person for one hour and not get abused, it would be very, very significant. I said, okay, I can do that. You know, I'll just keep my mouth shut for an hour, basically. So I can do. So, the call came. I walked across the deal, introduced myself, you know, she introduced herself. I turned, walked back to the office. I got a boat right where you're sitting right there. And I could tell that she wasn't there. I could tell she wasn't following me. And I turned around, and she was standing on the step right there like this. It was like she had hit a piece of plexiglass like that. And she just could not physically move herself into the airspace above this place like that. And so I'm standing there, and I'm looking at her over there closer, and I'm thinking to myself, what is this happening? Something's happening. And it took about 20 minutes to get from there to there. 20 minutes. And then for the next 20 minutes, she sat right next to the door with the door open. Which is fine. And she kind of just told me something for 20 minutes. And then she said, that's it. That happened. One fell from the time. And for 20 minutes, she just told me story after story after story of being hurt, being mistreated, being mistreated in the name of Jesus for her spiritual love. by people in spiritual church. I thought to myself, spiritually. Let me give you some examples of what some of the struggles that people have who have been spiritually abused. What this is about is, this is just about when I see this, when I start seeing these kind of struggles or characteristics, I start thinking to myself, you know, maybe this person's been spiritually abused. And where did this come from? Every behavior that a person does, every behavior, every behavior that you can think of, the most horrific, perverted, awful, gross behavior that you can think of makes sense if you know why. There is a why for every behavior. and sometimes the why is spiritual views and sometimes the why. And so I have noticed kind of a set of characteristics and I'm not going to get to all of them, but I'll get to most of them. Number one, a distorted image of God, a twisted picture of God. Now I grew up in this you've got to find God's will kind of environment because you don't want to miss it. And we spent a lot of time trying to discern and figure out and understand and discover God's will because, once again, you've got to do it or else you're in trouble. So we spent a lot of time focused on it. But what was interesting is that I also had this belief, even as a kid, I also had this belief that at the same time that we were supposed to figure out what God wanted so we could do it, if we ever really figured it out, like if we nailed it, this is it, we changed it. Okay, that's what I saw. I thought, as soon as we figured out, he changed it. Because if we actually figured it out, then we would really know something that he knows. And I guess he's a little insecure or something. I'm not sure. Serious. I mean, I'm just letting in on some of my thinking. Like, God would not like it for us to be on that same kind of level with him. And so he's always keeping one step ahead. The other thing that it does is it teaches you, you can never rest. You can never rest. You can never know it and do it. You are always moving ahead trying to find it. But that's the picture I had of God. God was kind of this secure God who really wasn't real comfortable with us finding out His will, even though we were supposed to. And there's a lot of double-binding messages like that in spiritually abusive places. How many of you had this message that you're supposed to live holy lives? You're supposed to live holy lives. Okay, keep your hands up. Now, raise your other hand if you also got a message that said, By the way, you can never do it. Okay, see, that's a very tiring kind of place to be. But what it does is it gets you trying real hard. But never there. You can never rest. You're supposed to live holy lives, and by the way, you can never do it. So try and keep doing and keep doing and give more and do more. So that's a God who's never satisfied, who sets higher and higher goals, and is really anxious to let you know when you didn't meet him. Some people have a mean, vindictive God who is waiting for us to make a mistake so that he can really do what he'd really rather do, which is to nail us. That's the God who's looking at you all the time. You know, just waiting for you to make the wrong moves. I think the Pharisees had this guy. I think the reason why the Pharisees tried so hard to do all the rules and follow all the rules is because they had a God that had a big stick. And the only way they could avoid the stick, or at least kind of take the stick out of God's hands, was to not do anything that would upset God. And that's the twist of God. An apathetic God, a lot of people who are victims of other kinds of abuse have an apathetic God. When someone gets sexually abused, they get spiritually abused too. I don't have time to develop that. What I can say is that the spirit is wounded. It's not just the skin. The skin is not what they have to talk about. The spirit is wounded.... Or for him to do something would be for him to violate his own principles of authority. And so he's just answered. It would be like this. It would be like, you know, I don't know, are you guys married? Okay, well, let's say you are. Okay, so like, okay, so like you're the spiritual leader and you're abusing her and I'm God. And I can't under being on her behalf because under being on her behalf would be violating my own personal service, spiritual leaders, so I just haven't said it wrong. Some of you know about this. I mean, it's a lie. I think that's done. You know, what that looks like is here's God and he gives his stuff to the husband. There's a wife. And she's getting abused. But she has to stay here because this is how God gives this stuff to the wife. And if she comes over here, she's going to get Satan's stuff. And then she's going to get Satan's stuff. So she doesn't want to be over here because this is the structure that God has set up to get this stuff to the wife. Even if the husband is a slug or a perpetrator, he needs to stay here. Now, I personally think this is a lie. Personally, I think that what really happens is that with this husband as a perpetrator over here, what the truth is is that he's really over here. And he's doing stuff to the wife, and the wife needs to come back over here. And that might mean leaving her stay in the stand. I don't know, but she needs to be demoted here, not here, because this guy bails to work on my life today. So that's going to be a new thought for some. Maybe some of the suspicions that I've had already, but I don't know. See, the God who sets this up and can't violate it is kind of a God that a lot of people don't want to be around. Some people have a God who's sleeping and doesn't even notice some people are hurting and used, And some people have a God who's awake, close, cares, but can't do anything. And a lot of people have what I call a codependent relationship on God. Not a dependent relationship, but a codependent relationship. And what that's about is that they tiptoe through the Christian life. They live their lives a certain way because they think, they believe, they're in charge of God's mood swings. Okay? So they have to do it just right and live just a certain way, or else God's going to have a bad day, and you don't want him to have a bad day, because you know what happens when he has a bad day, right? So it's your job to control God's mood by how you live, which, now, when I say it this way, doesn't that look like kind of a whiffy, puny, whiffy God to have? I mean, but a lot of people are there. When we were, I was a kid, we sang a song that said, Be careful, little eyes, what you see. Anybody know that song? Be careful, little eyes. We won't sing it. And I won't sing it especially. But it says, Be careful, little eyes, what you see. Be careful, little eyes, what you see. For the Father up above is looking down in love, so be careful, little eyes, what you see. Now, I don't know if you can hear something in that song. But the first question I have now, see, now that I see these different leaders, What kind of father that's looking on in love do you have to be careful around in love? So you don't have to be careful around a father who's looking on in love. Understand this? Now, let me say it a different way. What if you're a six-year-old little boy and you're messing around in your father's closet? You shouldn't be there, but you are. And you should be careful, but you're not. And you're in there and you find a stack of pornography and you see something you shouldn't have been seeing. You weren't even trying to see, but you weren't careful. You saw it and you've got this God. Now if you've got this God, is this the kind of God where this little boy is going to want to run toward this God as fast as he can? Or is he going to want to head the other direction from this God? And you have to be careful around it. You see the wrong stuff. That's a historic picture of God. Some people have a Santa Claus bag, and I don't mean like cheap grace bag. I don't mean like, you know, some people kind of have this concentration on this cheap grace bag, Santa Claus, that's not what I mean. And those of you who have a concern about cheap grace, it's worse than that. If you're concerned about cheap grace, you should really be concerned, because it's worse than cheap, it's free. Understand this? So I'm talking about the Santa who, if you don't live right this year, you get lumps of coal in your stocking instead of presents. How many have that kind of Santa, by the way? Switches, you know, you're going to get bad stuff. So let me do the Christmas carol. You better watch out. You better not cry. You better not cry. I'm telling you why Jesus Christ is coming again. He's making a list, checking it twice. You're going to find out who's going to be nice. He sees you when you're sleeping. He knows when you're awake. He knows if you do better, good. So, he puts you in the city. Why? Because he's coming and you could be in for it. Number two, preoccupied with spiritual performance. Basically what this is about is this is about the reason you get preoccupied with spiritual performance is because love and acceptance, God's and ours, it's earned. It's held out like a bait. I don't have time to get into this whole thing about like spiritually abusive places are traps, are spiritual traps, and the bait is this. There's lots of baits to it, but this. So because we need this, we're baited to try to get it by performing. I don't know how many of you have gone to Bill Gothard, but it is impossible to go to Bill Gothard and come away from Clean Consciousness. It's impossible because you start to, you know, what it does is it, and I don't even, I'm not even arguing with the principles, okay, which is a whole different thing, okay? I'm just talking about the idea that there's this whole big list of stuff, you know, how to do it stuff, where you should be doing stuff, what it looks like stuff. And when you do that, when you look at that, the first thing that you look at after you look at that is you. And you don't look like that, so you go home and spend the next year trying to look like that, and then when the conscience comes around again, you go back to the conscience. And if you ever get really good at it, you go to the advanced conscience. But the point is that you start living your life to clean up your conscience Instead of like what Paul says in 1 Timothy, chapter 1, the goal of our instruction, the reason I'm telling you this, is love from a pure heart and a clean conscience. Now, I'm telling you this stuff so you can live your life, so you can love others out of a clean conscience, out of a pure heart, instead of to get a clean conscience. But if you want to know where you get the pure heart and the clean conscience, you've got to look at Hebrews 10 and know that you get that from what Jesus did on the cross. You want a clean conscience and pure heart? Look at the cross. Don't try hard for the next year. It isn't even about whether you should or shouldn't be doing this stuff. Number three, a distorted picture of self. People who have been spiritually abused have had a picture of themselves mistreated. They've been told wrong about themselves. How many of you got wrapped up in the death of self, dying of self kind of teaching? Do you know that people who are wrapped up in the death of self, dying of self kind of teaching, end up getting totally gratified with themselves? In the name of being dead to self and denying themselves, they're constantly looking at themselves to see if they're dead enough yet. But that has the opposite effect that's supposed to happen. People don't know who they are in Christ. They need to find out who they are in Christ. They need to find out who he says they are. Here's a song that we sing. I'm so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. I'm so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves what? Even me. Now, that would be like, what's your name again? Darf, yeah. That would be like Darf. See, Jesus loves everybody here. And yes, he even loves you. Okay. It was a stretch. But he pulled it off because that's just the kind of guy he is. Now, you have to understand, Scripture does not say that God even loves Darf. Scripture says, God so loves God. God so loves Him. Not even loves Him. So loves Him. And that's a big reminder of how much you don't deserve God to love you, you see. And if you get reminded about how undeserving you are enough, you start feeling like you're supposed to be deserving. And, you know, if I reminded you, here's the reminder of how undeserving we are, okay? You're undeserving. So drop, forget. it ain't going to happen because of that it's all about God's gift it's about his love because he thinks it's worth a lot so quit trying to earn it quit trying to deserve it just enjoy it, receive it, live in it quit looking at yourself a couple other things people who have been spiritually abused have a hard time with grace and the reason they have a hard time with grace is because grace sounds It's too good to be true. It's because they don't believe that it's the whole message and the rest of it's coming later. Like they're getting tricked. You give them this gift of grace and instead of it landing as this incredible gift that they can just be thankful for and enjoy, it lands as a reminder of how much they don't deserve grace and so they push away. I know that you know people that do that. When you love them, it doesn't land as love. It lands as a reminder that they don't deserve you to love them. And so they say, oh, you shouldn't have done that. You know, they think if you know about me, what I know about me, it wouldn't be so nice to be in the first place. They think you must want something while you're doing this. They think it's just half a story. They find a way to give it away. You know, they'd like to give it to somebody else. They give it to somebody else. I feel uncomfortable. Hard time of grace. Difficulty with personal boundaries. If it's not okay in a spiritually abusive place, if I'm a spiritually abusive person, leader, it's not okay for you to say no. That would be a big spiritual issue. If I asked you to teach something or do something, it wouldn't be okay for you to say no. And if you know it's your boundary, And the truth is, if you don't have a no, then your yes isn't a really yes anyway. If you don't really have a no, then your yes isn't a really yes anyway. But in a spiritually abusive place, you wouldn't be allowed to have a no. Or if you did, I'd kick it down. And so when I see people that struggle with boundaries and kinds of things like that, I'm thinking to myself, where are those boundaries? Boundaries get knocked down. A lot of times it's a spiritually abusive place. You're not allowed to have an opinion. You're not allowed to disagree. You're not allowed to say, this is where you stopped. And I start, think about this, think about the person that's spiritually abused you. And think about standing in front of them back when that happened. And being able to say, this is where you stop, and I start, and you don't get to come in here unless I say something. I mean, can you imagine what that would have been like? How hard that would have been? And what you would have gotten received if you had done that. So you're not allowed to have this. You're just supposed to be wide open. So there's other things. One last thing. Or two last things. Difficulty admitting the abuse because it feels like you're breaking some kind of loyalty or trust. Or even if you say it out loud, you're in this world of God. Like God's reputation somehow depends on how well you can be disreputed about what happens in the churches. And the last one would be having a hard time with trust. Trusting again. Mark Twain said a cat that sits on a hot stove lid won't ever sit on a hot stove lid again. But it might not even sit on a cold stove again. And I see people who are now in safe places but they're still having big boundaries now. and still kept fighting and still afraid to trust, I'm saying to myself, where did they work? They don't need this boundary now, and now they have it. That's what's going on. So anyway, these are just some of the signals that when I see them, I'm thinking, I'm starting to ask myself the why question. And a lot of times, the why leads to people in this church. David, I cover this a lot more thoroughly than I've seen before.
