Now when my wife asks me if I talk about kittens again, I can say no. I want to make a little announcement here. On December 6th, we're open door live. I will be singing a country western set. It's already arranged. The funny part about this story is that after it was all arranged with Mark Johnson and stuff, he ran into my daughter, Jessie, at the church picnic and they were talking about it and he kind of took her aside and said, can your dad sing? I mean he already made the arrangements so Jesse told me about this scene I went up to Mark and I said you know Mark it doesn't matter if I can sing I mean they're going to come anyway just to see this I mean you can start seeing dollar signs here I mean this is anyway it's true James 1.18 In the exercise of his will he brought us forth by the word of truth so that we might be as it were first fruits among his creation. Let's pray. Lord, thanks that you love us so much. Once again, I pray that your spirit would be here. I pray that you would open our minds to the truth of this, not just the truth of it, but how big the truth is and what it means for us as we leave here and seek to live lives that are pleasing to you. And I ask this in Jesus' name. Amen. We've been talking about sin and blame for about six weeks now with an understanding that blame really is just a form of hiding. Last week I talked about the reasons we hide from God when we stumble. Fear, because we have a picture of God that He might not be safe to go toward after we sin, shame about ourselves, which is a negative assessment of yourself or negative judgment about yourself, versus guilt, which is a negative assessment about behavior. And God intervenes on this whole process by being a loving, safe, and eager to forgive God whom we can go toward when we sin instead of hiding. Jesus intervenes by getting to the Father first and interceding for us. And in fact, last week I talked about the fact that he lives for this. He lives to make intercession for us. And I have a funny story about that too. You know, I remember when I was doing that sermon, I talked about that Jesus lives for that. It's what he lives for. And I used Dave Johnson as an illustration as someone who lives for something. And I talked about he lives for the Cubs. He really likes the Cubs, all that stuff. Remember that part? Well, I'm at a gas station on Wednesday night, and Dave Johnson pulls up and he's putting gas in his car. He says, come here, I've got to tell you something. And I said, what? He says, I've got to thank you. I said, well, why? He said, well, after your sermon, I don't know if it was Sunday or Monday, someone called up and gave him tickets to the Cubs game, second row behind home plate. So he was there on Friday watching the Cubs. So anyway, I really like the Bears. Well, in fact, I love the bears. I was going to try to do that with a straight face. I just couldn't do it. Okay. Well, this week, I want to talk about what God has done to intervene on sin, shame, and blame ahead of time. Remember 1 John 2.1 from last week says, I'm writing these things so that you may not sin. I'm giving you this package so you may not sin, so that it would be possible for you to not sin ahead of time. And if you do sin, though, then we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous. But the reason I'm writing this is so that you may not sin. It all begins with a little phrase in today's text. And once again, the text is this. In the exercise of his will he brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we may be, as it were, firstfruits among his creation. The phrase is, in the exercise of his will. In the exercise of his will. Why is it important to understand the significance of God's will? Well, first, as we saw last week, his will is what makes us who we are. Firstfruits. His will, through his will, by exercising his will, he brought us forth, gave birth to us as his first fruits, the choicest part of the harvest. But there's a second reason, and it can be seen in Colossians 1, 9 through 12. And what that says is, For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you, and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will. I'm praying this to ask that God may fill you up with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, So that you may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work. See, I used to hate this verse, this text, because those things there always seemed like kind of a checklist that I could never do good enough. I could never do it well enough. You know, I would go, you're supposed to know God's will. I don't know what that is. You know, I still have to figure that part out. So that you may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord. Well, I'm not really doing that well, or I haven't this week anyway. To please Him in all respects. In all respects, I didn't do that. Bearing fruit in every good work. Well, I'm not doing that. Increasing in the knowledge of God. Oh, I didn't read my Bible enough. Strengthen with all power. I don't have a clue what that means. See, it was like this checklist of behaviors I was supposed to do. And so I could feel better. And so I could think God felt better about me if I could just check these off. The punchline is coming. I never got to the punchline because I was too tired by that time. It says, Strengthen with all power according to his glorious might for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience. Here's the punchline. Joycely giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us. Joycely giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us. It's the Father who has qualified us. So we don't have to do those things to qualify anymore. He has qualified us. But are those things issues? Yes, they're issues. Where do they come from? This verse says, so that you may be filled up with the knowledge of God's will in order that you may do these things. And so where this comes from, it's very simple in this text, if you know God's will, you will do God's will. That's where doing God's will comes from. That's where doing fruit comes from. That's where doing pleasing Him comes from. In this text. There is something in knowing and understanding God's will that enables us, that empowers us to live rightly, to hit the mark, to not sin. Now, God's will is a phrase that strikes a chord of tiredness, confusion, and even terror in some of the hearts of believers. Because it's a scary, heavy thing for a lot of people. One day I asked a friend of mine if he would be willing to do a word association exercise with me. And he said, sure. And I said, God's will. God's will. He said, here's some of his responses. Missing it. One perfect plan. Unsure. Heavy. being out of it getting disciplined. Notice he didn't define God's will. What he did more is use descriptions of how he feels in response or in relationship to God's will. For a lot of Christians, God's will is a heavy thing. His divine to-do list, something to figure out, something we better figure out because if we don't figure it out, we can't do it. And if we don't do it, we could be out of it. And you don't want to be out of it. that's a scary place to be out of God's will or you could be kind of languishing in God's permissive will instead of his perfect will. In other words, you're off now on plan B or C or D or Z or whatever instead of plan A and you want to be on plan A. Well, first of all, nowhere does Paul use the phrase out of God's will. I mean, I look for that. I looked in every combination of words I could to see if there was a description of believers who were out of the will of God. I couldn't find that. It might be there, but I couldn't find it. Only once is the phrase God's perfect will, that concept of God's perfect will used, and I'll explain that a little later. Let's look at this divine to-do list approach to God's will a little bit here first. Have you ever struggled with wondering if you were in the will of God? For a lot of people, this is the cause of such anxiety that they use all kinds of methods to try and figure out what God's will is so they could be in it. One method is the fleece. I call it the fleece method. Lord, if you want me to do such and such, make such and such happen. Actually, this concept of fleeces is found in Judges 6. God told Gideon to go beat up the Midianites. Gideon was afraid and reluctant because they looked really scary and he didn't feel too big. So he laid out a piece of wool and asked God to do a miraculous sign. And the sign was to let Gideon know that God was really God. It was really God who was telling him this. And God was really serious about what he was telling him. So the ground was supposed to be wet. And the fleece was supposed to be dry. And then Gideon would know. Now this comes out in several versions today. If the money comes in for what we're planning, it must be God's will. If there's no resistance, no hang-ups, if God doesn't close doors, then it must be God's will. If enough people confirm or disagree with what I already suspected in the first place, then it must be or must not be God's will. If someone recommends a plan out of the blue, if I'm just trying to figure something out and somebody walks out out of the blue and says something that sounds like what I've been thinking about, then it must be God's will. If I have a dream, it must be God's will. I mean, the list goes on and on. I'm trying to figure this out. But see, if you've got to do it, you've got to figure it out. I have a couple questions at this point. First of all, did Gideon lay out the fleece because he wanted to find out what God's will was? No. He already knew what God's will was. God said, go beat up the Midianites. In fact, God told him three times. Judges 6.14, Judges 6.36, Judges 6.39. Every time, Gideon believed God and then he changed his mind. Was the fleece an example of Gideon's faith? No. It showed his lack of faith. See, if Gideon would have believed God in the first place, there wouldn't be any story about fleeces in the Bible. Understand that? Plus, he did it twice. Okay, God, so I know it's really you, and so I know that what you're saying is really what you want me to do. I'm going to put a piece of fleece on the ground. If the ground is wet, the fleece is dry, then I'll know that you really mean what you say. Gideon wakes up in the morning, the ground is wet, the fleece is dry. Gideon says, okay, two out of three. This time, if the ground is dry and the fleece is wet, then I'll know for sure. See, I think that Gideon did the fleece the second time, either because he still didn't believe God, or he didn't like the answer he got. Like flipping coins, you know. I don't know whether I should go here or go here or go here or stay home. I'll flip a coin. But see, you kind of really want to go. So you flip a coin. Heads. Heads, I'm going. Comes up tails. Two out of three. Flip it again. Five out of nine. Seven out of... You know, just go. Just go. Deal with God later. If you shouldn't have gone, you'll find out. See, okay, look. I think a lot of people, myself included, do fleeces not to discover if they are in God's plan, but if God is in their plan. Let me draw you a picture to illustrate a couple of views of God's will. One is the multiple choice staying in God's perfect will plan, and it looks like this. Here's God's will. Here's God's will. Here I am, and I want to be in it about a certain thing. So what God does, you know he doesn't just tell me he kind of does this multiple choice test and the x's represent his perfect will and then the ones the little lines there the eyes they represent god's permissive will see so i'm really not in god's perfect will if i'm doing these ones here but i'm not as in big a trouble as if i wasn't in this whole thing in the first place okay so what i have to do is i have to kind of connect the dots here and and follow all the signals and when i follow all the signals then finally i get to god's will then i can do it and when i do it i'm not in trouble if you go over here you see and maybe even go over here then you're in god's permissive will so you're in a little bit of trouble but not a lot but then you got to work your way find your way back here and it just takes longer than if you just would have done what he said in the first place that's one view the other view is kind of like a river and here's god's will over here. Here's Jeff over here. And then there are these stones like rocks in the river. And what I have to do to find God's will and do God's will is I've got to find those stones in the river, see? And then step on them. So I find this one, I step on that one, that's cool. And then I step on this one and it turns out to be a turtle. So I'm in the river now, plus it's taking me down here. So now, to get back in the plan, I've got to swim upstream and get back here, so I can get back here and finally get to God's will. Very common ways that people look at God's will. But there's a different way to look at it, actually quite a common way to think about the word will. The word will in the Greek is thelema, and without a context. If you just take that word, pull it out, put it here, no context. What it means is wants, desires, the way someone wants it to be, what they wish, what they prefer, those kinds of things. And when you add it to God, God's will, God's wants, God's desires, God's wishing the way it was, then it kind of does imply a to-do list that you have to figure out so you can do it. But, as members of God's family, we are heirs according to His will. now see how many of you have a will anybody have a will you know like where you wrote out you know all the stuff you have and who's going to get it if you die who's got that got a will see and how many of you have heirs according to your will see and unless you name if you don't name these people in the will they aren't heirs according to your will they could even be family members but they're not heirs according to your will let's try to see God's will like that today for a minute like you know if we can see it like God's will his divine will in which he named his heirs and dispensed the inheritance it will not only put the whole thing in a different light it'll confront a lot of the ways we think about God's will. And rather than some divine to-do list, really it's God's last will and testament that lets us know what is ours because we belong to Him. I'm going to give you a Greek lesson now. And I found this text in Ephesians 1. I've read it my whole life. But I noticed something in this text that put Ephesians 1 in a different kind of light for me. And Ephesians 1 is mostly about God's will. So let me show you what I mean. Blessed be the Father, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places. The word translated blessed from the Greek word eulogeo means to speak well of, prosper, or empower. It is the word from which we get our English word, eulogy. Eulogy. Now the eulogy is part of the funeral service when people stand up and speak well of their dearly departed uncle, who they remember as a kid was really nice to them and gave them chocolate chip cookies and stuck up for them and kind of enabled them to get out of what mom and dad were saying and that kind of stuff. Or maybe the mom who sacrificed like crazy so the kids could have an education. You know, when you get up and eulogize this person, you speak well of them. Well, see, I think that Ephesians 1 is Paul's eulogy of the dead person, Jesus Christ. Let me read you that text. Blessed be the God and Father, our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons, through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace, which He lavished upon us. In all wisdom and insight, He made known to us the mystery of His will. He made known to us His will. There isn't anything to figure out about God's will in this passage. He made it known. He made known to us the mystery of his will according to the kind intention which he purposed in him with a view to an administration suitable to the fullest of the times, that is, the summing up of all things in Christ, things in heaven, things upon earth. In him also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to his purpose, who works all things after the counsel of his will, to the end that we who are the first to hope in Christ should be to the praise of His glory. In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation, having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise who was given as a pledge of our inheritance. Now, remember, out of context, eulogy just means to speak well of. So I could go to lunch with you and eulogize you over lunch, meaning speak well of you. Understand? If you had a need, if I had the resources to help you with that, by giving you the resources, I would be prospering and empowering you. So that's a eulogy, a blessing kind of thing, you see, if you take it out of context. But if you put it in the context now of Ephesians 1, what it looks like is that Christ's death has given Paul an opportunity to tell of the wonderful ways God's heirs have benefited because of their relationship with the person who died. So, what about this will? Paul tells us in Ephesians 1 that God chose us first before the foundation of the world. The verse goes on to say, He did this that we should be holy and blameless. Now, I always had a problem with this verse too because I understood this verse like this. He chose us before the foundation of the world so we better be holy and blameless. But that's not what it says. It says, his choosing then makes us now be holy and blameless. See, it's his choosing us rather than our behavior that makes us holy and blameless before him. Now, in your will, in my will, there are certain terms that have to be satisfied. In other words, you have to carry it out a certain way. That's what wills are like. God predestined us to adoption into his family according to the kind intention of his will. In this context, we get a picture of God, who is the owner and creator of the universe, sitting down, decreeing, before time began, that he wanted everyone, whoever was, to be part of his family according to the purpose of his will. The Greek word eudokeia translated the kind intention of his will, also means satisfaction. The satisfaction of the will. See, when the will is satisfied is when everything in the will that the person wanted to happen has happened. In this context, we see how God is pleased, how His will is satisfied, and it's not when we figure out what music we're supposed to listen to, and it's not when we figure out what school we're supposed to attend, and it's not when we figure out who we're supposed to marry. It's when we become his heirs. Because you see, a will is pretty useless if there are no heirs. He didn't call us his heirs. He made us his heirs. He created us as his heirs. Next thing Paul tells us are the benefits that we have as heirs that we receive from the will. The first thing is charis, grace. That is divine acceptance, Favor, benefit, pleasure, grace. It is freely bestowed on us, and by it we are made highly favored. He made us highly favored. In addition, because of Jesus, we have deliverance or full payment. All I'm doing is skipping the Greek words, giving you all the English about those words. We have deliverance or full payment, and freedom and pardon from our sins. Not our hamartia sins, missing the mark sins, our periptoma sins, unintentional errors, and willful offenses. In this text, it's talking about the fact that we have deliverance, full payment, freedom, and pardon from the things we did on purpose that were wrong, and the things we did by accident because we weren't paying attention. All of those things. All of this is according to the abundance, richness of His grace, which He superabounded, gave in excess, so much that there was grace to spare. Now look carefully at the next thing that Paul reveals. Still in Ephesians 1. In wisdom and insight, he made known to us the mystery of his will. Made known is a word that means to cause to know or give understanding. Our knowing or understanding God's will is something that God himself brings about and he has brought it about. Making known his will satisfies his will. The next part of the verse says that he did this according to his satisfaction, which he determined ahead of time in Christ. Jesus' death on the cross is what makes all the resources in God's will available to his heirs. But with any will, there must be someone who administrates the will. That's why Paul then says that God did this for an administration suitable to the fullness of time. The Greek word for administration is oikonomia. It is our English word economy. And what it means is administrating or dispensing the household goods. And this is the function of the trustee or the executor at the meeting where you do the will. Understand? When you do the will, a person called the trustee or executor is there to make sure that the will is dispensed just the way the one who made the will wants it to be dispensed. That's Jesus. he also goes on to say that God is always working all things according to the counsel or advice of his will in other words God is bound by his own will any and all the work that God ever does is simply a matter of him following the instructions he decreed ahead of time two more words and then we'll quit the Greek lesson Paul says in him you also after listening to the message the gospel of your salvation have believed you were sealed. One point in time, completed action, with the Holy Spirit of promise. The kind of sealing that Paul is talking about here is when a person mailed a letter and dripped wax on it and took a ring and sealed it closed. When a king wanted to send an important letter, he would drip hot wax on the opening and press his signet on it, his personalized identifying mark, into the wax to seal it shut. The royal seal with which we have been marked and sealed is God's own spirit, who is given as an Erebon, a pledge, down payment, valuable commodity given in advance as a security for the rest of our inheritance. Okay, here's the summary. God determined, willed, ahead of time, that we should receive it, what we should receive as his heirs, how we should receive it, when we should receive it, then the one who made the will died, the executor of the will dispensed the inheritance to us, the Holy Spirit sealed the transaction. If you are an heir, now listen, if you are an heir, you are in God's will. And you have at your disposal everything that that will provides. Now, so you can see that I'm not stretching the meaning of the word will here. I just want to show you one more thing. Hebrews 9. Hebrews 9 talks about the old covenant and the new covenant. The old covenant was the covenant that God had with the people in the Old Testament. It's the law. The new covenant is what Jesus brought. Brang. Jesus brang. Practicing for my country western set. Hebrews 9.1. Now even the first covenant had regulations of divine worship. Even the first covenant had terms. And it goes back and forth. First, second, first, second covenant. And then it says in verse 16 of Hebrews 9, For where a covenant is, that word covenant is will and testament. For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it. For a covenant is valid only when men are dead. It's never in force while the one who made it lives. I have a will in my will. My heirs are named. they get everything, but they don't get anything. While I'm alive, it only is enforced when I die. But then it is enforced. Verse after verse, but then we get to chapter 10, verse 1. The law, since it is only a shadow of the good things to come, but not the reality itself, you see. Old covenant, new covenant. First covenant, second covenant. Verse 7, then I said, behold, I have come to do thy will, O God. Now, when Jesus says, I've come to do thy will, it doesn't mean he came to check the stuff off the list, like somehow he's got to measure up to the list. It means he came to execute the will. After saying above, sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast not desired, nor hast thou taken pleasure in them. He then said, Behold, I have come to do thy will, and here's his will, to take away the first and replace it with the second. In order to take away the first and establish the second. And then it says, by this will. By this second will. By this will what? Well, last week we talked about James 1.18. By this will, we were created to be first fruits. By this will, what else? Verse 10. By this will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. Old covenant, sins are covered over. New covenant, sinners are made holy. Do you understand the difference between this? Old covenant, high priest makes the sacrifice time after time after time. New covenant, it's a one-time deal. It's finished. you know that's another way that we're the first fruits God never did that with anybody until they were Christians we're the first people that God cleansed from our sins didn't just cover over our sins how else verse 15 the Holy Spirit also bears witness with us for after saying this is the covenant I will make with them after those days says the Lord I will put my laws on their heart. Old covenant. Laws are on a piece of stone. Laws are written in a book. New covenant. Laws are in our hearts. And on our minds I will write them. We're the first people God did that with. We're his first fruits when it comes to putting laws on the inside. What else did he do? Ezekiel 36, 24. I'll take you from the nations. This is what he's going to do and what he did when Jesus came. I'll take you from the nations. Gather you from all lands. Bring you into your own land. I will sprinkle clean water on you. You will be clean. Old covenant. Covered so God can't see the dirt. New covenant. Clean. You will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from your idols. I'll give you a new heart. New covenant. First ones he did that with. I'll put a new spirit within you. I will remove the heart of stone from you. And give you a heart of flesh. A soft heart. Listen. And I will put my spirit in you. I'll put my spirit in you. Old covenant, spirit shows up when you need him to. New covenant, inside. Now let's look at Colossians 1, 9. For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you and ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will. Do you understand that this isn't Paul asking that they'd be able to figure out all the little nuts and bolts of what God wants them to do every day so they can feel like they're doing what God desires? He's saying, and he says this at the end of Ephesians 1, he's saying, I pray that you get how big this is, and you get what you have, you understand what is yours, what it means that you're an heir, so that you may, in order that, you may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work, increasing in the knowledge of God. Ephesians 4.1, Therefore I, Paul, beg you to walk in a manner worthy of your calling. All Paul is doing in these texts is asking believers, begging us, actually, To live consistent with what we have. But you can't live consistent with what you have if you don't know what you have. Now comes that perfect will text. This is Romans 12, verse 1 and 2. I urge you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, not by trying hard, by the mercies of God to present to your bodies a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. The word translated spiritual is not spiritual. It's rational, reasonable service of worship. And what Paul is saying here is the only thing that makes sense, the only thing that's reasonable and rational for you to do, someone who is as living as you are, someone who is as acceptable as you are, someone who is as holy as you are, because he made you holy, is to present your bodies that way. To live that way is the only thing that makes sense. And then he says, don't be conformed to this world, but be transformed by renewing of your mind, that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect. That you may prove, do this, to prove God's will. Now, one of the things that that word means is approve of God's will. So it could mean do this as your way of saying yes to God's will. And once again, you could get the to-do list interpretation out of that, you know, because here's God's list, all the things that are in his will for us to do today. And when you do it, you're saying yes to that. But the other thing that that word means, which is what I think it means, is to put to the test. When you prove something, what you're doing is you're testing it to see if it has the qualities it says it has. You know, God is saying, live this way, because living this way, by living this way, you will be putting me in the place where I have to deliver what I promised. And that's okay with me. Okay, a lot of theology. Greek. let's do a little bit more practical thing okay we have all of God's grace we have more grace than we need we have grace in excess his laws are written on our hearts and in our minds we have a new heart we're new creations we have a spirit living in us and we need to obey God from the heart anything else but obeying God from the heart is hypocrisy. But I need to make a confrontation here. One of the ways that what I just said is abused, one of the ways that some of the things we say here at Open Door gets abused, gets misunderstood or kind of a twist on it, is with the idea that what we are saying, what Dave says, what the church kind of says, is that if you don't feel like doing it, it wouldn't be real to do it, so don't do it. Being real is the most important thing. For instance, God says be kind, but I don't feel like being kind, so being kind wouldn't be real. I'd be a hypocrite if I was kind, so I don't have to be kind until it's real for me to be kind. That's kind of how that goes. I hear that all the time. Let me clarify something here. Don't interchange or equate the phrases, I don't feel like doing something when I don' want to do it.I don't find a picture of a believer in scripture that doesn't want to do what God wants. There is no description of a person in here who loves the Lord, who belongs to Jesus, who has a new heart. There is no description of a person who doesn't want what God wants. There's a person who wants what God wants but doesn't do it sometimes. There's a picture of a person who doesn't want to go to the bad thing but does it sometimes. There's a person who joyfully concurs with the law of God in the inner man, but it comes out different out here sometimes. But there is no picture of a believer who doesn't want what God wants. If you truly don't want what God wants, if you really don't want to obey, that's not about not feeling like obeying. You don't want. That's not your desire. And then the problem is with your heart. It's not with your behavior. And obedience at that point, meaning following the list now, cranking out the right thing because it's on the list, at that point would be empty hypocrisy, and it would be worse than hypocrisy because it would make you look like you didn't have the heart problem you did have, which is what happened to the Pharisees. I was talking to a friend this week who was involved in a ministry here at the church. And he said, you know, I'm doing this ministry. I've been doing it for a few years. I'm involved in this ministry. And frankly, I'd rather not be doing it. In other words, he's saying he doesn't want to do it. And I said, wait a minute. You don't want to do it? Is it that you don't want to do it? Or is it that you want to do it? But sometimes it's inconvenient to do it. Sometimes you feel sad that you're doing it instead of fishing with your kids. Sometimes you wonder if it does any good to do it. In other words, sometimes you don't feel like doing the thing that you really want to do. Is that what it is? He said, yeah, that's what it is. I want to do it. I want to do it. But sometimes I don't feel like it. It's like waking up in the morning, Monday morning, and you don't feel like going to work. See, if you told me that, I don't feel like going to work, I'd say, does that mean that it's hard for you to go on Monday morning? Are you telling me you don't want a job? I said, let me ask you one more question. Would your heart let you get away with quitting this ministry? Would your heart let you get away with quitting this ministry? He said, no. He said, I do the right thing even when I don't feel like it because I love God, it's the right thing, and I want to do it. You understand, when it comes to a ministry like this, or now let's go back into the context of the sin cycle. People don't sin because they don't know the rules. You know, what's going to prevent people from sinning is not somebody standing up in the pulpit and telling them one more time what the good list is and what the bad list is. That's not what it's about. And you understand that when it comes to sinning, what Scripture says is, the flesh might let you get away with it, but your heart won't let you get away with it. And if you can't live in the flesh consistent with your heart, then get help. Then get some help. then get in a process with people that can help you do that. See, the Christian life, obedience, living rightly, is a matter of living or perhaps learning to live consistent with what God has written on our hearts, consistent with who we are as his children, consistent with what we have as his heirs. Now here's a couple of practical examples of that, and then we'll close. I know a woman she got divorced after 20 years she was in an abusive relationship her husband was very controlling got punished for having friends so she didn't have any she got punished for wanting to go to school so she didn't go to school her life revolved around this person she didn't have any contacts out here he disappears she doesn't have a life she doesn't know what to do she wants to go to school she needs to get training she needs to make a living so she goes down and files for unemployment because she can't do this training and work the way she needs to in order to make ends meet so she goes down and files for unemployment problem is she and her husband own a million dollar business the bigger problem is she gets nothing from the business all the money is in the business she gets nothing She doesn't even get child support payments on time. She's locked out. And she's afraid because if she tells the truth at her interview about this million-dollar business, she could not get unemployment, which she really needs. What's God's will in this? God's will is tell the truth. Right? She knows the rules. Tell the truth. She maybe even could have pulled off not telling the truth and gone home, and her heart would not have let her get away with it, even though her flesh did. You understand this? So you know what she did? She trusted God. She trusted God. She believed that what God said was hers, was hers. She believed Philippians 4.19. My God shall supply all your needs according to his riches and glory. She believed that. Okay, she remembered the will of God. You understand what I mean when I say that now? She knew the will of God. And because she knew the will of God, she was able to do the will of God and tell the truth, even if it didn't come through, you see. Because either God supplies her needs by giving her employment, or he supplies it a different way. knowing the will of God is what enabled her to do the will of God pick your favorite sin and what I mean by that is the one you have a problem with on a regular basis the one that draws you the strongest the one that you struggle with the one you keep going back to why do people sin? people don't sin because they don't know the rules people sin because they trust something to meet their needs that can't meet their needs and when they do that it misses the mark God's will is to not do that sin if you have a to-do list kind of thing don't do that sin where you already knew God's will and you already keep going back to it as far as that goes but you know what that sin, whatever that is however strong that is, can't give you anything that you don't already have available as an heir in the will of God, you see. And in fact, that sin can't give you anything. Whatever you're thinking of right now, if you remember, instead of having euphoric recall, which is kind of like always remembering just the good stuff that happens, if you remember the whole thing, what you remember is your flesh might let you get away with it, but your heart doesn't. Why is that? Because God wrote his laws in our hearts. If you want to do the will of God in that area of your life, you need to know the will of God, which says you already have a God who promises to meet that need. And maybe you can't see that right now, but that's what it says, what he says. He promises to do it. He will do it. He's faithful and powerful to do it. If you're locked up and stuck in some kind of addictive kind of sin, you see, get help. The resources are there to get help for that. And as a matter of fact, if you have shame about that, God intervened last week and said it's okay to say it because you don't lose points with God. He's okay to go toward. Jesus got there first. One more illustration, and we'll close. Now, don't build a big theology around this, okay? I mean, don't... This is just my picture, just the way that I see it, okay? So don't be, you know, like... I can't find it in here, okay? I mean, it's just mine. See, I like the river picture here, too. and the river is being in God's will. This is the ocean and this is eternity. And this is God's will, the river, and it's headed that way. Here I am. I'm a non-believer. I'm not an heir. I'm not a child of God. And in being one who isn't God's child, I am out of God's will. This is the only person that's out of God's will. When I become a believer, I'm in the river. Now, and here's where I'm going. I can swim against the river like that. That would be like disobeying. It would be like fighting God. And however good I am at fighting Him, I'm going here. And when I get here, I'm going to be really tired. I could swim with the river. In which case, I'm going to get some places sooner than I was supposed to be there. Okay, how that works is this. See, here's this garden that God planted by the edge of the river because he just loves me and knows I like gardens and stuff. And here I am trying to do God's will, figure it all out, do it, you know, driven, you know, to do this. And I'm swimming as fast as I can. And here's this garden. I don't even see it. He did it for me. I missed it. You know, our will to do God's will is not the same as God's will. Here's a little litter of kitties. these are older than our kitties our kitties when they're little their ears are down here and then as they get older they move up their head like that or something I really like kitties you know but I'm so busy so driven trying to do all this right that I miss them here's a fish you know and God knows that I need food so he puts fish in the way but the problem is I'm so busy trying to make this happen and do it right that I get to the place the fish is going to be before God puts the fish there okay here's a muskrat and his foot, his paw is caught in a trap and I have an opportunity to do muskrat ministry here but I'm so busy swimming as fast as I can trying to do it right and so driven to get it just so that I get to the place where the muskrat is trapped before the muskrat even is trapped and miss an opportunity that God had for me. See, I think God's will is more about resting in his will, kind of like in the sinner tube. And floating down the river and enjoying the scenery and being thankful to God that he loves me so much he puts a garden there for me to see and kittens for me to enjoy and a fish. You know, I get to that place where that fish is right at the same time God puts that fish there because He promises to, you know. And I get to that muskrat just in time, you know, so I can do the ministry that He wants me to do because there's lots of... And when I do that, I see that muskrat there and I open up the trap. I'm happy. You know why? Because I care about helping. It's what I desire. I care about what's right. and God provides all these things for me see I think it's more like this Philippians 2.13 for it is God who is at work in you both to will and to do his good pleasure for it is God who is at work in you both to will and to do and to work for his good pleasure so this week as you're trying to figure out God's will and you want to do God's will you know specifically all those kinds of things spend at least as much time enjoying his will enjoying your inheritance fight as opportunities come to rely on things that promise to meet needs that can't meet needs fight to remember what you have as an heir who you have as a father who you are as a child and what is yours because if you can remember that and know that, you won't do this. Scripture says in 1 John 3.6, no one who abides in him sins. Wow. See, no one who is presently abiding in him is presently sinning. It's impossible to rest in Jesus, what he has for us, what he says about us. Believe that, accept that. It's impossible to do that and do something over here that misses the mark both at the same time. It can't be done. It says, no one who abides in him sins. What's the secret to not sinning? Abide. And we have a lot to abide in. Let's pray. Lord, thank you that you love us so much. Thank you for what you've given us. I pray not only that you would enable us to understand and let this in, but that you would give us people in our lives who could remind us of this. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
