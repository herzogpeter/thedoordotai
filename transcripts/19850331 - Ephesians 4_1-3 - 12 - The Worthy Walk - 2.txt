Ephesians chapter 4 verse 1, the first three verses. This is our third week in these three verses, and let's continue. I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, entreat you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you've been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing forbearance to one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, again, as we open your word, we sense its power. We have seen it over and over and over again. Its ability to move in and touch and change and revolutionize our lives. It is truth and it is alive. And Father, I pray that your spirit would be our teacher and that, Lord Jesus, we would be receptive and submissive students as you teach us. In Jesus' name, amen. It has been interesting to me to discover that when Paul says, walk worthy, here's how, he has not, in the beginning of this study, talked about a work or a deed or something that I do. Instead, he has begun by saying, walk worthy, here's how, an attitude. He's been talking about attitudes. We have been learning these past few weeks that the bottom line on walking a worthy walk is not so much what I do as who I am. it's not so much what I do as who I am you see there are plenty of people who can do the deed there are plenty of people who can do that who can go to church who can get involved who can help out and all those things are nice who can teach a class who can serve on the board who can give their money they can do the deed and never be the person and the problem with that is that the word of God very clearly calls that hypocrisy you see it is possible to have what i would call action fruit action fruit the fruit of the lips praise to come to church and get a tear in my eye because we're talking about the lord and i picture him on a cross and i can get involved in that and i can really i can lift up my hands and i can sing the songs and i can really enjoy it and leave with a good feeling and never change the fruit of giving i can give my money the fruit of good works i can do a lot of good things i can even in some instances the fruit of leading someone to the lord is that possible yeah the fruit the the action fruit i believe that it's possible for us to do the deed to have a lot of action fruit without attitude fruit, however. Action fruit without attitude fruit. And the fruit that we're talking about in terms of attitude fruit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, on and on and on. Action fruit without attitude fruit is hypocrisy and it leads to legalism. The Pharisees did the deeds. The Pharisees kept the law and they had a lousy attitude. But if that attitude fruit is their first love, joy, peace, humility, hear, gentleness, patience, that is going to produce action fruit. And that, my friend, is true spirituality. We all need to know, and it needs to be driven into our hearts, that we can do the deeds, we can do all the deeds, we can go to church, we can give the money, we can serve on the board. But if in our homes and in our jobs we do not demonstrate those internal graces, not only do we fail to have what we would consider a good testimony, even though we're doing the deed, not only do we fail to have that testimony that we think we have, we, in fact, become a rebuke and scorn is brought upon us, and even the name of the Lord, because if those internal qualities are not there, if humility and gentleness and patience, showing forbearance to one another, if those things are not the things being manifest through you, I don't care what you do, you're going to be telegraphing to the entire world that basically what we are are hypocrites. Because it isn't affecting my heart. The biblical issue is not what we do apart from who we are. The biblical issue is that who I am is going to affect what I do. But it starts with who I am. It starts with the attitude. And so it is that when Paul says, walk worthy, that exhortation is followed immediately by the attitudes that make that worthy walk possible. Let's look at the text. The past couple of weeks, we've seen that this text breaks down into two basic parts. First of all, the call to the worthy walk, and secondly, the characteristics of the worthy walk. The call to the worthy walk. For three chapters, we have been talking about the high and exalted and lofty position of the believers. You've been chosen in him before the foundation of the world to stand before him holy and blameless. You have been forgiven. You have been redeemed, bought out of the marketplace. You have an inheritance. You've been sealed with the Holy Spirit. You can be filled with all the fullness of God, and God wants to do in you and in me, exceeding abundantly beyond all that we could ask or think. A high, exalted position. And now Paul comes down and says, I beg you, I entreat you, that you would walk in a manner that is worthy of that high, exalted position. The word worthy, you remember, comes from a word whose root in the Greek means to equalize the scales. I would like your manner of living, your everyday life, to be equal with that high and lofty position. Make your practice parallel with your position. The question we had to ask is how. That's a very intimidating kind of thing. You know, walk worthy. And so I go, okay, I better try. And again, we come up with all sorts of little things that I do that are going to demonstrate to you that I'm walking worthy. then we got into the characteristics that's the answer to the question how do i walk the worthy walk let's look at the characteristics of the worthy walk in verses two and three and that's where we got introduced to the strange kind of paradox because paul is saying to us you believers who are so high and so exalted and so lofty you know how you're gonna walk worthy balance the scales of that high exalted position stick out your chest hold your head high call yourself a king's kid. Ah, no. You're going to walk in all humility. You're going to walk in all humility. First Peter 5 says, humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, and he will exalt you. Worthy walk. Worthy walk. The best example that we could possibly find of that was Jesus himself, and we discussed that. Who, although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped. He didn't take it for himself, but he humbled himself, and the result of that was there. God therefore also exalted him and gave him a name which is above every name, that at the feet of Jesus every knee should bow and every tongue confess. But not only that, he lived a lifestyle of humility, and that was the example. That was the thing I could look at. It's hard for me to relate to God becoming man and being moved, but I can relate to a lifestyle that I see, and that's what he had. And then he said, if you abide in me, you ought to walk even as I walked. The bottom line of a worthy walk is walking in all humility, and we talked about the fact whether we like it or not. There's no way I can walk worthy of that exalted position without humility, no way. The second paradox is the one we're going to introduce you to today, the second characteristic, and again it is a paradox. This second characteristic that enables me to walk a worthy walk is meekness. Meekness, gentleness is the way the New American Standard translates it. Literally, it's meekness. Oh, boy. Remember when we discussed humility? And we had to be honest with ourselves and think of all the things that, you know, I connect with humility. Humble, to be humbled. It's embarrassing. It's downgrading. I have the same exact problem with meekness. When I think of meekness, I think of something weak. I just do. When I think of something meek, I think of something that's helpless and defenseless, wouldn't ever win anything, absolutely ignoble, wimpy. That's all there is to it. That's what I think of when I think of meek. The problem is, and this passage is a problem for me, and it is for you. Because while my mind registers wimpy, ignoble, weak, here it's telling me, David, if you want to walk worthy of that exalted position, you're going to have to walk in meekness. You can't walk worthy without it. Jesus was an example of it, and he's told us to adopt it. So what do I do? Maybe I need to find out, what is it? We're going to do that today. A definition of meekness. Now, I want you, I've got to grab you. I want to grab you by the spiritual collars this morning and bring you in close and exhort you to pull up, gird up the loins of your mind this morning and think with me. I want you to follow me. I want you to fight with me a little bit on this concept of meekness and how and where and when it needs to be appropriated in my life and in yours. Meekness comes from the Greek word prautes, basically means what we would think it would mean, mild, gentle, tender-hearted. The opposite of vengeful, in fact, in some dictionaries it would be defined that way. The opposite of vengeful, the opposite of vindictive. It is not retaliatory. It is not resentful. A quiet, willing submission to God. Okay? Sounds good. That's exactly what I think about when I think about meekness. Nice, not retaliatory, not vindictive. It's nice. That sounds like a nice person, doesn't it? But it doesn't sound strong. It just sounds nice. Let's go on. Let's go on. Keep fighting with me here. The ancient Greek sources reveal something of how this word is used and what it means. They would refer to meekness as being something that was like a soothing medicine. That would be meek, a soothing medicine. Something that would be like a tranquilizer. It would have a calming effect. A gentle breeze was meek. Something that on a hot hillside in Galilee or something, when a gentle breeze came along, that was meek. It was calming, okay? It's broadening just a little bit, my concept of what meek is. They would use it to describe a friendly person, a tender-hearted person, a peaceful, pleasant type of person. But again, here I am, I'm fighting with this concept, and again, when I'm really honest, I think of this tender-hearted, friendly, gentle, soothing person as the kind of person I'd like to be around when I'm picking flowers, right? When I'm going fishing, when I'm doing something that I want someone gentle and peaceful and nice around. That's who I want. Meek, right? But if I'm going into war, I don't know if I want this guy to run. I think he'd just kind of fritter away somewhere, okay? Something's missing. Something's missing. In the real world, you see, where decisions are made and action is taken, I'm going to leave the meek person at home. Jesus was meek. Jesus was meek. And all that does is make more problems for me. In my defining of this, 2 Corinthians 10.1, Paul speaks of the meekness of Christ. In Matthew 11.29, Jesus speaks of himself and says, I am meek and lowly in heart. We sing a song, Away in a manger, no crib for his bed. And he puts down his sweet head and no crying he makes. Jesus didn't cry even when he was a baby. Did you know that? I don't believe that. But he didn't cry. He was meek, though. That's our impression, right? He was meek. He didn't even cry when he was a baby. Go down in our fireside room and there's a picture of Jesus. You look at it. It's meek. It's meek. Jesus, Jesus, meek and mild. I picture him in a field with flowers and little children skipping about. And it's beautiful. It's beautiful. I can't argue with that. I'm not about to stand here and say, Jesus didn't do that. Yes, he did. Yes, he did. He was. He was gentle. He was meek. He was tenderhearted. But that picture I'm painting in my mind is one that's nice, it's serene, it's blissful. But I don't live there. I don't live in a field with little flowers and kids skipping about. Sometimes my life is a lot more like a war, and I'm not going to take meek there. Something's wrong. The picture I'm developing here of what meekness is doesn't even jive with who I know Jesus is and the kinds of things he did. So I've got to go a little deeper. We've got to dig a little more. The term is used at least 12 times in the Gospels in the New Testament. In James 3.13, it says this, Who among you has wisdom and understanding? The PhD? The college grad? The person who's been around the longest? No. The person who has wisdom and understand it shows it by what? His good behavior, his good works, and meekness. It doesn't really help me anymore because all that does is say meekness is important. I go, okay, okay, it's important. But then it goes on in verse 17 and it says, wisdom from above, you know when you're in a board meeting, you know when you're in a, we got a quarterly meeting coming up, you know how to pick the people who have wisdom from above? Wisdom from above is first of all pure, peaceable, meek, easily entreated. Okay, wisdom from above is what? Wisdom from above is pure, peaceable, meek, gives in, right? It's mushy. It doesn't take a stand. It's hesitant. Meekness would kind of stand up and almost apologize. I've kind of got a question. Maybe, what do you think? Huh? Hmm. Ah. Something's missing still. But see, I go on in that same text, verse 17 of James 3, and it says, yes, wisdom from above is first of all peaceable pure peaceable meek easily entreated then it comes along and says unwavering and without hypocrisy a new concept is being introduced here unwavering that means to stand firm and not to move to stand firm and not to move without hypocrisy means not to beat around the bush and say something you really don't mean so hope people get it speak the truth something new is being introduced here along with pure and peaceable and meek and easily entreated. There is a person who having those characteristics is also unwavering, standing firm in the truth and not beating around the bush. Let's go on. First Timothy says, but thou, O man of God. Again, here's the same theme in chapter four, verse one. If you want to be a man of God, if you want to be a woman of God, if you want to walk worthy of this high exalted position. Here's how. Pursue after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and meekness. Again. And then right after that, you know what it says? Now fight the good fight of faith. Again, introducing something else. Meekness is gentle, but for the right cause, it's going to fight. For the right thing, it's going to fight. Huh. This is strange. Got something else to add to that. I want you to come along with me again as we're learning here this morning. The ancient Greeks also used this term, meekness, to refer to the taming of animals. The taming of animals. A wild colt running off in the field, absolutely having no purpose to people. All that energy, all that power, running free is absolutely useless. But when people would take that colt, harness that energy, break that colt, humble, we could use that word there, humble that colt, break that colt, he is now tamed. He has become what? Meek. He is under control. Okay? Something's broadening here. I hope you're coming with me. We need to learn this. Now he is useful. Now he is useful. A lion. Let's think about it this way. Running free in my backyard is what? real dangerous and i guarantee i'm going to stay away from my backyard as long as i've got a lion running free in my backyard all that power out of control it'll pounce on anything i never know what it will i could go out there and for a lark he might kill me i don't know it's out of control i don't know what it's going to do next but when the master comes and controls that animal and cracks the whip and says, this is what I want you to do. And when the control is there, now that animal is under control. All that energy is there. All that power is there. All that force is there. All that ability to destroy is still there, but it doesn't. Why? It's under control. It's under control. The master is controlling it. Meekness is not the destruction of the lion into a spineless pile of mush. Meekness is the taming of the lion. Meekness is power under control. Power under control. If you're taking notes, that's important. You get that. Power under control. Let's go on and explain some more. Proverbs 25 verse 28 says this, He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and without walls. You got that? He that has no control over his own spirit is absolutely defenseless. He doesn't have any walls. He is vulnerable to every kind of sin, to every kind of pitfall, to every kind of temptation that comes along. Every little inducement to anger, bam, he flies off the handle. He's like a city without walls. He has no control over his own spirit. He flies off the handle at the drop of a and he's in trouble all the time. That's power out of control. That's power out of control. And like a lion, this kind of person is a dangerous person to be around. If you're a dad, I wonder, dads, if your kids kind of feel like this is you. If you're a mom, I wonder if your kids feel like this is you. If you're a kid, I wonder if your parents feel like this is you. I'm coming home from school, and it would be real consistent. if I knew when I was coming home from school, I was going to get smacked in the face. Well, I'm going to get it, bam, I get it every day. It would be real consistent if I came home every day and I knew I was going to get love. What the most terrifying experience to live in is to come home every day from school and wonder what it's going to be like. Is it going to be up? Is it going to be down? Is it going to be happy? Is it going to be sad? Is it going to be in control or out of control? Flying off the handle at every little thing, you're like a city without walls. absolutely vulnerable to every little temptation or every little sin, you're out of control. You live in a home like that? If you do, it's dangerous. It's dangerous. One of the reasons it's dangerous, I would put it up on a level where it's dangerous to the cause of even Christianity and the church being the church. Because if that is the situation, then there is no integrity there. You may think you're strong because when you yell, people hide in the corner. You're dangerous. You're not strong. You're just dangerous. Power out of control. Often when we confront that kind of problem in the church, one of our responses is this. Well, that's just the way he is, you know. Well, that's just the way she is, you know. I know. They're out of control. They're out of control. I know that's the way they are. They're out of control. And they're like a city without walls, and they're vulnerable, and they're dangerous. On the other hand, Proverbs 16, 28 says, He that rules his own spirit is better than he who takes a city. He who rules his own spirit is better than he who takes a city. In other words, the lion is there, the power is there, the strength is there, but it's under control. It's under control. That's meekness, power under control. I wonder if you're seeing the balance. I wonder if you're beginning to learn what the balance really is. Let's move on. Aristotle sheds some light on this, and it's very, very interesting. In his work, Writing in Ethics, he writes this. The virtues, catch this, the virtues of life are on this side. I'm sorry. The virtues of life are defined as the middle between the excess and the deficiency. Okay? You got that? The virtue is in the middle. Where was I? Okay. On this side is the presence of something. On the other side is the excess of something. And in the middle is the virtue. Courage, for instance, is the virtue in the middle between cowardice, which is the absence of virtue, and foolhardiness, which is excess. Generosity is the virtue in between stingy selfishness and wasteful irresponsibility. Meekness, therefore, is this. It is the virtue in the middle between unconcerned indifference, which would just be sitting in a lily field, you know, skipping about. That's not what meekness is. But it's the virtue between that and explosive anger. Meekness is power under control. It's the virtue in the middle. And so it is that power under control has great value. So it is that power under control is a virtue. And the fact is this, that there is within the heart of a believer a lion. And that lion, my friend, has every right to pounce and every right to roar. but not any longer on the matters of its own discretion. Why? Because something's happened to that lion and it's the virtue right before the one we're studying now. That's humility. What's happened? Broken. He's been broken. He's come and he's seen himself before God and there's been a breaking and the result of that breaking is what? He's tame. He's meek. The master's now in control. The power is still there. The energy is still there but now it does not pounce on matters of its own discretion. but now he's under the control of the master and that master has changed what i pounce on and that master has changed what i care about i want you to think about that i want you to think about this and this may be a little rough for every one of us myself included because i think a good barometer to check ourselves as to whether we're under control whether that power is under control or not is to ask yourself some of the questions I'm going to ask you right now. What do you care about? What do you care about? Ask yourself that question. I'm going to give you some examples, but you have to do the work here. What makes the lion roar in you? Think about it. What makes the lion roar in you? You got in my way, buddy. I pounce on that. You violated my rights. You took my position. You moved into my space. You hit my car. You broke my window. Everyone else thinks, you know, the lion just, I'm ready to go. Hi, how many of you, I don't know. I'll just use me. That's okay. I'm a maniac when I drive and the lion roars. And I've got a problem with this and maybe I got a smile, but this is something I need to deal with. Have you ever been cut off in traffic? And all of a sudden, and let's just really make it realistic. It's not just a mistake. It's somebody who's real cocky, and they said something to you when they went by, and now they're just kind of cutting front of you, and they think they own the road, and I'm telling you, I'm ready to pounce. I felt like killing people for that, you know? The lion roars in me for that. I get cut off. Somebody bump your car, little bump. The lion roars. I'm taking him for everything he's got. I'll tell you, boy. dads come home from from work i hope it isn't this way in many families but you come home from work and the dinner isn't ready boy i'll tell you what's even doing all day anyways you know the lion roars at that moms you have something like that what does the lion roar at when the kids do what kids what does the lion roar at you know what something's wrong something's wrong real wrong We're out of control. We're out of control. We're like a city without walls because we're flying off the handle at every little thing and those things just don't matter. We care about the wrong things. We care about the wrong things. We'll pounce on things like that. And even the fact that we laugh indicates how insignificant they are. We'll pounce on things like that. The dinner isn't ready. My window got broke. My fender got bumped. I had my feelings hurt someone offended me doesn't know how tough and important I am but I wonder sometimes if sin in our church would be responded to with that same intensity if hypocrisy and we knew it was here would be responded to with that same kind of I don't believe it we've got to do something about that would the fact that we lie to each other and gossip and backbite each other would that bother us with the same degree of intensity that somebody bumped my bumper, bothers me? Would the fact that some believers are full of bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander, would that cause us to come together and go, hey, we've got to do something. We've got to have a family conference. We've got to have a church conference and do something about the fact that in our family, in our church, there is bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor. We've got to do something about that. Would we pounce on that would the lion roar about that or what we would say well well you got to understand that's the way they are they've always been like that so we're out of control the walls are down and we're like a city without walls out of control we care about the wrong things you see you let that fender get bumped in our church you let that window get broken you let people come into our church who don't look like us and might mess it up a little bit you let our budget sink a little bit below what we think is proper and I guarantee faster than you can do anything we're going to have a meeting and do something about that you know what we care about the wrong things don't we we care about the wrong things the lion roars and it's real inappropriate it's really out of line you know what else until we roar about the right things until we get that straightened out we're never going to walk a worthy walk never never let me wrap this up with some examples illustrations that will kind of teach us the balance see i can talk all the time and give you this greek and this other example but when i see it in the life then i clicks and i see the balance power under control meekness david had it second in first samuel 24 he was running from saul he was running for his life saul was a lousy king he was a rotten person and he was out of control there came an instance in samuel 24 i think it's one of the funniest incidents in the entire bible the word of god says that saul came into the cave and david happened to be in that cave and Saul came into the cave to relieve himself and he took his robe and he put it on the side and I the images I could conjure for that I don't want to talk about them but you just go ahead and play with it if you want but he sat there and he was taking care of business and he put his robe off to the side and all of his men said aha what an opportunity God's provision Saul has been laid right in our hands lop off his head David said I'm not going to touch a hair on his head he walked over and cut the robe. And later on, David even felt guilty about that because he had moved towards God's anointed. And David said, no, power under control. Same David, 2 Samuel 16, at a later time in his life, Absalom, his son, full of rebellion and full of sin, was trying to destroy his father's kingdom and David was running for his life again. And this was after David's great success and now his upstart kid was chasing him for his life. He'd become the laughingstock of the nation. He was trying to destroy his father's kingdom. And at one point, Abishai, his general, came to David and said, David, you just say the word. Absalom, your son is not nearly as strong as you think. You say the word and I'll have his head. And David said, leave him alone. Leave him alone. Now what I want you to do is not just consider that, but contrast that with Saul. Contrast that control with Saul's lack of control. What do you think would have happened if the roles would have been reversed with David and Saul? If Saul was laying in wait and David came into the cave and David was the vulnerable one, what would have happened? Saul would have killed him right now. It would have been over. What would have happened if Absalom was Saul's son? And Absalom was the rebellious one. and looking right into the face of his father and spitting at it and saying, I don't care about you. In fact, I'm going to destroy you. Saul would have gone crazy. He would have had Absalom's head like that. In fact, 1 Samuel 14, Saul was so out of control, he almost killed his son Jonathan over a minor issue, something that wasn't even important, and he almost killed him. Saul wouldn't let himself be offended by anyone. Even his own son, he'd kill him first. Saul was a victim. The walls were down. He was like a city without walls, absolutely vulnerable to every little thing flying off the handle. The contrast is clear. Both had the power. Both had the strength. Both had the ability. Both had the resources and the energy, but one was like a fortified city, and one was like a city without walls. Meekness. Power under control. Power under control. Moses had it. Moses had it in Numbers 12 verse 3 the stamp upon Moses' life was this that he is the meekest man in all the world the meekest man in all the world and yet as I consider again the misconceptions and the shallow perceptions I've had of meekness it's hard for me to picture to conjure up a picture of Moses as being some little puny guy walking around mumbling under his beard that's not what I conjure up because why? I know something about his life he was a leader and he was courageous and i think of someone with deep deep conviction who wasn't afraid to act he did things he was the one who walked into pharaoh's court and said oh pharaoh um what do you think maybe huh uh please let my no he didn't he came into pharaoh's court and said let my people go and if you don't you're going to get it you're going to have locusts in your soup i guarantee it and then he turned around and walked away exodus 32 moses was the one who facing the sin of his people the people of god didn't come and say oh well god that's just the way they are verse 19 says his anger burned at that at that the lion roared the lion roared at that he took the tablets that he was coming down from sinai with and smashed them on the ground and said i can't believe this and he rebuked the people in verse 26 he came to them and said whoever here among the people of god means business come with me if you don't stay here he split the church over that. Moses was a bold, strong, effective leader, and yet he was called the meekest of all men. Why? Why? Because he didn't make an issue about things that didn't matter, but he pounced on those things that did, and he roared about those things that did. The lion and Moses had not been destroyed. It was under control. Power under control. Meekness. Most of all, Jesus had it, and this is the last. 1 Peter 2, 21-23. I love this verse. It says this, In Christ's suffering, in the suffering that he went through, he left us an example. And Peter says he left this example for you. And what was that example? It was simply this, that Jesus, God himself, that Jesus being reviled, reviled not again. When they touched his body, when they moved into his space, when they moved in and violated his rights, when he was reviled, he reviled not again. And being persecuted, he uttered no threats. When he was offended, when he was hurt, when his rights were violated, he reviled not again. But, lest you picture again the lilies and the little things skipping about, disconnected with the war, that same Jesus, facing the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, pounced on them. I want you to turn to Matthew 23, and it's important because I want you to see this. I was going to skip over this, but we need to see Jesus pouncing on things that matter. Chapter 23. Let me start in verse 13, as we get into a big round here. But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees. This is saying Jesus, meek, hypocrites, because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from men and you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering in to go in. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows' houses. Verse 15, woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites. Moving down, woe to you, blind guides, you fools, verse 17, and blind men, which were more important. Moving over to verse 23. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, for you tithe mint and dill and cumin and have neglected the weightier provisions of the law. You blind guides, verse 24. Verse 25. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites. On and on and on. Verse 27. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanless. Even so, you too. Outwardly, the outward things, the deeds, they were doing the deeds. Outwardly you appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. That Jesus is the meek one, but he roared at that. This is the same Jesus who walked up to the leaders of Israel and condemned them to their face. The lion roared. This is the same Jesus who boldly spoke judgment when judgment was needed. We call him the Lamb of God, and to those who are believers, he is the Lamb of God. But it is not complete for us to just leave it there because he's also the Lion of Judah. And when he saw God's temple being dishonored, he picked up the whip and turned over the tables. The lion roared. But you know what? When his own temple was defiled, when his own body was touched and broken, and when the nails were driven into the hands and from his body was dripping blood and sweat and spit and he had every right. And he could have stood there and said, you can't do this to me, I have every right. And he could have called 10,000 angels right now, stop the whole thing. But when it came to him, the lion didn't roar. What the lion said then was, Father, forgive. Father, forgive. You know what that is? That's meekness. That's power under control. And no wonder Peter said in 1 Peter 3, verse 4, that we are to be adorned with all the immeasurable qualities of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God something precious. Lloyd-Jones says, to be meek means that you have finished with yourself altogether. The worst that men could say about you is probably true. Power under control. Let me just ask you a question. Is the power in you? It's all there. The energy, the power, the resources. Is it under control? What makes the lion roar in you? What makes the lion in you pounce? You can't do that to me. Who do you think you are? How dare you? Let me ask you a question. Would you be as offended if God were dishonored? Would you? Does it hurt your heart as much when you sense your own heart moving into hypocrisy? When you sense your own heart moving into sin? Does it violate you just as much as when... we care about the wrong things, don't we? I'm convicted about this. I think too often as a church we care about the wrong things. We pounce on things that don't matter. I think too often even as a board and as elders and as a pastor, we pounce on things that don't matter. And we talk about, and sometimes things that matter slide. Let me ask you this. Are you a peacemaker? If one would stumble among us, would you be one who would condemn and talk about him and gossip him? Or would you be one who would go to that person in the spirit of what? Gentleness. Same word. Meekness. Galatians 4. To do what? To restore. Would you be that person? That tells you whether the lion's under control or not. Let me ask you this. Here's a toughie. Do you receive criticism without retaliation? Whether it's right or wrong. But Dave, that's not realistic. We have an example. We have an example. Jesus, who being reviled, reviled not again. And either this is true and I need to deal with it, with me, or let's just not even preach it. You want to walk a worthy walk, worthy of that high, exalted position that is mine in Christ, do it in all humility and all gentleness and it's amazing to me because the whole thing comes back to what we spent so much time in in those other verses where the ignition gets turned on the ability for me to do this comes when I submit to the spirit and he begins to do his work of supernatural power in me Thank you.
