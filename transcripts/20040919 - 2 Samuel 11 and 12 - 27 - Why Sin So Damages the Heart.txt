You see, for a while, it looked like he'd get away with it. That is, it looked like the cover-up of his adulterous affair with Bathsheba and subsequent murder of her husband Uriah was complete when in 2 Samuel 11, verse 27, it says that David, whose life we have been using as our guide for what we've been calling for about a year the journey of the heart, sent and brought Bathsheba to his house and she became his wife and she bore him a son. So they're married now. The very picture of domestic tranquility. But, verse 27b, The thing that David had done was evil in the sight of the Lord, which means, among other things, that David's not going to get away with it. It looked like he would for a while. He had lived with this, as we indicated last week, for almost a year. But now the hammer is about to fall, not because God doesn't love David, but precisely because he does love David, which is why last week we talked about the fact that maybe the scariest thing about God is the love of God. that will not let us go. Through a skillfully told parable by Nathan the prophet, David's sin would be exposed in 2 Samuel 12, verse 7. His repentance would begin in chapter 12, verse 13. God's forgiveness, grace, and mercy would begin to be extended and lavished upon David in that very same verse, but not without consequences. 2 Samuel 12, verse 13. Then David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord. Then Nathan said to David, The Lord has taken away your sin, and you shall not die. And the response to that last week was, Whoa, that was easy. I say, I'm sorry. He says, Okay. First word, next verse, However, because of what you have done, the enemies of the Lord will blaspheme God. In other words, because of the sin of David, people who already hated God would use David's sin as proof that this is all a bunch of baloney. None of that, the baby born of his adultery dies, and the sword would never depart from the house of David because in his violence toward Uriah, David had, in a way he didn't know, couldn't control or manage, released violence into his life, into his family. Two of his sons would die a violent death. Absalom is kind of the embodiment of angry rebellion. You catch that stuff like a cold. The point of all of that, as we talked about it last week, was this, that though grace is amazing and forgiveness is complete, though the joy of David's salvation would eventually be restored and his heart would be recovered, there were consequences to his sin that the amazing grace of God did not make disappear as if by magic. We said it this way. Grace is not like a great big mattress at the bottom of a cliff that keeps you from hurting yourself if you decide to jump. It doesn't work like that. Life doesn't work like that. Even life in the kingdom of God doesn't work like that. See, if you jump off a cliff, a cliff being a metaphor of boundaries that God has set up for us in order to live a full life, if you decide to jump off the cliff anyway, believing that maybe the laws of gravity somehow don't apply to you, here's the deal, you're going to fall. And if you fall, you're going to hit. And if you hit, you're going to get hurt. And our only hope is that you don't get hurt too badly. So if you embezzle your money from your employer, there is grace for that. But you're still going to jail. And if you have sex with someone other than your spouse, there's amazing grace for that. There's all sorts of grace for that. But you still might lose your marriage and the respect of your children. And you still might get a sexually transmitted disease. And if you use, manipulate, and lie to people, there's grace for that as you repent. There's amazing grace for that. But I'm still not going to trust you for a very long time. All of which is why this week and the next, using this episode in David's life as the backdrop for our thinking, I want to talk about sin. Indeed, beyond the examination of the reality of the consequences of sin, like we talked about last week, This weekend next, I want to talk about and examine the very nature of sin. How it functions, what it does. And in a word, what sin does is destroy. It destroys people. It destroys the hearts of people. It destroys marriages. It destroys relationships. It destroys trust. And where you used to be able to look people in the eye, you can't do that anymore. It destroys a sense of safety in a church, in a marriage, in a school. It destroys, in some sense, a sense of our sanity. It destroys the human soul. One writer put it this way, God is not arbitrarily opposed to sin. He hates sin, not just because it violates some rule he gave, but more substantially, because sin violates shalom, because it breaks the peace, which is what shalom means, because it interferes with the way things are supposed to be. Sin, he says, may be safely described as the spoiling of shalom, the spoiling of peace in the human heart, in the human mind, the spoiling of peace in relationships, in marriages, in families, in communities, in cities, in nations, and so on, and so on. It's the nature of sin. It's what it does. It's how it functions. Now, one of the reasons I want to spend a week on this, and actually next week we're going to stay with this David thing, but I want to talk about safeguards and not so much about sin. But why I want to talk about the nature of sin this week is because the impression, I think, that many of us have, and maybe not even consciously aware that we have it, that sin, while it may be wrong, is actually kind of fun. That sin is kind of where the action is, where the life is. And when God says things like, thou shalt not, he's just trying to keep us from all that fun, all that life. He's kind of a cosmic killjoy, kind of a crabby old grandpa, or your janitor at school. What are your kids doing over here? Stop it, stop it. Having fun? Stop it. An old joke about the Ten Commandments. Moses is coming down from the mountain having received the law. He makes this pronouncement to the people. I got some good news and some bad news. The good news is I got them down to 10. That's why I was up in the mountain so long. We were just negotiating this whole thing. The bad news is adultery is still in. I'm not sure whether you should laugh at that or not, were you? But the joke itself tells us something about adultery. Adultery, you know, it's kind of where the action is. Adultery, if we could get away with it, that would be the really good place to go. That's what we would really like to do. how many of you know that adultery is not fun and it isn't funny how many of you know first hand that adultery isn't fun and it isn't funny because the effects of it have invaded your life and your heart you know there's something on the front end of that adultery oh boy there was something on the front end of that adultery that looked so good and it it smelled so good and it when you bit on it it tasted so good but there's something see even that little analogy there's something you need to know about the nature of sin see sin is like bait on a hook I got a word for you the bait on a hook is not there to feed the fish here fishy fishy have a nice little meal for you No, he's there. The bait on the hook is there to catch the fish. It's on the hook to destroy the fish. And it smells really good, and it tastes really good. It's the nature of sin. You can't be naive about that. Proverbs 6.16 says, there are six things God hates. God's a God of love. God hates certain things. Seven are an abomination to him. Number one, a proud look and lofty eyes. arrogance. He hates that. A lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises evil things, and feet that run swiftly to sin, a false witness that fabricates lies, and he who sows discord among brethren with gossip and slander. God hates that stuff. You know why? Because he's a grumpy old grandpa, and he's a big old killjoy. I didn't want you to have any fun. No, God hates that stuff because every single one of those things do great damage, sometimes destroy, every time diminish the object of his love, and the object of his love is people like you and me. Well, how do those things damage people? That doesn't take a lot of imagination, but imagine with me living in a family. Some of you actually live in a family like I am going to describe. imagine going to a school, going to a church, living in a society where all the people in it, or a lot of people in it, have lofty eyes, lying tongues, evil schemes, blistering tongues of slander and gossip. What would that be like? That'd be hell. Some of you live in families like that, go to schools like that, go to workplaces like that, maybe go to a church like that. You're always wondering, what are they saying? There's evil schemes. There's lying. False witness. People sowing discord. You're always wondering what they're saying. Little children don't normally do very well in environments like that. With lying tongues and evil speech. And blistering tongues. The spirits of children are crushed in environments like that. And hearts are filled with fear. Even young people. Young people normally so full of youthful energy and strength with the capacity to conquer and endure and accomplish things in systems like this where there are lofty eyes and lying tongues and evil schemes and blistering tongues. Young people so full of energy normally in systems like this stumble and fall. They lose their way. They lose their heart. Instead of using their energy and their strength to build and to help which is what they really want to do. They use it instead to attack and to destroy with angry rebellion. And again, I think of Absalom, who we will come to in a few weeks. And even adults, grown-ups like you and me, in systems like this where there are lofty eyes in the family and lying tongues in the workplace and evil schemes and the church blistering tongues of gossip and slander in their environment of friends. in those kinds of environments, even adults, grown-ups, cannot stand. You are diminished by those things and afraid, having nothing to give. We're damaged ourselves. The prospect of mentoring and modeling and nurturing, leading the next generation, which is something we want to do, is just shot so we kind of, without words, say this to our kids. You know, you're on your own, kids. We're kind of beat up ourselves already. That, beloved, is the nature of sin. It's what it does. It damages, diminishes, ultimately destroys people, and that is why God hates it. 1 John 2.15 says this, Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. Well, it's kind of a heavy verse. Verse 16 explains what he means by that, for all that is in the world, and then he explains what it is that's in the world that we are to hate that does the damage. For all that is in the world, in other words, or for instance, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but those are the things that are from or of the world. Now, I grew up in church. Most of you know that. So I've heard that verse and verses like it all my life. Love not the world, need the things that are in the world. And while I am absolutely sure that I was taught those verses correctly, what I almost always took from those verses and what I almost always heard, kind of picture me sitting in church, 12 years old, 18 years old, 20 years old, just sitting there listening to the verses. What I even taught well, what I would hear often is something like this. The world is full of delightful, exciting, wonderful things, really fun things. But once again, God's not much into fun. and certainly doesn't want you to have any. So what I'm going to do is try to keep you from all of that fun stuff by giving you verses like this. Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world, neither the things that are in the world. Lots of things I'm sitting here listening. Neither the things that are in the world, and I'm sitting there with a lot of things in the world that I really like. Oh, God, there's a lot of things. What about nothing in the world I'm supposed to love? What about cars? Can I like cars? No, you can't like cars. Cars, big black ones, fast ones? No, you can't. What about fishing? Is fishing okay? Yeah, you can like fishing, but no cigars. okay and in fact in fact again nobody's ever said this to me never ever you just get this impression when you when you read a verse like that and you don't really understand what it's saying nothing in the world you're not supposed to like anything you get this impression that the best way for you to prove you really love God is to not have any fun just kind of go to church and sing in the choir I hate singing in the choir, I'll prove you love God. Do something you really hate to go do that. You kind of become like some of the people, not all the people, but some of the people you saw in church, kind of boring and dull, a little bit crabby too, mostly because they weren't having any fun at all. Well, the truth is this. A lot of people in church are boring and dull and a little crabby too. But if they are, please hear this, it is not because they have tapped into and are living out of the life of God. Jesus said, I am come that you might have life. Jesus, who was God incarnate, knows something about how life works and how you and I can live it to the fullest, how we can smell it and taste it and live it and laugh out loud. I have come that you might be able to enter into a kind of life that you can fully be alive in. It's the world. And everything's been turned around because we believe the lie. It is the world, particularly the part of the world John is describing in verse 16 of 1 John 2, that is dominated and driven by the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life. That is the thing that steals, kills, and destroys your fun, your joy, your life. To really be able to get your head around this, I want to explain those two verses, kind of break them down a little bit for you so you can understand them well. Love not the world. The Greek word for world there is the word cosmos. In Scripture, there are several usages for that word. In other words, that word appears many times in Scripture's cosmos, but it's used differently in different places. Sometimes that word cosmos is speaking of the physical world. In the beginning, God created the world. It's the creation. Sometimes it's speaking of the human world or people. John 3, 16, for God so loved the world. He's not speaking there of creation. He's speaking there of people. But in this particular place, 1 John 2, 15 and 16, the word cosmos is speaking with reference to a system, the world's system. When you speak of, for instance, the world of politics or the world of finance, you are speaking of a system, and a system works a certain way. The world of finance works a certain way, and there are certain things about it you need to understand to function well in it. These systems are driven by certain dynamics. The world of which John is speaking is a system that works a certain way. It is driven by certain things. He identifies three, and all three of these, according to John, damage you and damage others. The lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, the boastful pride of life. Let me break those down for you. Lust of the flesh speaks to the satisfaction of appetites. The satisfaction of appetites? Nah. Now, just before I go any further, I just want to sit on that one for just a moment. I have appetites, and I really like it when they are satisfied. It's kind of what they're there for, to be satisfied. Let me go a little further with the lust of the flesh. It's the spirit that says whatever you want to taste, you can taste, And you can taste it now. Whatever you want to do, you can do, and you can do it now. Whatever you want to have, you can have, and you can have it now. A word that often comes into play in the context of or when you are seeing the lust of the flesh played out in life is the word insatiable. Because once you begin to live this way, according to the lust of the flesh, the dynamic you will experience in your flesh, if you will, is this. It will never be enough. If you are a person driven by the lust of the flesh, you will never have enough money. You will never have enough power. You will never have enough sex, enough possessions, enough pleasure. The word is insatiable. And along with that insatiable reality, there will come an overwhelming discontent. It will never be enough. Don't call that happy. Lust of the eyes speaks to greed. Whatever you see, you must possess. Now what you must possess might be a possession, but not necessarily. What you must possess might be a position, not necessarily. It might be a person you must possess. By the way, people driven by the lust of the eyes don't love people. They don't have a clue how to love people. They use people. some of you are in a relationship right now or maybe have just left a relationship let's say you're in one right now where you kind of think he or she loves you but you're not really sure if they are driven by the lust of the eyes I got a word for you the reason you're feeling used is because you're being used whatever you see you must possess sometimes it's a person by the way this need to possess a person sounded it all like David? if you've been with us the last couple of weeks as you looked over the balcony and saw Bathsheba do you think he looked over the thing and says I really care about what's best for her no it was less of the flesh less of the eyes and it was about possessing her it had nothing to do with love for her and by the way if you're in a relationship with someone again who I said this already driven by these things you'll never know if you're loved you'll never know if you're loved and you want to maybe even put those words on it but there will always be this dis-ease in your spirit that you don't understand. And it could be that you're married to someone who's driven by the lust of the flesh. Isn't this a happy home? See, this stuff hurts people. Boastful pride of life is simply the arrogance that says, I am the center of the universe. And they would never use these words, but basically, I'm God. It's kind of what we've been seeing in David over the last couple of weeks. I can do what I want, when I want, where I want to, whomever I want. I'm a God unto myself. I am, and here's the word we've been playing with the last couple of weeks, I am entitled. And all three of these things, loss of the flesh, loss of the eyes, boastful pride of life, are embodied in David as we have seen it in 2 Samuel 11 and 12 over the last couple of weeks. 1 John 2, 15 says, love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. And the things in the world that we are not to love are those three things. Because those three things, lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, both of the pride of life, are going to hurt you. And they're going to hurt people around you. They might look good on the front end. They might smell good. They might taste good. But here's something we cannot afford to be naive about relative to sin. Sin is like bait on a hook. It's not there to feed the fish. It's there to hook the fish. To destroy the fish. A word about lust. Greek word for lust is epithumia all it means is strong desire please note something very important there is absolutely nothing wrong with strong desires in and of themselves indeed one of the mistakes that many Christians have made historically I believe is that we try to manage our lust by killing our desire which may be why some Christians we know are so boring and dull and sometimes even crabby because the way they've tried to deal with their epithymia, their strong desires for the lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, the boastful pride of life is to just kill all desire and they just walk around like a dead person. Missing entirely. I came to give you life. I mean, Christians who are tapping into the eternal life of God ought to be the indicator that they have indeed tapped into the eternal, but the most alive people you know. The fact is I believe that most of our strong desires have been planted into us by God. Some of them you're trying to kill and you shouldn't. They might need to get rightly ordered. The strong desire to grow is planted in you by God. The strong desire that some of you have to build things, to build a company, to build a family, to build things, has been implanted in you by God. The strong desire that some of you have to accomplish things, to aspire to things, has been planted in you by God. It can get disordered, but the strong desire itself has been planted in you by God. In Genesis, in the story of creation, we're told to rule, subdue, and multiply, to take dominion. I, you know, do that passively. I'm going to take dominion. you ever aspire to build to rule, subdue, to multiply to take dominion rightly ordered those are strong desires God planted in you point, there's nothing wrong with strong desires rightly ordered problem is when the world's system driven by not just strong desire, but the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the boastful pride of life, when those things come to our strong desire and make a promise. And the promise is this. I can give you what you want. I can satisfy your strong desire. I can satisfy your needs. I can quench your thirst. Here's how. Indulge your flesh. Just say yes to every urge you feel. Indulge your eyes. indulge your pride, your egocentrality. You really are entitled. You really do deserve. And by the way, hang around people who tell you that. On the front end, again, again. Without a doubt. When you hear that stuff, it sounds like a sweet deal. It sounds like it made sense. I like the word indulge. I like it when people say, I can. It sounds like freedom. You can do whatever you want. I can. I feel free. I like being told I can have what I want when I want it. I like being told I'm entitled. And I'm pretty sure whoever's telling me that stuff, Dave, you can, oh yeah, go ahead. Oh yeah, no, I have a feeling that people who are telling me all that stuff are really my good friends. They really care about me. They must really love me. They want what's best for me. Let me again put another spin on this, though, that might just give you pause about whether the people who tell you that are your friends. Imagine, again, being in a family, in a school, in a church, in a society, where most of the people in it are driven, fueled, and characterized by the lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, bolster pride of life. Where it's not just you. I'd like me to do it, but nobody else. No, no, no, no. What if we're all driven by that? The whole church, or the general spirit of the church, or the workplace or school or family, is indulging their flesh, indulging their eyes. If everybody's living as if they are the center, well, suddenly it doesn't sound like quite as much fun. It sounds a little scary. Indeed, for some of you, it might sound familiar. Because you're living with someone who thinks they are the center. Or you work with people and they all think they're the center. See, the truth is this, in systems like this, whether it's a family, school, church, I don't care, society, whatever. In systems like this, the world system that is driven by the lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and the boast of pride of life. In systems like that, it is everybody for themselves. You are on your own, folks. You'll never know who you can trust. You'll never know if you're really loved or if you're just being used. You can't ever be confident that people will stay because as soon as they get a better offer, as soon as they taste something sweeter, they're gone. You know why? Because the whole way they operate, the whole way they're driven, is it's all about my needs, my wants, my desires. I am the center. And that system kills people. that's why God says love not that way of life because it will kill you it will kill your marriage it will kill your kids here's the deal while on the front end the invitation the permission to indulge the flesh the eyes and the ego sounds like a sweet deal sounds like it makes sense the fact is this that this world system cannot deliver what it promises. It cannot provide satisfaction, fulfillment, or joy, which is precisely why as often as the Bible calls sin evil and points to the damage it does, the Bible also calls sin folly because it doesn't work. It does not provide what it promises. Keep this before you. Sin is like bait on a hook. It's not there to feed the fish. It's there to catch the fish. It's the nature of sin about which we cannot afford to be naive. You especially can't afford to be naive when the bait is going by your nose. Because here's the deal. It does smell good. It does look good. And it might even taste good when you wrap your lips around it. but there's a hook in there, and you will pay. It's not there to feed you. It's there to kill you. It doesn't work. Cornelius Plantinga, in a book entitled Not the Way It's Supposed to Be, says it this way. Sin is both wrong and dumb. Here's why. It's the wrong recipe for good health. It's the wrong gasoline for the engine. It's the wrong road if you're trying to get home making sin not just evil but futile. It doesn't work. Human desire, deep and restless and seemingly unfillable, keeps stuffing itself with finite goods that can never satisfy. We find ourselves, therefore, overfed but undernourished. We find that day by day, week by week, month by month, we are thinning down to a mere outline of a human being. See, the nature of sin illustrated in the story of David's downward spiral that we've been examining for weeks now and embodied in what 1 John 2, 15 and 16 calls the world system is not dangerous just because it's evil. It's dangerous also because it doesn't work. It can't deliver what it promises. Life. Joy. Frederick Buechner, in his book, The Two Loves, puts this spin on it. The Bible is not, first of all, a book of moral truth, he says. I would call it instead a book of truth about the way life works. Those strange old scriptures present life to us as having been ordered in a certain way with certain laws as inextricably built into it as the law of gravity is built into the physical universe. When Jesus says, for instance, that whoever would save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it, he is not making a statement about how, morally speaking, life ought to be. Rather, Jesus is making a statement about how life is, how it actually works. Satan, therefore, with all of his enticements and all of the bait he puts in front of your face and promises for the good life that he makes has actually involved himself in a hopeless program of swimming against the current of the universe for a while. Moral evil is destructive and often infuriating. It is also in some ways ludicrous, end quotes, because it doesn't work. It will not give you what it promises. There's a hook. C.S. Lewis, in a preface to Paradise Lost, poignantly puts all of that this way when he says, mere Christianity commits us to believe that the devil in the long run is an ass. C.S. Lewis said that, not me. It was him saying that. Further, he says, that sin is actually a form of self-abuse. Think about it, he goes on to say. Promiscuous people, living the good lives, living it wrong, isn't this the great, okay, promiscuous people, coarsen themselves. They do it to themselves and disqualify themselves from the deepest and most satisfying forms of intimacy, condemning themselves to the prison of social superficiality. You don't have to be a churchgoer or a God believer to see that. When you see somebody going from bed to bed to bed to bed, you know there's something very empty in that. And yet it's portrayed like, hey, you live in the... You bit of bait. Liars and cheats, C.S. Lewis says, forfeit their neighbor's trust and imprison themselves behind a wall of enmity and suspicion, thus cutting themselves off from their fellows. Envy traps and torments the envier, turning their life into a hell of resentment. Pride renders a fool unteachable. They know it all. You can't tell them a thing. They're wise in their own eyes. A sure sign of folly. So those people are ignorant and arrogant. You ever see that combination together? An ignorant, arrogant person? It's the most maddening thing you've ever seen. They kind of walk around with a smirk on their face and they're an idiot. You just thought of somebody, didn't you? Yeah, yeah. Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. What he means by that is not fishing and fun and life. He means this world system driven by the lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, the balsa pride of life. Why? Because that system damages, diminishes, and destroys people. And it doesn't work. It can't deliver. It's the nature of sin. It's how it functions. It's what sin does. And again, it's graphically illustrated in the downward spiral of David, whose life we've been examining, who not only damaged Bathsheba, destroying her marriage, and ultimately her husband as well, he damaged, diminished, and destroyed some things in himself too. But here's the deal. As I try to reel all of this in, all of us have sinned. Truth is, you know, I can stand up here and go, don't bite the bait, you bit the bait. We have all. bit the bait. One way or another, one time or another, we've swallowed it hook, line, and sinker. And while we might get real indignant about somebody else who I can't even believe that they would do a sin like that, I can't even believe that they would bite a bait like that. It's not attractive to me. What do you bite that? You know, generally, I know the baits that work on me. You know, if you're a fisherman, you pick a bait that works with bass, and then you pick another one that works with walleye, and he's always up when you're fishing. I'm not a good fisherman, but I've been fishing with fishermen, and they're always changing the bait. It ain't working. Let's do something else. This will smell better. This will look better. And I get indignant. I go, oh, how could you go for that one? You know, the bait of shopping, going by my nose. Oh, resist temptation. I didn't even go for that one. Go for shopping for crafts and spend too much money. What an idiot. How could you do that? that's not what I'm baiting for and that's not the bait in my life I got other ones and so do you so get off your high horse about that one we've all bit the bait we have all bitten the bait we've all bought the lie so what that means about this message is this, this message is too late don't bite the bait, don't bite the lie we already did, we already have every one of us we're already damaged actually getting ready for church this morning. I was praying about the message and I was praying for you and this thought came to me. Lord, I'm going to be talking to an auditorium full of damaged people. And I'm one of them. Been damaged by our own sin. We've been damaged by other people's sin. We've all been damaged. This sermon's too late. We've all been we've already been diminished. That's why some of you, even though I look at you and I know you're competent in your career and you're pretty good people you still on the inside you still feel small. You know why? Because you've been diminished. Maybe by someone else's sin. Maybe by your own. Some things in your life actually might feel like they've been destroyed as well. Maybe because of your own sin. Maybe because of somebody else's. This message is too late. Back to David. 2 Samuel 12 13 Then David said to Nathan as the lights began to come on and the horror of what he had done began to seep back into his consciousness. I have sinned against the Lord. Then Nathan said to David, the Lord has taken away your sin. You will not die. Which did not mean no consequences. We've established that well. It simply meant, David, there's grace for you. There's grace for you to face your consequences and you're going to have to face them. There's grace for you to start over, even for you, with what you've done. There's grace for you to rebuild your life and recover your heart. You know, it was David in the Psalms who said, if not for grace, who could stand? I don't know when he said that. Might have said it as a young boy and as a young boy, I think he knew it and I think he meant it and he was grateful for grace. And I certainly don't appeal to people to involve themselves in sin so they can really taste grace. But I got a feeling after this, when he tasted grace, after he saw his sin, I bet he couldn't. I bet he said, if not for grace, who could stand? I bet he said it a different way. He just, I could never stand. I could never be in a place where I could look God eye to eye again if it wasn't for grace. Who could stand? You couldn't. I couldn't. Neither could David. Close with a story. A guy was talking to me last week after church, and he was telling me that the story of David that I had spoken of the previous week, especially that part where David was running red lights and getting deeper and deeper into his stuff and kind of thinking, why don't you stop running red lights? He said, you know, that whole thing reminded me of this real-life cop show that I watch. And some of you have seen that maybe, or at least the advertisement of it, where they actually are filming from a helicopter somebody who is running from the cops, and he's going through red lights, and he's busting through intersections, and he's hitting a sign there, and he's bumping into a car over there, and he says, you know, it reminded me of when you were talking about David, and the whole time I'm watching this guy run from the cops, I'm thinking, why don't you pull over? Why don't you pull over before you do more damage, before you kill somebody or yourself? Word today in closing is this. This would be a really good time for some of you to pull over, to stop running the red lights, to stop thinking you're going to get away with it, maybe if you just go faster, to stop thinking that because you got through those first three red lights, the next one is, oh, we'll just do that one too. To stop, to pull over, it would be a really good day for you to pull over, to put on the brakes and pull over and surrender to the grace of God that might just help you face the consequences. Because if you've been running the red lights, there's probably some consequences to face. Surrender to the grace of God that might just help you start over. Surrender to the grace of God that might just help you rebuild your life and recover your heart. It's not too late. Not yet. I want us to do as we close what we did last week. I'm going to ask you to close your eyes. Just bow your head and close your eyes. Whatever you need to do to just get alone with God. See, I think God can speak some things to your hearts much more effectively than me. It's time for me to shut up and ask the Spirit of God. Just you do this. This is your work, to ask the Spirit of God. Lord, are there any red lights I'm running? Are there any places in my life where I need to pull over? you know what just ask him to tell you ask him to show you i think he can do it better than me holy spirit come tell us what we need to hear Amen. Cursed me that the Holy Spirit of God is a much better preacher than me. because he has an ability. If you listened, he told you some things. Much more penetrating than me. Let me just speak this word over you, especially if the Spirit of God has said, you need to pull over here. You need to pull over, put the brakes on about this. Here's the word. If we confess our sin, he's faithful. He is faithful and he is just to forgive us our sin and to begin the process of cleansing us from all unrighteousness. Surrender to the grace of God. Father, give us the courage to do the things you have just prompted in our hearts to do. I pray these things in Jesus name Amen The altar team as always will be here for
