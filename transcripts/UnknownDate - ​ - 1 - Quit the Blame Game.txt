Morning. Seems like about the time I get to speak, our cat has kittens. And you know, last night I didn't say anything. I didn't say a word last night. And in the past when I've said stuff, you know, I've gotten letters and calls from people saying, you know, why don't you just have that cat fixed? I mean, it's had 48 kittens. So last night I didn't say anything. And then I got all these people saying, don't you have any kittens? I mean, how come you didn't say anything about kittens? So actually, we're about a week away from having kittens. So I'll keep you posted. And two of them are already spoken for, so you have to get your request in real quick. We have kittens. I liked last week, you know, and several weeks before when Dave was talking from the book of James, and he kind of characterized James, I guess, he kind of characterized James as this person who maybe you met as a counselor in your treatment when you went through treatment whenever you did, if you did. And the reason I like that is because I worked as a treatment counselor, inpatient treatment, in the late 1970s. And actually, I was a lot meaner then than I am now. I used to be a shamer and, you know, holler at people, make them wear signs and all that. And some of you remember the treatment stuff that happened in the 70s. So I'm much more graceful now than I was then. But, you know, he's been talking, Dave's been talking about blaming. And, I mean, I heard some great blaming, creative kind of incredible blaming stories while I worked in treatment. I'm getting an awful lot of feedback here. Is it me or... One of the things that happened while I was there was I had this 14-year-old girl as a client. and what she used to do is she used to get loaded up on pot about every other weekend and then run away. And she'd run away down to Iowa, which, you know. I mean, she was under the influence, so I mean. But anyway, and then she'd get caught loitering in some small town and then the sheriff would bring her to the sheriff's office and then they have to call her folks and they have to drive down to Iowa and pick her up. Two weeks later she'd do the same thing. So my opinion, she's the one that ended up in inpatient treatment, but my opinion was that she's not the one that had the issue with chemicals. I think that her dad was the addict in the family and that she just kind of wore the pain in the family by getting loaded up on pot once in a while and she wasn't really an addict. So one of these times what happened was that her dad went and picked her up and she didn't want to come home. and put up a big stink, and he made her a deal. And the deal was that if she would just agree to come home, when they got back up here in Minneapolis, they'd go get an evaluation. Both of them would, you see. And then they'd proceed with whatever the evaluators told them to. So, of course, she thought that was a good idea. So they came back up to Minneapolis, and she ended up getting an evaluation and sent to inpatient treatment where I was the counselor. And he didn't even go to his evaluation or keep any part of his end of the deal. And so now she's sitting in inpatient treatment feeling chumped, you know, and all she wants to do is talk about this dad and talk about his drinking and talk about his behavior. And, see, like I said, I don't think that she was even the addict. But I do know that if she's going to get help for herself, that she's got to stop talking about somebody else and start talking about herself. So, because that's the way it is. You know, you can't change the person that's not here. You can only change the person that's here. And so anyway, a lot of the work that I did in the first few weeks of treatment was to help her focus on herself and what she needs to change and what her issues are and where her pain is instead of just keep focused on this dad that isn't here. But at the same time, it's also my job as the counselor to make a referral when all is said and done that is going to send her to a place that's going to give her the best shot at staying healthy. So, of course, while she's telling me about the dad and I'm trying to encourage her to think about herself. I'm also taking all these notes about the dad because we're going to have to check this out at some point. So finally the family conference comes along and so I say to the family now, I say, you know, it's my job to kind of try to discern what's going on here so I can make an intelligent referral after treatment that's going to give my client a good shot at staying sober. So I need to check out your drinking, sir, because that's pretty much all I've heard about since she got here in treatment. How much do you drink? And he said, well, I don't drink that much. You know, I have a couple drinks to unwind when I come home. No big deal. That's what he said. Then the daughter, who's the client, she says, Dad, you drink from the time that you come home to the time you go to bed every night. Then the mom, who's sitting over here, says, he does not. And then the son says, he does too. So I said, well, how often do you get drunk? And he said, well, not that often, maybe once a week, which, by the way, is a lot. Okay, that's a lot. Not that much, maybe once a week. She says, Dad, you get drunk every night. We find you asleep in front of the test pattern, you know, every night. And then the mother says, he does not. And then the son says, he does too. Now, see, there's a couple reasons why I told this story. I mean, one of the reasons I told this story was to just tell you a little bit about me, which is that this is the first time that I got chest pains as a helping professional. Because, see, I thought that I'm supposed to know what to do here, and I'm supposed to know the thing to say, and I didn't have a clue what to say, and I had never seen anything like this before in my life. And the blaming that happened in that family happened so fast, I couldn't catch it. See, I couldn't hardly keep up with it. But this guy, you know, finally what I said was, I said, you know, in order for me to even consider referring her home, you'd have to get an evaluation and then do what they say. And he said, you know, if I went and told those people how much I drank, they'd say I had a problem. Hello? So basically, you know, the guy is really deluded, and his thinking is that if somebody found out the truth about him and they thought that it was a problem, they would be the problem for thinking there's a problem. See, the problem isn't that I'm drinking too much. I mean, this guy had yellow eyes, so his drinking was manifesting itself in a jaundice kind of way, you see, in his body. And he had bleeding gums in his nose, had broken blood vessels. And if anybody thought he had the problem, it would certainly be the person who thought he had the problem that would be the problem. So there was blaming going on there. There was blaming going on with the daughter who, you know, thought that the dad was her problem. And if he would just get better, she'd be better. And once again, as I said, if she's going to get better, she needs to look at herself. Now the reason I told you that story, and I have some other stories I'm going to tell you here in a minute, is because last week I was sitting back there when I heard Dave Johnson promise you that I was going to, quote, unquote, unpack verse 18 of James 1. And I'm going to do that, and it's going to take a couple weeks to do that. So I'll do that now and then next week is communion and then the week after that I'll do part two of this sermon, which is kind of hard for me to do because this is kind of the bad news sermon and in two weeks it's kind of the good news sermon. It's hard for me to just kind of let the bad news sit there, but we're going to have to do that. But here's the verse in James, verse 18. In the exercise of his will. You know, when I saw that, when I saw in the exercise of his will, two things came to my mind that I wanted to make sure to mention in two weeks. The first thing was that we've been talking, Dave's been talking about blaming, which is to say I'm not responsible. Here it says in the exercise of his will. So God is saying, James is saying about God, God is taking responsibility for what he did. He did this in the exercise of his will. He did this intentionally on purpose. He's responsible. The other thing is that I have a little bit of a study on the will of God that I want to share with you in a couple weeks because I think that most people think of God's will as kind of this divine to-do list that you have to figure out what you're supposed to do and do it to keep out of trouble. And I don't think that's what God's will is really about. The second thing it says is he brought us forth by the word of truth. And of course, David's been talking about deception. And what contradicts or what solves deception is truth. So that kind of filters back into what we've been learning. and then it says, as it were the first fruits, that we might be as it were the first fruits among his creatures. And when I saw that, I thought, what does that have to do with anything? Why is it important for us to know that we're the first fruits of his creatures? I mean, Dave quoted a passage last week from 1 Corinthians that talks about Jesus being the first fruits. See, if Jesus is the first fruits, and we're the, how can I say this? you can't have two things be the first thing do you understand? you have one thing that's first and the next thing is second so how could we be the first fruits and Jesus be the first fruits both at the same time and it's because we're first fruits of different things Jesus was the first fruit of those who died and were raised again not to die again I mean Lazarus died and rose again but he died again but not Jesus Jesus was the first fruits of the one from the dead who was never to die again. That's not the kind of first fruits we are. We're a different kind of first fruit. And if we understand the kind of first fruit that we are, we don't have to blame anybody. We can take responsibility for our behavior, and I'm going to talk about that next time. Over the last couple weeks, Dave has walked us through a description of the sin cycle. And I just want to review that quickly. It starts with a person's own lusts. The word lust there in my past, in my training in the church, has always had very strong negative sexual connotations. But you see, the word lust itself is epithumia. It's not automatically bad. It means strong passions, passionate longings. So it doesn't automatically mean a bad thing. If you want to see someone with passionate longings, for instance, to be loved and accepted and noticed and attended to, just go up to the nursery and look at the babies. The babies have passionate longings to be held. So the passionate longing in and of itself is not the bad thing. It's the course of action that people take to try to meet the passionate longing that turns it into a bad thing or else a good thing. It also talks about being carried away and enticed by passionate longings. What I noticed in that verse, I'm not sure, I can't remember if Dave unpacked this or not, but what I noticed was that there was the word and in there. Enticed and carried away. And remember he said that the word enticed means baited, like bait that is used to trap or catch an animal or a fish or something like that. You see, you can have a passionate longing, for instance, to be loved and accepted, which is a legitimate passionate longing, and you can even be enticed or abated by something and it's not being tempted towards your passionate longing, that's the problem. You have to be enticed and carried away for it to result in death. In verse 12, it says, Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial. So if you have a passionate longing and you're enticed but you persevere, it doesn't lead to death. You see, it leads to life. But if you have a passionate longing and you're enticed and you are carried away, then it leads to death. Last week Dave also talked about the sin cycle and he used the illustration of a merry-go-round. You remember that illustration? And I really liked that illustration because it reminded me of being a kid. When I was a kid, I used to live in the country, kind of a rural area, and right next to the house was this little park and basically it had a pump. That's all it had was a pump. And I remember that pump because I used to get my tongue stuck on it in the wintertime, putting my tongue on it. And so I remember that pump. And it had a swing set and a slide, and it had a merry-go-round, and it was one of those merry-go-rounds that you had to push yourself. And I remember that you'd get it going as fast as you could and then try to get to the middle of it. Anybody remember that? Try to pull yourself to the middle of this thing. But it was hard because the centrifugal forces kept pushing to the outside. And the way that Dave talked about this was that the sin cycle is like that merry-go-round and you're stuck on it, you see. And what propels it, what keeps it going is deception. He talked about that last week. And blame. He talked about that four weeks ago. Blame and deception. Makes it go faster and faster. And I mentioned to Dave that if you leave the illustration just like that, where you're on the merry-go-round with a sin cycle and it's being propelled by deception and blame, it really isn't accurate. And it really defeats the purpose of confronting blame because, see, the reason you confront blame is you want people to start taking responsibility for themselves instead of blaming somebody else. But if you talk about the sin cycle as you're just kind of sitting in the middle of this merry-go-round and something else is pushing it, it takes you out of the loop. Are you following me? Really, I remember as a kid putting my knee on this thing and pushing it with my other leg, you see. Perception does keep you on the merry-go-round. But what also propels the merry-go-round is that you have to have one leg off pushing it, and that's blaming somebody else. There is a part that we have in this, not taking responsibility for our behavior. It's really hard to take responsibility for being deceived. Do you understand this? Because the nature of being deceived is that the person who's deceived doesn't know they're deceived. If they knew they were deceived, they wouldn't be deceived anymore. Understand? So it's really hard to take responsibility for being deceived. But it's not hard to take responsibility for blaming and for the thing that you're blaming for. And that is the part of the cycle where we are actually pushing the merry-go-round, not just riding along. So after telling Dave that his illustration didn't work really well, he told me that he thought it would be good to go back and reiterate some of the teaching on blame. And more specifically, which is more what we're going to get to at the end of today and then also next time I speak, why do people blame? Why do we do it? What's the reason in us why we blame and then how do we get out of blaming? And that's really what I'm going to talk about next time is how to get out of it. Once again, you know, Dave used this illustration of the treatment counselor and I just saw so many examples. I already told you one of blaming. I had a guy come into treatment, a cocaine addict. He had a wooden Bible, a wooden King James Bible. And every time you tried to point out something about him, every time you tried to confront him for not doing something he said he was going to do or for doing something he said he wasn't going to do, he'd open up his wooden King James Bible to the place where it talked about Christians are going to be persecuted. and he would just say, well, you know, I'm just being persecuted like the word of God says. So there's no way for him to hear what you were saying because he had it all figured out with God's stuff why he wasn't really responsible and the person who confronted the problem was really to blame. Of course, I took that Bible away from him and that just proved to him. Actually, what we did in those days is we put people on restriction. We called it, we put them on restriction. So I put him on wooden Bible restriction. And that just proved to him that I was the problem and he was just being persecuted more and more. But it's always interesting when I see people use God or use scripture, use spirituality as a way not to get well, not to see the truth, not to be honest, to keep the peace at all costs, which is not what the Bible talks about at all. I had another guy who had seven drunk driving tickets you know he lost his license after the second ticket but in the meantime he's driving with his first drunk driving ticket you know now he's got seven of them he ends up in the workhouse he ends up in treatment I said what's going on he says I don't know man every time I drove I got a ticket I said what'd you do he said I quit driving now that's good I mean I'm glad that he quit driving because I have a wife and daughters and friends and myself are out on the road and I don't want this guy driving. But the sad part is that the reason he quit driving was because he figured out that driving was the problem. See? So if driving is the problem, then the solution is quit driving. Following this? Okay. Now he's walking. He walks to work, walks to school, walks to the bus, walks home, you know, and he's walking home one night and he rips off a Sears Craftsman toolkit, 500 pound toolkit off the back of a pickup truck. He's dragging it down the sidewalk. The cops pull up. He does an Eddie Haskell number on him, calls him sir. Really polite, you know, doesn't know where that's coming from. They give him, arrest him for felony theft. I said, well, what did you do? Stop walking? He said, what are you talking about? I said, well, you were driving and getting tickets. And he stopped driving. Now you're walking and getting busted for felony theft. And I want to know if you stopped walking. He said, what? I said, well, did you ever get any tickets when you weren't drinking? He said, no. I said, well, did you ever get busted for felony theft when you weren't drinking. He said, no. So maybe that's it. Maybe that's the problem. He went, ah, ah. Like, it is. Like it hadn't occurred to him up to that point. Now, see, up until that point, it was the driving and it was the walking and it was the cops and the social worker and his job and everything else was the problem, you see. So when he finally realized that he was the problem and his behavior was the problem, he didn't go, oh, no, I'm a scummy alcoholic. Like, this is just a terrible thing. He was very relieved, you see, because if everybody else is your problem, then you're just this victim person who's got to sit around waiting for everybody in the world to get right so that when you're right, when they're right, you can be right. But see, if you're the problem, you can change and get help right now. And that's what he realized. I had a guy who was 50 years old, came to visit his daughter. He's from Vermont. He got two drunk driving tickets while he was here. Now he's got to go to treatment. He can't even go home. I said what's going on he says I don't know the cops here or something else aha they make you walk the line and get a breath test and touch your nose and all this kind of stuff you know and I've been acting this way for 20 years in Vermont nobody says a word I come here I get a ticket oh so the problem is you're in Minnesota right that's the problem how'd you get the second ticket he's driving home at night funny thing you know leans over to pick something up and I've done this by the way where you keep your hand on the steering wheel you know and then you lean over and when you lean you keep your hand there and it kind of makes the car swerve. Who's ever done that? I mean, I've done that, but he's drunk when he's doing it. He does it at three o'clock in the morning and he's thinking that the reason why he got the ticket was it was three o'clock in the morning and he was the only car on the road. So the cops saw him do that because if it had been 10 o'clock in the morning, there'd been all these cars on the road and he wouldn't have even been spotted. So his problem isn't that he's got a 20 year old alcohol problem. His problem is he's in the wrong state at the wrong time of day. now I've worked in the church for almost 20 years and I've seen that kind of blaming you know and that kind of blaming is everywhere I'm not responsible something else is the problem I'm not the problem but I've seen other kinds of blaming happen in the church too I've seen where the victim has been blamed you know I've seen wives who were told that the reason why their husband continues to abuse them is because they haven't forgiven them enough. They haven't forgiven them 70 times, 7 times. You see, and that verse is used on wives to propel them back into abusive situations where they get abused again. When Jesus wasn't talking to domestic abuse victims when he said that verse about 70 times, 7 times, he was talking to self-righteous people who thought that they could forgive someone enough times to get points with God. or turn the other cheek. You see, Jesus isn't talking to battered wives when he's telling people to turn the other cheek. He's talking to Pharisees. But the reason why this person keeps acting irresponsible or acting abusively is because of something you're doing or you're not doing, you see. So we get blamed or we blame the person who's on the receiving end of the abusive treatment. I've seen that. I've seen people who are told that God has all this great healing waiting for you. It's just waiting for you, see? But the reason he can't give it to you is because you're doing this or you're doing that or you think this or you think that or you don't have this or you don't have that. So you're not a fit vessel to receive all this healing that he has for you. And of course, then I've seen other people who've gotten healed and then all of a sudden they get sick again and then they're told that the reason they got sick is because they did something or didn't do something and it's their fault they lost their healing. Let me say something about this. Healing is a gift from God. And like all of God's gifts, God distributes them just as He wills. And if the criteria for receiving God's gifts was really that we were fit to receive them, no one would receive any gifts, including being saved. There would be no saved people. because it's not about earning or deserving. It's about receiving a gift. But I've heard people and dealt with the wounds that were caused when people were blamed for God's choices. And then I have seen a lot of people get into self-blame, and Dave addressed that. I heard him address that too, self-blame. And I think one of the reasons why people get into self-blame, like just continuing to heap blame on themselves, is it's almost like a lot of us have been taught that if you can just feel bad enough about something, it'll make a change. You understand what I mean by that? Like, if you could just feel bad enough about what you're doing, then you'd stop doing it. And of course, if feeling bad was the solution, our problems would be solved because we're not short of feeling bad. So there's a lot of stuff to sort out here, and I want to just tell you a story that really helped me, what happened in this story really helped me sort some things out. Now, do you remember a couple years ago, I had a ponytail. How many of you remember my ponytail? Okay, I mean, I'm, you guys have really put up with a lot. I mean, last year I came up here and bled all over everybody, and two years ago I had a ponytail, and, you know, I got cats every time. I show up and, well, see, I had this ponytail. And I was asked to go speak to a group of people in Toronto. And the group was really made up of three different groups, three different denominational kind of categories of people who probably, under normal circumstances, wouldn't have even talked to each other, you know, because that's how different they were. but they all got toasted in their various religious place, you see, by a bunch of kind of mean legalistic people, and they found each other, and they're supporting each other, and they're trying to get through this together, and they decided they wanted me to come and do a little deal on spiritual abuse and help them get through it. So I went into Toronto. The place where we were staying was about 70 miles away from where the place was where I was going to be speaking, and I rented this Mustang convertible, And so I'm driving down the road in this Mustang convertible with my ponytail. And I'm thinking to myself, this is stupid. Because I don't know these people and they don't know me. And they might really be offended by a ponytail. I mean, I know that they have been blown up by a bunch of legalists. But it might be that these are just really, really mean legalists. And the people I'm going to go speak with are legalists too. Just not as mean. And that's why they got thrown out. Understand what I'm saying so far? And what I have to say is so important, it's not worth not being heard because of a stupid ponytail. You following me here? So it's not worth not being heard because of this goofy ponytail, so I'm going to take it out. So when I got to the exit, I pulled over, put the top up, took the ponytail out, and I went to speak. I met the guy who hired me. He said, we're going to have Brother George come up and pray and introduce you in a minute. I said, okay. I went and sat down. The guy gets up, he says, thank you all for coming. Brother George is going to come up and introduce our speaker and pray, and then we'll begin. Brother George comes up. He says, I'm here to introduce the speaker, but before I do, I want to tell you a story. Wednesday night, I had a dream. And in the dream, we were at the conference, and you were all there. I recognized a bunch of people, and we were here to have this conference, and I was supposed to introduce the speaker. But I didn't know what he looked like. I'd never met him. I didn't know who he was, and so I was feeling kind of panicky because I didn't know what he looked like. So I'm looking around, trying to recognize who the speaker is, And I look over here and here's the Lord Jesus Christ standing in the corner. So I go over to the Lord and I say, I'm supposed to introduce the speaker, but I don't know what he looks like. And the Lord says, he's the one with the ponytail. Now you think I'm going to draw some big spiritual implication out of this, probably. And I'm not. I only told you that story to tell you that I have bad hair, I know it, and I want you to know I know it. I'm not in delusion about it, I'm not blaming anybody. But there's another reason I told that story too. And this reason is this, that as I was giving this seminar to these people, You know, I spent the first evening defining spiritual abuse and describing the characteristics of abusive systems. And the first morning I was there, I talked about the wounds that people, that are common to people who've been through spiritual abuse. And in the afternoon, I started talking about some of the elements that are necessary for healing to take place. And kind of in the middle of that talk, this guy raises his hand. And I thought he was going to ask a question. So I called on him, and he was looking out the window, and outside the window, there was a little driveway next to the church building, and across the driveway there was like a tangled up bunch of brush and really a junky kind of mess of tangles. And he said, see that tangled up mess over there? And I said, yeah. He said, you know what? The leadership of our churches led us into a spiritually abusive tangle. It was confusing. It was evil just like what that looks like there. The leadership led us there. And you know what? They shouldn't have. And you know what else? It was wrong for them too. But you know what else? We followed. You know, when he said that, all of a sudden I realized that he had an insight. And the insight was that there was part of this whole thing he was responsible for, and that was the following. Do you understand? Also, it means to me that he was clear of what he wasn't responsible for. He wasn't responsible for the evil behavior on the part of the other people, but he was responsible for his part. Now, you see, if I had asked that question the first night, when we first met, if I had said, instead of all the stuff I said, if I had said, now what were you responsible for, it would have come out as a shaming, blaming kind of thing, and they wouldn't have been able to hear that. You following me? But there does come a time in the process after it's sorted out, whose is whose? Who's responsible for which part? When it is important to say, well, yeah, I'm responsible for my part. When I counsel people, people come in for marriage counseling, for family counseling, one of the questions I probably ask most of them like it is, more than any other, is a question like this. What can you do differently? what can you do differently now you see if you ask that question too soon in the process what it sounds like is blaming somebody for somebody else's behavior you know a husband comes in or a wife comes in and they start talking about all the stuff that this other person is doing and why the relationship isn't working and I say well what can you do differently and what that means is this that you can't do anything about their behavior you can't change their behavior their behavior is theirs but there is part of this that you're doing that you can do something about But if you ask that question too soon in the process, what it feels like you're saying is, you need to do something differently because you're the reason why that person's acting that way, which is not what that question means. You know, parents come in and they talk about what's going on with their teenager and all the turmoil that's happening, and I say, what can you do differently? And what that means is, the teenager may never change. Do you understand? That's their option. Even if they don't change, what can you do differently? How can you be a healthy person? What are you doing that contributes to the turmoil that you don't like, that you'd like to change, how do you do that? But if you ask the question, once again, too soon into the process, without some understanding, people hear you saying, you know, you're the reason why that person is acting that way, and that's not why I asked the question. I'm not asking the question to imply that the spouse or the parents is somehow responsible for causing their loved one's actions. I'm not implying that if they change, their loved one will automatically change. And as a matter of fact, their loved one might never change. They have that choice. My question simply points to the fact that while people can't control their loved one's choices, they can make choices of their own. And at some point, when they can take responsibility for that part, it becomes very healthy for them to do so. And that's what the guy in Toronto realized. Somewhere in the presentation, he asked himself, what am I responsible for? And that was the starting point of his healing. It's the difference between holding people accountable for their behavior and blaming people. Now, you know, without getting into this a lot, because Dave already did this, but there's a difference between holding someone accountable and blaming someone. For me to hold you accountable for your behavior means to act like you're responsible for your choices. For me to blame you is like holding you accountable for my choices. You are not accountable for my choices. You're accountable for yours. And holding you accountable is not the same as blaming. Now, the thing that Dave walked you through, and I'm going to walk you through exactly the same illustration, except I'm going to go a little bit deeper, is the illustration of the little kid whose dad abused him. So here's what it looks like. Five-year-old little boy, Rick, is beaten up by his dad. What does Scripture say besides the fact that dads aren't supposed to beat up their kids? Scripture says he should talk to his dad. But he's learned that whenever he tries to talk to his dad, he's been hurt. He's been treated in ways that gets him hurt even worse maybe than the first time. See, for the little boy to go talk to his dad, all he's trying to do is hold the dad accountable for his behavior. but he gets hurt worse doing it so he shuts down and he shuts dad out and dad notices that the connection between him and the little kid is gone and so he says what's going on and the kid chooses to protect himself by pretending nothing's wrong and he puts a fake smile on his face and says everything's great now who's responsible for what? the dad is responsible for the abusive behavior he's responsible for his actions that punish Rick for trying to tell the truth, that communicate to Rick, if you try to hold me accountable for my behavior, I'll hurt you again. He's responsible for the messages that say, little kids are here to get hurt and not say anything. Here's what dads are for. Here's what males are for. And all these behaviors need to be charged to the dad's account. That's what it means to hold someone accountable. And if I had been involved, I'd have called child protection. Because, see, the little kid isn't big enough to hold the dad accountable and have the dad be held accountable, so we just have to bring someone in bigger who can do that. Rick is accountable for his pretending and his lying. Does it make sense? I remember when Dave walked us through this, but it's very important, see, because we want to give the kid the benefit of the doubt, and we need to do that. But the truth is, the kid made a choice. He chose to pretend. Does it make sense that he chose that? Yes. Do we blame him for choosing that? No. Is it a good idea he did? Yes. You see, it's the way he picked to protect himself because a five-year-old kid isn't capable of getting a restraining order to protect himself. He's not capable of drawing a line in the sand that says, you will not abuse me again. But what he is capable of doing is pretending that things are great when they're not great to protect himself. So it makes sense. but he's still responsible for that choice and now he's a 30 year old husband and dad and he's still choosing to pretend and he's married to somebody who wouldn't beat him up if he told the truth and he's still not telling the truth and he's around people that it is safe to be open with and he's still choosing to not be open with these people and in order for him to understand this and make different choices he needs to take responsibility for the lying and the pretending which started back at a time when it made sense but it was still lying pretending. And if he said, I lie and pretend because of my dad when I was a kid, then he has become a victim and has a victim mentality and that's not helpful. There's a difference between blaming and holding other people accountable. It's blaming our past to say, I am where I am because of you. But if you say, I am where I am because of the choices that I've made in response to how I was treated in my past, now that's taking responsibility for your choices, and it's very important to do that. Last 15 years has seen an outpouring of people getting permission to examine their past relationships and understand how they have been affected by them. And, you know, some people haven't used the permission to make different choices. they've used that instead as an excuse for their present lifestyle. You know, I can't help myself. My parents treated me this way. I went through this. And that's the victim mentality. And so even though in the past 15 years the pendulum has swung way over here to give people permission to start looking at this stuff, and I'm in favor of that, and I was part of that, and I think it's a good idea. You see, now in reaction to that, the pendulum has swung way back the other way. So you get an article in Time magazine that says, you know, Americans are just a group of litigious blamers. They're looking for somebody to blame so they can sue them. And the Eagles, in their latest concert, came out with that song, you know, Get Over It. Which just means, you know, quit griping and complaining and just get on with it. I got a book here that someone sent me called Why Christians Can't Trust Psychology. And basically this book, without getting into this, and I used to argue a lot with folks who wrote books like this, you know, Trying to prove psychology is okay and all that. But basically what this book says is that instead of dealing with the real wounds and issues that you have in your life, what you just need to do is do the right thing. Just do the right thing. And so we've got chapters in here that say the myth that psychology is scientific, the myth that psychology is effective, the myth that psychology is motivated by compassion, the myth that psychology is trustworthy, The myth that psychology can heal the past. That's part two. Then part three is, are psychology and Christianity compatible? Well, what do you think this person says? You know, I think God owns psychology. I think God thought psychology up. I think you get a verse like Romans 12, 2 that says, Be transformed by renewing of the mind. you won't find a more psychological statement on the planet. And I wouldn't hesitate to recommend that you go to a psychological conference, and when you go there, regardless of all the whatever's going to happen there, when you go there, you know, take and keep the stuff that lines up with the truth of Scripture, that's helpful and useful, and throw out the rest. But see, I would tell you that if you were going to go visit a church and hear a sermon. I would tell you that about this sermon. The Holy Spirit lives in you. Use your heads, listen to God, take the truth, throw out the rest. It's not about throwing out psychology. But what's happened is now we have this big pendulum swing over here because we want to react to all the victim mentality that's happened. And by the way, you know, I've been involved in the recovery ministry here since 1981. And even after I stopped being the recovery pastor and started teaching and Bob was involved, I've never heard anybody here ever one time, ever once, being given permission to just be a victim and blame somebody else for how you are. I've never heard that. Never heard it from the pulpit. It's almost like a straw horse that people, you know, a straw man that people set up that isn't even real anyway so they can knock it down and look like... they have something to say to people's pain. You know what this pendulum swing has done? In our reaction to the victim mentality, what it's done is it's told victims, once again, it's not okay to talk. Done a disservice because it prevents legitimate victims from treating their wounds. Forget what lies behind. Just forget what lies behind. You know, Paul didn't say forget what lies behind in order to tell people they shouldn't look at the wounds of their past. He said forgetting what lies behind referring to his list of self-righteous behaviors by which he used to assess himself positive in God's eyes. And he's saying, I don't do that anymore. I hang on to Jesus. Read your Bible more. Read your Bible more. See, in my opinion, this whole approach heals the wounds of God's people slightly, saying peace, peace, when there is no peace. That's why sometimes when you share with somebody something you're going through, they say, just give it to Jesus. You ever heard that? Just give it to Jesus. Really what they're saying is, just don't give it to me. blaming the victim you know even if we don't blame victims people who have been beat up and wounded they blame themselves I mean I wish I had never heard stories like a rape victim beating herself up for being in the wrong place at the wrong time do you understand something here the person who does the rape is always responsible for the raping Understand this? Can a person learn to make better choices about the street they're hanging on at the time of day they go there? Yes. Are they ever responsible for being raped? No. Is there any good enough reason to be raped? No. Can a wife or an abused child or abused person learn to make different choices in their relationship with people? Yes. Is it ever their responsibility for the abuse that happens to them? No. The abuser is always responsible for the abuse. I had a friend of mine who used to take a blind woman to the grocery store for shopping. One day, she took this woman shopping, and she wanted to go check out the eggplants, so she let her purse sit in the cart with the blind woman. And of course, what happened was someone came and stole the purse. She got her purse stolen. They took all the money out of it and dumped it in the trash can. So she was telling me about, you know, what happened, and one of the things she said was this. She said, I was so stupid to leave my purse with my friend the blind woman. And when she said that, it indicated to me that she was blaming herself. See, she was the victim, do you understand? She was the person whose purse was stolen, and she's blaming herself for having the purse stolen. So I said, no, wait a minute. Who's responsible for getting your purse stolen? She said, well, I am because I left it to be guarded by a blind woman. Now, let me ask you a question. Can she learn to make better choices about who she leaves her purse to be guarded with? Well, yeah. I said, no, that's not why it got stolen. She said, well, because my friend was blind and couldn't guard it. Now who's to blame for her purse getting stolen? The blind woman. I said, no, that's not it. She said, okay, well, why did my purse get stolen? I said, your purse got stolen because there was a thief in Cub Market who steals purses and he stole yours. See, the thief is always responsible for the theft. Do you understand this? Can you learn to make better choices? Where you put your purse, who you let guard your purse. Yes. Does that ever make you responsible for the theft? No, the thief is always responsible for the theft. There's a thief in the grocery store. You can take responsibility for your choices without taking responsibility for the hurtful choices of others. Do you understand that? You can take responsibility for your part without taking responsibility for the hurtful part of the other person. You can let them have their part. Should you have stayed in that hurtful, dead, irrelevant, unhealthy church so long? Maybe not. Are you responsible for the abuse that happened to you there? No. The abuser is always responsible for the abuse. Are you responsible to get whatever healing and insight you need so you don't keep picking hurtful relationships? Yes. Are you ever responsible for the hurtful way someone treats you? No. The hurtful person is always responsible for the hurtful behavior. Okay. All of this to say. that to get to the issue of why do people do this. Why do people blame? Why are we so quick to blame? A couple summary statements and then I'll tell you why. First summary statement, holding someone accountable for their choices is not blaming them. Understand? Holding someone, after the first service, someone came up to me and they said, we never held anybody accountable in the hurtful church we were in because we didn't want to bash people. You understand that holding someone accountable for being hurtful is not bashing them. Shining the light on the ugly thing does not make the thing be ugly. And the light is not the problem. The ugly thing is the problem. Another thing is, this is a common phrase that you hear, making someone responsible. Like, I want to make Bob responsible. I cannot make Bob responsible. Bob makes himself responsible when he does the behavior. As soon as he's done the behavior, he's made himself responsible. I can hold him responsible, but he makes himself responsible. And when you try to hold someone accountable for your choices, that's what blame is. Understand this? Okay, now, I hope that's clear. Why do people do it? The example that Dave gave was tracked all the way back to the Garden of Eden. I'll read you that story quickly, summarize it. What happens is that Adam and Eve eat from the tree, God shows up. It says, they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves in the presence of the Lord among the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called to the man and said, where are you? And he said, I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid myself. And he said, who told you you were naked? Did you eat from the tree which I commanded you not to eat? Which I always think is, it's like the speed cop, you know, who's got you on the radar asking you if you were speeding. Okay? Did you eat from the tree? And the man said, well, the woman, you know, it's her fault. She gave me the apple, and actually you gave me her. So if you wouldn't give me her and she wouldn't give me the apple, I'd be okay. And then he says to the woman, what have you done? And she's not responsible either. It's a serpent. So everybody's blaming everybody else. no one's responsible, and Dave tracked blaming back to this point. And he was accurate. But see, I think you can track why people blame back to this point too. And I think that if you can untangle those two pieces in this, which we're going to do next time, if you can untangle those two pieces, it sets us free to take responsibility for our behavior and move out of the hurtful choices and hurtful places that we are. into health and life and light. Here's the reason. Verse 10. And he said, I heard the sound of you in the garden and I was afraid. Now that's an interesting thing because it's like this. I screwed up. I sinned. I did what I wasn't supposed to do. God, who is the safest person, who is the one who has forgiveness to offer, who has reconciliation to offer, shows up and I hide. Why would I do that? The reason I would do that is because earlier the serpent had painted a picture of God for Adam and Eve, and the picture was that God really doesn't have your best interest in mind. So with a false picture of who God was, when God shows up, instead of running toward God, you see, they ran the opposite direction from God. What's interesting about this is, in order to fix their problem, they covered themselves with leaves. You know, it kind of reminds me of this commercial that's on TV around the Olympics with Michael Jordan. You know, last night he was talking about the difference between the original Olympics and now. Is that the underwear is better? Because, you know, like, originally they just wore a leaf and now they've got Hanes to wear and all this kind of stuff. Well, you know, what's interesting is that Adam and Eve, as soon as they realized they were naked, they covered themselves with a leaf. If you read the rest of the chapter, what you find is that God took skins and covered them. Right from word one, God is doing a better job of covering us than we could do covering ourselves. And yet when the person who shows up that loves us and does that, we run in the opposite direction and hide. Why? Because we have a distorted picture of who God is. And when you have a correct picture of who God is and you screw up and sin, He's the one that you can run toward, not the one you have to hide from. So that's one reason why people do it. Another reason is this. It says in Genesis 2.25, and the man and his wife were both naked and not ashamed. So their state in Genesis 2 was naked and not ashamed. Their state in Genesis 3 is naked and hiding, which means they were ashamed. Now you know how much I like to talk about shame, and I'm not going to get into a big thing about shame here, except to say this. Shame is a view that a person has of themselves. Shame is a defective sense of self. Why don't people take responsibility for their behavior? You know, Mike comes up to me and confronts me about something. Why don't I just say, yes, I did that, and take responsibility for that, and apologize or whatever and get on? Why do I blame somebody else? Why do I take the pointer and push it someplace else? Because I believe that what he confronted me about, what I did, has the power to reflect on who I am. And if it does, I have to push it away. But if I'm a first fruit from God, you see, and I understand what it means that I'm a first fruit because of his behavior, who I am in Christ, you see, and then I screw up, which I do sometimes, and Mike comes and points it out, I could even take responsibility for it, Because the only behavior that reflects on me is Christ's behavior on the cross, not the fact that I did a bad thing in our relationship, you see. So why do people blame? One is because they have a distorted picture of who God is, and the other is because they have a distorted picture of who they are, and those are the two pictures we're going to talk about next time we meet. Okay? So, when we close, as always, The altar team will be here for people who desire prayer. And you're welcome to come and do that. I'd like to close in prayer. Lord, this is just a lot of information. It's hot, a lot of distractions. Part one of two parts, a lot of reasons why not to hear this. I pray that even though there are a lot of reasons not to, that you would utilize this to not just be part one of a sermon that's coming, but just to be helpful and useful and shed light on our situation now and give us courage to look at our lives and give us courage to approach you. Thank you that you love us. Thank you for your truth. Thank you that you cover us better than we can cover ourselves. In Jesus' name, amen.
