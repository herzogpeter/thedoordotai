Using the life of David as a sort of guide, we are beginning today what I will be referring to probably for the next few months as a journey of the heart. It is a journey that I do not have entirely mapped out. I don't know if you've ever gone on a journey like that, maybe a vacation where you kind of know we're going to go west, but we're going to stop where we feel like it. That's how we're going to do this a little bit. I have some places of the heart that I know I want to visit and probably sit down in and stay a while. We need to examine certain things of the human heart. I also hope to be surprised that we might end up going some places and explore some regions of the heart that I didn't expect at the beginning of the journey. In fact, that's one of the reasons we've got a webpage. If you want to log on to our webpage, there's a site you can visit. It's called Journey of the Heart. It's going to have the same logo, I think, that you saw on the screen when you first came in. And what we want to hear is your journey. What we want to hear from you are some journeys of your heart and some areas of the heart that maybe you want to make sure we visit. And we're going to try to do some of that. So it's going to be an interesting journey. It's a journey that I expect to be at times confusing. Because the workings of the human heart are often marked by mystery. Our own hearts often hidden even to us. I expect this journey of the heart to be exhilarating. I also expect it to be messy. If we're going to do an authentic journey of a real human heart, it's going to be a messy journey from time to time. Expect it actually, if we do it well, to be frightening from time to time, but also healing and human and earthy. Above all, it will be spiritual. You see, this journey of the heart is a spiritual journey, and the journey begins today. Our guide for this journey will not be so much a person as it will be a story. The story of David. That is the biblical David and Goliath, king of Israel, David, who, while being noted for many things, may be noted most of all for this, that David had a great heart. He's referred to in the scriptures as being a man after God's own heart. We're going to see that scripture for the first time this morning. 1 Samuel 16. And over the next few weeks and months, we will find David to be a man who had a passionate heart, who had a courageous heart. We're going to find him to be a man who had a worshiping heart, characterized at times by wild abandon. 2 Samuel 6, verse 14. We will find David in worship, dancing before the Lord with all his might. David had a loyal heart in his friendship with Jonathan that we will examine. We're going to see that when David loved you, you stayed loved by that guy. David had a seeking heart. We're going to find out that he had a tender heart and an open heart saying things like this, Search me, O God, and know my heart. I want to open my heart to the spotlight of your truth, God. David had a desiring heart. Psalm 34, he writes these words, Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart. I want you to know that David was an individual who had strong desires. We're going to talk about a desiring heart. We're going to talk about the fact that sometimes in churches, we think the only way you get people to behave is to turn off their desire. I hope that this journey calls out desire for life and for God. David had a desiring heart. We're going to visit that part of the heart, a desiring heart. We are also soon going to discover, however, that David also had a wounded heart. At times he had a forgetful heart. At times a wandering, even deceitful heart. See, one of the things that we may end up discovering about David that actually is a little disconcerting, maybe confusing, is this. That he didn't have a perfect heart. He just had a really good heart. A lot like your heart. And a lot like my heart. See, David had what I would refer to as a mixed bag heart. What will look at times like a contradictory heart. A faltering heart, in fact. The story of David, I want you to know at the very beginning, will not be the story of an uninterrupted ascension into spiritual perfection. For example, David was a great warrior in his youth. He was a great king at least for a while, but he was a failure as a father. And that broke his heart. Oh, Absalom, my son, my son, I think we need to talk about a broken heart. Because that's one of the places that you inevitably visit on any authentic journey into the human heart. Now, in the course of this study, as we deal mostly with passages of Scripture found in 1 and 2 Samuel, which is where we'll see his life, I'm not feeling committed to tell every single story there is to tell about David. I'm most interested in the stories that are going to reveal something to us about his heart. In fact, I wonder how many of you can already tell that this isn't really even going to be just about David's heart. this journey is really going to be about your heart and my heart. A journey of the heart that I expect to be at times frightening and thrilling and messy and healing and human and earthy and altogether spiritual, this journey of the heart. To start the journey, by way of preparation, there's a couple of things I want you to know. And the image I'd have you kind of stir up in your mind as we begin this preparation Sunday, this beginning Sunday, is some things I want you to stick in the suitcase. Stick in your backpack for the journey we are about to take. Two things, at least, I want to make sure you have in your suitcase. One is I want you to have a little bit of information about David. So we're going to pack our suitcases with some information about David. And secondly, I want us to know a little bit more about the heart, your heart and my heart. I want some things about the heart in general to be in our suitcase, to be in our backpack before we start the journey. Let's start with David. Three things I want you to know, three things I want you to have in your suitcase, as it were, as we begin this journey of the heart. First thing about David I want you to know, just basically this, he was an extraordinary person. At just about any level that you can think of, he was an amazing man, a guy by the name of John Herkes in a book entitled simply David. It says this about David. If you had to name a single renaissance man in human history, someone with extraordinary capacities on multiple fronts, David would quite possibly be at the top of the list. David was a musician of such skill that King Saul, who we will meet in weeks to come, would summon David to play, thus banishing his depression when nothing else would work. David's musical capacity served like musical Prozac for King Saul. David was such a courageous warrior that he challenged and defeated an adversary that had intimidated an entire army, and he did it when he was still in his teens. David was such a leader that he attracted the bravest soldiers from among his people to serve with him and defeated his nation's enemies in a way that Israel had never experienced before and would never experience again. In 1 Samuel 16, verse 18, David is described as a mighty man of valor, a warrior, a skillful musician, prudent in speech, a handsome man, and the Lord was with him. It's like he had every card in the deck. He was a poet and a prayer. He wrote the Psalms, Psalms that expressed the longing of the human heart for God so deeply that now, thousands of years later, they remain the single most effective and moving devotional literature ever written. It's as if David wrote the prayer book for the entire human race. David was a statesman of such skill and wisdom that Israel reached its highest level of economic well-being and political stability in its history. His reign would forever be remembered as the golden age of Israel, existing so powerfully in people's memories that they would refer to the Messiah as the son of David because they hoped and believed that whatever the Messiah would do, he would reclaim the glory of David's reign. In many ways, David is the central theme of the entire Old Testament. The life of Abraham, for instance, is dealt with in 14 chapters of the Bible. Now, if you get 14 chapters of the Bible, pretty significant character. Elijah has 10 chapters devoted to his life. David, 66 chapters devoted to his life. He is mentioned 600 times in the Old Testament, another 60 in the New Testament. And the last chapter of the Bible, the last chapter of the last book, the book of Revelation, Jesus himself refers to himself as the root and the offspring of David. So from the beginning to the end of Scripture, his presence is felt. Indeed, to this day, the flag that flies over the nation of Israel bears this one symbol, the star of David. Point of all that is this. The guy's extraordinary. He's an amazing individual. But there's something else I want to have in our suitcase. Stick it in your backpack about David. We need to know this as we move on this journey of the heart. It's this, that he was earthy. He was extraordinary, but he was very down to earth, altogether human, particularly in the expression and the experience of his spirituality. While passionate in his pursuit of God, David was rooted in the earth, in the everydayness of life, he was altogether human. Eugene Peterson in a book that you might be interested in reading even as we go through this story it's one that I'll be referencing quite often entitled Leap Over a Wall said it this way the David story is simultaneously earthy and godly it does not present to us a polished ideal to which we aspire but with a rough edged actuality in which we see humanity being formed The God presence right in the midst of the human condition. I love that book. Peterson captured me early in the book when he said this, and I'm quoting him here. I have an aversion, says Peterson, to what I call boutique spirituality, the nice religion that Henry James once criticized as little more than cathedrals and mild social convenience. The result of that is that the streets of our cities and pews of our churches are crowded these days with emaciated men and plastic women. Limp souls, he calls them. Limp souls who, instead of using their life with God and the reality of God to help them plunge into all of the realities of life, all of the vagaries of life, all of even the pains of life, using their faith to plunge into reality, instead use their faith in God, or what they call faith in God, what they call their spirituality, instead of using it to plunge into life, to escape from life, to insulate and isolate themselves from the realities of life so they don't have to deal with life. You know what that results in? Emaciated men, plastic women, false spirituality. David was none of that. And by the way, if you like that, if you're like that, David's going to confuse you, puzzle you. I hope he calls you to a different way of life. David, emphatically human, profoundly spiritual. We will see David fighting and praying. Sometimes we will see him praying while he's fighting. We will see David loving and sinning. We will see him angry and devious and generous and dancing. And we will see him running. We will see him running often to Goliath. We will see him running from Saul. We will see him running toward God over and over. Even when his heart would begin to wander, you go watch this guy run back to God. Spirituality. Earthy, meaning down to earth, dealing with everydayness, praying while doing the laundry, singing while stuck in traffic. Spiritual, meaning moved and animated by the Spirit of God and therefore alive to God. And alive to God is alive. Connected to life. Not isolated from life. In a cocoon of false spirituality. So David is extraordinary. And David is earthy. But what I'm most interested in David and attracted to about David is his heart. Because it is his heart that in many ways is going to explain to us why he is so extraordinary. It is his heart that is going to explain to us why it is that his spirituality was so very earthy. So open your Bibles if you have them. to 1 Samuel 16, where we get our introduction both to David and his heart. If you have your Bibles and you're looking for it, it's in the Old Testament. It's near the beginning. About to see many of these pages, about this much. Real close. While you're doing that, let me just set the scene for what's going on here before we read the text. Prophet Samuel is sent by God to find and anoint the king of Israel who is going to replace the present king, King Saul. All Samuel knows is that whoever this person is lives in Bethlehem, so he's on his way to Bethlehem. And he's one of Jesse's sons. Jesse had eight sons. Jesse got the news, found out what was going on, couldn't believe it, was very excited that one of his sons would be the Lord's anointed, the king of Israel. So he brings his sons to Jesse. The first he presents to Jesse is the most obvious choice, Eliab, the firstborn. The firstborn would be the obvious choice. But beyond just being firstborn, Eliab was big and strong. He had what it takes. Eliab heard this phrase all his life, Eliab, you the man. And he was expecting to be the man in this as well. Jesse, the father, certainly thought it was Eliab. But when Jesse presented Eliab to Samuel, Samuel was not impressed and God was not impressed. Please note, just a little side note here so you don't spin this off in a direction that it shouldn't go. It's not that there's something wrong with being firstborn, certainly not. And it's not that there's something wrong with being physically strong or having great stature. The fact is, David would be physically strong and have tremendous physical stature. It's just that God was looking for, and God is continually looking for something more. And the something more he's looking for can only be found in one place, the heart. Pick up the story now with that information in verse 7. Eliab has been brought to Samuel. But the Lord said to Samuel, Do not look at his, that would be Eliab's appearance, or at the height of his stature, because I've rejected him. For God sees not as man sees. And this is that famous phrase we all know as being applied to David. For man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart. Then Jesse called to Binadab and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has the Lord chosen this one. Next Jesse made Shammah pass by, and he said, Neither has the Lord chosen this one. Thus Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, The Lord has not chosen these. I'm very confused. And Samuel then said to Jesse, Are these all your children? And Jesse said, Yeah, there remains one more, yet he is the youngest. Eugene Peterson, in his translation of the Bible called The Message, translates youngest the runt. Yeah, I got one more, but he's the runt. of the litter. And behold, he's sending sheep. Obviously, it can't be him. It can't be him. Then Samuel said to Jesse, send and bring him, for we will not sit down until he comes here. And I don't know if I'm reading into the text here, but when Samuel says, listen, Jesse, go get that kid, and we ain't sitting down until he comes here. I sense an energy here in Samuel that anticipates resistance on Jesse's part. We ain't going anywhere until you get that kid here, so go get him now. We ain't sitting down. so he sent and brought him in him being david in and he was ruddy with beautiful eyes and handsome in appearance and the lord said arise samuel anoint him for this is he and samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon david from that day forward and samuel arose and went to ramah before we get kind of into the story here a little bit more. Just a little word, side note, on the reversal of birth order. Most of you know, maybe you don't, that in the Old Testament, birth order was a big thing in those days. All things went to the firstborn. All the rights, the properties, all the privilege and the power went to the firstborn. And God is breaking into that here, saying, I'm changing the order of things. I want you to know that it's not the first time God did that. get some historic perspective. Ishmael was the firstborn. God chose Isaac. Esau was the firstborn. The line would go through Jacob. Ten brothers were born first, but God chose Jacob. Seven brothers were born first. David becomes the king because in the upside-down reality of the kingdom of God, the kingdom of God, which did not begin in the New Testament, in the upside-down reality of the kingdom of God, that has been present from the beginning of time that is continually over time unfolding and revealing itself and injecting itself into the human experience in the upside-down reality of the kingdom of God, God changes the order of things so that the first shall be last and the last shall be first. And it's not because there's something wrong with being first. We miss the point when we think it's that. The reason he changes the order is he is communicating something really important. I'm looking at something beyond the order. I am looking at the heart. Back to the story. God sees something in David that no one else sees. What he sees is his heart. Now just be David here a little bit. He's been out watching sheep. He knows his place in the family. and now God sees his heart and calls him out. This is really good news for David. So this little story here is a story that didn't need to be written down for David. It's a monumental time in his life when God saw his heart and God blessed his heart and God called him out to be the man that God had designed him to be from the beginning. But I want you to consider this also, that while this story here would live in David's spirit all his life as a real good news story, there is in this very same story bad news for David. Where's that? The bad news is this. Nobody else did notice his heart. Nobody else did call out his heart, bless his heart. Most notably, I just couldn't hardly not notice this, that the person most notably who didn't notice his own son's heart was Jesse, David's father. His dad didn't notice his heart, didn't bless his heart, didn't call out the heart of his own son. Now, other people did, and other people often do, call out what God's doing in your life, in my life, that weren't about parents, and that's a good thing. But I have a question. It's just one of the questions that you notice when you get into somebody's story on this journey of the heart. Do you think the fact that David's father, Jesse, didn't notice his heart, didn't bless his heart, didn't call out his son's heart, do you think it affected David? Do you think it might have wounded David in any way? Does it strike you odd when you connect some dots with this story that's basically a really good news story for David? Because God noticed his heart and called it out. That's one of the things we know about David is that he was a great warrior and a great king, at least for a while. But he was a failure as a father, do you suppose? There's a wound in here somewhere. I think we're going to have to talk about a wounded heart. and I think we're going to have to talk about how if you don't deal with the wound in your heart you might just end up embracing that wound and letting that wound become a primary part of your identity turning your heart into a number of different things sometimes making it a passive heart I'm wounded, I can't do anything you can't expect anything of me that's not the image of God, I can tell you that right now sometimes making it a violent heart, sometimes turning a wounded heart into a coward's heart. You don't deal with the wound of your heart. The heart God has for you will never be called out. We need to talk about the wounded heart on this journey of the heart. Well, I think that's enough about David in terms of what we need in the suitcase just to start this journey. Let me tell you a little bit more about the heart, some stuff I want in your suitcase, in your backpack before we even start our journey. Three things about the heart you just have to know, have to have it in the suitcase for this journey. Number one, your heart or the condition of your heart is absolutely central to life. It is central to your ability to do life. It is central to your ability to do your marriage, to raise your children, to pursue a career, to be a whole human being. It is absolutely central to life, especially life in the kingdom of God. Let me just consider these scriptures. Love the Lord your God with all your what? Hearts. Trust in the Lord with all your what? Heart. Man looks on the outward appearance. God looks at the heart. These people honor me with their lips, but their what? Hearts are far from me. Therefore, above all else, says Proverbs 4.23, above all else, guard your heart. Take care of, pay attention to your heart. Why? For from the heart flow all the issues of life. In a book that I highly recommend, that I am sure we will be referencing quite often in the course of this journey of the heart, entitled, Waking the Dead, John Eldridge points out, and I'm quoting him here, that the subject of the heart is addressed in the Bible more than any other topic. More than works or service, more than belief or obedience, more than money, and even more than worship. But keep in mind, of course, he says, that all those things are matters of the heart. Consider these realities of the heart revealed to us in Scripture that confirms again the centrality of the heart. Scriptures tell us that the heart can be troubled. You can have a troubled heart. The heart can be wounded. It can be pierced, grieved, and broken. Good news is that the heart can also be cheerful, glad, merry, joyful, and rejoicing. You can have a whole heart, or you can have a divided heart. The heart, according to Scripture, can be bold, steadfast, upright, and true, or it can be frightened, faint, forgetful, and dull. Over and over, one of the things Jesus said to the disciples was, you are slow of heart. You are slow of heart, so you can have a slow heart. And one of the things, if we decide to talk about dullness of heart and slowness of heart, one of the things we're going to have to move into around that is that Jesus wasn't particularly gentle with them. Oh, you have little faith. I'm calling out your heart, would say Jesus often to the disciples. And it wasn't always in a real, oh, you poor guy. You know what? I need your heart. I'm calling out your heart. Heart can be wicked according to Scripture. It can be perverse or it can be pure. Blessed are the pure in heart. But of all the things that can happen to your heart, I think the worst may be this. to lose heart. Which leads to the second thing I want you to know about your heart. You just have to have it in your suitcase. Stick it in your backpack. As we begin to make this journey, it's this, that your heart is under assault and so is mine. And the point of this journey, to tell you the truth, is to fight for your heart. In fact, part of the reason I wanted to go on this journey, I told you this when I came back from my break when I talked about how I spent my summer vacation. Part of the reason I wanted to go on this journey was to fight for my own as well. Three weeks ago, we prayed a prayer. We were coming near the end of the Lord's Prayer. We came to the place where Jesus said to pray this way, lead us not into temptation. The word temptation, if you were here, you remember, does not mean an enticement to sin. It means trial, testing, wilderness experience. God, lead us not into wilderness experiences. In fact, we found that Jesus prayed that very same way when in the garden he said, let this cup pass from me. Lead me not into that trial, but thy will be done, said Jesus. And so do we in the Lord's prayer. Thy will be done. Thy kingdom come. And if what you are calling me into, leading me into, as it were, just the same way Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted to be going through a trial. If we're going to go into that kind of thing, here's the next part of my prayer, Lord. Deliver us, empower us to go through the evil day. Deliver us from the evil one. The evil one who goes about as a roaring lion, 1 Peter 5, seeking whom he may devour. three weeks ago as we talked about that reality we talked about the primary tactics that the evil one uses to devour people like you and me are these number one he intimidates he is a roaring lion we invited people to come forward at the end of that service remember that who were hearing the roar of the lion and some of you were hearing it three weeks ago and some of you are hearing the roar of the lion still or again today that's what he does he intimidates out of that intimidation out of that roaring lion thing he then accuses and among the things he accuses you of is is are things like this whatever trouble you're in right now you know it's your own fault you are such a loser you don't have what it takes you're going down this and god you think god loves you if god loved you you wouldn't be in a mess like this. He accuses God. He accuses you. And out of the intimidation and out of the accusation, something inside of us gets worn down. And then the third tactic is to entice you, not so much to sin, but to despair. Where you lose heart, where we lose hope. And if you lose heart, If you lose hope, you then become easy pickings for Satan and for sin behaviors that normally would not even have an appeal to you. You find yourself drawn to because you've lost heart, you've lost hope. And this little stupid thing over here would, I even know, it's going to feel good for about 10 minutes, but 10 minutes, feeling good, I'll settle for 10 minutes because something happened before you were dealing with something where you lost heart and you lost hope. I'm fighting for your heart on this journey. C.S. Lewis writes, The story of your life is the story of a long and brutal assault on your heart. There really is a glory to your life that the enemy sees, even if you don't see it, and most of you don't, there really is a glory to your life that the enemy sees, and he is hell-bent on destroying that glory before you can act on that glory, so he attacks your what? Heart. You ever lost heart? I have. I mean, a question like that, have you ever lost heart? That's like asking, are you a human being? Have you been on the journey, you know, like more than 10 minutes? You've lost heart. Then you've lost heart from time to time. You know, I don't always identify losing heart as losing heart. I identify other things in my... See, when I lose heart, I can tell. Because when I lose heart, I begin to live in fear. That's how I can tell. I play it safe. I hunker down. I keep my job. I don't rock the boat. I'm careful always to say the right thing. I hardly ever say the real thing. One of the ways I can personally tell that I've lost heart is I disengage. And what's cool about disengaging, I do it so well, I can give you advice how to do it. You can do it without anybody knowing, at least for a while. I disengage. And I can disengage from my marriage. I can disengage from my parenting. I can disengage. And when I've lost heart, I do disengage. I can disengage from life. Nobody knows. I've still got a smile on my face. In fact, I make extra care. I work extra hard to make sure I have a smile on my face when I've disengaged. So nobody suspects I've disengaged. I really don't do that. I get sick of the fact that I'm not very hard to read. I walk down the hall. What's wrong? What do you mean? Shut up. What do you mean what's wrong? I hate that. I think I'd rather die than lose heart I'm not kidding when I say that I think there's a lot of worse there are a lot of things that are worse than dying and losing heart losing hope would certainly be one of them I think we need to talk about losing heart on this journey of the heart. We couldn't possibly take an authentic journey that was really about the heart and not visit what it feels like to lose heart. And I'll tell you something else we need to talk about, what it takes to find your heart that has been lost. We've got to talk about that. 1 Samuel 17, the very next chapter, we have the story of David and Goliath. It's a famous story. Everybody knows that even if you never went to church, You've heard of David and Goliath. It's kind of a metaphor for the little guy beating the big guy. It's a wonderful story of courage and faith, but it's also a story of what it looks like when people lose heart. I mean, I'm just as interested in those soldiers who were all amassed around this Goliath guy, and every single one of them were scared to go because they lost heart. It's incredible what losing heart does to the heart of a man or a woman. in the movie the legend of bagger vance main character played by matt damon was the best golfer that the south had ever seen he had a natural swing he could feel his swing it was just totally instinctive he was he was just became a legend even at a very young age and in his amateur status he was in his amateur years he was in a in a tournament where he teed off and hit a ball off the tee so far that they stopped the entire tournament to measure the ball because they couldn't believe that it went that far. The guy was a tremendous golfer. Then he went to the war. And in the war, he experienced things, saw things that wounded his heart and caused something inside of him to die so that when he came home, the love of his life was of no interest to him. The game that he loved to play, that he'd kind of been created by God to play, he had this incredible swing. He didn't play anymore. He hid from life, and all he did was drink. Never golfed again. He lost his swing. And what the story is about is his journey to finding his swing again. How many of you know that that movie was not about golf? It was a movie about losing heart, about losing your swing. Let me ask you a question. Have you lost your swing? You ever lose your swing? Do you know you have one? God put one in you. It isn't about golf. I'm not talking about golf. Have you lost heart? well we need to find that again we need to find your heart again and we need to find your swing again and I'm hoping this journey will help us find our swing and find our heart and find mine too so let's see the third thing last thing we need to know about our heart and this is the last thing and you just got to have this in your backpack before we go. And you may not feel this, but I'm sticking it. If you won't put it in your bag, I'm sticking it in your bag. Okay? While you ain't looking, I'm going to unzip your bag and I'm sticking this in it. This is it. You can't make this journey unless you know this, that you have a good heart, that you have a good heart. We talk a lot in the church about original sin. I think we need to know that before original sin, please get this, there was original glory. You, in the beginning, were created in the image of God. We'll talk about original sin. And because we talk about original sin, we are really drawn to verses that speak of the heart being deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. You have a desperately wicked heart. Before original sin, there was original glory. God put glory into you. Sin came, and we lost our what? We lost our hearts. We lost our heart. And then the God who made us said, I'm coming for your heart. And the God who lives in heaven became a man, died on the cross, so we could recover our heart. And I want to speak some truth to you this morning. If you are in Christ, if Christ is in you, you may not be able to feel this this morning, but here is the truest thing about you. It's this, that you have a new heart, a redeemed heart. You have a washed, clean heart. You have an alive to God heart. You have a good heart. It may not be a perfect heart, but it's a good one. Now, as you sit here right now, your good heart, your new, redeemed, washed clean, alive to God heart, may also be, at the same time, a wounded heart. This journey of the heart's going to be a confusing journey. It may also be, in addition to being alive to God, washed clean, redeemed new, may also be a weary heart, may right now be a wandering heart. And you're wondering if you can even come home to your heart. today we're going to begin a journey of the heart and my prayer for the journey is this that some of us maybe all of us would recover our heart and reclaim our heart and find our heart so we can live as free men and women from the heart when I was a kid I have a vivid memory of weird things. I don't know why I even remember this, but we would go on vacation. We'd often leave very early in the morning. It was still dark. We'd all pile in the car. We were about to go on this big, long journey. Before my dad would put the transmission into reverse, we would all stop and we would pray. I don't know why I remember that, but we would pray. We would pray for, among other things, journeys, mercies. Well, folks, here we are. We're in the driveway. I haven't put the car into reverse yet. We haven't left on the journey yet. And before we leave, I want to pray. For among other things, journey is mercy. And like my dad prayed for our family, in a moment I'm going to pray for us on this journey. But before I pray, I want you to pray. And I want you to pray and come to God and ask him for what you need for this journey. Here's the question. What kind of mercies do you need for this journey? If we're going to do a journey of the heart, what kind of grace might you need for this journey? What kind of awakening might you need for this journey? Why don't you just be with God right now? We're sitting in the driveway, haven't even put the transmission in reverse. We're about to leave. Ask him for what you want. Ask him for what you want on this journey. It's you and God. Thank you. Father, I pray that as we begin this journey together, that you would help us identify the places on this journey that we need to stop, that you would help us notice the things you want us to notice, that we would be free to drive by certain things, but others to just say, wait, wait, wait, we need to stop and look at this and sit down in this and maybe spend a week or two here in this little town, this little region of the heart. Help us do that, I pray, in Jesus' name. And the other thing I pray, Lord, as we have identified David as kind of the guide, we're using his story as our guide for this journey of the heart. As grateful as I am for his story, Lord, I just need to say, as we're sitting in the driveway here about to begin, that the real guide that I think we need is you, not David. Thanks for David, we're grateful. But we need you to be our guide. Please, God, be our guide on this journey the heart and use this to call out our hearts so we can be men and women who are living in the kingdom of God from the heart, alive to God and life. We pray it in Jesus' name. Amen.
