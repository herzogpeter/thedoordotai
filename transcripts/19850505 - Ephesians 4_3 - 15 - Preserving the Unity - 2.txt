The book of Ephesians, chapter 4, verse 3, and let's pray before we do anything. Father, I too thank you for the Spirit that is here this morning. Continue to work in us as we open your Word, that every one of us would apply as it needs to be applied. In your name, amen. Being diligent to preserve the unity. We are in a second week of what I guess I'm having to call a parenthesis. This is not exactly expository preaching in the book of Ephesians anymore. I'm kind of using this as a springboard to get into some other thoughts that I believe for our church are very timely and very necessary. but much of the things i'm thinking and much of the things i'm feeling and much many of the things i want to share with you are born very directly from our study in the book of ephesians as we're considering the body of christ what the body is and how it's to function how it's to look and how we who are parts of the body are to be relating to each other and we have been specifically stimulated by this little phrase here being diligent to preserve the unity to protect the unity, to defend it, to do whatever it takes to maintain it, to see it as a mandate from the word of God and therefore a priority of the church. A man by the name of John Powell said these words I find very pointed. Our lives are shaped by those who love us and by those who refuse to love us. That statement does some crazy things to me. It makes me feel real warm and it makes me feel real cold at the same time as the truth of that begins to hit me. One theologian put it this way, it is not civilization and culture nor blood and soil that can unite men. It is only love, sacrificial, self-giving love. One of the things that's happening to us as a church as we begin to understand the biblical concept of the body of Christ Jesus in the world, that's us, is that we have begun to learn that it is no longer good enough for us to come to church just to worship. Worship is part of it, and it is an important part. It is an essential part. But we do not come when we understand the body and how it functions and what it means to be part of it. We don't come here together just to sing the songs, just to hear the blessed songs that touch our hearts just to hear the sermon. In fact, if that is all we're coming for, we are missing as believers something that is extremely essential in terms of our spiritual growth. Hebrews 10 says this, we all know it, not forsaking, do not forsake your assembling together. As the habit of some is, why? Why is that important? Well, of course, we all know if you don't come together to the assembly, as some people do, you won't hear the sermon. I think that's important. I think it's important that we hear the sermon, the kerygma, the didache, the teaching of the word of God. We have to have that. It's absolutely essential. But that's not what this text is saying. Don't forsake your assembling together. Why? Because it's fellowship that we need. It's fellowship that we need. It's the provocation of my life that takes place when I'm placed next to you and you're burning for Jesus and you're learning to reach out and you touch me and I learned to turn on that same way. It's the fellowship that we need. Fellowship is the fire of the church. Sermons are fine and they are essential. Singing is fine and that is essential. But fellowship is the fire. The picture I get as we're going into this a little bit deeper is that of just a bunch of coals sitting together and they're all on fire and they're all lit. but one of the things that happens when you light coals is it's like one coal lights the other. It provokes the other one to fire. And if you take one of those coals out of that fire and place it by itself, immediately it's going to begin to cool. And we need to come together when the fire is here. We need to be here by the fire so that I can be warmed by you, and you can be warmed by me, and I can be provoked by you to love and good deeds. And I want to say something else. If the fire of fellowship has grown cold and all of the coals are cold, one of the things we have to do before we do anything is find at least one coal that is burning hot and bring it in and fan the flame and get the other ones going. We are in the process of fanning the flame. We need to understand that the church that changes the world must be a fellowship. It must be a fellowship. And as believers, we cannot be allowed to drift in and out, to kind of come and participate as if we were spectators. We as believers, any believer, I don't care if you're a member of our church or not, this is understanding the body of Christ. We cannot be allowed to drift in and out as if we were samplers of the wares, you know, going from one thing to another, like a little kid in a candy store saying, I like this and I like this and I don't like that and da-da-da-da-da. We are part of a body. the body is a fellowship that's a fellowship within which there is responsibility and there is accountability and there is ministry and every one of us as part of that body are responsible to participate in that one of the things that i think we have problems with and understanding the concept of the body is that whether we realize it or not see mentally i think we all go like this when we think of the body we we nod our heads yes i understand i've been heard that all my life. The problem is we live in a society that's totally individualistic. I am told from the time I'm a little kid that I need to stand on my own two feet. I need to be able to do it alone. I need to be independent. And the more independent I am, the stronger I am and the better I am. I don't need anybody. We love individual stories. I have my individual house. I have my individual family. I have my individual checkbook and all my individual little things and my personal things and I even have a personal relationship with Jesus. It's me and him. And that's wonderful. But what we need to understand is that we are part of a body. We are part of a bigger whole. And I think it's very easy for the church, even the church, when we claim the name of Jesus, to even without knowing that we're doing it, begin to drift away from the concept of the body and that desperately we need each other and we need to be touching one another. Not long ago, I got a hold of an article written by a man by the name of Michael Griffiths, and he was talking about the problem of fellowship in the church today. And he was speaking specifically about one particular phenomenon called the drive-in church to begin with, and I'm going to just say what he said. He said, then there is that monstrosity, the drive-in church. You kind of wonder where he's at on the drive-in church, don't you? Whether he likes it or not. I don't think he does. which on the exterior appears to be thoroughly contemporary, related to drive-in banks, drive-in theaters, fast food chains, and yet is surely a total denial of what the church is really all about. The drive-in church fosters my oscillation. It fosters my selfishness beautifully. You see, I can go to worship without ever leaving my car. I can go to worship and I don't have to meet anybody. I don't have to touch anybody. No fellowship, no accountability, no responsibility, no way. the whole concept of the drive-in church is positively nauseating. I'm quoting. But this is where it gets to the meat, and I want us to catch this. The real tragedy, however, is that in our everyday garden variety churches, where the church members come sitting in pews, that maybe even there, they are just as walled in by their own reserve as anyone ever is by a car window. just as we might speak of those who are mentally or socially maladjusted we might also speak of some christians who are genuinely born again and to a certain extent nourished by their feeding on the word but are spiritually defective retarded congregationally maladjusted people who merely maintain their private devotions and float casually from church to chapel to assembly grazing and nibbling where their fancy might take them without ever becoming integrated and involved in a congregation of God's people. They are missing something essential. They will never develop and mature properly as Christians if they maintain a life of spiritual isolation. And then it goes on, and he finishes his whole article by saying this, their dear people is a big difference between a body being frozen together in the jaws of theological truth and a body that is melted together by the fires of a loving and all-inclusive fellowship. Fellowship. Fellowship. You and me touching and caring and being alive. How do we preserve it? How do we get it? How do we get the fire going? We started last week by studying fellowship. And the first thing we would do, because I'm the pastor and I am supposed to do these things, is we will study the theology of fellowship. Won't that be wonderful? well it is it is but if we leave it there it isn't wonderful at all there's no fire in that that God in Christ has made us one that we are all one in verses 4 through 6 of Ephesians 4 there is one body one spirit one Christ one call we are one that's wonderful the problem is is that I can have that bonding and we can all understand that you and I are one theologically and we can still walk by one another in the hall and never meet and never touch and never care and never get involved so the fire is not in that theological truth something is missing what is it? well we had to go on last week we talked about an example of fellowship what would be an example of fellowship? we moved to Acts chapter 2 and we saw some people who had fellowship we saw some people who were doing it they were bound together this New Testament church not by superficial and occasional contacts but every day they were together and living together house to house and everyone was included a tremendous fellowship and we saw what they did And we looked at their form and we could imagine how they met. And we think they must have had small groups or they must have had large groups. And we kind of look at that whole thing. And one of our first reactions to that is that if that was their form, that's the form we must use. If that's what they did, that must be the key. The external acting out of their love for each other is what we must do. So what we'll do is if they sat on the floor, we should sit on the floor. If they were hugging each other, we should hug each other. In fact, we're going to incorporate into our service a hug time, and everybody will stand up and hug. Won't that be wonderful? Just give fellowship. No, we discovered right away that that had nothing to do with it, that the things they were doing, the external forms that were developed, were nothing more than an outgrowth of something far deeper. But we have such a tendency to look at the external and figure that that must be the key. What we really need is large groups. What we really need is small groups. What we really need is medium groups. What we really need is prayer groups, fellowship groups, teaching groups. We discovered last week that maybe what we really need is a change of heart. And that's when we got down to the guts of what fellowship really is, as we talked about the foundation of fellowship. And last week, I'm still in my introduction here. We'll get to it. Last week we discovered that the key to real fellowship is a little word called one another. And I have to just kind of share with you right now that I feel like we could have very easily just gone on and left the things that I shared with you last week, and it would have been enough. And yet as I was going through these other one another's, these other exhortations from the Word of God to tell us so clearly and practically how I'm supposed to treat you and how you're supposed to treat me, I just felt compelled and I felt that God had stopped me here. And so we're going to stop and we're going to consider today, this morning together, some more of these practical things that I need to do with you and you need to do with me specifically, one another. One another. So you want to have a powerful church. You want to have a going church and you want to fill the church up. What do you think we should do? Love one another. Love one another. That's one we gave you last week. And we sing the songs and we can even get a tear in our eye and we sing songs like we'll know they're Christians by their love and all you need is love and all those wonderful things and I don't know if it connects with you the way it connects with me, but I can really get into it and get real emotional about that. And I see little butterflies pitter-pattering around and little tinkly bells and, oh, just love. And it's just so pretty and it's just so nice. And some of you guys are going, and some of you people are going, oh, it's just love one another. I guess every once in a while, that's okay, but every once in a while, I think when we hear exhortations like this to love one another, we also need to hear the thundering voice of God as he's telling us to love one another because this is important. This is essential. We're going nowhere without it. Love one another. 1 John 3, 14. The word of God speaks very clearly and it's speaking of salvation when it says this. The way we know, the way I know, talking about assurance of salvation, how do I really know I'm a believer? How do I really know I'm in the kingdom? How do I really know I'm part of the body? Here's the way. The way I know that I have passed from death to life is because I love the brethren. It doesn't leave it there, though. It goes on and says something even deeper. And the one who does not love his brother is walking in death. See, one of the things we say is, well, you know, I'm dealing with somebody on salvation, I'm dealing with somebody on assurance, and one of the things we say right away is, well, when were you saved? And we say, well, I know that I was saved and I know I'm part of the kingdom because on July 26th at 4 o'clock, I knelt by the side of my bed and I prayed to Jesus, or I raised my hand, or I went forward, or I cried, and oh, wonderful, you know what the word of God says, the way you know you're one of the kingdom, you're part of the kingdom, part of the body, it's because when you met Jesus, the confirming factor of that faith is that it affected a change in your life, it affected a change in your heart, the way I know that I'm one of his is because I love. And maybe some of you are asking, what if I don't, what if I don't, what if I'm not into that? What if I don't feel that at all? And what if the characteristics of my life isn't love at all? What I feel like I want to say is, don't worry about it. It's okay. You know what? But the Word of God doesn't let me say that. The Word of God comes to me and says, David, you're going to have to say to them the way Paul said to the church in Corinth, test yourselves. Test yourselves to see if you're in the faith. Because if you don't have love, if you don't have love, there's reason to believe that you don't have him. Paul wrote to that church in Corinth. It was the only book, you know, we loved that 1 Corinthians 13 where he talks to us about love and tells us what it is. It was amazing how he had to tell them what it was. Remember when he wrote to the church in Thessalonica? He said this to them, I don't have to tell you anything about love. You know about love. You're practicing it. God has been your teacher. To the church in Corinth, it was wrapped up in jealousies and strife and anger and all sorts of bitterness between them. He said, this is what love is. I want to tell you all about it. Test yourselves. Love one another. Love one another. Kindly be affection toward one another. Be kindly affection toward one another. Be devoted to one another is one of the other ones we did last week, Romans 12, 10. Another one we did last week, the third and final, was an honor to prefer one another. And last week I talked about the fact that that simply means to serve one another. But I got some more meaning out of it this week and I think this is really quite a bit different. It means simply this, to prefer one another in honor. In honor, prefer one another. Let me say it a little bit different so you might get the meaning. In honor, prefer one another. When it comes to honor, prefer one another. When it comes to deciding who gets the honor, who gets the credit, let you get the credit. Prefer one another. I think that's neat. When it comes to honor, you get the credit. I heard a statement not long ago that said it's amazing, it would be amazing what God could do in the church if people wouldn't care who got the credit. In honor, prefer you. I heard a story not long ago of two pastors who were having a Sunday school contest between the two churches. And they were really going at it and it was really important. And the final thing came where one of the churches won and one of the churches lost. And the pastor of the church that lost the contest was so distraught and so upset and so disturbed that he wasn't getting the credit and he wasn't getting the pat on the back that he went home and threw up. Kind of makes you feel like going home and throwing up, doesn't it? In honor, prefer one another. That's something I can do. Here's some more. Again, I just want to catch your heart on these so simple, so practical things that I can do to minister to the body, to be part of the body, to help the body grow. You want to know what you can do? Here's something you can do. James 5.16. Confess sins. to one another. Confess sins to one another. Now this verse basically has two simple dimensions. One is the very general sharing of myself. This is not speaking of standing up publicly and making great, big, vast, intricate personal confessions in front of the whole body. It's not what it's talking about here. It's talking of something a little bit more personal between you and me. A sharing of myself. A confessing of my heart. A sharing with you. an opening of my heart, a sharing with you of my struggle and my pain and places in my life where I'm inconsistent. And I have to be honest with you, one of the things I try to do when I preach is share with you the struggles that I go through and confessing, confessing to one another, a public kind of thing, a general sharing. There's two very serious problems, and the reason I mention this, there's two very serious problems in our lives if we don't do this. One of the problems is this. If I don't share with you my heart, if I don't share with you my pain, And if I don't share with you my struggle and inconsistency, there's no way in the world that you're going to be able to minister to me. None. None. And if you don't share with me your pain a little bit, if you don't share with me your hurt and your inconsistency, there's no way I can get in there and minister to you. Excuse me. The other problem is this, that if you're not opening your heart to people, you're not going to have anybody opening to you because people have a hard time with perfection and they're not going to be able to deal with that. Specific confession also. A general kind of confession and also a specific confession. And that is found in Matthew 5.23 where it says this, Therefore, if you have brought your gift to the altar and there you remember that you have wronged your brother, leave your offering at the altar, go your way, first be reconciled to your brother and then come and present your worship. This just again emphasizes the tie, the integration between worship and fellowship, doesn't it? I have no business at all coming here and lifting holy hands to God if I know that I've got something wrong with you, if I know I've just had a fight with my wife. I'll tell you this, I guarantee that I've preached the lousiest sermons of my whole life on days that you have a fight with your wife, right? He was really boring today. Church was really bad today. He didn't get anything out of church. There's no way you can come and worship and adore the Lord when you know there's something wrong with a relationship. Get your relationships and the body straight before you come to the altar with your gift. And don't you dare expect, don't be so naive and don't be so presumptuous as to believe that you can come and God would accept your gift. Unless those relationships have been mended. Confess your sin to one another. And then you know what we do here in this church? Then we forgive one another. Then we forgive one another. be kind, tenderhearted, forgiving one another. How? Just the same way Christ forgave you. What a tender thing it was last Sunday night when we had our agape feast. And people stood and shared their hearts and some just said, I've been wrong. I've been so wrong and I've been wrong to you. And the person he said it to stood up and said, Huh! Yeah! No, no. There was confession. and then there was forgiveness and then the body was built you know what we do here? we confess our sin I share with you my hurt I share with you my struggle and then you forgive and then we're built up you want to build a church? do that confess your sin, forgive another, third encourage, real simple aren't these profound? we've heard these a million times encourage one another build one another up 1 Thessalonians 5.11 says those exact words therefore encourage one another and build one another up the word there is parakaleo it means simply this to come alongside and to strengthen to come alongside and to comfort to come alongside and to encourage the parakletes of John's gospel was none other than the Holy Spirit and what did he do? he was the comforter, right? the Holy Spirit, the comforter the one who comes alongside and encourages and builds up. These aren't the kind of things that I can kind of stand up here and preach. We need so much to make these practical. What can you do with that? I want you to think of somebody right now. I really do. I want you to think of somebody right now that you know who's hurting, who's got pain, who feels detached. Maybe there's a lot of parents in this congregation right now who are worried because their kids aren't coming through. And maybe not even a whole lot of people in our church know that their kids aren't coming through and that their kids are having a rough time, but you know. You got that person in your mind? You know what you need to do? You need to go alongside that person. You need to be the one who comes alongside and pours your strength into them. Be an encourager. There's people in our church right now whose kids are hurting because of your parents. And there's alienation. There's wives in our congregation here that are hurting. And husbands because their marriage is nothing near what it needs to be. And nobody would know. And if people knew, they'd go crazy. You know, you just know I couldn't share that. But maybe somebody here knows. You know what you need to do if you know? You need to come alongside. You need to come alongside and put your arm around and encourage them and pour your strength into them. There are people in our church, we know this already, we've talked about it all morning, who are really suffering because of sickness, disease, and death. You know what you need to do? You need to come alongside. You need to come alongside and be the encourager. Be the one who comes alongside and builds up and pours your strength into them. You know what else I want you to think about this morning? as we're applying this together. I want you to think about somebody who's ministering in our church now. And this is kind of getting away from the big pain thing and all the hurt in the marriage, but just someone who, and I think a lot of you are getting a name right now, someone who is just faithful. They're not real, I don't see them a lot, but they're faithful and they're here and they're giving and they're serving and you don't even know that maybe they're discouraged. Maybe they are and maybe they aren't, but they're just faithful and they're teaching that Sunday school class quarter after quarter. And they're playing the piano. We're playing the organ all the time. I think of children's church. We never see those people. And they're serving and they're laboring. You know what you need to do? You need to come alongside. We need to be a church where we're coming alongside each other and building each other up. Before you leave this morning, pour your strength into someone. I mean it. Before you leave this morning, come alongside someone and pour your strength into them. Before you go to bed tonight, Write the note. Be the encourager. You want to build the church and build the body? Encourage one another. Build each other up. Come alongside. 1 Thessalonians 2.7, Paul says this, and we see how he ministered in this way. He says, But we prove to be gentle among you, even as a mother nourishes her child, having thus this fond affection for you, a fond affection for you. Because we had that fond affection, we did not just come and impart to you the gospel of truth, the gospel of Christ, but we gave to you our very lives. Fond affection. I love that word fond. It has to do with body heat. It means we touched each other. We touched each other and we got involved with each other. Listen, folks, we don't come here and I don't come here just to kind of academically crank out doctrine and crank out Sunday school lessons and crank out sermons. No, the fire of the church is that we touch. The fire of the church is that body heat, the warmth. caring for one another come alongside and encourage a fourth very quickly receive one another receive one another romans 15 7 says that accept one another just as christ also has accepted you simply means this open your heart to one another open your heart to each other open your arms don't close your compassion to anyone there's only one reason in the world that we would close anyone off or separate anyone, and we know that would be simply for reasons of doctrinal error that would lead to death, serious kind of sin, and also some sort of moral sin that was obvious, and we would have to cause a separation for the purpose of restoring that fellowship. But other than that, the context of Romans 14, 15, where this exhortation is given, is given in a place where he's talking about Jew and Gentile, weak and strong. And the exhortation is this, whether they're weak or whether they're strong, whether they're a Jew or whether they're a Greek, welcome them, receive them. Don't shut yourself off to anyone. This one bothers me. Receiving one another. Because we can be so small in this area. We can be so petty and sometimes maybe the real pain is that the pain of not receiving someone, the pain of kind of cutting someone off is very, very subtle. I can feel very much like I'm open and warm and ready to receive anyone and yet who do you have in your home who do you who do you spend time with who do you greet who do you care about who are you coming alongside and encouraging and if you're finding yourself doing it with the same four people all the time then you need to expand yourself in that area who do you shut out of your life whether because of anger or whether very subtly either way we need to open up to this man um the book of matthews 10 verse 40 says this he who receives you receives me and he who receives me receives the father you know what that's saying it's saying simply this you open your heart if i open my heart to you i'm opening my heart to him that's it if i open my heart to you i'm opening my heart to him the book of mark chapter 9 verse 37 says whoever receives one child like this in my name what receives me when i receive that little child and bring him to myself i'm receiving him you know what that means the fact is this that man is created in the image of god and especially the believer who is part of the body and has received the holy spirit and the holy spirit is living within you do you know what it means for me to shut you out grievous sin grievous sin if i'm shutting you out i'm shutting him out and if there's people here that either subtly or just blatantly are being shut out by me i need to be rebuked for that the body can't shut anybody out receive one another and now just about as you have formulated your reasons why you will receive everyone but him that one guy you know you have problems with we have to ask ask this question and look at how we're supposed to receive one another the way we're supposed to receive one another is the way he received us and how did he receive us gladly that's how gladly and that's all when i came to him and brought my heart to him he didn't look at me and say well oh i guess if you want to get saved i don't know how to keep you out you're an undesirable character no he didn't do that he received me gladly and he receives you gladly and i know that because every time a soul comes to him in repentance the angels rejoice and the angels simply reflect the heart of god receive one another you know barbara barbara's a young woman who comes to our church a lot of times in the evenings and she's not here this morning that's why i'm going to talk about it barbara's the young woman who sometimes in the middle of my sermon opens the door and bangs it shut and then walks right down the middle of the aisle the whole way waving at me and saying hi to you or you whoever she may see barbara Barbara isn't all there very simple in her mind very simple love for Jesus very simple love for you and for me and Barbara embarrasses me I lose my place I don't know how to react and I think in my mind what should we do with Barbara the fever how Barbara's easy for me some of you are hard for me and i am hard for some of you the people i live with and the people i work with how do i receive you gladly we need to be the body the last one another for this morning is this admonish one another admonish one another this almost seems out of character doesn't it with all this lovey-dovey stuff admonish one another romans 15 14 encourages us to do that and it means simply this counsel with a view to a change in behavior to warn to warn people revealing the consequences if the course is not altered altered Colossians 1 28 says we preach Christ admonishing every man warning every man teaching every man with wisdom so that we may present every man complete part of the ministry is to warn part of the ministry is to admonish it's speaking the truth and love first thessalonians 5 14 says i urge you to admonish the unruly encourage the faint-hearted help the weak and don't give up on anybody be patient with all men admonishing is part of the responsibility of the leadership of the church admonishing is part of the responsibility of the body to be doing that with each other we're going to get into that deeply when we get deeper into ephesians 4 where it says to do that speaking the truth and love to admonish to warn to say this if we don't change our course of behavior these are going to be the consequences and they're going to be things we don't like at all we have to warn and just as i closed this morning the admonishment today is simple it's this that if we as a body of believers are not committed to a fervent love that if we are not committed to preferring one another when it comes to honor well if we are not committed to kind affection to one another if we are not committed to confessing our sin to one another and then forgiving one another and if we are not committed to being the kind of people who are consistently coming alongside and pouring in our strength into other people and if we are not committed to receiving one another then here's the warning the fire will go out the joy will be gone the unity will be theological and never practical and we'll be frozen together when we need to be melted together be diligent to preserve the unity and the bond of peace because we are one body and one spirit and one Lord and we have one faith and one baptism and one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all. Be diligent. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, continue to work this not only in our hearts but in our lives. Amen. Thank you.
