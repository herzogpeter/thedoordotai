I'd like you to open your Bibles with me, 1 John chapter 4, where we have been for several weeks, as most of you know, examining and affirming the centrality, priority, and necessity of living a life of love. Verse 21, chapter 4, and this is the commandment we've heard from him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also. Verse 7, beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God and everyone who loves is born of God. In chapter 3, verse 11, it affirms that this is not only the theme of the entire epistle, but it's the focus of the entire gospel. When John says this, for this is the message that we have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. The reason that that is such a central thing, well, at least among other reasons, one of the primary reasons is revealed for us in verse 12. And verse 12 has kind of become for us the focus of the entire chapter. It's this, that there's a problem. No man has seen God. Therefore, it creates a problem having a relationship with Him. But if we love one another, the way that John is calling for us to love each other, it has the power to reveal the face of God to men and women who have never seen Him. But all of that has raised a question for us, a question that we have found more difficult to answer than might have been expected. The question is this, what is love? Having seen the importance of it, having been called to do it, what is it? More to the point, actually, we've been asking that question this way. What does love look like in different situations, at different times with different people? For the obvious fact is this, there are different kinds of love. Love is not, we have discovered, a one-size-fits-all proposition that uniformly expresses itself as a warm and gooey feeling for the whole wide world. We have discovered these weeks that there is a love that stands against, that says no, that imposes a consequence. There is a love more stern and splendid than mere kindness, says C.S. Lewis. It isn't warm and gooey, saccharine sweet, but it is love. Jesus said, love your neighbors. And I've had a pretty good idea of what that kind of love looks like and what it feels like. But he also said, love your enemies. What does that kind of love look like? And what does that kind of love feel like? Is it warm and gooey, saccharine and sweet? Probably not. Probably requiring a different kind of love. Reflecting on all of this, it dawns on me that there are certain kinds of love I love, that I seemingly understand, that I warmly embrace and am highly motivated to cultivate and develop. Indeed, the Scriptures speak to and identify at least three kinds of love that I'm highly motivated to cultivate and develop. They identify them with the help of the original Greek, and these are three words that many of you, if you've been in church for any length of time, have heard before. This is nothing new, at least at the front end. The first kind of love that I understand, the Scripture reveals, is erotic love. The Greek word there is eros. It speaks to sexual love or romantic love. It's created and blessed by God. It's a love I understand, instinctively desire. It's a love I'm highly motivated to cultivate and develop. There's not a whole lot of mystery in eros love to me, at least on the front end. When Jesus says, love your enemy, that mystifies me. I say, what? When the Bible says, love your wife, including in a sexual way, I say, okay. You know, if I have to, I'll be obedient to you there, Lord. You know, no. This is a love I warmly embrace. I'm highly motivated to cultivate and develop. This is a love I understand. At least I think I do. Until even with a rather superficial examination of erotic love and my experience of it, it begins to dawn on me that maybe I don't understand it as much as I think. I mean, for something that's supposed to be so natural and easy, it doesn't always feel natural and easy. For something that's supposed to be so exhilarating and fulfilling, it isn't always exhilarating and fulfilling. Why is that? Well, short answer to that is this, that this kind of love, like every kind of love, keep that in mind as we go through this, like every kind of love, can become disordered love. Disordered love is a term I introduced to you a couple of weeks ago, dealing with it again today, this week, are we, and also probably next, disordered eros, simply defined as this. Disordered erotic love is manifested when sexual love is no longer a giving thing, when sexual love is no longer a celebrative thing, when it's no longer a revealing the face of God thing. Stop right there. The very thought that sexual love could be something that reveals the face of God is a bizarre thing to some of you. I need to stop right there and explain how that could be. It does indeed have the power to reveal the face of God. And this is the design of God for erotic love from the garden, from the beginning. It is this. when everything that is truly and in a healthy way feminine comes together in love with everything that is truly and in a healthy way masculine, when those two things are blended, those two things together reveal the very image of God. And what I'm driving at there is this. God is not masculine. He is not feminine. But when you bring those two things together, you have in there mystery. You have the revelation of God, the character of God, enormous sense of wonder. but erotic love in our culture and in our experiences becomes so disordered the idea of it being a revelation of the reality of God is something totally lost on us it's disordered when it's no longer a giving thing it becomes a taking thing it's a using thing indeed the ultimate expression of disorder is when sexually I begin to use you to fill myself at that point, this love designed by God to be exhilarating, fulfilling, and revealing of the face of God becomes diminishing, hurtful, manipulative, abusive, at least unfulfilling. Why? It's really quite simple. It's because you're not being loved. You're being used. That's why I feel so lousy. You were wondering, weren't you? Why does it feel so, even in your marriage maybe, Why does this feel so loud? Well, it's because you're not being loved. That's why. This is how human beings respond. When they're not being loved, when they're being used, they don't feel fulfilled. Funny how that works. And you aren't giving, you're taking. In that scenario, neither the person who is being used or the person who is using is feeling fulfilled. The one who's being used feels used. I don't care how you cut that. It's not very exciting. And the one who is using, even though there might be some sort of physical sensation that feels really good for a relatively short period of time, instinctively you know. If you are using someone, you didn't make a connection. And the human heart was made for connection. We're going to hear about that this week. But you didn't make a connection if you're a user. And all that does, this, you know, you can't even put words to it, but this instinctive reality that I did not make a connection, all that does is leave you thirsty for more. hungry for more. It's never enough. And you might even get upset with the person that you're using to quench your thirst, thinking if they were better thirst quenchers, then I wouldn't be thirsty. It's your fault. If you provided a little bit better sexual food, as it were, then I wouldn't be so hungry. And I know what I'll do. Since you're not meeting my needs, I'll discard you and use somebody else and call that love. I got it real. I got the real thing this time. No, You just found somebody else you can use for a while. Problem with using people to fill your needs, especially when the sexual component gets involved, it just never satisfies because sex isn't designed to fill you. Neither are people designed to fill you. And using people or sex to fill you is like drinking salt water to quench your thirst. On the front end, it looks like it makes sense. After all, it is water, but all it does is make you more and more and more. thirsty until you die from it. Now, what's the root of this disordered love is what's at the root of all disordered love? A word that you wouldn't expect at the root of this. The word is idolatry. What? Work with me here. Here's how it works. See, I have come to believe that what I need to be okay to be fulfilled is erotic love. That is now my source. that is what will make me okay. That is now my false God. If I have found a source, my source is my God. It's my false God. And I will use you to get that. And if not you, then you. And if not you, then somebody else. And if not somebody else, maybe an image on a screen or a fantasy relationship on the internet. I'll find it somewhere. But all of it is using. And I use flowery words and might even give little presents, but it has nothing to do with giving. It has everything to do with taking. an idol is as you know simply a false god false god is something anything that i look to other than god to give me life and my relationship to all my false gods and i just want you to let that in i think we all have false gods at some some level some false source of source of life you may not be aware of them i may not even be aware of mine i have in the past and you kind of let them go, hopefully. But here's the deal. My relationship to all my false gods, whatever those false gods might be, is always the same. Not only do I bow to them and serve them, which is what worship is, as we learned a couple of weeks ago from Bruce's talk. My relationship with my false gods is that I bow and serve to them in order to get something from them. See, my real relationship with them is to use them, to consume them. It's past desire. It's past delight. It becomes demand. And at that point, I will pay any price to get what I think this false god can provide for me, and I will forfeit any joy to keep what I think this false god can give to me. I will force it if I have to. I will take it if I want to. It has become life to me. It's disordered love. Now, there's another kind of love that the scriptures speak of that, again, I think I understand. The Greek word is storge this time. Storge is familial love or family love, that of the love of a parent for a child. I get that. I understand that. It's a natural kind of love. Indeed, I think it's primal. Several months ago, Bonnie and I were serving communion, and two of our four kids came through the line, just kind of to surprise, to our surprise, and Caleb and Erica were there, and we served them the bread and the wine, and they went by, and other people were coming, and out of the corner of my eye, I noticed that Bonnie was crying, and she couldn't stop. Well, I asked the obvious question. What do I do now? You know? All I'm doing is the cup here. I didn't think I did anything. Something. And then she said, nothing, you idiot. You know, you guys think we're talking about it. God bless you. The cup is here for you too. You know, no, no, no. We're having a little family. Just shut up, shut up and serve the cup. You know, stuff like that. No, you know, she said, I said, what's up? She says, I just love those kids. You know what that is? That's storge. See, that's a love I understand. I get it. When Jesus says love your enemy, it mystifies me. I say, what? When he says love your family, I say, okay. I mean, this is a love I warmly embrace. I'm highly motivated to cultivate and develop. I don't always get it. I don't always do it well. I read lots of books, though. I mean, I'm highly motivated. I'll go to seminars. This is a love I understand. At least I think I do. until I begin to examine, even superficially, my experience of family love. And when I do, it begins to dawn on me that maybe I don't understand it as much as I think. I mean, for something that's supposed to be as natural and easy, as everybody says, family love is, it's an instinct, it's primal. It doesn't always feel natural and easy, does it? For something that's supposed to be exhilarating and supportive and fulfilling, it doesn't always feel like that. Why is that? short answer is because this kind of love like every kind of love can become disordered love and i don't think i need to spend a lot of time piling up proof or building a case for the fact that when storge or family love is disordered it damages people indeed disordered storge has damaged to some degree or another every person sitting in this gym for none of our parents perfectly loved us, and we will not perfectly love our children either. We could probably all give testimony to that fact to some degree. Some of you more than others have been damaged. But what I want you to catch is this. The disordered storge is very much like disordered eros in this respect, that the driving force behind the disorder, in other words, the disorder of the disorder is that all of a sudden this gift of God, this family love that's designed to be a giving thing becomes a taking thing. And when it becomes a taking thing, there is the disorder. This nurturing thing becomes a using thing. The supportive thing designed by God to be such now becomes a draining and diminishing thing. Here we go again. It becomes an idolatrous thing. And again, at first blush, I go, idolatry? I mean, I understand that disordered storge can cause pain, but I don't see how at the core it's idolatry. Don't make a connection. Work with me here. Explain it this way. And by the way, I'm not sure that idolatry is at the core of every form of disordered storge, but maybe the most common form of disordered storge is when parents are no longer there for kids, the kids are there for the parents. what do you mean? Very simply. The parents are using the children, maybe without even their awareness, and how their children look, and how they behave, and how they perform, maybe at sports or school, or some aspect of the arts, to fill an emptiness in themselves. I am quite sure, and again, this is no revelation, but there are people, maybe some of you, and you've brought some order maybe to this disorder in your life, but there are some people I'm quite sure who have children in the first place, thinking by having the child, I can fill myself. And you've got a little, you've got a little, you know, 10-pound false god that I'm going to draw life from. This is going to make me okay. Now how they look and how they behave and how they perform becomes your source of life. So that how they look, perform, and behave is no longer important for their welfare, Stop right there. Those things are important for how they do, how they behave, how well they perform. They need to be encouraged and disciplined and pushed a little bit and all of that stuff for their benefit. It's going to be good for them if they do well. But all of that gets turned around when storge is disordered. Now it's important that they look, behave, and perform for your sake. In a strange, perverse way, the child is no longer the source of delight. This child is a source of life, a false god. It's incredible how much power competitive situations have to draw this out, to make it apparent, to make both really healthy storge apparent and also disordered storge. For those of you who have kids, if you're involved in sports, you probably know what I mean. I think our kids were all involved in sports when they were younger and growing up because we always went to their games. I just tell you, more than once over the years, I've left some sporting event that our kids were involved in and needed to get into the car and remind Bonnie that, you know, it's only a game, honey. You know? Let it go. None of you believe that. Better not believe that. But yeah, you get in the car, and you know, I could sit and watch little basketball games with 12-year-old kids, and they're my neighbors and they're my friends or they're, you know, maybe my niece or my nephew or something like that. And I'm just all excited and I'm so pumped. And I look at some of these parents and I think, what's the matter with them until it's my kid on the floor? And all of a sudden, what's the matter with me? What's that about? Sometimes it's healthy, sometimes it's not. This last winter we've been, as a family, real involved with one of our kids in a real exciting way around their sports. Christopher, our youngest, is a wrestler at Maple Grove Senior High. a heavyweight and had a lot of fun this year. Wrestling is different than a team sport in a number of respects, but the chief one, our kids always play team sports and every once in a while they'll make a play and that's kind of cool that they actually stood out, but they usually don't. Team sports are cool that way. You have places to hide and you have people to blame. But in wrestling, there's nobody to hide and there's nobody to blame. It's just, you know, so Bonnie and I would go to these matches and we would just notice that more than other sporting events that our kids were involved in And over all these years, we'd get really nervous around Christopher and this one-on-one type of deal. Also very excited. And Bonnie, again, would lose control quite often. You know, I'm joking. But it really is funny to watch moms at wrestling matches. It's these little, you know, diminutive, just calm and normal. They're standing and yelling, stick them, get them, nail them, yes, yes. Oh, it's just wonderful. Well, a couple weeks ago, I had a speaking engagement out of town. And you knew about that because I had to miss church. There was something else I had to miss on that weekend. Christopher was involved in the regional wrestling tournament that was going to determine whether or not he went to state. So this is a really big deal. And he had a really good year up to that point. And so there was some possibility that he could. It was kind of up for grabs as to whether he'd make it or not. Well, being gone just drove me nuts. And I even had to go a day early, so I missed some of the Friday stuff. There was some potential weather coming in Saturday, so I left a day early. but I'm sitting in this hotel and driving around this goofy place that I was at with nothing to do, but every couple hours calling home and using Bonnie's cell phone and trying to find out what's going on. Or she would call me and she'd give me the blow-by-blow. He did well or he didn't do so well here and on and on and on. He's still in it. Well, finally it came to the final match of this whole thing. And this final match, if he won, he'd go to state. And if he wouldn't, if he didn't, he wouldn't. And it's 10.30 at night. This time it's 11.30 at night where I was because of the time change. And here I am alone in the motel room. Bonnie had called, and so I kind of knew when the match was going to start, and I'm sitting, and they're staring at the ceiling. No, he's probably wrestling right now. I don't know for sure, but I think he is, and I know what that looks like, so I'm playing it out in my mind, and it's driving me crazy. The phone rings. It's halfway through the match. Bonnie called so I could hear. She goes, there you go. You know, I could see it through the phone. You know, I've been here, so I am. I'm watching this thing through the, it's just the oddest thing, through the phone. The crowd is roaring. Bonnie is screaming. I'm not kidding now. He's ahead. He's behind. He's ahead. The class going down. He's still ahead. He's ahead. He won. He won. Bonnie's crying. I'm on the other end of the phone. I'm crying. She brings the phone down onto the mat so I get a chance to talk to him. Chris is crying. He won't admit it, but he was crying. I get to talk to him. I feel like I'm there. I'm just so excited. I hang up the phone. It's very quiet. Except for me. My heart is pounding out of my chest. He's going to state. I'm just so excited. I couldn't go to sleep, it's 11.30. No, it's not. It's 12.30. No, it's not. It's 1.30. I got to get up at 5. I got to speak three times in the morning. What is this about? I mean, I even asked the Lord. I mean, I'm going a little nuts here. I can't go to sleep. This is so intense. Is this okay? Have I crossed the line here? Am I starting to get life from this? How would I know? I did ask God about that. I mean, it kind of bugged me. I got to get up tomorrow, Lord, remember? Anyway, like it's his fault, you know. Honestly, here's what I think he said to me. It was an interesting thing to mull around in my mind and in my heart. Here's what I think he said to me. Dave, being deliriously excited for your kids is not crossing the line. That's what storge is. Celebration, taking delight in the success of your son is good. And then he said this to me, and I'll tell you what. I hope you can hear him say this to you. I take delight in you, Dave. Let me stop there. Do you know that God your Father takes delight in you? I mean this is pushing it I'm sure but he can't go to sleep at night you know Dave when you walk in the light of my kingdom and you get to taste it once in a while you think you get excited when your son wins the match when you walk in the light of my kingdom and I can see you taste it and you just go to life and you have that look of wonder I delight in that when you stand for truth when you trust my love when you don't even feel it, when you come out of hiding, repent of your sin and experience through tears my grace, I can't go to sleep. I wake up all the angels in the middle of the night and I tell them, that's my boy. That's the love of the Father, beloved. When human beings get to touch it and taste it in just human earthy ways, like a wrestling match, It has the power to reveal the face of God. Rightly ordered, store gay, love beloved, strongly desires the children to do well. And by the way, in this family dynamic metaphor, let's extend it beyond my physical family, your physical, to the family of God. There is strong desire for people to do well, to succeed. And in this context, there is celebration when we win. And there's grieving. Have you ever seen your kid not do well? And you think, why am I carrying this? And you try to work through it. Is this about me? Is it about them? And even after you get it past being about you, there is a grief for them and their pain. Burying one another. It's a kind of love that gets nervous when the match is going to happen. But here is where it turns. When desire becomes need, when delight becomes demand, this love is disordered. Just like Eros. what disorders eras when desire becomes need when delight becomes demand the giving thing becomes a taking thing and everything is changed suddenly in storge love if the desire becomes demand I'm not here for him or her win or lose he or she is here for me and they better win no I mean you can have two sets of parents at an athletic event same gym same event same cheering rah rah rah different love one is nurturing and building the other one is taking and diminishing and you only feel that in your spirit but it's a real thing let me say it this way i strongly desire for my children to do well in life not just wrestling wrestling is just practice for life but it is precisely because I strongly desire that that I encourage them, discipline them, cheer for them, yell at them and then yell at them some more push them, celebrate with them and grieve with them but if I need them to do well everything changes, all of the encouragement, all of the discipline all of the cheering, all of the yelling, all of the pushing is no longer for them, it's for me It's not a giving thing. It's a taking thing. It's not a nurturing thing. It's a using thing, a diminishing thing, a disordered thing. There's a third kind of love the Bible speaks of that, again, I think I understand. Phileo. Phileo is the Greek word. It simply speaks to friendship. It's marked by warm affection, commonality, mutuality, safety, and trust. It's what you feel for your best, most trusted friend. It's what Jesus felt for John when it says that He was the disciple that Jesus loved. The Greek word for love there is not agape, it's phileo, affection. Well, here I go. I can do affection. I get that. When Jesus says, love your enemy, that mystifies me. I say, what? When he says, love your friends, I think, okay. Well, duh, of course I love my friends. They're my friends. See, much like eros and storge, phileo is a kind of love I warmly embrace, and I'm highly motivated to cultivate and develop. It's a love I understand, at least I think I do, until I begin to examine even superficially my experience of phileo. Let me ask you to examine. Let me just ask you a question. Anybody here ever experience a disordered friendship? Nah. Of course you have. Some of you have experienced disordered friendships to such an extent that you have a real hard time trusting anybody to be a friend, and you've walled yourself in by way of protection. from ever having that kind of friendship before because you entered into that and you got used. Philel is an amazing thing. It's very much like Eros, you know, without the sexual components. Because philel starts almost like a romance. It begins wonderfully, magically. You click. You like the same things. You laugh at the same jokes. And if you're in a relationship with me, these jokes would be mine. No, actually, I have a very low threshold in terms of expectations relative to my friends. All you have to do is laugh at my jokes. and you're my friend. That's why I have very few friends. Anyway, I don't need anybody laughing at my jokes. I laugh at my own and anyway, that's another thing. But over time, this wonderful romance begins to fade and you get this uneasy feeling. I thought they liked me. I feel like they're using me. I thought they loved me. I feel like they're trying to sell me. I thought they had affection for me. I feel like they want something from me. And before you know it, this uneasy, creepy thing begins to happen where they don't want your attention. They demand your attention, and the walls just start to close in on you. You see, just like disordered eros and disordered storge, at the root of disordered phileo is a kind of idolatry again because I have come to believe that a friendship with you can make me okay. In other words, I can use you and our friendship and the good feelings I have when I'm with you to fill me. And while I may do a lot of things that look like love, like favors and flattery, if disordered, the favors and the flattery will all have a hook. No longer being a giving thing, now they're a taking thing. Not a supportive thing, but a draining thing, a diminishing thing. I'm talking about a disordered thing. all of that raises the question it's this is there anything that can bring order to these vitally important arenas of love family, sexuality friendship the answer is yes and the answer the solution the thing that can bring order to these disordered loves is the fourth kind of love that the scripture speaks of and it's the kind of love that John is calling for in this epistle that we have been studying for several weeks, that he says has the power to reveal the face of God. The Greek word is agape, love. Beloved, let us love one another. He doesn't say phileo there. There's nothing wrong with phileo, but phileo can get disordered. He says here, let us agape one another. Doesn't say eros, doesn't say storge. The reason he says agape is because if you have agape, it will bring order to all the other loves. Let me talk about agape just a bit. Agape is a term that you may or may not be familiar with in Christian theology. It's regarded by most to be the supreme form of love. It's not easy to define in concrete, you know, this is what it means, terms. In fact, it was one of the biggest struggles I had in trying to pull this sermon together. In fact, I got set free in terms of trying to define it by just accepting the fact that agape is something that has shades of meaning and subtleties. It's like a picture with different colors and different shapes and textures. Let me give you my best shot, and by the end, I'm hoping you have the picture of what Agape is. At the core, it is a love that is defined as being sacrificial and self-giving. It is a love that comes from God, 1 John 4, 7. That means he is the source, and that's where I've got to go to get it, and that's the power I need to give it. It is a love embodied in Christ, powerfully illustrated in Romans 5, when Paul says this, one would hardly die for a righteous man, though for a good man, one might dare to die. In other words, I have a category in my mind where dying for a good man at least makes sense. But God demonstrated his love toward us and that while we were still sinners, while we were still enemies, antagonistic toward him, in that context, he died for us. I don't have a category for that. That's agape. This is a love that strongly desires, just like I desired my son to win or do well. This is a love that strongly desires reciprocity or love in return. Strongly desires relationship. You need to mark that in your mind and just put it in the place where your spirit deals with life. You need to mark the fact that God has strong desire for you to love him back, for you to have relationship with him. He has strong desire for his entire creation. for that very thing. But this love does not require the love in return to exist. It loves anyway, allowing itself incredibly to long for a relationship that may not yet be real. I mean, that's an incredible picture of God's love for his entire creation. Puts him in a place of painful longing for reciprocity. But whether the reciprocity comes or not, he still laid down his life. that's agape. This is a love that acts in the best interest of a person being loved, regardless of the response, meaning I would do what's best for you even if you don't respond positively. That one's hard to get, but I at least can get some pictures of that. See, I think that's the love that is demonstrated in the life of a healthy parent who in a healthy way would discipline their child, knowing that in this discipline, this child might be mad at me for an hour or a day or maybe a week. But also knowing that this kind of pulling this child back into this responsibility or accountability is exactly the best thing for this child. That's acting in the best interest of someone regardless of their response. This is a love that is required to love someone who may be hostile to you, who may be an enemy. This is a love that mystifies me. At first blush, quite frankly, it's a love that frightens me. But finally, this is the love that drives me to the cross, is my only hope of knowing this love, or living in this kind of love. That's agape. Now, most of my life, I have understood and tried to explain these four kinds of love, eros, phileo, storge, and agape, as different kinds of love. In other words, there is sexual love, eros, family love, storge, friendship love, phileo, And then there is this supernatural special occasion love that I kind of pull out in the most extreme situations, like when I'm needing to love someone I don't like. Now, that puts us in this very strange position. I don't know if you've ever thought of agape that way, but agape is a supernatural love. It's a love from God, and it's the best, highest form of love. But the only time I really use it is on people I don't like. So the people I really care about in my life, they don't get the supernatural love. They just get the everyday old kind of ordinary philatel love. Like, it never quite fit for me. I taught it that way. It's the only way I could see it. So there's something wrong with that. Agape in my mind was what I pull out for those people I don't love very much. You know, that's when I need agape love. That's when I become agape man. Good timing, Terry. Way to go. Agape man. You know? and who disguised as Dave Johnson, mild-mannered pastor of Church of the Open Door, puts on his agape man suit for special situations. You know, think about Superman. You know, he was Clark Kent. He was just mild-mannered. He didn't walk around in his Superman suit all the time, only for special occasions when the bad guy was there. I don't use agape all the time. I just use it for special occasions. I'm agape man, and I'm the Superman, and you all look at me and go, wow, he's able to pull off agape once in a while. You know, I wouldn't teach it that way. That's how I lived. The only way we could get it. Consider now another paradigm. This came to me this week, and it was like I've tried it out enough on people to think I'm right about this, but it made me a little nervous because I'd never heard this before, but this is what I think. The wallagape is indeed the kind of love I need to be operating out of and inside of to love my enemy. It is also the kind of love I need to be operating out of to love my friend and love my wife and love my children. Let me say it this way. Agape is not just one more kind of love in addition to eros, storge, and phileo. Instead, agape is the kind of love that brings order to my eros, phileo, and storge love. If that's true, by the way, then the focus of my life and the pursuit of where I want to grow and bring things to God is not, Lord, help me get better and better at my eros. or Lord help me get better and better at my phileo though I want to or Lord help me get better and bigger at my stargate though I want to Lord work with me and begin to reveal to me what agape really is how I can really find it and how I can live out of it and when I do guess what it will bring order to my family love it will bring order to my friendships it will bring order to my sexuality I'm talking about a context you see agape needs to be the context within which we live let me say it another way erotic love that comes in any other context than agape love will be disordered eros. That agape eros becomes a taking thing, a using thing, a hurtful thing. Agape desires. Agape has, that's one of its quality, deep desire. I want reciprocity. I desire that. But agape doesn't demand it. agape brings order to eros giving the possibility of my eros to reveal literally the face of God to reflect the image of God family love experienced in any other context than agape love will be disordered love without agape storge becomes a taking thing a using thing a hurtful thing agape brings order to my family love so that I could sit in the bleachers of a gymnasium watch my son wrestle and really, I mean, just let everything go relative to my desire for him to win. Do you want to win? Yes, I really desire him to win for him, but he doesn't need to. You see the difference? Huge. It's a difference between life and death, giving and taking. Desire him to win for him, but he doesn't need to. And what that provides for both of us is freedom to win or to lose, in either case, to love. friendship without agape love is disordered love agape brings order to my friendships and sets me free from the need to coerce and manipulate and fix and control and pressure it desires but doesn't demand you're not my source friend you're my friend and I love you Now, draw this to a close. I want to add another piece just to the picture, another piece, another color, if you will, to what I think agape is. And this is very short, but the fact that it's short does not mean that it is not important. In fact, it all comes together for me right here in this definition of agape. Agape love walks in the awareness of and is awake to the reality of the presence of God in other people. Christ in you. So I can look in you and I can physically see characteristics and you have personality and your personality affects me in certain ways, sometimes positive, sometimes negative. But in this agape love, in this community of faith love, I look at you and there's this almost discipline. It's like God, help me live in this place where I just am always just sensitively and tenderly aware of Christ in you. well is it just the believers no no I'm talking about everybody I'm talking about people who love God and don't who are Christians who aren't who are good people and bad you know why because they may not have Christ in them but they are all bearers of the image of God and all of a sudden that affects how I look at the person at the grocery store checkout stand and the person I'm driving in the car next to in 169 tomorrow morning. This awareness of Christ in you and everyone being a bearer of the image is at the root of what we call around here at Open Door incarnational relationships. Where we deal with each other with an awareness of the life of Christ in us and between us. C.S. Lewis said it this way in his now famous sermon, The Weight of Glory. There are no ordinary people. You have never met a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations, these are mortal, and their life is to ours as that of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and exploit. Next to the blessed sacrament itself, your neighbor is the holiest object presented to your senses. End quote. Mother Teresa, when asked how she could minister for so long to these desperately needy people, said, When I see them, I see more than them. I see Jesus in them, who said, When you do it to the least of these, you do it to me. You're serving me. And by serving me, she doesn't mean that in some vague, I'm doing this and serving you. No, no, she's not looking there. She's looking here. She's looking here. She's looking here. And when I do it to you, I'm serving him. Not like this, like this. Incarnational. That's incarnational. Christ in you. And relating to the Christ in you. And if the Christ isn't in you, that you bear the image. Let me ask you a question. Does even thinking about that, I'm not even talking about being able to live this out yet, just thinking about that. Does it bring any order? to your eros. Let me get real specific. I don't doubt for a minute that there are people in this room right now who are using someone sexually to fulfill themselves. What do you mean, a prostitute? Maybe. That's not what I mean. It could be your wife. It could be your husband. It could be, I don't know. Does this paradigm at all, they bear the image, the life of Christ in them. You know what? That's not your wife. That's his daughter. You know who you're using? Do you have any idea who you're using? You know, I get pretty big about who dates my daughters. That's why they tell me nobody dates them. Dad, go away, go away. You know, I really don't have real huge things. All you have to do is cherish them. That's a father's side, you understand? All you got to do is cherish them. That's all you got to do. You know, every other thing about you, you can be a jerk. I don't care. No, you can't. You know, we would do well to look at our wives, our husbands, our friends that way. Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Who you're using? Agape love brings order to my eros. Brings order to my friendships. Do you have any idea who you're manipulating? Brings order to my family. Agape is the only thing that can. We're going to deal with this a little bit more next week. I'm going to bring you to the Corinthians to tell you. The Corinthians is going to have a really good time in Corinth Corinth because because um however disordered your love is theirs is so bad it's going to make us look good so we're just going to feel really good about ourselves next week they had disordered friendships first Corinthians chapter 3 they had disordered eros in chapter 5 they disordered store gay relationships marriages in first Corinthians 7 they disordered worship in first Corinthians 11 and finally he got to first Corinthians 13 the thing on love and he says you know your problem is not about having a sermon on eros. You don't need to go to a seminar on getting better sex. You don't need to go to a sermon on how to be a better friend. You don't know a thing about love. And so 1 Corinthians 13 comes in the middle of this enormous confrontation on them. And the whole thinking is this. If you get this rightly ordered, if you begin to walk in agape, all those other things will find their order. Let me close with this. several months ago when we began this study I told you that this epistle, 1 John would be an invitation into three things number one, it would be an invitation into life that we can live an eternal kind of life now secondly, it would be an invitation into light and third, in these later days these last several weeks we have heard it as an invitation into love as I close this morning what I want to do is invite you once again as I have several times in the course of this series is to invite you into the complexity and mystery and anguish and to walk with it all week long of what love looks like and how when rightly ordered it has the power to reveal the face of God in my sexuality, in my friendships, and in my family. And as you walk that out and you bring it to God and you ask him to show you the disorder and then ask him to heal the disorder and ask him to help you begin to even taste or understand the order. What I would say to you is this, welcome to life in the kingdom of God. I'd like you to stand as we close. Father, I do believe that you are up to something among us relative to our learning what it means to love one another. And I pray that, once again, beyond words that I've said or concepts that I've shared or principles that we could understand, that's just so empty if there's not life. God, that we would be a people who are responding to this word from John, who says from the heart, beloved, let us love one another. in rightly ordered ways because more than anything on earth it has the power to reveal the face of God that nobody can see maybe any other way. Do this work among us. May our hearts be open wide to your word and to your work. In Jesus' name, amen.
