Open your Bibles with me to Matthew chapter 23. We've been dealing these weeks in chapter 23, and as we have been dealing with it, it has developed into a series that we're entitling The Marks of False Spiritual Leaders and Leadership. Another title could be Issues of Spiritual Abuse. The focus of today's study is going to cover verses 14 and 15. I want to read 13 through 15 just to kind of enter us into the tension of what is going on here. Let's start in verse 13. But what do you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites? Because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from men. For you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are desiring to enter in to enter in. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows' houses, even while for a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore you shall receive greater condemnation. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel about on sea and land to make one proselyte. And when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves. Let's pray as we begin. Your Father, I come to you again this morning and recognize in my spirit, even as I begin to emerge into this teaching, that this is important. And Father, as I get a visual image in my mind of you standing in the courtyard of the Gentiles, standing against this system, the picture I have is that of you fighting for us so that we could be free from systems that devour, systems that shut off the kingdom, systems that even have your name on it, but they aren't about you. And Jesus, in your name, I pray that you would reproduce, as this truth is being reproduced for us in these pages, that you would somehow, by your Spirit, reproduce the dynamic of your Spirit that was designed to set people free through these words and do that among us, supernaturally, by you. Not by the words of any person. We invite you to move among us as your truth is presented. In Jesus' name, amen. One of the ironies of our study as we deal with the issue of false spiritual leadership is that all through the word of God, instructions are consistently given to God's people to submit to, to obey, to support, to pray for, to follow their spiritual leaders, their true spiritual shepherds. In Hebrews chapter 13, verse 17, it says, Obey your leaders, submit to them. They will keep watch over your souls as those who give an account. Let them do what they do with joy and not with grief, for that would be unprofitable for you. 1 Timothy 5, 17 says, Let the elders who rule well be worthy of double honor. Now that is true. That is information that needs to be brought to God's people, and there are people who need to hear that and respond to it. But what we have been learning from the passage of Scripture we're dealing with is that we can't afford to be naive about that. The fact is this. Whether we like it or not or understand it or not, not everyone who looks like a shepherd is a true shepherd. Not everyone who presents himself as genuine is really genuine. Not everyone who presents himself or herself as safe really is safe. In Acts chapter 20, Paul is leaving the church in Ephesus, and he says, I need to tell you a fact. The fact is this, that upon my departure, grievous wolves will move in, and they will come in from among you. They will not come in from the outside. And when they come in and rise into positions of leadership, they will not spare the flock. The fact is this, that when a wolf or a false leader is identified, we do not submit to them. We do not obey them. We do not trust them. We run from them. The key question then becomes, as we're struggling for a balance in here with a word of God that tells us to obey and submit, and then other words of God that tells us to be aware, is how can you tell the difference between that which is true and that which is false? And that's where our text has become enormously helpful. Because the text over these last four weeks has indicated very clearly to us that you can tell. There are indicators. There are signs. Those signs and indicators are clear. They are not hidden. They are observable and they are objective. And they are revealed for us in verses 1 through 12. The characteristics of a false spiritual leader start in verse 2 with a false basis of authority. A false basis of authority. The scribes and Pharisees seated themselves in the chair of Moses. You remember the chair of Moses was a position of authority and they put themselves in the position of authority based on not the fact that they necessarily told the truth, not based on the fact that they were sensitive to the Spirit, heard from God, and loved the people. They put themselves in this position of authority over people based on the fact that they held the position of a scribe. They held the position of a Pharisee. Because I'm a scribe, that's why you're going to listen to me. It has nothing to do necessarily with being sensitive to God. Because I'm a Pharisee, that's why you're going to listen to me. Because I'm the pastor, that's why you're going to listen to me. And again, it doesn't have to do anything with sensitivity to God or being truthful. A false basis of authority is the first indicator that you're dealing with a false leader, a false system. The second one was a lack of integrity. Verse 3, they say, but they do not what they say. We talked about the fact that there is often even a double life going on that is disclosed sometimes after a period of years. Another indicator of a false system is that they tie heavy loads. A sign of a true God-working system is that the impact on your life is that the load is lifted by the strong arm of grace. and forgiveness. And you come into life. A sign of a false system is weights are consistently being put on you that you by yourself have to carry in order to please God. And it wears people down. And generally it comes in the form of some sort of legalistic performance issue. The fourth thing was that their religion becomes a thing that is for show. Verse 5. They do their deeds to be noticed by men. They broaden their phylacteries. The issue in systems like this is image, projecting an image that looks spiritual. Once that image is projected, then you spend all your energy protecting the image that you have projected. And in systems like this, it becomes more important that you look spiritual and look devoted than you really be spiritual and be devoted. The final one is that there is a demand in systems like this for the recognition of people. They love the place of honored banquets, chief seats in the synagogues, respectful greetings in the marketplaces, and being called by men rabbi. The Latin derivative of rabbi is doctor. Titles, degree recognition in false systems is very important. And the reason that is, is because how things look is what matters. If how things look is what matters, and I get my sense of value from what you think, then it's going to be very important that you recognize my status. It's a sign of a sick system. When we came to verse 13 last week, what we discerned was that what Jesus is doing here is taking that entire issue of characteristics of false leaders and turning it up a notch. And my opinion was that what he really is doing is putting us into a position where we cannot be allowed to minimize how dangerous these characteristics are. I think there is a tendency on the part of the disciples, on our part as well, to hear these characteristics in verses 1 through 12 and say, hey, you know, yeah, I really have seen these kinds of things. I've been in systems like this, but you know, really, come on, it's really not that big a deal. We're just kind of talking about a different way of doing things and a different leadership style that we may not like, but it's really all the same thing. We're just saying the same thing in a different way. We're really all on the same team. In verses 13 to 39, Jesus is saying categorically, we are not on the same team. We are not saying the same thing a different way. We are not saying the same thing. Let me tell you why these characteristics in these verses are so serious. Number one, because they shut off the kingdom from people who are trying to enter. When you see these characteristics, it shuts off the kingdom. It is not a benign thing. It is very big. Shutting off the kingdom was last week's issue. This week we move to verse 14. Let me tell you something else that these characteristics, when they are in a system or in a leader, due to people, they devour them. They devour people. Systems like this. What are you, scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites? Because you devour widows' houses. It's interesting to me that in James it says that pure religion and undefiled is to visit widows and orphans. Maybe it's safe to say that pure spiritual abuse in its most blatant form is when widows begin to get devoured. Instead of ministering to them, we suck the life out of them. This whole issue of being devoured is one that we're relatively familiar with. I brought it up a couple of weeks ago. And what we called it or what we described as being what happens when this happens or what precipitates this happening, people being devoured, is when role reversal happens. Remember that? Role reversal is what causes people to be devoured. Role reversal is simply when the shepherd, instead of being there for the sheep, using the knowledge and the strength and the authority that a shepherd has to nurture the sheep and build the sheep and strengthen the sheep, he begins to use his strength and authority over the sheep to shear the sheep, to get from the sheep what he needs to satisfy himself. You've got a shepherd who's empty, who doesn't feel very good about himself, and he uses his authority, possibly, as a shepherd, to suck the life out of his sheep to make him feel better and him feel full. It's role reversal. When that happens, it devours people. The passages of Scripture we used for that was Zechariah 11, 16. You devour the flesh of fat sheep and tear off their hooves. That happens when the roles are reversed. Ezekiel 34, 2 and 3. Same thing. Woe to you, shepherds of Israel. You have been feeding yourselves. That's role reversal. Should not the shepherds feed the flock? That's why you're there. You've been equipped by God to do something that not everybody can do. Feed the sheep, then feed the sheep. But what you're doing is eating the fat and clothing yourselves with the wool. You slaughter the sheep and feed yourself and build your own kingdom and flatter your own ego. What that is is spiritual abuse. Now, I don't know if you've ever heard that term before. We've heard the term abuse before. We've heard it in different contexts. There is physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse. Add to your list spiritual abuse. And you want to know something? It has the same impact on the soul of men and women as any other kind of abuse. It devours them. This really did come, this issue of spiritual abuse, when roles are reversed, devouring people, came to light in my mind when I did indeed compare it to other forms of abuse that I understand. Because spiritual abuse, the concept is still relatively new, though I've seen it and so have you. I just haven't put words on it. The best parallel I can think of is one that is frightening and graphic, and that is to compare spiritual abuse to sexual abuse. Let me define it this way. Sexual abuse is when a parent, who was, by the way, placed in the life of the child for what? For nurture, for strengthening, for safety, for protection, and the parent was given in that child's life strength, authority, power. I'm bigger. And I was placed in the life of that child as a gift to the child, just like a shepherd is placed in the life of a sheep, of sheep, of a flock of God for as a gift for their protection, for their nurturing. But all of a sudden, the roles get reversed in a sexual abuse issue. And rather than me using my authority and strength to give to that child and put life into that child, I use my authority and strength to overpower that child and take from that child what I need to nurture me. You got abuse now. Comes in lots of different forms. Sometimes it is sexual. Sometimes it's emotional, manipulative. Sometimes it's physical where I just overpower you and get what I want. Spiritual abuse is the same thing. When a shepherd uses their authority, their power, their gifts, not to nurture people, but to suck the life out of them to fill me. When this happens, it is role reversal. When it happens, the victims of this kind of system wind up very confused. They wind up tremendously frightened. They feel absolutely helpless. Again, keep bouncing back and forth, whether it's a sexual abuse issue or a spiritual abuse issue. and a sexual abuse issue, that child has no idea what to do. I mean, they don't know. They feel like they can't say no. They feel like they can't resist. After all, it's grandpa. I mean, it was daddy. The Bible says, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. They know best, and they're here to protect me. It's probably for my own good. That's one form of spiritual abuse. Somebody begins to use their authority and their power not to nurture you and help you and heal you and fill you and strengthen you. They begin to use that to get from you what they need. And when they come to you that way, it's very confusing. It's very frightening. You don't know what to do with it. There's nowhere to go. You feel absolutely helpless. You feel like you can't say no. You can't resist. After all, it's the pastor. It's an elder. I mean, they know best. If you're here to protect me, it probably is for my own good. Obey your leaders. Submit to them. Obey your leaders. Submit to them. You know, by the way, let me just give you a little handle here, a little help. In systems where spiritual abuse is going on, the abusers will have that as their favorite verse. You ever notice that? I mean, that'll be there. Submit to me. Obey your leaders. don't you know what the Bible says about it? Don't you touch the Lord's anointed? That'll be their constant thing. Anytime you ask a question, they're going to smack you right upside the head with that. You better notice that that is a sign that something's going wrong. They're even using the Word of God to shut your mouth. I love what Jeff Van Vonderen does, and this can help me kind of explain where I come to with things like this. When Jeff Van Vonderen teaches the stuff on Ephesians 5, wives submit to your husbands, husbands love your wives, lay down your lives for your wives. Children, obey your parents. Parents, don't provoke your children to wrath. One of the things he says that kind of straightens the whole thing out without a whole lot of exegesis is this. Listen, everybody, do your own verse. Okay? Do your own. Children, do your verse. Parents, get off their verse. You do your verse. Parents, you do your verse. That is, don't provoke your children to wrath. Kids, get off of their verse. You do your verse. You obey your parents. Parents, you don't provoke your children. And wives, don't be doing your husband's verse, and husbands, get off your wife's verse. You do your verse. You lay down your life for your wife. Okay? Same thing applies here. Leaders, get off this verse. Get off. That's the people's verse. You guys do your verse. I got to do my verse. Leaders, do your verse. Our verse is this. Don't lord it over people the way the Gentiles do. Be among the flock as a servant. See, one of the interesting ways to use my authority is to take verses like that and make it do what I want. And it is no longer, then, a work of the Spirit in people's lives. It's the work of a powerful manipulator controlling people, and it has nothing to do with God anymore. And it devours people. Let me talk real straight to you about this whole issue of abuse because it's frightening, especially as I compare it to sexual abuse. And see, we've had a considerable amount of dealing with victims like that. I'm glad, I'm so glad that God has healing power for victims of any kind of abuse. He came for abuse people, folks. That's why he came for broken down people who knew they couldn't do it. But what's frightening to me is that the people we're also coming in contact with who've been in systems like the one described in this chapter have exactly the same emotional symptoms as people who are coming out of sexual abuse issues. What do you mean by that? What I mean by this is that is this. Sexual abuse victims, by and large, come out of a long period of time of denial. For years it didn't happen, it didn't happen, they denied it, they forgot it. It was a very puzzling thing when I first began to get exposed to and get some education about the pain that people have with things like this is that people when they were 25, 26, 30 years old would remember something for the first time that happened. They had literally forgotten it. It's denial. This is fine. This is, I don't have any problems. Daddy was wonderful. Mommy was great. Then all of a sudden, somewhere along the line, they hear a truth. The truth intersects the lie. The truth turns on a light. They got a light. They look at it, and they go, whoa. Long period of time of denial. People who've come out of spiritual abuse, it's the same thing. They lived in the system so long, they thought it was normal. All of a sudden, truth is heard. The real gospel is heard. A light goes on and they go, whoa. It's one of the characteristics, is denial. They blame themselves. Sexual abuse victims say things like this. You know, it probably was my fault. Yeah, you know, they're six years old. Younger than that sometimes. You know, if I only would have done this or that or... Spiritual abuse victims say the same thing. They say the same thing. You'll hear it all the time. Probably really was my fault in some way if I only would have obeyed or done a little more or tried a little harder. Overwhelming shame, both kinds of victims. Tremendous fear. Sexual abuse victims and spiritual abuse victims still have the perpetrator in their life, exerting incredible power in their life. And sometimes those perpetrators are dead. They're not even there. Mom and dad, they're gone, but they're still in control. powerful no-talk rule and a very difficult time ever trusting anybody that's why spiritual abuse victims have a very hard time receiving grace it just it's hard to let it in it's hard to let it in doesn't mean they can't they do that's who grace is for but you got to keep dragging these people over the word jesus loves you jesus loves you yes he does it's not because your effort yes he does it's really true. Add to this whole devouring of people that in the middle of their devouring of people and using their power to suck the life, while the life is being sucked out, they are for pretense offering long prayers, looking very spiritual. And again, that connects with my picture of daddy coming to the little girl or the little boy. All the while looking like a safe daddy, all the while sounding like a spiritual man sucking the life out of people. That's frightening. It ought to be. It is frightening. Hear me. When we see the characteristics that are delineated in verses 1 through 12, a false basis of authority, because I'm the pastor, that's why, putting heavy loads on people of legalism without ever extending the long arm of grace, the strong arm of grace to lift a load, role reversal where you are here to make me okay, not the other way around, not me ministering to you, where people are wearing their religion on the outside. It's a big show. Those issues are not minor. They are not benign. They shut out the kingdom and they devour people. They kill them. We are not on the same team. We are not saying the same thing. verse 15 just keeps on going after he says they shut out the kingdom they devour people verse 15 says this they reproduce and that good news they reproduce read the verse what are you scribes pharisees hypocrites because you travel about on sea and land to make one proselyte and When he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourself. To keep this as simple as I can, just kind of keeping it with the metaphor of this abuse and the reversal, all that simply means is they pass their disease along to their victims. They're converts. And when they pass it along to their victim, after victim, after generation, after generation, after generation, This generation down here is more cemented in this system than the person who started it. Do you get that? That's all it means twice as much. It just gets cemented. And by the time you're down here, this whole thing looks normal to you. The dysfunction gets passed down. The distorted spirituality gets passed on from generation to generation. And it seems to get more cemented in each one. Until somewhere along the line, the light goes on, the cycle is broken, someone stands up and says, this is not life, it's death. This is not truth, it's error. This is not lightening my load, it's burdening me down. I've had enough. I want to seek God. The cycle isn't broken until the sexual abuse victim somewhere along the line and that cycle stands up and says, that was too inappropriate, that was not okay, you touched me wrong, and I'm not going to pretend anymore. Doesn't that sound spiritual? See, that sounds spiritual to me. Revival comes when people start saying that spiritually. I'm not going to pretend anymore. Say it out loud. Let's look a little closer at this text and just break it down exegetically. The first thing I want you to know about this reproduction is that it is purposeful. It is purposeful. You travel about on sea and land to make one proselyte. I'm telling you, they are zealous in their evangelism. One of the things that echoed in my mind, and it was a little troubling to me, confusing, was as I see these words, traveling about sea and land to make one proselyte. I heard Jesus in a few chapters after this, echoing in my ear, go into all the world and preach the gospel to every nation. And in my putting together of truth, I'm thinking, well, they're doing that. They're doing that. And wouldn't he kind of give them a pat on the back for going into all the world, preaching the gospel? And it's even more frightening, by the way, when I realize again the context of this rebuke that he's bringing. The context is among who? God's people. He was going to the chosen people of God when he said these words. Israel was designed by God to be the channel through which God was going to reach the world. When they were evangelizing, they were doing what God wanted them to do. It would be as if he would come to the church today and say, I have called you to go over land and sea, and if you just make one convert to Jesus, it is worth it. But what you're bringing to the world is death, not life. And you got my name on this stuff. And I have had enough. Enough. I hate it when my voice does that. Their evangelism was not producing sons of God. this text says their form of evangelism was producing sons of hell. Why? Two reasons that I can think of. There's maybe more, but two that I can think of. Because of their message, first of all. Because of their message. Their message that they were bringing to people was not a message of brokenness. It wasn't calling for brokenness. It wasn't a message of mourning. It wasn't mourning. Remember, that simply means get out here, what is in here. Quit pretending. Let's get honest about our sin. Let's get honest about what's really going on in here. Time to quit slapping the happy face on the outside if you've got pain in here. The time has come to mourn. That means be real about what's going on in here. They're the ones who get the kingdom. They're the ones who get comfort. They weren't bringing that message. They were bringing messages that said, look good, run your factories. We're bringing a message of hungering and thirsting for a righteousness that you can never produced by yourself, so it drives you to grace. They weren't bringing grace in their message. They weren't bringing faith. They weren't communicating that people's only hope was the life of God in them. Their message was this, try harder. And after you've tried harder, try harder some more. And do more. And after you've done more, do some more. And carry the load and keep carrying the load. And it's up to you. And after you're done carrying the load, you better realize this, it's never enough. Keep on doing it. And the whole time you're doing all of that, make sure you look good. Their message did not point to grace and faith. It pointed to law and striving. Their message did not produce brokenness and mourning. It produced self-righteousness and pride. And this text says it was worse than self-righteousness and pride. It produced sons of what? hell. This is not a benign issue. When you see these things, it's not, yeah, they're just saying it different. They're not saying, it's bigger than that. One of the reasons it produces sons of hell is because of the message. The other reason is because I think of their motive, because of their motive. Ask yourself this question. Again, don't apply this to anything right now. Just stay with the text. Why were these guys, these Pharisees, scribes, so zealous? Why were they willing to travel sea and land just to make one proselyte. Spend thousands of dollars just to make what? Love? It was love? It's hard for me to be judgmental about people that I see because I don't always know people's motives, but I know the motive here. It's in the text. Was it them looking at the multitude the way Jesus did in Matthew chapter 9 and seeing the multitude, he felt compassion for them. Why? Because they were distressed and downcast like sheep without a shepherd. And he said, guys, we've got to bring the kingdom to these people because they're dead and they need to come alive. They're wounded and they need to get healed. And they need to experience the reign of God in their life. Let's bring them life. Was that their motive? Love, compassion? No. I already know what their motive is. Verses 1 through 12 told us their characteristics. They were those who put heavy loads on the sheep. They weren't there to take them off. They weren't looking for sheep who had heavy loads so that they could go and relieve their distress, they were looking for people who would accept the load. They were looking for people who would be willing to carry what they, in their self-righteousness, were willing to carry. And then they could feel proud about it. Hear this. These people, Pharisees, these scribes, were not evangelizing. They were recruiting. Know the difference? They were not evangelizing. They were recruiting. And the reason they were recruiting was not so that you could be redeemed and so you could be in a position where the load would be lighter. They were recruiting you so they could add you to their number, which tells me their motive. Their motive isn't to liberate you. It's to validate themselves. If I can get you to sign up for my way, I feel good about me. It has nothing to do with love for you. Nothing. And I am willing to go over land and sea to convert you for me. because that's how I validate me. That's how I feel good about me because I don't get my value from Jesus. I get my value from all the people who I can convince to come my way. I was a freshman at Bethel College. It was a Sunday afternoon and I was with a group of friends of mine. One of them had a TV in his room and so we kind of gathered around this TV to watch a Vikings game. some young people came into that room that we didn't know but they were about our age and kind of wondered what they were doing in there and didn't want them to interrupt my game i soon realized that as they identified themselves that they were from another christian college fairly close to us in fact it was another baptist college and i thought okay that's cool what are you doing here watch the game at your place i soon realized that they didn't come to watch i mean you know that's good i do that share you know and after they made it clear that they were there to to share their faith with us i as quickly as i could because i wanted to get back to the game as quickly as i could assured them that i did indeed love the lord and i was redeemed and the lord was in my heart and so they if they if their if their intention was to get us redeemed we already were and maybe they should go somewhere else where people weren't because we were i was irritated already okay with with this because the game was going and and um but the thing it got worse because they didn't no matter what i said they weren't convinced that i was really redeemed i was clear that i didn't get it i was still missing something and after the conversation went on i i was able to put together the fact that the reason they were convinced that I wasn't saved was, of all things, one of them was I went to Bethel. I mean, if you go to Bethel, you obviously need some help, and that's why we're here. This is absolutely a true thing. The other reason was that I wasn't, at the time, doing what they were doing. And saved people do what they do. They don't watch football on Sunday afternoon. They go out and save other people who think they're Christians, but they're not. At that point, when that became clear to me, I said something to them that convinced them that they really were right about my redeemed status. And they left. When they left, I was really angry. And when they left, I felt invaded. I felt defensive. I felt very confused. And I felt intimidated. In fact, I was angry at myself for how intimidated I was. Because I thought, why do you care what they think? And yet, even though I had all sorts of teaching about grace, and I knew where my value was, those people entered in my life for 10 minutes. And it was everything I took not to run after them and try somehow to convince them that I really was okay. And I was so intimidated in 5 or 10 minutes by this message that said, you don't measure up, you're not enough, that I was willing to shuck everything that I had ever known about God's grace and what makes me okay to jump through whatever hoops they had for me to jump through so they would think I was okay. You want to know something? They, however, did not come there to convert me to Jesus. They came there to convert me to their system. And if I could have convinced them, and if I would have done all the things that would have set right with their system, they would have gone, okay, you fit. I don't believe they came there for me. I believe they came to that room for themselves. They did not come there to lift any load off of me. They came to give me theirs. I do not believe they came into that room to evangelize me. They came to recruit me. They did not come into that room, I do not believe, to liberate me. They came in that room to validate themselves. and by the way they probably did leave feeling pretty good well we gave them the word don't worry about it i know more now than i did then that whole dynamic that whole scenario was right out of galatians chapter 6 verse 12 where it says they are those who would make a fair show in the flesh and they would compel you to be circumcised to do all the things in their system but the reason they're compelling you to be circumcised is really only because then they can boast in your flesh because what validates them isn't jesus what validates them is getting you to do what they want and that's what fills them that's where all the manipulation starts now you got role reversal again and i'm getting you to do what i want for me not for you it has nothing to do with love for you I got to stick with the text. That kind of evangelism produces sons of hell. By the way, just so you know, this is not a new thing. At the time of Christ, these very same Pharisees identified two kinds of converts. Remember, they'd go over land and sea to produce one proselyte. There were two kind of proselytes to them. There was a proselyte, what they called a proselyte of the gate, and then there was a proselyte of righteousness. The proselyte of the gate was a Gentile who, when they heard of the true God, Yahweh, the true God of Israel, and then they heard of the necessity to have faith in him, believed. They just believed. Acts chapter 16, verse 14, and Acts chapter 18, verse 17 identifies people like this as true worshipers of God. I would call them simple believers. Jesus is my only hope. I don't know a lot about all the other stuff, but Jesus is my only hope. That's a proselyte of the gate. They're in the gate. They came in. I love Jesus. What else? What? Pharisees were not terribly impressed with these people. Didn't even think them to be converted. Not really. The proselytes that they were jazzed about were the proselytes of righteousness. The proselytes of righteousness were people who were not just converted to God. They got converted to the system. Meaning this. They bought the bag. They got circumcised. They didn't just love God. They got circumcised. They learned the rituals. They learned the rules. They learned the Levitical and traditional system. And before these people realized what was even happening, they began to know more about how to be a good Pharisee than how to be a genuine man of God or a woman of God. Do you understand the difference? Because they were buying the system, not necessarily God. They were not learning how to become followers of God. They were learning how to become followers of Pharisees. And they weren't becoming followers of Jesus. If I were to update it, it would be if in systems today, we are not producing people who are being genuine heart responders to Jesus. We're producing good Baptists. We're producing good Catholics, good Lutherans, good Methodists, good Alliance. Have you ever seen that? Where what people are getting converted to isn't God, it isn't Jesus, it's to a system. And the way you can spot that is when people know what it means to be a good Baptist more than they know what it means to be a born of the spirit child of God. It's when people know what it means to be a good Catholic more than they know what it means to be a born of the spirit child of God. They know what it means to be a good Presbyterian or Methodist or Alliance person more than they know what it means to be a born of the spirit child of God. We are not here to convert people to a system. We are here to push them and point them and direct them to their only hope, who is Jesus alone. But I know it's a fact. I grew up in a good church, I think. where Jesus was exalted. But I still know, in the context of that church growing up in it, I saw this all the time, that there were people coming even out of a pretty healthy system who knew the traditions of their denomination, who knew the distinctives of their denomination, whether it be Baptist, Catholic, Lutheran, whatever. It doesn't matter. But all of a sudden, the focus was they knew the distinctives of the denomination more than they understood Scripture. In fact, that was so powerful that when they actually began to hear the unadulterated Word of God, it sounded like a brand new thing to them, like they'd never heard it before. Well, where did that come from? I never knew Jesus got mad. To the Pharisee, the one who converted to their system was the true convert. The text says the one who converted to the system wasn't even a child of God. They were producing sons of hell. it goes on next week as we hit into verse 16 that in systems like this you're going to find that people who even though they look real holy they lie you never get a straight answer from people they'll swear by the temple oh it wasn't really the temple it was the gold and a double talk and it's all around they can't ever talk straight they'll never say they're sorry and it'll go on and on over the next week or so how do we conclude this i told mark yesterday that part of these sermons kind of feel like they go 100 miles an hour we've got to stop now i want to conclude with the question how do you break the cycle how do you break the cycle what if you grew up in a system like this i'm real mindful right now that maybe there's some people here who feel like they grew up in a system just like this the characteristics of verses 1 through 12, were there in force. You grew up in a system where the authority was a false thing, where heavy loads were tied to you, where the strong arm of grace never did lift, where the pretending to be spiritual was the focus, and it even looked normal to you, and you got into it yourself. And now you're beginning to see, even maybe through some of this teaching here in chapter 23, that the impact on you was that the reality of the kingdom was shut off for you. Maybe not redemptively. Maybe you are in the kingdom, but the fullness of the joy of Jesus and the rule of God in your life in a free way was shut off from you. Maybe you're even identifying ways in which you have been devoured by spiritual abuse in one form or another. Now that you're even identifying that maybe that disease has been reproduced in you, and that's frightening because the end of that reproduction is that the people are twice as much a son of hell. The question would be this. can the cycle be broken if i grew up in a system like this can the cycle be broken the answer to that question is yes absolutely it's called the gospel the gospel breaks the cycle be just like a sexual abuse victim who's the result of generations of that kind of stuff no talk but it's been there in the family the cycle can be broken but somewhere along the line it's got to be said out loud. The way the cycle is broken, the light needs to go on. Truth needs to be heard. We need to stop our denying. There needs to be a breaking of the silence. Somebody needs to blow the whistle. Somebody needs to say it out loud. The way Jesus did in the courtyard of the Gentiles enough. This system is sick. It doesn't produce life. It produces death. It isn't about internal reality. It's about external performance. It's not about real authority. It's about pretend authority. It devours people. It's not about giving people life and lifting the load. It just puts loads on people. And it's shut off the kingdom and it devours people and it reproduces itself. And what it reproduces? Death. And I want to tell you something. If you are in a sexual abuse cycle where you are the end of a generation of that kind of stuff and you are the one that God uses to rise up and say, enough of this, I'm going to say it out loud. If you are one who has been the result of a cycle of spiritual abuse, and it's been what I described in verses 1 through 12, kingdom's been shut up, you've been devoured, it's developed disease in you, and you are the one who decides to stand up and say, this is not right, you will be so appreciated, won't you? In that sexual abuse system, you become the problem, don't you? How dare you say that about daddy, about grandpa? Oh, he loves you how dare you say that about past our church is wonderful we love it's one god jesus the fact is this everyone i've ever known please hear me now i just needs to readminister to you especially those of you who've been called to break the cycle in your family or your church or whatever. Every person I've ever known who was called of God or used of God to break the cycle of abuse in their family or in their church, whether it be sexual or spiritual, who for some reason had the light of truth turned on and then they saw the problem and then said it out loud. Anyone I've ever seen do that paid an enormous price for doing it. I've seen people here came out of sexual abuse issues where the light got turned on, they said it out loud, and we have seen you come through to health and vitality and joy again in your marriage and a rediscovery even of your own humanity. We've seen people break the cycle of spiritual abuse the same way, but you paid an enormous price. For those of you who've gone through that kind of thing, I've got a gift for you. It comes right out of the text. You know what you need to know? You need to know that the original breaker of the cycle was Jesus. Would you get a picture in your mind? I can't reproduce this with words, but God's given me a picture. I hope you get it. Get a picture in your mind. 2,000 years ago, Jesus stood in the courtyard of the Gentiles in the face of a system that had a false basis of authority from the pastor, that's why. That was putting heavy loads on people, not lifting them off. That had an external demonstration and constant display of spirituality. We're the most spiritual. And Jesus stood in that courtyard and in the face of that kind of system that produced sons of hell said, I've had enough. I've had enough, and I'm going to fight for my people. And I'm going to break the silence, and I'm going to break the cycle of religious pretense and spiritual abuse so that people who come to me can come to life, can come to real authority, can come to real godliness, can come to the load being lifted so they can live for the first time in their life. And when he said that out loud in the courtyard of the Gentiles, he was so appreciated. You know, the fact is this, that he said this and two days later they, what, killed him for it. He paid an enormous price for what he said right here. Just like some of you who've had to stand up and say, enough, you've paid an enormous price. Jesus paid an enormous price too. And you know what else you need to know? He knew he was going to pay an enormous price when he said it out loud. i know that he knew when he was saying this the whole time there was a little voice it was the voice of god you're going to die for this you're going to die for this you're going to die for this and jesus kept saying i don't care i don't care i don't care i have come to set the people free get a picture would you get a picture don't ever if it's a god will give it to you as a gift it'll never go away i hope get a picture of jesus and the courtyard of the gentiles fighting for us see what i want just as i close i wonder if there's anybody here who needs to know that jesus fights for us need to know that you ever need to know it read matthew 23 not only does jesus fight for us you know what he does he dies for us he died for us and after you play that scene out in your mind that jesus fights for us and then he died for us and then he rose for us so we could live there's one thing i want to add to those things he does for us he calls to us he calls to us you know what he says hear it this morning he says this come unto me all you who are what weary and heavy laden you've had the burden put on you and somebody lied to you and told you you were supposed to carry me come into me all you who are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest and you'll take my yoke and the the paradox of my yoke is my yoke is easy my yoke is easy i got a yoke of grace that's going to invade your life and empower you to do what in the flesh you could never do come into me all you who are weary i'll give you rest And I got another word for you men and women who are battered and bruised and wounded and beat up, battered reeds. I don't break off. And smoldering wicks I will not put out. Until I lead justice to victory in my name, the Gentiles will hope. But he's our only hope. We're not here to call people to a system. our system, open door, alliance. We're here to call people to Jesus, who is our only hope. That is such good news. Would you stand with me and pray? I'm overwhelmed, Lord, again with the reality that you fight for us and that you are the original reconciler, you are the original cycle breaker. and god as you are the original reconciler you have then given to us the ministry of reconciliation so that we go into all the world and tell people that they can be reconciled to god what a joy what a joy what a privilege to be able to be able to tell people that the light has come that the life is here that they can drink well from the water that won't from from water that won't run out and they can eat bread that will satisfy the hunger of their human soul but father this text us that we are not only called to be reconcilers just like you were a reconciler, but I think this text in a roundabout way says to us that we are to be cycle breakers too. Like you were a breaker of the cycle, we are too. To stand up and turn on the light and tell the truth. Jesus, I pray that you administer to the people here this morning who need to know you fight for them. And you would give them boldness in coming from ministry if that's what they need. to get the load lifted, to get the wound healed, to receive from you and see you as you really are, the minister of life and light and grace and truth. Do your work among us, even as we sing in Jesus' name. Amen. Thank you.
