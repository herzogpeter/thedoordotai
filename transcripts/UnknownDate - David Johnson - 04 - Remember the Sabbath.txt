Let's pray. The invitation that we just heard from the song is to come and listen. The request, my request, is that we would actually be able to hear what it is that you're saying to your church, to us, and I pray that in Jesus' name. Amen. Over the last several weeks, as most of you know, we've been examining and coming to understand why the prophets, why the psalmist, why the rabbis, including our Rabbi Jesus, when speaking of the law, said things like this, it's sweeter than honey. Yes, sweeter than the drippings of the honeycomb to my taste, primarily because they saw the law, particularly the Ten Commandments, which is what we're dealing with these days, not as a list of things they had to do to get God to like them, not as a means by which they could earn their salvation, their redemption. They already had that. It's very important to keep remembering in the flow of our study, Exodus chapter 20, verse 2, for I am already the Lord your God. That's a done deal. And you are already my people who have been called out of Egypt, already called out of then delivered from the house of slavery. So the law was not about things you had to do to get God to like you or become redeemed. Rather, the law was seen by them and by Jesus as a wonderful gift from a loving God, providing for them the best possible information on how to actually live life as an already brought out by God child of God and how to live this life in the kingdom of God to the full. Indeed, Jesus in John 10.10 says that he's about exactly the same thing. I am come, he said, that you might have what? Life. The thief has come to steal, kill, and destroy life. But I have come that you might have it, and that you might have it to the full, abundantly, richly. But that life, Jesus makes it very clear. Our rabbi makes it very clear. Will not be entered into an experience by abolishing the law, Matthew 5.17. For do not think, he said, that I have come to abolish the law. I did not come to abolish the law, but to fulfill it. In other words, to bring the law into the fullness of its expression and to show you what it actually looks like when the precepts of God, the law, are really being lived, are fully integrated into the spirit, to the essence, to the nefesh of a human being. And he showed us how the law looked when it was really integrated into a life by the life that he actually lived. And it's why in Matthew 5, when Jesus says things like this, you've heard it said, because it's in the law, thou shalt not murder. But I say anger is the real issue. What he's doing there, what he's doing there in that very dynamic is bringing the law to a place of fullness, to a place of integration. Because if you get that, where you're in your spirit, free from anger, if you get to that place where you're nefesh, your essence is free from anger, you won't even need the law. Thou shalt not commit murder. But thou shalt not commit murder is a good start. If you're murdering and you stop doing that, that's a really good step in the right direction. But you're not done. I mean, wouldn't it be great to be really free and assimilate and have the intent of that law really integrated into the fullness of your spirit where you're free from anger? Nobody ever has to tell you one more time, don't murder anybody. Which is why I've been referring to the Ten Commandments, actually, as kind of kindergarten, really. And God's dealing with his people because in many ways, these Ten Commandments were given to his people and then to us at a time in their life when they were just beginning. Keep that in mind. It's very important. As God is calling his people out from slavery, that's exactly the context. It's as if he's saying, you know what? Let's start here. With you and me in relationship now as you're coming out of slavery and that old life that had you bound and as you're just beginning to learn how to live as a free person and step into the fullness of your destiny that I have planned for you as the groom, you being the bride, It would really be good to start here. You need to figure out, first of all, what it means to put God first. And if that was really ingrained in your spirit, integrated into your spirit, you wouldn't need a rule like that. But it's a good place to start to figure out what it means to put God first and get rid of your false gods. Accept no substitutes. Revere my name. We talked about that last week and the week before. Observe my day. Honor your parents. Don't commit adultery. Don't kill anybody. Don't lie. Don't steal. Pretty basic stuff. But it's a good place to start. Today is the fourth great commandment in the law that we're going to deal with. The text words it, says it this way. Exodus 20, verse 8. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Holy means set apart. So put a boundary around this day. Protect this day. Six days you shall labor and do all your work. But the seventh day is a Sabbath of the Lord your God. in it, you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or female servant or your cattle or your sojourner, your visitor who's come and visited you for the weekend, who stays with you. Here's why. Because in six days, the Lord made the heavens and the earth. There's something dialed into creation here that's important. And the sea and all that is in them and rested on the seventh day, he rested on the seventh day. Therefore, the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy. The Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy. And a blessed by God day is a really good day. A blessed by God day is a look forward to day. It's a gift from God day. But here's the deal. By the time of Jesus' day, it didn't feel like a good day at all. Because this day, designed by God as a gift to be the best day of the week, by Jesus' day, had become in the hands of some religious people the worst day, the hardest day, the easiest day to get in trouble day, which is, by the way, what religion and religious people always do. Even to good gifts from God, religion and religious people spoil, even kill good gifts from God. So the things designed by God to bring joy and to invite his people into life in the hands of religion feels like drudgery and death, something you ought to do but don't want to do. I mean, religion in general, and religious people in particular, could spoil a picnic by the lake on a summer afternoon because it wouldn't be about laughing and singing, which kind of is what picnics are for. It wouldn't be about eating and laughing and being with your friends. No, if it was in the hands of religious people, the picnic would be about doing the picnic right. Have you ever been around people like that? Which is an odd sort of way. Exactly what happened to Sabbath day in Jesus' day. It was almost as if it had become a contest for who could rest the most. God said rest. And who could rest the best? Like the picnic that turned into something that we weren't doing right. And in the middle of trying to figure that out, you weren't having any fun. The Sabbath had become the same way, indeed, rabbis would argue. In Jesus' day, trying to prove how holy they were by how little they did, often pressing this to extreme levels. For example, one rabbi said you couldn't carry a burden that weighed more than a fig because that would be work, but you could carry something that weighed half a fig twice. What freedom! That was a real liberal rabbi who said that. Had another taught that if you threw an object into the air with one hand and caught it with the other, that was a violation of Sabbath. But if you caught it with the same hand, that was okay, okay, hope I do this right. Taylor couldn't carry a needle lest he sew. A scribe couldn't carry a pen lest he write. A student couldn't carry a book lest he read. According to some rabbis, it was unlawful to take a bath on the Sabbath because you might spill water on the floor inadvertently washing it. You couldn't sew. You couldn't plow. You couldn't reap, thresh, winnow, sift, grind, knead bread, bake bread, wash clothes, make two threads, tie a knot, untie a knot, light a fire, extinguish a fire, all of which turned this day designed by God to lift the burden into a day that was a burden. That's just what religion and religious people do to everything. By the way, that whole religious thing, that's a whole little side talk, just for free. but here's the deal here's the deal around Sabbath most of us I think it was important to say the stuff I just said but most of us, for most of us the problem I just described of legalistic religion hijacking our deep experience of Sabbath is not our problem with Sabbath it's not the reason most of us don't enter into or experience this concept of Sabbath very well though some of you may have memories as a kid of some ways you got in trouble on Sunday and it was kind of the worst day and I have some memories like that, but they're memories. It's not what I live in now. It's not the reason I have a struggle with understanding Sabbath or experiencing it or entering into it. More likely for most of us, our problem with experiencing Sabbath is that we don't understand enough about it to actually value it. And if you don't value it, you won't become curious about it and even wonder more about it. You won't incorporate it. And if you don't incorporate it, I promise you won't experience it. And the problem with not experiencing Sabbath is that it's a pretty big thing to miss. So what I want to do today relative to Sabbath is to go back to the beginning, to go back to, in a sense, to kindergarten, to kind of in our minds go back actually to the text. I think it's very consistent with the text. Go back to Exodus 20, verse 8, when God gave them this very basic thing about taking a day where we learn the fundamentals, the basics of why God gave us Sabbath in the first place and why it might be a good idea to enter it and to experience it and then to see. And this is where I want, the reason I want to do the fundamentals is because I want to go here because I want to then help us see what it looks like when this Sabbath day rule actually becomes integrated into a life. Because Jesus did not come to abolish the law, particularly Sabbath. He didn't come to abolish it, but to fulfill it. And our rabbi Jesus not only did that, but he came to show us what it looks like when Sabbath day rest is really lived in a real life, not just on one day, but integrated into life. And as we get into that, we're going to find out that Sabbath is about a day, but it's not just about a day. A day is like when you're in Kittering Garden, how you kind of start to learn about it. It starts with a day, but it gets integrated into life. Sabbath. Sabbath day rest. A concept about which I want us to understand for fundamental kind of building block things, three things, that Sabbath is first of all about rest, obviously. I mean, that's the word that kind of pops out at you the most even in the text. But more, and if you leave it at just a day of rest, you maybe get a taste, but you're not there. It's more than that. It's about realignment of your life and your spirit. And more than that, it's about remembering some things that bring you into Sabbath. Let's deal first of all with this issue of rest, which is designed by God to restore. In Exodus 23, just a few chapters later, he's talking about Sabbath again, and the word that's used there is refresh. The purpose of the Sabbath is to refresh. Viannefesh is the word in the Hebrew, to restore the soul. Nefesh is the essence of the person, to restore your essence. And the word Sabbath in the Hebrew is actually rendered Shabbat, which means to cease. Primarily from work, for you shall not do any work, Exodus 20, verse 10, 66 days you will work, but the seventh is a Sabbath to the Lord, and I want you to protect that day, build a boundary around that day, which is what it means to keep it holy, to set it apart. So at its most basic level, in kindergarten, understanding of this, What God seems to be saying here is simply this. I want you to take a day off, which I think is a really good idea. Not incredibly deep, but it's a really good idea. But it strikes me as an odd thing that he commands it. I mean, I remember when I was in college and even a little into my later years, I was working construction, and I would work construction in the summer, and it would be 95 degrees, and we'd work all day. And it was a weird thing because about Friday at about 3 o'clock, we'd get off at 5, and at about 3 o'clock, Most of the guys on my crew, you could tell in their body language, they started slowing down and they started looking at their cars and looking at their watches. They were getting ready for Sabbath. They didn't know a thing about Sabbath. And when the bell went off, they didn't walk through their cars. They ran through their cars and they skidded. They were really in a hurry to rest. And so the idea, I commend you to rest, sounds weird to me. At one level. Stop, relax, take a load of it. I commend you to do nothing. Some of you parents of teenagers are getting nervous. You're going, this is not only an odd commandment, it's a dangerous one. I'm serious. So here's a quick word about that. To those of you who seem to respond quite well to this command, indeed, you don't really need this command at all because you do nothing all the time. Please notice the rhythm. It's very important, actually. Six days you shall work and complete all your work. you'll get it done then you'll rest the rhythm is really important it's written in a creation 6 and 1 6 in Exodus 23 he even speaks of the land there's a rhythm in creation there's a rhythm in nature for the land for 6 years you will plant and reap from the land and the 7th you'll let it go you'll leave it alone it's written in creation there's a rhythm here of 6 work is a good thing but then the rest it speaks to a rhythm And the rest is in order to restore you, to replenish you so that you can actually keep on working. So you can stay at it, be productive for a long time, like your whole life long. It's about a rhythm. Get that word about this, because it really is about that. Now, in order to really dial into how important this command was and what a gift it actually was to the people of God when they originally got it, we need to remember something, and this is just as obvious as can be. What we need to remember is who they were and where they were in the story of God dealing with his people. Remember where they were. What had they just been called out of? Slavery. So the life that they knew most at the time this word was being given was a life of slavery. And here's the deal about slaves. They don't get a day off. Either figuratively or really, no rest if you're a slave. Primarily because slaves, slave masters, don't care at all about the slaves. Just what they produce. So I will use you, and I will suck the life out of you, and I really don't care about your actual life. I just want you to produce. So here's the deal. Part of this commandment, literally, in the actual lives of these people, as it's being given to them at this kindergarten level of their life, is an invitation into a different kind of life, a different rhythm of life that for the first time in their life isn't being driven by a slave master. And because they'd never really known this kind of life, And this represented an entirely different way to live and a different rhythm of life. God says, I'm commanding you. This isn't going to feel normal to you. I'm commanding you to do something that probably won't even feel right at the beginning. And my command is this. Stop. Cease striving. Quit earning. Stop proving. One day a week. Take a day off. And I promise you, this is kindergarten stuff. Because if this one day a week doesn't bleed into anything else, if it doesn't get integrated into any other part of your life, you really don't get it. But it's a good place to start. It's a good place to start. It's kindergarten. It's how you begin. Let me ask you a question. Is there anyone, you think, in this room, or is there anyone maybe that you know, a distant relative somewhere, or maybe someone you read about in the newspaper one day who has a hard time resting, taking a day off, letting it go for 10 minutes, You know anybody who just can't stop, cease striving, earning, deserving, proving? Well, if you know anybody like that, and maybe if that person's you, maybe it's because you're a slave. What? What? I'm not in Egypt? No, maybe you're a slave. To I don't know what, actually. And maybe you don't know either. To I don't know who. What is the voice in my head that just keeps me going and doesn't let me rest? But the truth is, you're driven. By fear? I don't know. Is that it? By a need to prove? By a need to deserve? I don't know. And by the way, if you are driven, often we haven't done the work to wonder why we are. But if you're incapable, you're a slave. A really good exercise would be try to figure out who's my slave master. What is it that's driving this? Now, if you are kind of this driven person, and I think there's a few of you here. There's one on the stage. Back there, we hit him because he's a nut. How would you break a cycle like this? How would you break a cycle? Well, it'd probably take some time, but you know a good place to start? A real practical way to start would be make a rule. And saying you're going to make a rule about this sounds like you're treating me like a child. Well, it's because you're in kindergarten on this issue. Make a rule. Put a boundary around some time. Put a boundary around a day. I wonder if there's any people here who are remembering conversations in your marriage where your spouse, either the wife to the husband or the husband to the wife, who just says, you know what, you know what, here's the deal. Just like no work after five. How about that? Put some boundary around some time in the day. How about no work on Monday? Could we do it Saturday? Would there be a day where we could put a boundary around some time when we would actually have you here? And again, it sounds like, well, you're treating me like a child. That's because on this issue, you're in kindergarten. Now, if you had graduated and rhythm and Sabbath, and what Sabbath is really all about, had kind of become integrated into your soul, you would have a rhythm in your life that wouldn't require anybody saying, you better take a day off. Because you'd be living in a kind of rhythm and a Sabbath. It's just like if somebody has the anger issue dealt with. It's integrated. Nobody has to go, you better not murder. Okay, I'll try to remember. Rabbi Stuart Vogel in his book on the Ten Commandments dealing with this issue of Sabbath said this when God created us among the things he gave us was dominion I want you to rule, subdue and multiply the earth God said what that requires is work and work is a good thing work is a God thing a very fulfilling thing actually so we went to work and got dominion, and we have dominion all week long. But in doing that, we lost dominion, says Vogel. We lost control of something very important, our time. And one way he suggests, again, this is kind of kindergarten here, to get back control of your life is this. Just start you out with this. Remember the Sabbath day, to put a boundary around that one day, To keep it holy, set apart, protect that day, put a boundary around that day. Even if you have more to do that day, you need to stop. That day you need to cease, and this will get you, and leave, see if you can do this, and leave what's undone undone. Which, by the way, if you struggle with what I'm talking about today, leaving undone what's undone pushes all sorts of buttons. See, one of the side benefits of this command that you may not appreciate, especially if you are a slave of some sort, is that in trying to do this, establish, you know, some Sabbath kind of rhythm in your life, you may actually discover that you're absolutely incapable of doing it. Because many of us have no idea how driven we are until we try to stop. In fact, most of you, if you've been doing it for long enough, you have no idea how driven than you are, but if you try to stop, fidgety, you'll get depressed. I read all this in a book. I have no idea about any of these things truly. Vague senses of guilt, and the vague sense of guilt is like, I should be doing something. You know, some of this is how you're wired. There are different people who are wired different. Some of this even has to do with your job. I told you a bit ago that I worked construction in college. One of the things I loved about construction was at the end of the day, I was done. I could look back at what I did and go, there it is, there it is, it's done. And I'd walk away and I wouldn't think about it all day long. Ministry was different. It was never, ever, ever done. Oh, poor Dave. No, it's not for that. Some of you have jobs just like that. You have careers where, you know, if you're, I don't want to be demeaning to hamburger flippers, but if you're flipping hamburgers, at the end of the day, you're done. I did 50. You're done. You don't carry that all day long, except what you might carry is how incredibly bored you are. But if you're the manager, there's a different thing there. You're in a different place, and it's never done. So how does a person like that find rhythm? But here's the deal, and this is where we need to graduate from kindergarten. It's not just about physical rest. And the way I can prove that is this. Because some of you do take a day off, and you do get a vacation. How many of you know that you can take a day off, I'm doing the Sabbath, and you don't feel rested? So maybe there's something else to rest than just physical rest. How many of you have ever taken a vacation and you came back from vacation, I don't feel rested at all. Because it's about a day, but it's more than a day. God says, start here, you're in kindergarten. If you think you've arrived with that, you don't, it's okay, start there. Because this Sabbath that Jesus, God is inviting his people into is not just about physical rest. It's about a realignment of your spirit. And I even think that maybe the dissatisfaction with physical rest would make you hungry for what I'm about to talk about now. There's got to be more. So you start looking for maybe something like this. In fact, when it says in Exodus 20 and in Genesis 2 that God rested on the seventh day, and this is very important, It wasn't because he was tired. God worked six days, rested the seventh. The picture in your mind is not of God with his hands on his knees, whew, hot of breath, wow, that is so exhausting, creating the whole world in six days, I'm pooped. No, no, no, no, no. This is big. He didn't rest because he was tired. He rested because he was done. No, no, no, no, think of Jesus on the cross. It is what? done. Oh, there's some Sabbath rest. I smell something there. We'll come back to it. He was done. Genesis 2 actually makes it clear. It starts in Genesis 1, verse 31. Listen for the language here. And God saw all that he made, and behold, it was very good. This is good stuff. It's like he's looking at his creation and saying, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, stop a second. Let's look at this. Let's celebrate this. Let's smell. That's just, this is a good day. I want to give you a good day to just look around and go, wow. But notice your family. Notice the people you love. That was very good. And it was evening and it was morning the sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth were what? Completed and all their hosts. And by the seventh day God what? Completed his work which he had done. He rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. Here's the deal, you guys. The Sabbath day is not just a day of physical rest. today or a discipline of spiritual realignment, the discipline that you really need to enter into. And the spiritual realignment is to this eternal truth that there's a God in heaven and it isn't you. He is the one who did the work of creation on the cross. He is creator. He is sustainer, redeemer, provider, healer, convictor, not you. And see, here, most of us spent the whole week acting like that stuff was up to us. What would break that cycle? A feeling like you're in control of everything and everyone. Take a break. Not physically. See, I don't think anybody in this room actually believes that they are the creator. That was a goofy thought. You don't believe that you are the sustainer, the redeemer, the convictor, the healer. We just act like it. Because if I don't do it, and if I don't hold it, and if I don't fix it, lead it, change it, heal it, correct it, who will? Because the fact is, everything and everyone in my whole life will fall apart if I sit down. And nobody here actually believes that way. We just act that way. So Sabbath day, you guys, is a gift from God designed to interrupt that joy-stealing, life-destroying cycle by saying once a week, I want you to cease, not just physically, but to realign yourself spiritually to this eternal truth. There's a God in heaven, and it isn't you. You're not the creator, sustainer. I am. now let me just dress this out in some real practical ways how this level and we're in about first grade now on this one how this level of entering into Sabbath rest ministers to and guards against some pretty significant things one would be pride see the fact is that some of you are really good at what you do and it's a really good thing you have wonderful gifts and seemingly endless capacities to create you literally make music some of you, poetry, art, books some of you build houses and bridges and roads some of you are able to provide resources for your family and for your friends and for society at large you are a provider it's who you are, it's what you do but it's who you are and you're really good at it and it's a really good thing still others move very easily in gifts of the spirit, gifts of healing and deliverance and evangelism and everywhere you go people get healed and churches get built. Why would people like that need Sabbath rest? This realignment of your spirits. Well, I think the reason people who are really good at what they do need Sabbath is to remind them again of this eternal truth that there's a God in heaven and it isn't you. And if you really enter into that with authentic humility, it will humble you and it mitigates against pride. You are not all that. God uses you, and it's incredible, and you have wonderful gifts, and enjoy them. But once a week, step back and go, oh, that's good. And you know what? It isn't me. I have a friend. He's a heart surgeon. And sometimes in the course of a single day, he will hold in his hand three or four human hearts, open their chest and have his hand on their hearts. And it's weird because at the end of the day, they're still alive. See, if I had them, they wouldn't be alive anymore. Not only are they alive, they're better. Do you think at any level, you know, in his whole life, that's kind of heady stuff? Do you think somebody like that might at any time in their life, maybe if they're not grounded in some way, get this idea that they're all that, that they are the healer? You've never met a doctor like that, have you? Hmm. but what a beautiful and sweet thing it is when a man or a woman like that like my friend who's a heart surgeon says in response to a word like this you know what it's really important that I set some rhythms in my life where with intentionality and regularity I realign my heart to this eternal truth there's a God in heaven and it isn't me he is creator, sustainer, provider, healer And one of the things that stirs you to do is worship. Last week, oh, magnify the Lord with me. And all these people, you, all of you who create and build and do really good things all week, humble yourselves and say, it doesn't meet you, and it centers you. But it doesn't just mitigate against pride, this discipline. It mitigates against despair as well, which sounds weird. But it's not. You know why? Because sometimes things don't go well. And sometimes the patient isn't healed. You know what you need to know then? You need to know there's a God in heaven and it isn't you. You are not responsible for everything. Indeed, it even guards against obsessing, which I know nothing about. When it isn't working, when they aren't responding, when it isn't growing, whatever it is that I want to grow isn't growing or changing, and you just know you can do it. If you try a little harder and do a little more, but the problem is the more you push and the more you force, the worse it gets, how desperately you need a Sabbath. A rhythm of life where beyond physical rest, which quite often doesn't help at all, you spiritually realign yourself to this eternal truth. There is a God in heaven, and it isn't you. So cease striving and know that what? I am God. See, what's weird about this rhythm is that if you could finally let go of control, of trying to have the outcome go your way, if you could finally let go of that trying to push thing and relax and enter rest, you could actually get back to work and be productive. Third purpose of this Sabbath thing is to remember. I love this. Rest, realign, and remember. Remember what? That once you were slaves, it's really important that you remember where you're from. And Sabbath is an invitation to remember this on a regular basis. So part of the purpose of Sabbath is to remember your redemption. and indeed this is it's a real good reason to go to church once a week now if what you experience at church doesn't bleed into other aspects of your life so that you know on a Monday you remember your redemption as well well then I don't know what the value of this entirely is but it's why you would set some time apart and come to a place like this and lift your hands and hear the words of amazing grace when you remember when you were slain In fact, it says exactly this, Deuteronomy 5, 15. Again, we're in Torah. We're in the law here. It goes from Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and they're still talking Sabbath. The Sabbath thing is a pretty big thing. And God says to his people, you shall remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt. It's extremely important that you remember that. And the Lord your God brought you out of there. And he brought you out with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore, the Lord has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day and when you observe it, to remember that at one time you were slaves. That at one time you were, here's the word to you, church, that at one time you were dead in your transgressions and in your sin, Ephesians 2, verse 1. But God, being rich in mercy because of the great love with which he loved us, has made us alive together with Christ and raised us up with him and seated us in the heavenly places and I want you to remember that it's by grace you've been saved come back to that because you got into a cycle this week that was acting as if you could deserve it if you got good enough I want you to come back and remember it was by grace you were saved through faith and that not of yourselves it was a gift not as a result of your work to get God to like you. Not as a result of your work where you were deemed out of Egypt. Come back. Now just with that verse, be the people of God in Exodus 20. Hear the word of the Lord. I am already the Lord your God who has already brought you out of Egypt. And your work is not about earning salvation, earning my favor. You already have that. And if you would enter into that rest and that reality, you might actually be able to get back to work. and figure out what it means to put me first, accept no substitutes, revere my name, observe my day, enter into a rhythm of life where you regularly remember where you're from. Hebrews 4.9 says, there remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God. At the end of the Bible, Hebrews is on at the end of the Bible, we're still talking about Sabbath rest. But in Hebrews 4.9, we're not talking about a day anymore. It starts with a day. That's kindergarten. And you need to start there. Build some disciplines in. But the Sabbath day rest that Hebrews 4.9 is talking about is not a day. It's found in a person. Our Rabbi Jesus. Indeed, Paul in Colossians 2.16 says this, and this is kind of a balance of what real Sabbath rest is and why it's not just in a day, because he says this, let no one act as your judge with regard to food or drink, to a festival or to a Sabbath day. Don't let anybody tell you how to do that. Because those things were merely a shadow designed to point to something else. Those things were important, but they were kindergarten. Designed to point to what was to come for the real substance of Sabbath. And now we're talking about something that might actually be integrated in someone's life. for the real substance of Sabbath belongs to and is found in this rabbi we call Jesus, who we're learning to follow. And it's found in his way. It's not like he waves a magic wand and now we're resting. It's found, this kind of rest would be found in his way, our rabbi, Jesus, who says to anyone who wants to follow him, Come follow me. who is he inviting to follow him? Matthew 11, 28. All of you who are weary and heavy laden and don't know how to rest and don't know how to find a rhythm of life that actually helps you be even more productive and available to people you need to be available to, all you who are weary and can't figure it out, come to me and I will give you rest. Take my yoke. This is right out of our rabbi series. What was the yoke of a rabbi? It was their way. It was what they taught and how they lived. Take how I live upon you and learn from me. Pay attention to the rhythms of my life that you see in me, says our rabbi. And learn from me, for I am gentle and humble at heart. And if you learn my way, and if you notice the rhythms of my life, which, by the way, we're going to talk about next week, want to look at these things, you will find rest for your what? Souls. It's not just about physical rest. It would be something to be working really. You know, my prayer when I preach is that I'm working like crazy up here. But I know what it feels like when I'm working like crazy, and on the inside I feel rest. I know what that feels like, and so do you. I get tastes of it. It's very elusive for me and for you. Because I can also tell when I'm up here striving and hoping, I don't know. I hate that. It's really odd. Right after Jesus says, all you who are weary, come and follow my way, and I'll bring you in to rest, and I'll show you a whole different rhythm of life. The very next verse, Jesus, I love this about Jesus. He's such a troublemaker. Jesus, just talking about rest for weary people, he walks into a field with his disciples in Matthew 12, verse 1, on the Sabbath, the rest day. The disciples take some grain of wheat and they roll it in their hands and they eat some of the things which breaks the Sabbath. Which angers the Pharisees who observe the Sabbath but have no rest at all. All they had was religion. Religion which could spoil a picnic by the lake on a summer afternoon. But Jesus, I mean it's just so confrontational without any words. in the middle of all these people doing Sabbath day rest, had an entirely different way. An entirely different rhythm. So if somebody was hungry on the Sabbath, you know what they did? They ate. And if someone was sick on the Sabbath, you know what they did? They healed them. In fact, he was the Sabbath principle. Was so integrated into his life, he actually broke the rule. he did not come to abolish Sabbath he came to show you what it looks like when it's lived here's a question are you curious about that kind of rhythm you're curious about that kind of life see because it clearly is the invitation of Matthew 11 take up my way and learn from me and I will give you rest for your soul which isn't a magic wand. It's a different way to live. Indeed, it's the rabbi's way to live. We're going to talk about more of that next week. Would you stand with me as we close? Lord, as I just reflect on my own spirit and my own struggle with this word and my stepping into it, what dawns on me is, and I think this is not just true of me but many of us that I really have tasted this from time to time and I've gotten whiffs of this and I've entered into it at certain levels but I find it very elusive and I'm just going to assume that many of us do too. We've tasted it, we get it and we don't get it like so many things. And I don't know what grade we all are in in this thing. I pray for the courage for some who maybe are in kindergarten and the courage they need to just really put some boundaries around some things in their lives that are way out of control, and then to maybe enter into some work that would help them discover who their slave master is. What is it that's driving this? Because they've entered into a rhythm of life that's costing them their family, and their marriage, and their joy, and their sleep. And you hear this invitation from a rabbi to a different kind of life. And so some of us kind of stumbling and some of us a little scared. We just want to say, okay, we want to follow you here too, Rabbi Jesus. For those who've had tastes of this and maybe are living in it at pretty healthy levels, the invitation would be to even enter more Sabbath rest. Because the irony is that it just frees us up to be moving with your spirit and authentically going into those places where God is really working. I pray these things be true and become truer and truer among us. And all God's people said, amen.
