Amen. Amen. Let's pray as we move to the ministry of the Word. Beyond right words, it's for the right spirit that I pray. May it be your spirit that we hear. It stirs the heart and calls us to life in the kingdom of God. I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. Having lived as slaves in Egypt for 400-some years, God called them out. With a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, it says in Deuteronomy 5, 15, he delivered them from the only life they had ever known, slavery. They knew how to live as slaves. They didn't know how to live as free men and free women. So when in Exodus chapter 20, God gives to them the Decalogue, which is what we've been studying these days. The deka, meaning ten, log, or logos, meaning word. The ten great words for life, we know them more commonly as the Ten Commandments. They were designed by God to show His already redeemed people. They already belonged to Him. They were designed to show them a different kind of life, a different way to live as free people, as belonging to God's people, not as slaves anymore, which is at least part of why the prophets and the psalmists and the rabbis, including our rabbi Jesus, loved the law, calling it sweeter than honey to the tastes because they saw in the law not a means by which they could get God to like them if they kept it perfectly. That was already a done deal. They already belonged to God. They saw the law as wonderful gifts instead from a loving God providing for them the best possible information on how to live life and how to live it to the full. No longer slaves in Egypt, being driven by a slave master who didn't care about them at all, only what they could produce. They were being invited by the law of all things, by Torah, into a different kind of life that if they chose to actually live it, because they could choose not to, but if they chose to actually live it would enable them not only to stay free and not be subject again to a yoke of slavery like they were in Egypt, but it would enable them to step into the fullness of their destiny as the people of God in the world, the light of the world. And it starts with some pretty basic stuff, this Ten Commandments, these words that will help these people learn how to live a different way, though quite foreign words, to these people who at the beginning of their journey with God had only known how to live as slaves. So it's as if God says, let's just start here with some pretty basic things, some things you need to learn to live as free men and women. Start here. Learn what it means to put God first. And accept no substitutes. Revere his name. Observe his day. Honor your father and your mother, Exodus 20, verse 12. that your days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord your God gives you honor, your father and your mother. It's the fifth commandment in the law, marking actually the halfway point of the Ten Commandments, but marking also a shift in the Ten Commandments from a rightly aligned relationship with God-focused to a rightly aligned relationship with people-focused. Indeed, our Rabbi Jesus reduced all of the commandments in the law to two things, love God and love people. For you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and soul and mind and love your neighbor as yourself. So the first four commandments, generally speaking, that we've been dealing with these weeks, speak to how we rightly interact with God. The remaining six shifts to people, beginning with, and I think appropriately, significantly, beginning with the first relationship we have with another human being on earth, our mother and our father, even if we never knew them, were abandoned by them, it all began there. Now, first thing I want us to notice in the work we have to do around this issue is that the word God uses to describe what people need to have for their parents is honor. And it just weirded me. It's interesting that he doesn't say love them, which doesn't mean you don't need to. But the word he uses is honor, which causes a question for some of you to rise right off the bat, I'm quite sure. The question being this, how do I honor someone who may not be honorable? But I'm getting ahead of myself, actually, with that question. Before we get to the how we should honor our parents, which actually isn't in the text, we need to hear the why we should honor our parents, which is in the text. Here's why. That your days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord your God has given you, which many people hear as kind of a promise of a physically long life. As an individual, it sounds like an individual promise that if you honor your parents and figure out what that means, you will physically live a longer, longer life. Which, you know, is maybe, yeah, okay, it's a little strange though. It makes me wonder if anybody who really did honor their parents might have died young and if there's anybody who's really dishonored their parents, never really even dialed into what that even looked like or how it could actually be lived, might have lived to a very grumpy old age. It does, by the way, have an individual application, this prolonged life, an enhancement of life. And I want to talk about that. But it also has a generational application. And in fact, this is the one I want to dial into because it may be the one you haven't thought of. Indeed, I'm quite convinced that the original hearers heard it generationally before they heard it individually. And in fact, here's is what it would mean generationally. That as you, as an individual and as a community, learn what it means to honor your father and mother. And by the way, it takes a little bit of work to even learn what that means. And you really enter into doing the work involved in what it means to honor your father and mother. Work that, quite frankly, is considerable. As you begin to do that and learn to do that, you will have something of life to give to your children generationally. And if your children turn around and learn what it means to honor you and do the very, very hard work of what that means to authentically honor your father and mother, even if they weren't a very good father or mother. If they do that work, they will have something of life to pass on to their children, and their children will have something to pass on to their children that your days, generationally, as a family, may be prolonged in the land for generations. You get a picture there of generations. And if you don't do this, figure out what it means to honor your father and mother. And if you don't do the work involved, work that is considerable, those days of life being passed from generation to generation so that you would be living in the land, experiencing life as a community, as a family, those days will be shortened. They will be splintered. Because what you will pass on to your children, if you do not do the hard work of what it means to figure out, honoring your father and mother, What you will pass to your children is death and bitterness, anger, rebellion, unresolved issues. All of which means that this commandment to honor your parents, to figure out what that means and then do the work behind it, is entirely for your sake. That your days and your family's days and your children's children's days, as family, as generations, would be enhanced, would be prolonged. Indeed, if you don't figure this out, what it means at some level to honor your parents, regardless of what kind of parents they were or are, you will not only pass on this kind of death generationally, but individually, you will be a slave. And you will be a slave your whole life long to however it is they treated you. You will be a slave to whatever it is they think of you, thus controlling you, even though in your mind you think you're totally free from them. I mean, picture a 35-year-old person. I mean, I can picture a 45-year-old person thinking this relative to their parents. I do exactly what I want. No one tells me. Really. I have a therapist friend who told me of a client that he had who in dealing with some of these very issues of father and mother and all those things had come to realize that from the age of 15 to 25, when he was 15 years old to about when he was 25 years old, he did just about everything his parents ever wanted him to do. And it kind of came in the guise of honoring your parents. But after a while, what he really felt was totally controlled. He didn't have his own voice. He didn't have his own mind. And so from the age of 25 to 35, he went the opposite direction. Pretty much rebelled. That's kind of an old age to start rebellion. but he went the opposite and just about everything that he knew his parents wanted him to do he would do the opposite and during that season he kind of thought he was free I'm breaking away, I'm being my own person but at the end of the day after he began to do his own work considerable amount of work involved in this he began to realize that for the entire 20 years from the time he was 15 when he thought he was honoring his parents to the time he was finally getting free the truth that he realized is this, that the entire 20 years he was a slave. Because pretty much everything he did, one way or another, was connected to or in reaction to his parents. What they said, what they thought, even when he thought he was being free, he was an absolute slave to what they thought. Dan Allender in his book Bold Love tells how one young man chose a career as a lawyer as a means to live out his crusade against all pretenders and fakers. Which on the surface of things is a really good thing, I think. But you've got to wonder, like a lot of things that drive anybody, where did that come from? Where did the drive to do all that come from? Well, it turns out his father was a pompous, arrogant businessman who used his position and power to humiliate and control people, but also to control and humiliate his mother and himself as well. So the son wanted his father to pay. Didn't know how to do that, didn't even know how to say that. Brimming with the furious tempest of vengeance, says Allender in his book of this young man. The practice of law provided a vehicle for well-paid, socially sanctioned retribution. See, he couldn't prosecute his father, nor could he speak a disagreeable word to him. Never had the courage to even stand up to his dad face to face and say, Dad, it's not okay. But he could make other cruel men pay. But there's a problem in this thing. As he was doing this and being driven by this, in the process of all of that, He himself became cruel, eventually losing his own son the same way his father lost him, eventually losing his wife as well. He was a slave. Now, when I picture this kind of individual, he's being driven by this kind of anger, but he doesn't connect the dots to these kinds of sources. I mean, just imagine suggesting to a guy like that that the only way for him to get free would be for him to figure out what it means and then begin to do the work of coming to authentically honor his father and honor his mother. My guess is if you suggested that to someone like this, you wouldn't get much of an audience. In fact, you might get no small amount of resistance. I have no idea what you're telling me. You have no idea what my father's like. But here's the problem. If you want to come out of your slavery, people of God, who've been living in Egypt and you've only known one place to live and one way to live, here's the deal. There is no other way. There is no other way out of this kind of slavery than figuring out what it actually does mean to honor your father and mother and then begin to do the hard work of living that out. And by the way, for some of you, it's the hardest work you will ever do. It's the longest journey you will ever take. To which the rabbi says, Come follow me into this journey, and I will bring you into a different kind of life. If you really want to be free. A lot of people don't. So let's get to the question. So maybe those of you who actually want to do the work and know what work to do. The question is this, what does it mean to honor your father and mother regardless of what kind of father or mother they were or are? Let's just define the word. Key word obviously is honor. Interesting as we define it because at its most basic level, the Hebrew word for honor speaks to weightedness. If you're taking notes, write that word down. It's a significant word relative to this. Honor means it speaks to, at its root, weightedness. So to honor your parents at some level is the ability to ascribe to your father and your mother the appropriate weight. Key word, appropriate weight. To ascribe to your parents the appropriate significance, the appropriate value to who they are or who they were, to what they've done, good things or bad things. But here's the deal. This thing of ascribing to our parents the appropriate weight is something we do not do very well. And quite frankly, we do not do it very often. Tending more often to extremes of idealizing our parents, they're just, my dad is just, my mom is just. No, they aren't. No, they aren't. No, they aren't. Or vilifying our parents, they're just a bunch. And everything that comes out of your mouth, relative to your mother, relative to your father, is disparaging. They're just, no, they're not. See, in the extreme, vilifying or idealizing will not bring you to the appropriate weight. But it's real easy to keep it idealized or vilified because you don't have to do any work. But you do if you want to get free. If you want to keep living as a slave, just stay there. But the call to follow the rabbi brings you to a different place. And it's going to be the hardest work you ever do. And it's the longest journey some of you will ever take. To ascribe, figuring out what it means to ascribe appropriate weight to their influence on your life. Now, when I got that definition, just that word, what the word meant, it began to send me in a number of different directions all at the same time, which is actually fairly normal for me. It occurs to me, first direction, the first thing that occurred to me on this was this, that if we're really going to do this well, that if I'm going to do this well, and invite you into trying to do this well, ascribe the appropriate way, that that actually is going to require some skill, which means you may actually get better at this later in life than earlier in life. An 8-year-old, for instance, an 8-year-old little boy or girl can certainly honor their parents, and they need to, but it's probably going to look different than an 18-year-old would honor their parents, or a 28, 38, or a 58-year-old person might honor their parents. Indeed, dial into this, it's very important. I think the real work of honoring your parents, coming to a place where you can ascribe to them the appropriate weights, is pretty grown-up stuff. Fact is, immature people will not do this work. Now, sometimes immature people are 58 years old. But immature people will not do this work. In fact, immature people cannot do this work. To do this work, you have to grow up. Immature people will tend to what I spoke of just a moment ago, extremes. Either idealizing or demonizing. The problem is neither of those extremes is the appropriate way. It was interesting in message team this week as we were reflecting on this. Numbers of us kind of just kind of had this weird thing. You know, most of us when we've thought of this commandment, honor your parents that your days may be long, kind of have always thought of it as a child's commandment. It's kind of what you teach in Sunday school. Little kids, honor your parents. That's where it applies. I think it does apply to little kids. And little kids can do it the way eight-year-old kids. but the real work of ascribing to your father and to your mother the appropriate weight, I'm telling you, this is the work of adults. No one else will do it. No one else can do it. I don't want to be mean, but it's why most people don't do it. Second thing that occurred to me around this is that if honoring our parents means ascribing appropriate weight, then it doesn't honor them to live in a kind of denial about how they affected us either for good or for bad so if you really were abused it's not honoring to your parents to deal with that by saying oh it wasn't that big a deal if it was a big deal because you have to come up with the appropriate weight and you will not have that by going not a big deal, yes it was and until you deal with that and press into that you won't really be able to eventually do what you need to do for freedom, release it. And it's when you release it that you're no longer a what? Slave. To everything they think and everything they've done. But some, so many, so many. I mean, just look at the culture. Read the paper. Most people are slaves to how they were treated their whole life. And they will be a slave to that their whole life. it's just stunning to me how the commandments these stodgy old ten commandments speak to the fundamental issues of life and how we live but all of this raises or changes rather the question it changes the question from what does it mean to honor our father and mother to how do we do it how do we come to a place where we can accurately ascribe appropriate worth to our father and our mother. Well, a couple of things occur to me. I hope they're helpful. The first thing that occurs to me around this is this, that we need to remember. We need to remember our father and our mother. But here's the key to that. We need to remember rightly. Because the fact is, some can only remember the worst, which needs to be remembered. But the worst that they did to you does not need to be remembered for the purpose of reliving it. which is what most do I'm afraid using that memory of I'll never forget that time he or she using that memory that event to feed to literally keep alive the anger and the contempt you feel if you're using your memory to do that that's not what I'm talking about but I'm telling you you need to remember your father and your mother the good things and the bad things for the purpose of remembering, but the purpose of remembering is not to just relive it. The purpose of remembering it is to fully face it, to fully feel it, to fully feel it, to grieve it, to be angry about it, so that with God's help and maybe the help of some very skillful and loving people, you might begin, and this is a journey very often, you might begin to release it and forgive it, all of which, for many of you, if honest, is an agonizing process. Indeed, it's the hardest work that some of you will ever do. It's the longest journey that some of you will ever take. But the rabbi says, come follow me on this journey, and I will bring you into freedom. There are no magic wands here, though, folks. Hardest work you'll ever do. Longest journey you will ever take. But it's a journey that is entirely for your benefits. I'm just going to let my father off the hook. This is for your freedom. That your days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord your God has given you, and it's for your children, and it's for your children's children. So grow, say this gently, grow up, grow up, so that your life may be prolonged. One of the great joys of my life recently, and I've spoken of this a couple of times already, is the involvement in the prison ministry that we at Open Door have and that I've been able to engage in myself. Going to Lionel Lakes a few times, a couple times in the last couple of months. Last Monday I was able to go to Shakopee Prison for Women. It's an interesting thing to hear some of their stories. And when you hear, and I promise, it doesn't take a lot of thinking to think that maybe there was some pain in their family someplace. and stories that would just break your heart. And you hear some of their stories, and one of the things they often say is things like this, I could never forgive my father for that. I just could never forgive my mother for that. And here's the deal. When you actually hear what their father did and hear what their mother did, I hear them say they could never forgive, and there's part of me that says, I understand. I understand. And there's part of me that wants to say, and you don't have to, and I'm not going to push you there, given I just want to give you a hug and hold you here and encourage you. But there's another part of me that says, that's an awful story. It's the worst story I ever heard. But you have to. You just have to figure out what it means to forgive them and release them. Because if you don't, it's going to kill you. It's going to kill you. Indeed, it's already killing you. It's part of why you're here. And the rabbi says, come follow me. It's the hardest work some of you will ever do. It's the longest journey some of you will ever take. This is not for kids. Word about forgiveness. Forgiveness, like honoring your parents, is entirely for your benefit because it will set you free. Forgiveness begins with desire. Do you want to? I hesitate to even tell a story young, but I'm going to. A young woman came up to me last night after church. Just the sweetest thing. I don't know. 26 years old, I'm guessing. I don't know. And she says, I'm really struggling with this forgiveness thing. She didn't have an angry look on her face. She just looked like a sweet young woman. And she said, my father molested me when I was a little kid and did it for years and years. And now I'm estranged. And I need a boundary. And I said, yes, you do. And she goes, and then she said, but I don't know how to do this forgiveness thing. Where do I even start? My therapist says I don't have to forgive him. And I said, your therapist is wrong. And I often talk that bold, but she's wrong, because this is for you getting free. This is for you getting free. And you know what? This could take some time, and this could be the hardest work you ever do. And she said, where do I start? I said, well, do you journal? I asked her, and she goes, yeah, I journal. I says, well, then, here's where you start. Want it. Do you desire to be free this way? Then start to journal and invite God into your inability to do this. and start with a want to be free. I'm going to tell you something. Real forgiveness. And I even said, don't forgive too soon. Don't do it too soon. I forgive you. Really? Really? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know how little kids are being mediated by their parents and they say, say you're sorry. Sorry. Okay, Johnny, say you forgive him. All of a sudden, it's all switched. the perpetrator who just beat the daylights out of this other kid, got off. It's a get-out-of-jail-free card. Sorry. Now I have to go, no, no, no, no, don't do it. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This real forgiveness, I call it being on the path of forgiveness toward forgiveness. And there's freedom there. See, sometimes the weight that needs to be acknowledged and reckoned with, that needs to be remembered, has to do with hurtful things. They need to be pressed through, not held on to, and not just kind of superficially released, but also hurt, helpful things. Helpful things need to be remembered. You need to feel the weight of the good that your parents gave, and that is honoring as well. Now, admittedly for some, you have to stretch for that, even to the point where some of you, having been abandoned, for instance, couldn't honestly give much more honor than this respectful acknowledgement that they gave you life. That they were bearers of the image of God themselves and that through them it came to you, and for that you could be grateful. And the sad truth for some is this, that that would in fact be the appropriate weight, the only level at which you could authentically honor them. But for most of you, there's more than that. and you need to remember the more it was 10 years ago last September that my father died I looked it up this week, I called Bonnie, I said Bonnie 10 years, it just doesn't seem that long ago we all knew my dad had been sick at the time none of us knew how sick including him when he and my mom did what turned out to be a farewell tour that fall visiting from Florida. He visited my two sisters on the East Coast on his way up to Minnesota to see my two brothers and myself and the grandkids. It was going to be a big weekend of football because whatever else he wanted to do, he wanted to watch Bethel College beat somebody. And they beat somebody that weekend. I don't remember who. But my brother's the coach there, and you know that. I think my other brother was actually coaching with him at the time. And he wanted to come to Open Door because I'm the pastor here, and he wanted to do that. But he was sicker than we knew that weekend. he made the weekend. He came to church. He went to the game. On Tuesday, though, he'd grown so weak he couldn't get out of bed. He needed help going to the bathroom. So he called out, and no one was home but me, so I carried him to the bathroom. He didn't make it, so I cleaned him. See, this is my dad. He's never been sick. He's never been weak. And I was uncomfortable with all that. I don't know if I want to do this. What would help me snap out of it? You know what would help me snap out of it? Remembering. You need to remember. You know what helped me? And you know what I remembered? Here's what I remembered. That this guy carried me my whole life. So I could carry him now. You know what it was? An honor. See, cleaning my dad, when he didn't make it to the bathroom, humiliated him. You know what else it did? It honored him. that's weird it's weird because sometimes the battle we have in coming up with the appropriate weight around our father and mother which is what it means to honor them some of the work we have is that we tend to vilify them and we have some real negative things to work through sometimes the work we have is that we idealize them you've heard me talk enough about my dad to know i thought he hung the moon i just thought he was just like you don't want to be like him i just want to be like him but one of the things that helped me get to a place of the appropriate weight with my father was seeing him in his frailty it's another reason why sometimes this takes some time but seeing him in his frailty it reminded me even as his life came to a close it reminded me of other times he was weak and it reminded me of how it made me feel and how I got angry when he was weak and I didn't want him to be weak and it was all about me but as I work through that, these are feelings you don't want to have when your dad's dying, but all of those things coming together are part of what it means to come up with the appropriate weight, the appropriate weight. He was a great dad. He wasn't. He was more like this, which makes me look like love. He was weak, and he was strong, and he was wonderful, and he was an idiot, and he was my dad. it's weird because my mom was a different process it was later in her life that i began to get in touch with her strength which in my younger years i had a very hard time seeing but when i saw her strength it helped me come up with some appropriate weight for her about a year ago september at open door we acknowledge you acknowledge the 25th year here at open door for me. I was 25 years last September, and among the things we did that weekend was have my daughter, my oldest daughter, preach. She approached. She approached. Kind of trying to put two words together, and they don't work. She spoke, she preached, she approached. Anyways, laughed. Yeah. And she talked about me, and she talked about her mom, and everything she said honored us. And she said funny things and poignant things, but she honored us when she did that. But you know what? A few months, I think it was a few months after that, she called us from her counselor's office and she says, Dad, you need to come in and bring Mom too, but mostly you. I want to say some things that I don't know how to say any other way. And you want to know something? She honored me then too. I'm not going to tell you what she said. But apparently, it's not all that great. But let me tell you, this is so incredible, this is so important, because what it helped my daughter do was come up with the appropriate weight. It's the appropriate weight that lets her not idealize and not vilify, but just go, it's my dad, it's my dad, it's my mom. It's the hardest work some of you will ever do, It's the longest journey some of you will ever take. And many of you won't do it. But you'll be a slave your whole life. See, while among us, there are some who really do have to deal with serious issues of abandonment and abuse relative to parents, most of us had parents that I would describe as normal sinners. Flawed human beings with feet of clay who really loved you but didn't know how. See, again, I think some of this gets easier. That's not true. It's not easier. It becomes more authentically possible with age. Because, again, while 8-year-olds can and need to honor their parents in some 8-year-old way, the real work of this requires courage, strength, maturity, and grace that, quite frankly, 8-year-olds don't have, and sadly, many adults don't have, because we get stuck in that adolescent place of either vilifying them or idealizing them, neither of which is the appropriate weight. One other thing that might help you in this process of coming to the appropriate weight, and this is another reason why sometimes it takes time. It's not the work of children. It's not just remembering, it's discovering your father and your mother's story. But when you're eight, you don't care about their story. And you shouldn't. But if you want to get the appropriate weight, you might need to hear their story. It's amazing how it helps. Bonnie and I were newly married. I would say it was within the first four or five years of our marriage when my grandmother on my mom's side died. After the funeral and all the wasn't she wonderful talk subsided, the family, like a big reunion, gathered in the church basement. All the guests had left, and we just began to talk. It wasn't scripted. It wasn't planned. The stories began to flow. And here I am in my early 20s hearing for the first time the story of where grandpa came from, where grandma came from. And I don't mean what country. I mean the temperature in that house. And I began to hear stories I'd never heard of grandpa, my grandpa, who was unpredictably violent, out of the blue. Bam! And then would come back into the room with the little kid crying on the floor with a big smile on his face. And there was a craziness. It began to hear it. And you know what it did? Among other things, it made me look at my mom and go, where'd you? You came from there. And it was one of the first smells, the first taste I ever got of going, I've got to shift my weight. I've got to shift my weight on how I experience it. Because she came from. I have a good friend who told me years ago, Dave, if you knew people's stories, an awful lot of them who you think very little of may in fact be a hero for how far they've come with what they had. Which, by the way, doesn't excuse what they did or how you felt by what they did, but it might help you come up with the appropriate weight. But what if for you the truth really is that when you remember, all you can remember is the pain. Indeed, for all the pain, you can't see any good. Well, if instead of a church service, this was a class where we were studying how to honor parents who aren't worthy of it, one of the assignments I would give would be to require you to see a movie. The movie is called Smoke Signals. It's an old movie, about nine, ten years old. It tells the story of two young Indian boys, Victor and Thomas, Growing up on a rather bleak Indian reservation out west, Thomas lost both of his parents in a fire when he was a baby. So he was raised by his aunt. Victor was abandoned by his alcoholic and abusive father when he was 12, and he was raised by his mother. The scene where his father leaves him, abandons the entire family, is very, very poignant in the movie. Confronted by his wife for his drinking, Victor's father backhands her. She falls down. He hits her really hard. And he runs out the door with all her stuff. And Victor's mom is running after him, screaming, don't ever come back. Don't ever come back. He never does come back. But as they're running out the door, and as Dad gets in the truck, Victor comes running out as well. I want you to watch Victor. Hit me again. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Here's where I get your metal. Come on! You're too easy! No! Don't you ever come back! Do you hear me? Don't you ever come back! Stand fast! Don't get in there! Don't get in there! Let's go! Oh, sees his father again. When in 12 years, word comes that his father has died in New Mexico. Come to get his stuff is the instruction. All he's got left is a run-down trailer and that rusty old yellow pickup truck. So Victor begins a journey to go to his father's place and pick up his stuff and bring some kind of closure. When Victor goes and finds where his father lived these 12 years, he meets some people who don't hate his father. who see him with different eyes and speak of him in tender terms. They tell him of a father who spoke to them often of a son that he adored named Victor. This information, this new perspective both confused and enraged him because now he had to re-decide who his father was. Who is he? Was he the drunken bum who abandoned his family, beat his wife and left me? or is he or was he this likable guy that at some level seemed to care even about me? Guess what helped Victor ascribe to his father the appropriate weight? It was when Victor realized that his father was both of those things. No, minimizing or denying the damage he did, the pain he inflicted. He was a terribly flawed human being, but he was a human being nonetheless. In the very last scene of the movie, you see Victor pouring his father's ashes off a bridge a scene we're going to see in just a moment into a raging river on his reservation and as he pours these ashes into the river from the depths of his soul comes a primal scream and in that scream you see a mixture of remorse and release anger and understanding loathing and love fear and forgiveness and all of that honored his father for the agonizing work that this young man did gave appropriate weight to his father's life and ultimately it set Victor free to live his life fully, no longer a slave. But to raise this question, shall we forgive? Shall we forgive? Let's watch this together. How do we forgive our fathers? Maybe in a dream Do we forgive our fathers for leaving us too often Or forever when we were little Maybe for scaring us with unexpected rage Or making us nervous Because there never seemed to be any rage there at all Do we forgive our fathers for marrying or not marrying our mothers, for divorcing or not divorcing our mothers? And shall we forgive them for their excesses of warmth or coldness? Shall we forgive them for pushing or leaning, for shutting doors, for speaking through walls, or never speaking, or never being silent? Do we forgive our fathers in our age or in theirs? Or in their deaths, saying it to them or not saying it? If we forgive our fathers, what is left? What is left is freedom. So I will no longer be a slave. It's the hardest work that some of you will ever do. It's the longest journey that some of you will ever take. It is a journey out of slavery into freedom. Honor your father and your mother. figure out what it means, and then begin to do the work of coming up with the appropriate weight of your father and your mother. It's the first commandment with a promise. And the promise is this, that it may be well with you, that your days may be prolonged in the land that the Lord your God has given you. It's for your children. It's for your children's children. Next week, as a community of faith, we are going to come to the communion table. the table which speaks among other things of our forgiveness bring with you your journey around this and bring it to the table the rabbi says come follow me and I will bring you on a journey that brings you to what I do, says Jesus. Forgive. Could we pray as we close? Would you stand with me? It's interesting. You know, there's just talks I do that I'm just real aware that this is going to land on some people and not on others, and it just doesn't apply to everyone. there are certain talks. It was near the end of my talk last night when it dawned on me that I think with pretty good confidence that this lands on everybody. I mean, this is big for everybody. And so I'm going to ask the prayer team wherever you are to come and receive anyone who needs prayer. But just bring this stuff with you this week. There's your work. Just wonder, just wonder about this stuff this week. And even ask God for ways in which you might need to respond next week as a community of faith, as we come to the table, as we come to the cross. I think we'll have the cross on the floor next week as people can come to that as well. Father, we thank you for your word. And I thank you. I don't know even how to say this, Lord, but I'm grateful for your stubbornness in this toward us. and that there's kind of an unyielding thing. None of us can get away with this. We can't think we can break this and just live free. We kind of have to figure out what it means to ascribe the appropriate weight and do the work necessary if we want to be free. But I'm thankful, Father, that while that law kind of breaks us, we can come to you, our rabbi, and you give grace, and you have healing, And I pray that as we enter into these things and consider at deep levels these things, that your spirit would be powerfully at work among us for freedom, no longer slaves, learning to live an entirely different kind of life. We pray these things in Jesus' name and all God's people said, amen. Amen.
