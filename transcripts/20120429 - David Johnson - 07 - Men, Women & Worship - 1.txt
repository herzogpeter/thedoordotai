I am glad to be back. And I think most of you might have known that I was gone. Maybe you didn't know that I was in Haiti. And then as soon as I got back from Haiti, I turned around two days later and went to Ohio to speak at a pastor's conference, being kind of immersed there for two weeks, doing something that I love to do when God gives me an opportunity to do it, to minister, to preach, to teach, to just be with pastors. Because it's something, this may sound weird, but I know how to do that. I know that life of being a pastor. And so when I go to talk to pastors, which I did in Haiti and then in Ohio, I have this expectation, we're going to connect. I just know we're going to connect. But this time I go into Haiti, I'm kind of wondering about that because there's some barriers in communication. There's this pesky thing called a language barrier. And the reason they call it a language barrier is because it's a barrier. It's hard to say hi. I mean, they're smiling and everybody, are they going to smile like this the whole time I talk like this? would look on their face that they're being polite, don't know what you're saying. So you're kind of wondering. And the other thing, when I was looking at these pastors in Haiti, was related to our actual lives. I think there's some similarities in ministry, but your life couldn't be more different than mine. Mine couldn't be more different than yours. Can we bridge this gap of language, of life, reality? Two things that helped. One was Dio, Pastor Dio, who was my translator. So I'd speak through this translator. And I've done that before, but over the years have come to really know and believe that what helps you communicate is not just somebody who actually knows the language, which really does help. It's good if they're saying what you said. You know, not doing a whole different talk, which might have been better than yours, but you still want them to say what you're saying. And I'm not exaggerating here or being weird, but what really is necessary is that the Spirit of God's on the guy, that there's an anointing on him, that there's a passion in him, actually for the word and for the people, and Dio had that in spades. But the other thing that I noticed transcended, and all of the culture stuff and the language stuff, was that while a lot of the stories I would talk were kind of culturally related, as I'm telling them, I'm realizing that and going, this isn't going to work in my jokes. Believe it or not, they didn't think they were funny. I don't get it. They didn't get it. They did like you. They look at me funny and laugh politely. So where we meet, we met at the text. We met at the text. Let's open the Bible to Matthew 5, the words of Jesus therein. And it's just a little kind of thing to me about the kinds of things that transcend. Another thing about Haiti that was fascinating and wonderful was Dio. Now, we've known Dio as a church for years. 25 years, I think, we've known him. This is Dio up here on the screen. And if I show you the picture, you kind of remember. Those of you who don't know him, that's him. What I do want you to know, because this kind of dials into what I want to say, he's short. The picture doesn't reveal that. He's short, around there, somewhere in there. But I really got to know him this time. Dio, over the years, maybe you know, he oversees nine different churches. Largest is the church in Port-au-Prince with 1,200 people. He's been instrumental in building churches and schools and orphanages. But this time, again, I've known all that, but I got to spend some time with him. three to four hour ride from Port-au-Prince to the conference, being able to hang with them there, kind of coming back for four hours on the way back. And on the way back, we were going to stop at this little village. So Dio is telling me the story of Bethel, this village called Bethel. And the story is kind of like this. Several years ago in the late 90s, one of Dio's people had an accident in Port-au-Prince. He swerved to miss a cow that was in the middle of a road, hit a pedestrian, and it killed him. And there wasn't any criminal problem in that, but there was kind of a lawsuit that happened, and Dio was the target of it. And the settlement that came down from the judge was that, Dio, what you have to do because of this is you have to go to this village called Bethel, and you have to build a church and a school and an orphanage, which is kind of what he does, but he's going to have to do this on his own. So he has to buy the land and pay for all this stuff. so he goes to Bethel. And part of the story of Bethel, however, is that Bethel, this little village, is the center of voodoo in all of Haiti. Like where all the practitioners and witch doctors who want to get better at voodoo go to get their mojo going, they go to Bethel. And so this village has been here a very long time, and everybody in Haiti knows that that's the center of everything. And there was actually kind of a scam going on relative to the voodoo stuff where the witch doctors and the power people in this voodoo village would indeed offer to Christians and missionaries to sell land in Bethel. There was kind of a hill there, and you could buy land there, and missionaries would come and do that, and they would buy land intending to build a church and maybe, you know, convert the voodoo village to Christianity. But what would happen, and Dio was just kind of telling me this matter-of-factly, they would buy the land, begin to build the church, and the witch doctors would release demonic power on them. And sometimes these people would die. Oh, and sometimes they would just be terrorized, but always they would leave. And so the scam was this. We'll get them to pay for the land, then they'll leave the land. We get to keep the money and the land and do it again and again and again. Enter Dio. Buys the land, begins to build the church. Death threats, poison, attempts to terrorize them. In Dio's words, demonic power released on us. And somehow they begin to stay, begin to build. A small church is formed. one day they're singing in a worship service not a lot of people I don't think when the whole village attempting to kind of take them out comes with the witch doctors and the power people in voodoo and this is going to be a major showdown maybe to kill Dio I talked about some of the you know tensions over the years that I've had as a pastor and and then when he talked about death threats I shut up about my stories. And yeah, they didn't like me. Anyway, you know, I can't tell that story. So these voodoo people were coming to confront Dio and maybe to kill him if they could. And Dio just said, let's sing. And they began to sing. And they kept on singing these very simple Jesus songs. And if anybody told me this but Dio, I, well, whatever. He goes, and the head witch doctor goes down. And then another person goes down, and then another. And long story short, the whole village that day said, I guess Jesus is the one we're going to follow. That's what happened. So I'm sitting in the car. I'm sitting in the car. I'm looking at you. I'm going, dude, you're Elijah. I didn't know Elijah was that short. See, there's the short thing. You're just a little guy. This is this. You're in the Bible. In fact, we were at the church because we went then to Bethlehem and saw the church he'd built in the school that was there. And I'm walking out of the church with Dio and I said, so is there voodoo still in this village? He goes, no, gone. Okay, okay, wow, okay. So what happened was when this Baal, worship of Baal showdown, like Elijah happened, what happened was everybody who paid money to get artifacts for voodoo worship, they quit buying the voodoo stuff. Because if you wanted a curse, you have to pay. If you wanted to break a curse, you had to pay. And so nobody was doing that anymore, so the voodoo people couldn't make any money, so they left all of them. I said, dude, you're in the Bible. You're not just Elijah, you're Paul, who in Acts 18 went to, you remember the story, went to Ephesus, and the whole economy got turned upside down because they quit buying the artifacts of worship to Artemis and bent their knee to Jesus. yeah and all of that just kind of goes together I just want to tell you some of these things because among other things it speaks to me of the irrepressible power of the kingdom of God because in a place and this was what caught my attention in a place where I have never seen more poverty and blight I have also not seen more power more supernatural raw power of God and such is the kingdom of heaven. So thank you, Deal. Thank you, Steve Hansen. A little plug for the Mephibosheth house. You can get some more information about this by contacting Steve. He'll be in the gathering place. But we're looking for team sponsors for some of these kids who need to be cared for. And if you're interested in that, we'll have more information for you forthcoming. That's all for free. Now we get to the word. Book of Colossians, haven't been there for a while. Third chapter, 18th verse, the Apostle Paul is, as you know, dealing there with issues related to women and men, submission and love, marriage and family. So wives, he says in Colossians 3.18, be subject to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord, and husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church. And while between Steve and Jen and myself, I feel like we unpacked those verses pretty well over the course of several weeks, some weeks ago, there were some questions that remained, some issues that emerged that kind of spun off what Paul was saying there in Colossians 3 about women and men, submission and love, marriage and family. And among the questions that lingered and issues that emerged were questions and issues about women and men, but not so much in the context of marriage, which is what Paul is dealing with in Colossians 3, but in the context of ministry. Because the same Apostle Paul in Colossians 3 says, wives, be subject to your husbands. In 1 Corinthians 14 says, women, be silent in the churches. Indeed, in 1 Timothy 2.12, the same Paul says this, and in this text, he seems to be quite clear on the issue as he says quite bluntly this, I don't allow women to teach or to exercise authority, particularly over men, but to quietly receive instruction. So there's kind of a passive stance there, apparently, and to do it with entire submissiveness, all of which raises a boatload of questions. The first, I think, for some of you might be this. Are you kidding? I mean, seriously, are you kidding? Did Paul really say that? And if he said it, did he mean it? Is that really in the Bible? Because if it is, some of you, especially if you've never heard those verses before, are thinking, this is just plain nuts. Now, there's a whole other group here who maybe knows those verses are in the Bible, and you have possibly another question. And your question might be this. If those verses are, in fact, in the Bible, Has Open Door just decided to ignore those verses? Because obviously at Open Door, we have women at pretty much every level of leadership and have for several years. Three of our elder board elders are women, including the chairperson of our elder board, who's a woman, Kristen Evenson, and the chairperson before her was a woman, Judy Haugen. Vicki Degner sitting right over here, serves on the executive team here at Open Door as pastor of spiritual development, which if it's played out and actually done, which it is actually done by her, is an exercise of spiritual authority among us. And on a fairly regular basis, we have women in the pulpits. Peggy Lang heads up our prayer ministry. And it's not unusual for her or for someone like her to preside over our communion table when we have communion, which in some churches is problematic. It would get a woe in a lot of churches If a woman presided over the communion table, we have women leading us in worship, not just being on the worship team, but leading us in worship. Last week, Julie Anderson led us in worship the week before that. Sarah Wheeler did the same. And for many of you, if not most of you, it's probably something you don't even think about. You don't even notice, actually, because we just do it this way, and we don't tell you why, at least not very often do we tell you why. Indeed, as I was thinking about this this week, what dawned on me was I've grown so used to this being the way it is here that I almost have to go to another church to realize it's not this way everywhere. Much like my daughter Erica discovered several years ago when she moved to Atlanta and got involved in what was by all accounts a very good church, unless you're a woman with a teaching gift like Erica who has a considerable gift of teaching, but in the church they took very seriously that women were to be silent in the church, and if not completely silent, you certainly couldn't exercise authority over men, which means you could maybe teach Sunday school to kids. Well, you could teach Sunday school to kids, or maybe a woman's Bible study, so you could teach women, or maybe teenagers, or something like that, which actually Erica did teach at levels like that, because I just want to serve, she said to me, wherever they'll let me serve. She wasn't out to make a statement. She wasn't trying to change their culture. This is what it is. I would just like to serve. But even that created a problem when she started teaching some of the women, because it didn't take long for some of the women to figure out that she was the most effective teacher in the church, including the pastor. Anyway, I got a kick out of that. And now you're in real trouble, Erica, because you're better than their pastor and people notice and maybe that's the real reason that women need to be silent in the church because they'll make men look bad. So be quiet. Thank you very much. Anyway, now I'm kidding about all that. At least we're getting in trouble for having an excellent gift. But it really does beg the question, what do you do with these verses that seem to so clearly say women are to be silent in the church, and have we as a church just chosen to ignore them? Because to a casual observer, it might appear to be the case. Well, the answer to that is no. We have not ignored these verses, but to explain why we do what we do the way we do it relative to women in ministry takes time. Because there aren't any short answers relative to this issue, which is why I kind of leave it alone most of the time. So when I do get asked, and I do get asked from time to time, often from a visitor, not someone who's part of our fellowship, but often get asked, why do you allow or even invite into every level of leadership women? When I get asked that question, basically what I say is, because. It's a very long answer. It's just the way we do it here, you know, get the tapes, because we've done this before. That's my short answer, because I don't have time to explain the whole thing. And so today, and probably for the next couple of weeks, we're going to take the time, and we're going to get into the long answer. And I want to do this for a number of reasons. Chief among them is this, that in this season of our church's life, and if you've been around, you're very aware of this, that we have been working very, very hard to identify, remember, and re-embrace our spiritual DNA. That in this particular season, this issue of how women and men function together in ways that have the potential to reveal the image of God and release the power of God is absolutely central, we believe, to who God is calling us to be and to become and to what God is calling us to do. And all of that is rooted in and emanating from our DNA as a church. DNA that has been in the process of being formed for a little over three decades. And so it is. I'm going to bring some teaching around this topic, but I'm going to bring it in the context of our story as a church, actually. I'm going to bring it in the context of our journey as a church with God in the Word, because we have not ignored these verses. And it all began about 25 years ago. So the story began then. In what I would refer to and have in the past as the early days of open doors, God was beginning to move among us, and people were being healed and set free in a variety of ways by this message of amazing grace that so marked and formed those early days of open door. And our elders, all of whom at the time were men, simply began to notice that in the context of this fresh move of God's spirit among us in our church, really gifted women began to emerge. They didn't grasp. They didn't demand. They just began to emerge. We just began to notice the fact that they were playing very significant roles, roles that were beginning to push the boundaries of some of these verses that we kind of always took for granted around 1 Corinthians 14 and 1 Timothy 2 that so clearly seemed to be saying that women can't do what some of them were starting to do quite effectively. So what do we do? I don't know. How about this? Let's just ignore the verses. No one will notice. Just do what we want. Doesn't sit real well with me. We're a people, part of our DNA rooted in the text. Well, how about this? How about we actually study those verses and try to discover what they really do mean, which means we're going to have to deal with all the things you have to deal with when you deal with the text. We're going to get into the language. We're going to get into the history and the culture and the context as well. Context is fascinating. Early on in the study, I remember 1 Corinthians 14, where he says women keep silent. One of the first things I noticed was the context of him saying women could be silent in the church, because it comes in the context in 1 Corinthians 14, where he's not talking about women at all. It's not on the radar at all. He's talking about the gifts of the Spirit. He's talking about prophecy. He's talking about tongues. And right in the middle of that flow, in verse 34, seemingly out of the blue, he says, oh, by the way, women keep silent in the churches for they're not permitted to speak. It's kind of like he had spiritual Tourette's. Be quiet, by the way. So what's up with that? Just in terms of the context, It really does seem weird and out of place, and as it turns out, there's some theories on that. One that I don't accept is this, that Paul didn't actually write it. And there are people who kind of promote this kind of idea. According to a guy named John Koenig, in a book entitled Slavery, Sabbath, War, and Women, he says this, that it's a Pauline fragment. It's completely out of context and deliberately added later by an editor who had his own cultural biases and was trying to check the rising feminist movement in Asia Minor. So if that's what you subscribe to, you just take them. Paul didn't say that. We're just going to take those verses and put them out of the Bible, which is kind of convenient whenever you run across some verses that you don't understand or don't like. I don't like them. We'll put them out. Well, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. Another theory that some subscribe to, even now I hear this from time to time, is that you just need to understand that when Paul talks about women, he can't be trusted. I mean, in every other area of faith and doctrine, he's stellar. But in this area, he's kind of off the rails. See, Paul had a serious problem with women, probably had a domineering mother, a wimpy father. So every once in a while, again, as he's got this spiritual Tourette's syndrome, he just goes, you women, be quiet. Mom, or something like that. Okay. But there's another possibility. It's this. Maybe we don't have all the information. Maybe there's something going on in Corinth and in Ephesus where Timothy was being told by Paul, not women speaking in Ephesus or Corinth. Maybe there was something going on that might help us understand not just what he's saying. I know what he's saying. Women keep silent in the church. It's in the Bible. Okay, well, why is he saying that? Might help to know. And here's the deal. unless you know the why something's being said, you really don't understand yet the what. So here's the question. I'm going around in circles here. How do you get to the why? Answer, need to teach. Indeed, I need to teach some things that I don't often bring to this room, because sometimes it's hard to teach them. It's going to be a little classroom-y, seminary 101 kinds of stuff, and yes, you will get course credit for this. You know, if you say all three weeks, four weeks, however many weeks this is going to be. We'll see. You know how that goes. One of the words I was introduced to early in seminary, first thing as you began to talk about was this thing called exegesis. You may know what the word means. It's kind of come from a green word, exegesis, exit to exit from the text. The job of the biblical interpreter, the teacher is to find out what the text actually means and pull from the text its actual meaning. What we were told, never do. You're going to do it, but please avoid this if you can. And don't think you're teaching the Bible if you do eisegesis. Eise is into, and that is when you get some idea out here. It might even be a good idea. It might even be a right idea. And you get your idea, and then you start looking for verses to support your idea. So you're pulling out of the text what you want it to mean and applying it to your idea. Don't do that. So how do you avoid that? How do we do good exegesis? So we pull from the text, what it actually means, well, you need to understand some principles of interpretation. There's four. Principle number one involves something we do around here all the time. Don't draw attention to it. You're used to us doing this. It's dealing with the original language and grammatic or syntax integrity, again, which is something we do here all the time as a matter of course. So I'm not going to expand on that or try to illustrate that because you've seen the value of that, how what the word actually means opens it, expands it, and I'm sure there's times you're sitting there and you're going, wow, if you hadn't defined it kind of at the original root of the meaning, I wouldn't have gotten that, and it's not like I didn't know anything about what the verse meant, but I now, I get so much more. You know what I'm talking about, don't you? But in 1 Timothy 2.12, where Paul says, I don't allow women to teach, this thing of syntax and grammar really comes into play because grammatically that phrase is in what's called a present indicative active. Doesn't that bless you? Present indicative active, which means that the literal translation of that phrase would be this. I am not now presently allowing women to teach or exercise authority. I am not now presently. Well, does that mean there's a time when you would allow women to teach in a different context, in a different culture, in a different situation? I haven't answered the question yet, but at least it's raising the question, something's going on here. I need to dig a little deeper, which leads to the second principle, history and culture, which again is something we do hear all the time. As a matter, of course, you've probably just grown used to it. We don't draw attention to it when we do it. But we're always talking about first century Rome and how that affects our understanding of Colossians or the way of the rabbi or the temple system in Jesus' day. And all of those historical realities, over the years you've experienced this, have helped us understand not just what the verse is saying, but why it is he's or she is saying it, which leads to the third principle of biblical interpretation. So you can exegete, not eisegete. It has to do with contextual integrity. Basic hermeneutic is this. Any text without a context is a pretext. And I remember the first time I heard that, I go, I want to write that down. I have no idea what it means. Any text without a context is a pretext. Here's what it means. You can't just take verses out of their context and think you know what they mean. Like this verse all by itself says this. And if you don't consider what's going on before and what's going on after, you do not get the full picture of why he's saying what he's saying there. So we're always asking when we come to a text in Colossians for the last couple of years, not only what did the writer say, but why did the writer say it, and why did they say it here? because it's about context. Luke 6, 38, a good example of this. You should hear this all too. Give and it shall be given to you. Press down, shaking together, running over. I've always heard that verse in the context of prosperity theologians who are talking about if you give, God will give back to you. So give particularly to us. And if you give, it will be given back to you. Press down, shake it. But if you read that verse in context, silly little thing to do once in a while. It's not talking about money in Luke 6 at all. Read the verses prior to it. He's talking about forgiveness and grace and mercy and pardon. And if you give grace and mercy and pardon, it will be given back to you, pressed down, shaken together, running over. Context matters. But the one I really want to give you, because this is one I haven't touched on very often over the years, is this. Fourth principle is a need to determine, very important, the difference between a timeless truth. What's a timeless truth? Here's one. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind. I don't care your context. I don't care your history. I don't care when you live. That's a timeless truth. Salvation by grace through faith, timeless truth. You need to tell the difference when you're looking at scriptures between that and a regulation for a certain people at a certain time for a certain purpose because those things aren't timeless. Let me give you an example of a regulation for a certain people at a certain time for a certain purpose. It's my favorite because it's funny, I think. but it requires a junior high kind of humor. Deuteronomy 23, verse 12 says this, the word of the Lord, Sunday morning sermon, and you shall have a place outside the camp and you shall go out there. By go, he means go, like, you know, go, you know, to the bathroom and that's what he's saying, and you shall have a spade among your tools. I commend you in the name of Jesus. and it shall be when you sit down outside, you shall dig with it and you shall turn over your excrement. My favorite part is verse 14. Here's why. Because the Lord your God walks in the midst of your company. That's the one step in that stuff. Okay, okay. Class. Timeless truth. Regulation for certain people at a certain time for a certain purpose. Well, if it's a timeless truth and you have indoor plumbing, you're in sin and I rebuke you, right now. You know, I grew up, it's all about the Bible, and I'm still all about the Bible, but we were literalists. We literally believed in the literal Bible, and we're always saying things like this, God said it, I believe it, that settles it. Really, okay? But do you understand what God is literally saying. Because if you don't put these principles into play, you don't. Well, with all those questions and principles kind of floating in your head and kind of fresh in your mind, now let's get into this text, 1 Corinthians 14, 34 and 35. Read it right off the screen. Women are to keep silent in the church for they're not permitted to speak. They're to subject themselves, just as the law also says. If they do desire to learn something, let them ask their husbands, at home, and at home, yeah, not in the foyer, for it is improper for a woman to speak in church. Hmm. Question. Timeless truth, universal principle for certain people at a certain time for a certain purpose. Some would say timeless truth. God said it. I believe it. That settles it. Okay? If that's what you think, fine. But there are some problems with considering that a timeless truth in every situation true. And the first problem we have with making that a timeless truth is scripture. Because in 1 Corinthians 11, same book by the way, same author a few chapters earlier, Paul is talking about how women do indeed have prophetic ministry in the church. And he says in verse 5 of 1 Corinthians 11, but every woman, while she's praying and prophesying, so there's an assumption on his part that women do indeed pray and prophesy in the church, and then he says, here's how I want you to do it, but it raises a question. I mean, how do I reconcile this assumption on Paul's part that women do indeed pray and prophesy in the church, but they're supposed to stay silent? Again, I haven't answered the question, but it's raising a question. I got to keep going. And then there's Philip, who according to Acts 21 verse 9 had four daughters who were prophetesses. They had the gift of prophecy. So how does that work? How do you prophesy and be quiet at the same time? Kind of hard. A little weird. Something's going on here that I don't understand. And Priscilla, who according to Acts 18 26, along with Aquila, took Apollos, who was one of the greatest preachers in the early church, aside to explain to him the way of God more accurately so he could preach more effectively. But here's the deal. She's teaching a man. She's exercising authority. So what's the deal? And then there's Anna, who according to Luke 2, verse 36, was a prophetess who spoke of Jesus in the temple. To all who are looking for redemption. So if you're deciding that this word about silence is a timeless truth, the first problem you have is scriptural because there are in scripture a number of places where women did speak and exercise authority and they weren't told not to. I'm just confused now, okay. The second problem you got with making this a timeless truth is kind of practical. How silent are women to be? I mean, are you literally silent? Like, you have to, like, can you talk in the foyer, in the gathering place? Can you talk out there? Hope you didn't talk amongst yourself here. I mean, Joel brought you into sin by saying, you know, greet one another. Some women did it. What about announcements? Truth is, in the early days here, when a woman would, for some reason, take the pulpit, they weren't preaching. Remember this? They weren't preaching. They were what? Sharing, I heard it over there. It's interesting because I started thinking about this again. I remember that when I originally started studying this stuff years ago, I stumbled on a fascinating study by Dr. Marilyn Weldon and a man named Wendell Price who were both at a crown college at the time. And it was a history of the denomination the crown was affiliated with and our church was connected with at the time, Christian and Missionary Alliance. and fabulous denomination. And he was doing a history of the movement. And in the first stage of the movement, when A.B. Simpson, who was the founder of the Christian Mission Alliance, was alive, women, in the beginning of the movement, were involved at every level of ministry. They were pastors, they were evangelists, teachers, officers, they were on the board of managers, eight of the first vice presidents, of the eight vice presidents, four of them in the early days were women. So women involved in ministry was more than okay. It was encouraged. Simpson used to call on women to get involved. And then in the 20s, 30s, and 40s, it began to shift. There was a decline in prominence, decision-making positions of women, but there were still pastors and evangelists and teachers, especially on the mission field. But then you fast-forward it to the present, and the present was 25 years ago when I was discovering this. Pastors and evangelists had officially disappeared, though women still did function that way. We couldn't call them an evangelist. We couldn't call them a pastor. Again, they didn't preach. They shared. Very effectively, actually. And I'm reading all this, and I'm just kind of reflecting on it. I'm thinking, this is weird, because all my life, I've kind of heard and believed, because it's what I heard, that the inclusion of women in significant ministry roles was kind of a sinful and spineless accommodation to a culture that was being overrun by militant feminism. And I'm sitting there beginning to think a whole different thing. I'm beginning to think that what this really is is that this slow and systematic elimination of women in ministry, that is the sinful accommodation to a culture that isn't actually all that different from the male-dominated Jewish culture that Jesus blew up 2,000 years ago. And now, with that statement, I'm back into the history piece. You're going to exegete this passage. You need to understand the history of what's going on in the culture. because women, as you know, because we've dealt with this recently, in both Jesus' day and Paul's, were worse than subservient. They were inferior, second-rate, common for every Jewish man. I thank you, God, that I'm not a Gentile, that I'm not an ignorant man, and that I'm not a woman. In a Jewish home, birth of a baby boy, remember this? Met with joy. Birth of a baby girl, not always, but sometimes. Met with disappointment, sometimes even grief in a court of law. In Jesus' day and Paul's, women were not considered reliable witnesses. They couldn't be trusted. They were kind of seen as being like a child because children couldn't serve as witnesses in a court of law either. Rabbis considered it beneath their dignity to acknowledge the presence of a woman in public, which speaks actually to me of something beyond arrogant condescension. There's kind of an angry contempt. I mean, in public, I might acknowledge the presence of my pet camel, but I won't even look at a woman. And finally, women weren't permitted to study Torah. Indeed, one first century rabbi, and this was not the spirit of every rabbi, but this was one significant rabbi said it this way, rather should the words of the Torah be burned than entrusted to a woman. Indeed, whoever teaches their daughters the Torah is like one who teaches lasciviousness. And while in many parts of the world, all of that has changed, In many parts of the world, it hasn't at all. Indeed, I couldn't help but notice it in Haiti. The treatment of women in Haiti, particularly young girls, horrific. Remember the voodoo thing I told you about in that village called Bethel? I kind of turned around one of the stories that Dio told me was that part of the doctrine of the voodoo, witch doctors in that town, was that they forbade marriage. And I'm going, weird, okay, I don't know. And the upshot of that was that 14-year-old girls, without any marriage covenant that might protect them, were being forced to have sex with 75-year-old men, so they would have sex, the girl would become pregnant, and the man, ah, on my own, you're on your own. 14-year-old girl, 16-year-old girl, has four kids. By the time they're 16, 17 years old, you're entirely on your own. So Jesus comes into this town through Dio and says, no, no, no, you're not walking away from this. I'm going to protect these girls. We're going to bring into covenant protection and kind of puts a whole different spin on why marriage like would matter. When we went to the Mother Teresa orphanage, you know, girls were bringing their babies. One of the images I'll never forget, we were in the orphanages and there was a metal gate that opened up and there was a small group of people. There's a little girl with a desperate look of, I don't know what, on her face. It was just kind of a blank stare with a baby. Would you take my baby? while we were there, they didn't, they couldn't, they can't always take them. But in light of that scene, someone told me a story about how it often goes here, and the story is these girls are starving. And then often what happens, they don't end up in this orphanage, what happens is they're starving, and so some man will offer them 50 goods, or $1.25, so they can eat, but I'll give you the $1.25 for sex. So they have sex. It isn't because they want sex. They want to eat. And so now they eat a meal. Maybe two on $1.25. But they get pregnant. And then they're still starving because they can't keep eating. And they're pregnant. Don't know it to give birth to this baby. Often it's dead. But if it's not, they bring it to the orphanage. Can't always get it in the orphanage. So it ends up in a box in a river. strange experience again in Haiti speaking of Dio's church last day we were there 1200 people sitting on the stage kind of with not on the stage but up front with Dio and then Steve Hansen was there and we did what you're kind of doing those churches where you're sitting there I'm the speaker so I'm facing you and I'm just kind of watching this whole thing and five women came up to sing and so they were we're sitting here and they're right here and so I'm just kind of looking at them and as I was listening to them, beautiful voices and strong voices, they were spotlessly clean, very noticeable thing. Everyone was clean, dressed and clean in this church. It was like I even had to buy, anyway, yeah, I had to buy new clothes to speak in Haiti. But I was listening, I was watching them and I was thinking about what kind of life do you have? Because I can look right out the window and see a whole different life and here it is all clean and the thought that came to my mind was, is this just a mirage? This is, with everyone all dressed up, we're singing songs about Jesus. Is this thing we're experiencing in this room that feels so full of God's spirit and kingdom and actually kind of a tangible kind of sense of power and presence, is it a mirage? Is it a false thing? Or is this what we're experiencing here, particularly what they're experiencing here in this place once a week on Sunday morning, and they have other gatherings as well, Is it actually a glimpse, a taste, a glimmer of something very real that gives them hope? Indeed, my sense in the moment, and it felt like a word from God at the moment, was that maybe the reason they get dressed up like this once a week is to remind themselves in ways they're not even conscious that they're doing, that regardless of their real life out there, This is who they really are or who they want to be clean. This is who I am clean. And I don't care how many times I got used. I don't care how many times I desperately needed to eat, so I did something else. I am clean here with God and these people. And into all of that historical reality, for the last 2,000 years, I hear the words of Jesus that we visited a few weeks ago in Matthew 19 when he was facing the hard-heartedness of the Pharisees toward women when he said with what I assumed was a great sadness that from the beginning it was not this way. This was never God's desire or design, and I have come to redeem all that, says Jesus. Fast forward it now, if you can go this fast, to Pentecost. Acts 2, verse 16. Jesus has died. Jesus has risen. Jesus has ascended. The Spirit has come, but it's very confusing. This is a monumental shift. Something is going on in the universe right now. So Peter, Acts 2, 16, stands up to explain that this is what was spoken of through the prophet Joel, that I will pour forth my Spirit on all mankind, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams. Even upon my bond slaves, both men and women, I will in those days pour forth my spirit, and they will prophesy. So something is shifting here of major proportion, because in Israel at the time, historical again, the three things you wanted to be were Jewish, male, and old. Indeed, you didn't have to be wise, though it helped, but you didn't have to be wise, or good, or kind, or mature. You just had to be Jewish. and male and old. But now, says Peter, I'm going to pour my spirit out on all mankind. In other words, not just Jews, but Jews, but Gentiles as well. I'm expanding this thing, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy. In other words, not just your sons, but your daughters will stand and proclaim and teach and exhort, because we need everybody activated. by the power of the Spirit to do the work God's called us to do. And it's not just the old, it's the young too, who will see visions and dream dreams that will be part of what God is doing in the world. And while what I just said doesn't answer all the questions, and we've got a few weeks to go on this, of these texts we're dealing with, what I just said really is at the root of why we here at Open Door, of why here at Open Door, Our policy is this. Men, here's the deal. Just because you're a man doesn't mean you can lead. And women, just because you're a woman doesn't mean you can't. Because we're looking for other criteria, like the Spirit on you and the Spirit in you and the Spirit flowing through you. And so we pray. Well, we always pray around here. Holy Spirit's what? come to our men and fill them and empower them and speak and work through them and come to our women and fill them and empower them and work and speak through them and come to our young men and women and come to our old men and women and fill them and empower them and enable them to do things in the kingdom that they could never do without your Spirit. Help them by your Spirit to see visions and dream dreams, to lead and build and protect your church. And all God's people said, amen. More on this in weeks to come. Let's stand and close in prayer. Father, take this word and drive it deep into our hearts. Father, we do pray that your spirit would come to our men and to our women, that your spirit would be free to move among our young and old. Help us to see visions and dream dreams. And I pray in Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
