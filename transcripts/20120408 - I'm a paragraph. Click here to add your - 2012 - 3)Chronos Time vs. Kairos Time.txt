Well, hi everyone. How you doing? Yes. Happy Easter. Welcome to Open Door. My name is Steve. And as Joel said, we chose to do this this way, very different, so that we could see each other. So that we could sing to each other. So that we could tell each other that he is risen. That he is alive. That the tomb is empty. So I want to invite you into an awkward moment. I would like to invite you to look across the room at someone and lock eyes with them. Awkward. and as you're looking at that person here's what you need to know the person that you're looking at right now is someone in whom God is doing something altogether new the person you're looking at has life that God is breathing in to them amen and this is the church gathered and so it's just exciting for us to be together. I want to ask you a question as we start the morning, and the question is this. On the actual day that Jesus actually rose again, because, you know, he was an actual person who actually lived in the actual universe, the first century, when he actually rose again, What was the first thing he did? The very first thing. I want to argue that the very first thing Jesus did was breathe. He took a couple of deep breaths in. He looked at his hands that were pierced, felt his side that had also been pierced. and he said, whoa, I'm alive. And the question that I want to wonder about together is, what are the ingredients in air that can raise a person from death to life? What kind of air is that? And how can we get to be a part of it? let's pray together as we think about that God thanks for what you did and what you do every single moment your resurrection life is flowing in our veins and in the air that we breathe so God come come with your Holy Spirit come with power invite us into life and away from death we need so much more than a talk right now We need your life coming into us right now. Amen? All right. Well, another question to think about as we gather together on Easter Sunday morning is this. Why don't you think about a moment that happened maybe in the last week or maybe in the last month or maybe even in the last year where you said something or did something that you really regret. That as you said it, and after it settled in, and it did whatever it did, you felt like, oh man, I wish I could have that back. Might have been something small, might have been something huge. For me, it started this last week, it happened this last week pretty innocently as most things start, with a stick of butter. In my little household, which is five people, me and my wife and our three little boys, we have three boys under the age of five. And so mornings, Monday through Friday, from 7, 10 a.m. to 8 a.m. is an absolute fight to get the kids up and dressed and fed and cleaned and cleaned again and cleaned again and dressed again because they really love to be naked. so 50 minutes of game time for me and Mary where we just have to be on task all the time and we're our boys love to have the same thing for breakfast every morning Ben and Isaac have waffles and Ligey has a little pancake and so this particular morning I think it was Tuesday of this last week it's like 7.39 I am rushing I am on game I am on task and I'm putting butter on Ben's waffle and all of a sudden Ben gets a little look in his eye and he drags his little chair over to the counter and gets up on that chair and puts his little chin up on the counter and says, Daddy, can I help? Now, a good father would have seen this as a moment, right? I mean, this is a moment to help your little three-year-old become a man and learn how to butter his own waffle. I mean, here it is, right there, bang. A good father would have been like, all right, I don't care if we're late. I don't care if butter gets all over the whole world. We're going to do this. We're doing it right now. We're doing it with a good attitude. We're putting aside all of our plans and all of our lateness and we're going to do it. But this actual father, who actually exists in the actual universe, took the little knife that Ben had taken and said, No, Ben, I'm going to put your butter on your waffle because we're late. Now you better get your little bottom in your seat and over to the table like right now. Now I'm exaggerating a little bit, but that's how I felt. Like Ben, I mean it is not time for you to learn a skill in life. It is time for us to be on time. Well, we got them ready. We got the kids off. We packed them into the Golden Eagle, which is what we call our minivan. That's how you know when you are an absolute nerd, is when you name your minivan. Okay, that's another thing altogether. But we got them off to school and then it was my day off, so I came back home, and I went for a run that afternoon, and on my run, like it happens, you know, this happens to you too, where these moments that you've just had that you start to regret, boom, it hit me. Like, oh man, I totally missed it. I totally missed the moment to see my son, to have an interaction with my son that is life-giving for him and life-giving for me, All because it was so important for me to be on time. Well, no matter what you thought of in your own mind about what you regret, and the thing you said and the thing you did, if it was smaller than the story I shared or bigger than it, the truth is we do these things all the time. And in moments in time, we do things we wish we could take back. But the problem is we can't get them back. I mean, they're gone. Well, in the time of Jesus, the ancient Greeks had two different ways to talk about time. The first way to talk about it is this word called chronos. It's where we get our word chronological. It's clock time. It's measured in seconds and minutes and days and weeks and months and years. And this is the kind of time that you spend and you kill and you fill and you try to save time. You ever thought about that? Oh, I'm going to save lots of time. Really? Sometimes we waste time. But here's the deal. With chronos time, you never get it back no matter what you do. Chronos time keeps marching on with the regularity of a second hand ticking around a clock. It keeps going. And I think in Kronos time, we tend to live in two different ways. We tend to live with regret for the past. Oh, I wish I would have done that. I wish I wouldn't have done that. I wish I could have done that. I feel bad because that happened to me. Or we live with worry about the future. My kid's going to be late to school. I might not get that job. I might not get a job. I might not get married. I might not do that thing right. I might not get an A on that test. And we live in chronos time either paralyzed by worry or paralyzed by regret. Chronos time is what we live our lives by. And the seconds just keep ticking by and we can't get the moments back. Thankfully, there's a different kind of time that the scriptures also talk about. And this is called kairos time. Now, much different from Kronos time, Kairos time is that moment when everything seems like it's the darkest it ever will be. And nothing is going to happen in any way good. Your back is up against the wall. Your hopes have been dashed. Darkness reigns. There is no way something good is going to come out of this. And then in a Kairos moment, boom, the world opens up and hope floods back in and something comes that you never expected. You got the phone call saying it's not cancer. You got the phone call saying you are pregnant after seven years. Your friend who you've been estranged from for a year calls you up and says, would you please forgive me? It's a Kairos moment that you never expected. Happens in the bottom of the ninth inning. Base is loaded and you are down. And then all of a sudden, hope comes in. The picture that you're staring at up on the screen is a guy named Kirk Gibson. This picture is taken in game one of the 1988 World Series. I used to be a big Dodgers fan. I grew up in Southern California. So in 88, I was watching this game. They were playing the Oakland A's. It was the ninth inning. A's were favored to win the World Series by a long ways. This is when Mark McGuire and Jose Canseco were young. And Kirk Gibson had been injured. Both of his legs were all hobbled. And they were talking about that the whole game. He's not going to get a chance to play. The Dodgers' chances of winning have gone down. And then in the ninth inning, the Dodgers are down by one. There's one guy on base. And the pitcher's up. So Tommy Lasorda, the manager, sends out Kirk Gibson. And they'd be talking about him the whole game. He's injured. He can't even walk. And he like limps up to the plate, takes a couple of feeble swings. You're like, this guy's going to strike out, no way. But then Eckersley, one of the best relief pitchers in the game at that time, fires this pitch, and then in a Kairos moment, the world stopped in L.A. And Kirk Gibson took a swing, and it wasn't even that great of a swing, but he took a swing, and that ball connected off that bat, and it went into the right field bleachers. And let me tell you, the whole city of L.A. exploded. I mean, we freaked out. It was like, yes! That picture, that look on his face is what a Kairos moment is. When all is dark and you're going to lose and there's no way out, something happens to open up hope again. And friends, that's just a baseball game, people. But there's something wired up in our hearts that is so needing and looking for kairos moments into our darkness, into our despair, into our bottom of the ninth, back to the walls. There's nothing in the world that's going to happen in any way that is good. It's written into our souls that we need someone to come through at that moment and do something that we cannot do. So in the prophets, in the Hebrew scriptures, we read this amazing prophecy about a kairos moment that's about to happen. Isaiah 43, 18, forget about what's happened. Don't keep going over old history, chronos time. Be alert. Be present. I'm about to do something brand new. And I mean, this is like a daddy that can't wait to give a present to his little daughter. I mean, it's coming. You guys can't see it yet, but it's coming. Here I come. I can't wait to give it to you. I love you so much. You can't see it now, but it is coming. The prophet goes on to write this. It's bursting out. Don't you see it? There it is. I'm making a road through the desert. You can't make a road through the desert, people. There's no way in the world. That can't happen. It's sand. It's desolate. You can't get trucks out there. You don't make a road in the desert. Making a river in the badlands. There's been no river in the badlands through the course of human history. We've never seen a river in the bad lines. It's impossible. It cannot happen. And into that moment of impossibility, God says, I am alive, and I'm about to do something brand new here. Can't you see it? And the children of Israel waited and waited and waited for that moment. What does it look like when Kairos erupts onto the scene? Well, residents of Minnesota know a little bit about Kairos because in the beginning of March this year, you guys, remember when it hit 60 degrees? And it was like, whoo! I'm wearing shorts. I'm pasty white legs. I don't care. I might even wear a tank top to work. It doesn't matter. It is sunny. It is 60, it is March, and it is Minnesota. But then one of your coworkers, and you know this guy, he's the guy that's like, well, you know it's going to snow again. Don't you put that snowblower away. Don't you pack that winter coat away. These are anti-Kairos people. And you need to stay away from them. But then, remember when you saw the first buds starting to form on the trees this spring? It's like, no, it's real. I mean, you know, and even this easy winter we had, it was still winter, remember? I mean, it's still like you're trapped inside. And so when the buds start forming on the branches, you're like, man, it is now. It's happening. Something new is coming. These are hints of kairos, even written into the seasons of the earth. is the story of God's redemption, is the story of new life. What does kairos look like? Have you ever witnessed a birth? Now, if you've ever witnessed the birth of a little baby chicken, maybe you've witnessed the birth of a little baby, child, a little human baby. And what's the word that we use to describe that moment? I don't care what country you come from. I don't care what kind of person you are. when a little baby is born, we say, it was a miracle. I mean, absolute miracle. Look at that little human life, gurgling and cooing and, you know, slime all over them, nastiest thing you've ever seen in your life. And you're like, that's a miracle. And it is a miracle. Into the very way in which we are reproduced and human beings come into life is a way in which we see the God of the universe telling God's story. I bring new life everywhere I go into the deepest darkness that you ever will feel. You will hear a baby cry and you'll remember, I bring new life into humanity. What does the Kairos moment look like? Now this little girl, I guarantee you, She's not thinking about what she's going to post on Twitter, what she's going to write on Facebook. She's not thinking about the Dow Jones. She's not thinking about the unemployment. She's not thinking about who's going to get elected in the fall. She's not thinking about school that's coming up. She's not thinking about homework. What is she thinking about right now? Nothing. She is experiencing the beauty of cold water on a hot day. She is springing up and bursting up into life. Adults, raise your hand if you have done that in the last 12 months. Now make a commitment. I see your little hand, little three-year-old girl. Love it. I have. I totally have. I believe it. Some of you adults need to make a commitment this summer to do that at least once. To turn on your sprinkler and to turn off your cell phone and to say, life is springing up all around me. When Jesus came on the scene in the first century, he came saying some pretty amazing things. He said this in Mark 1, 15. The time, and the word for time there in the Greek is, guess what? Kairos, the Kairos promised by God that we read about in the prophets in Isaiah has come at last. He announced the kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe the good news. And the good news is this, into your darkest hour, into your moment of despair, into your moment where your back was against the wall, when you thought nothing good would happen, when you thought it was all up to you to make something happen, I have made a way for you to be redeemed. I have made a way for you to be set free from what enslaves you. I have come. And that's the kingdom of God and it's good news. And the people of Jesus' day could not believe it. I mean, the Pharisees and priests, they really couldn't believe it. They wanted nothing to do with Jesus. But anyone who had any kind of defect or any kind of malady that waylaid them, people who were paralyzed, people who were possessed by demons, They flocked to Jesus because they experienced in Jesus the kairos moment of resurrection. Just meeting him was like, wow, it's bursting out. It's new life. It's resurrection. See, resurrection was the one moment in time that changed every moment since. It moved us from perpetually living in chronos time to the opportunity to live within kairos time, where every moment of life is a moment in which God could crash through and do something absolutely and utterly new. Into your regret, into your chronos time, into your sin and pain and darkness, the resurrection means that tomorrow does not have to be a repeat of today. into your absolute despair, God stands in the person of Jesus and announces, listen, turn from all of your striving to get it right on your own and receive the good news that in me is life. I am the way and the truth and the life, Jesus says. And no one gets to the Father except through me. I am the Kairos moment that you've been waiting for your whole life. And I'm setting up a kingdom and I am the king. And the motto of Jesus, what it was, what it is, and what it forever shall be, this is the rally cry, this presidential slogan is, look, I am making everything new. Now there's a little word in there you should notice. The word is everything. I am making everything new. Everything? No. Everything. No. I mean, a few things. Some things. It says there right there in the scriptures. Look, I am making everything new. So the people that are being made new, here's what it looks like. People in whom kairos moments are happening, we read this, so there is now no condemnation for those who, and I love this word, belong to Christ Jesus. What does it mean to belong to someone? It means you're theirs. You're not their property. You belong to them. You are hidden in their love. There is nothing you can do that can separate you from that love. There is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus. and because you belong to him. Here's the deal. The same life-giving power that Jesus got from the spirit, you get as well. The power of the life-giving spirit has freed you from the power of sin that leads to death. And Christ lives in you so that even though your body will die because of sin, it has to die. Things in you have to die in order for life to come. Do you get that? Things in you do have to die. You do have to turn. You do have to say, no longer am I gonna live by that way. But when you do, the Spirit gives you life because you have been made right with God. You have been made right with God. Now what made you right with God was Jesus hanging on a cross on that dark Friday, and he actually took my sin and yours onto him. He felt the shame and guilt and regret. We put him there. And on that cross, Jesus said this. He called out in a loud voice after his whole life had been spent, after he experienced the shame and guilt of sin, our sin, after he carried every single person's sin that ever has existed or ever would exist. He says, this Father, into your hands, I commit my spirit. He knew where he was going. He knew where he was from. And when he said this, he breathed his last. Mission accomplished. And then he spent three days under the earth. And on the third day, the power of God raised him from the dead. And it actually happened on an actual Sunday in actual history in the first century. Question, what do you think the first thing he said was? The first thing he thought. We know he breathed. That was his first action. What do you think his first thought was? I think it was, Father, into your hands I commit my spirit. It was my last thought. It will be my first thought. It was my thought every single moment of my life. Father, into your hands I commit my fear. Father, into your hands I commit my pain. Father, into your hands I commit my life. Father, into your hands I commit this breath. And this breath. And this breath. And this breath. What would it look like to live a life where with every single breath you breathe in God's life and you breathe out death? You breathe in forgiveness and you breathe out sin. You breathe in grace and you breathe out pain. Resurrection means that with every breath, we can begin again. No matter how dark your regret, no matter how dark the hopelessness is, no matter how much your sin has messed you up and separated you from people, in Jesus Christ we learn that with every breath, we can begin again in real time in our actual lives, with our actual relationships. Which brings me back to the butter. It always has to go from theological to practical. So my son, Ben, I put him to bed later on that day for his nap. He got up a little earlier than the other two guys. And I went in his room, and this is what he says every time. He goes, Daddy, is it time to get up? And I'm like, yeah, buddy, Let's go. So I got him up out of his little bed. We marched downstairs. I went right to the little cupboard where we keep our toaster. I got the toaster out, plugged it in, went and got the butter, put it down on the counter, got a butter knife, put it down on the counter, got his little chair, pulled it up to the counter, and he was kind of looking at me the whole time thinking, Dad, it's not breakfast time, I don't think. I said, Ben. I put him up on his little chair and I said, Ben, how would you like to learn how to butter your own waffle. He goes, yeah! So I gave him the knife, and I said, go for it. He looked at me, they're kind of like, are you sure? He stuck that thing down. I mean, we had this little dish of butter. I mean, buried that knife in that butter. Came up with about five pounds of butter. Slapped it on that hot waffle, and then he started to rub it around. I mean, we had butter flying over the place. I mean, the plate is demolished. And he goes, Daddy, I like to see it melting. I go, sweet, put more on it, you know. So, all right, he gets more, slaps it on there. He's spreading it around, you know. And then I looked at him right in the eyes and I said, Ben, please forgive me for this morning. Daddy's sorry. And he looked at me like, what the heck are you talking about? I don't even know. What? What happened this morning? I got the moment back. That was a Kairos moment. And you know what? Your moment, your stick of butter, your regret story is most likely much bigger and harder and more significant than the story I just told. And most likely what you've been experiencing around it is lots of shame and lots of guilt. So here's the question to ponder. What is it that you're breathing in these days? What are you breathing in? Most of us, it's influenced by Kronos time, we're breathing in shame, guilt, pain, regret, betrayal, hopelessness, failure, and we just are breathing in the voice that says you will never change. It will never change. He is never going to come back. She is never going to come back. You totally blew it. You'll never get it right again. What are you breathing in? I want to invite you to breathe in something different. In John 20, this is after Jesus has risen again, and the disciples were in this little room, and it says they were locked in this room, and all of a sudden Jesus appeared, you know, like Twilight Zone style. Boom, there he was. And he said to them, peace be with you, wholeness be with you, shalom be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I am sending you. And then he breathed on them. And he said, receive the Holy Spirit. Receive the life that I have. Receive the life that enables you to have a new moment, no matter what moment has transpired in the past. No matter how dark it is, receive my life. so as we close some of you need to hang on to this next verse and put it on your fridge put it by your bedside put it in your car because if you're in the middle of darkness and it's the bottom of the ninth and your back is against the wall and it seems hopeless and all is in despair you need to memorize this verse you need to let it truth sink deep deep down into you here's what David writes though you have made me see troubles many and bitter I'm going to say it just like it is God my life has not been easy. My life has not been easy. My road has been tough. Though you've made me see troubles, many and bitter, you, God, will restore my life again. You will do it. From the depths of the earth, from the lowest places, from the darkest places, you will again bring me up. You, God, are able to enact in me a Kairos moment where you come and you restore me. So let's pray together. And let's invite God to do that very thing for us in this very moment. So God, here we are, the church gathered, broken, messed up people that need you so desperately. So Holy Spirit, come right into this moment. Hover over this place. And God, first of all, we confess our sin with our thoughts and our actions and our words. We have wandered so far from you. We have turned our backs on you. We have sinned against you, God. In thought, word, and deed, and we have done it. Volitionally, we knew we were doing it, and we did it anyway. And so now, God, into our hopelessness, into our darkness, and into our despair, We pray that you would come with your life and that you would breathe your life into us right now. And I want to invite you to really take a deep breath in. Now let me pray this benediction over you as you leave. May you go, breathing in God's rich, generous, abundant, ninth inning life that raises you from the dead every single moment of your life. May you breathe that resurrection in every single moment of your life until you breathe your last. Amen? Amen. Go in peace, everybody. Have a great Easter.
