You'll notice that we're going to talk now for a few minutes, at least, on the topic how spiritual formation empowers and informs kingdom living. How spiritual formation empowers and informs kingdom living. And I would like to take off from 1 Peter 1, 2 Peter chapter 1. So, if you want to have a look at that, and we will then move into the discussion of spiritual formation. Spiritual formation is not a term that's in the Bible as such, but as you'll see from this passage, the reality is there. And here the writer says that we have been given everything that pertains to life and godliness. Verse 3 of chapter 1 of 2 Peter. Seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness. Now, that doesn't leave anything out, does it? That covers it. Everything that pertains to life and godliness. So the provisions are there. And as a people of God, we rest upon the fact that in the kingdom of God, Jesus is king, and he has all of the supplies that we need. The need of the church is never more people. It's never more money. It's never more credentials. How do you know that? Well, because the church has been at its best when it had the least of those. But what it did have was people of transformed character. See, the discussion by Todd was so helpful. And the missional aspect is something that comes from the transformation of the people as they live together under God. And the way it moves is conjugation. People come down with Christianity. They catch it. They go through an incubation period. And it's noticeable. And gradually they come to the place to where what they have caught by contact with other people becomes something that is living in them. And then that's where the idea of confessing faith comes in. Confessing means you own up to something, right? And to confess faith in Christ is to own up, He got me. I caught it. Now then I'm contagious and I'll pass it on. So all this stuff is there. Now, here's what Peter says in verse 5. Talking, well, verse 4 is too good to pass. He talks about, he has granted us his magnificent promises, precious promises, in order that by them you might become partakers of the divine nature. Now, that's the new birth. When the new birth comes, then a new life is inhabiting you, and you have become a partaker of another nature. Or in the language of Colossians 3, you are then risen with Christ. In order that you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust. And really, we could spend our whole evening or our whole session just talking about that. Many people don't think you can do that. Did you know that? Many people believe that it is impossible to escape the corruption that is in the world by lust. But I want to just go on from there now so you will see this process. Now, for this very reason also, applying all diligence in your faith, add moral excellence or virtue. Most of the versions say simply virtue, and that's correct. And virtue is the strength to do what needs to be done when it needs to be done. It's simply the habit of doing the right thing. And that language comes out of the classical background of the teaching about virtue, that virtue is something that you learn by practice, and it is a habit. It doesn't always mean you understand it. And so add to your virtue or moral excellence knowledge. and in your knowledge add self-control. And self-control is an advanced state of virtue that is based upon the capacity to plan and recognize what's happening and not be taken by surprise. Self-control basically means that you're able to do what you intend to do. Now, virtue in itself is not that stable and can be thrown off because it lacks knowledge. But when you add knowledge to virtue, you become the kind of person who is not thrown off, taken by surprise, the kind of person who recognizes what's happening and you're able to continue to do what you intend to do. To your self-control, perseverance. Perseverance, stick-to-itiveness, as someone has said. And this is the capacity to remain self-controlled, not just on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, but every day of the week. And then to your perseverance, add godliness. Godliness is basically adequacy of resources. It means that you're on a very firm foundation. Your power supply is adequate and more than that. And it's in no danger because you're now rooted deeply in the reality of God. And to your godliness, you would add Philadelphia, which isn't a place in Pennsylvania. brotherly love. Of course, you know the name of that. It comes out of the Christian tradition, the Quaker tradition, the city of brotherly love. Well, I don't know whether that's a true description of Philadelphia or not. But it is a condition in which you are able to exercise the kind of kindness and generosity to others around you that is characteristic of brothers as they're supposed to be. And then finally, capping it off again, is agape. And in your brotherly kindness, add agape, or love. And that is the character of God himself. That's a process of spiritual formation. Let's just now talk a little bit about spiritual formation, kingdom living, and how spiritual formation ties into kingdom living. And that will fill out our topic as announced there. Kingdom living, let's talk about that first. Kingdom living means you're living from the resources of the kingdom. That's the first thing it means. It's a matter of your resources for living, as Todd was talking about, the resources for living. For the first time, you have the resources to live human life as it is meant to be. Another way of thinking of it is to put it in terms of a spiritual person. Who is a spiritual person? Well, a spiritual person is not primarily one who does certain kinds of things. Rather, a spiritual person is a person who lives from the spiritual kingdom of God. That's where they get their direction. That's where they get their energy, power, is from a source outside of themselves in the kingdom of God. And that is a kind of life where you would now, because you have that, you would now easily and routinely do the things that Jesus said and did. I emphasize that because I think in order to get the point I want, I have to address the assumption that the more religious and holy you are, the harder life gets. And it's just the opposite. The holier you are, the easier life gets. The person who loves their enemy and does all the other things that Jesus talked about, that's not the person who has the hard life. The person who has the hard life is the one who hates their enemies. And you only have to look at life to see that that's true. So now, let's think of kingdom living in that way. Kingdom living is the life in the easy yoke. It's a life in which because of the resources, the things that you do are a natural expression of who you are internally. When Jesus on the cross said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do, that wasn't hard for him. That was easy for him. What would have been hard for him in that circumstance? To hate him? To say, you blankety blank blank, just wait till my father gets his hand on you. I used to preach with a fellow down in Texas, a dear man, but he had a strange view of God. and he said, he used to say in some of his evangelistic sermons, he'd say, God's going to skip them sinners across hell, the lake of fire like a boy skips a rock across a pond. I don't know where he got that. Very graphic. But you see, Jesus didn't want that to happen to those people. He loved them. And remember what love is now? Can you remember what that was? When we love, we will the good of what we love. And that's what love is. And Jesus was able to love that way. And when we move into the kingdom, then we're able to love that way too. So now, let's take that then as a description of kingdom living. and I really want to emphasize that you can understand this in terms just of what people do. It's where what they do comes from that is kingdom living. You have to stay away from legalism when you're trying to think about holiness and things of that sort. And, of course, that's one of the things we're really not quite over was the last round of holiness was something that fell into legalism and became very oppressive. And, for example, my wife and I were in a school that did not permit people to go to movies. And on the whole, that's probably a pretty good idea. But on the other hand, that's not the best way to handle it. And we were delivered by Cecil B. DeMille. Because when he did the Ten Commandments, we thought, well, this is close enough that maybe it won't count. But really, that's not the way you have to think about kingdom living. And it is true that the person who is living from the kingdom will be the person who, somewhat through a process like 2 Peter there describes, they come to the place to where they just routinely and easily do the kinds of things that Jesus said. And if there is some situation, as we were talking this afternoon, where there may be some problem of understanding it in terms of what Jesus explicitly said, if you take those as rules or laws, then they will be free to make a judgment, to ask God to lead them, to guide them, and to make a decision, and in faith go forward where the rules don't show the way. And that's crucial, isn't it? Because you can't live life according to rules. There will always be some conflict, some puzzle, some cases that no one said anything about in the rules, and you're going to have to make a judgment and trust God. That's where what you are on the inside, if you have been formed in Christlikeness, will give you the guidance you need. Now, second thing, what is spiritual formation? Or spiritual transformation, really, that's what we're talking about. Spiritual formation is the process through which we become in our inner being like Jesus. It's the process. Spiritual formation is a process. It is what happens in discipleship. It's what happens in discipleship. In discipleship, spiritual formation occurs. Now, the truth of the matter is everybody gets a spiritual formation, a good one or a bad one. Hitler had one. Mother Teresa had one. So everyone gets a spiritual formation because we become internally what we are, and that's spiritual formation in general. Christian spiritual formation is a transformation process. And that's one where what we have become internally, which is always bad in a world that has fallen into its resistance to God, it's always twisted, not always the same way. And it isn't just that we're wrong in what we do. We're wrung inside. We're twisted. or like a bow that's crooked, or a rifle that has the sights knocked out of alignment. And so that has to be corrected. And that process now of transformation is Christian spiritual formation. Christian spiritual formation is the process of becoming internally what Christ laws internally, having his heart, his faith, his peace, his joy, his wisdom, and all those things. That's what spiritual formation or transformation in Christ is. Now, I've put up here this list of things from Mark 12, and if some of you have looked at my book on the renovation of the heart, you'll know that I have diagrams on these. But we don't need the diagrams. Just remember, this lawyer came and asked Jesus, what is the great commandment? And Jesus said, the Lord our God is one Lord, and you will love the Lord with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, with all your strength, and your neighbor is yourself. That's the whole deal. And you know, that's picked up over and over in the New Testament. Like Paul says, I think it's in Romans 13. He that loves has fulfilled the law. And this is how you escape. So don't turn this back into another legalism. This is how you escape legalism. What Jesus is telling us here is not actually something to do. He is telling us how to love God. He's telling us to attend to those dimensions of the self that make up our life. Now, I suggest to you that these are the essential dimensions of the human self. If you're a dichotomist or a trichotomist, try not to worry about it right now. Because, I mean, the truth of the matter is, if you try to understand your life in terms just of your spirit, soul, and body, you will not know where to put some of the things you need to be most concerned about. And the mind, for example. And also, what are you going to do with your body in relationship to these other things? Where are the emotions? And so on. So you need to be able to think in terms of the parts of yourself that you can do something with. And you can do something with all of these. There's something you can do about them that will transform you toward loving God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength. Typically, when we start working on this, we just think about the heart or the will. And you have to use language sometimes in ways that are not wholly instructive. And in speaking of the renovation of the heart, one of the things I want to do is call attention to the fact that you can never just renovate the heart, will, or spirit by itself. The heart or will or spirit stands at the very center of who you are. That's the part of you that most defines your value to God and most defines the direction your life will take. It's your capacity to choose. And the capacity to choose is will. And God made us, as we talked about earlier, to be creative, will, productive of good. And that's what we're naturally attracted to. That's what everyone really wants, is to be creative, to count for something, and to count for something good. And that's deeply embedded in everyone. Now, when the will rebels against God and turns on itself, it can no longer be productive of the good it is supposed to produce. Because it no longer has the resources for it. No longer has the vision of goodness. Because it's lost in itself. And self-obsession, we've talked about it a lot today, or putting the self at the top of the pool, actually blinds a person. See, when we are told to worship God, that isn't because God is a cosmic egomaniac. That's for our good. That's for our good. That's not for His good. And when we love Him and seek what He wants, again, That's for our good. He lets us have a part of that. And it's very important to understand God in that way, that He wants to include us in His good, and so He invites us to love Him and to seek the good that He seeks. And when the will is turned away from God, it will be turned away from it because in addition to a choice, which most people never have a very clear choice about this because they're raised in a world in which they are naturally directed toward evil and away from God. And the primary form of that is self-concern, self-obsession, self-advancement, self-confidence. that doesn't rest in God. And so when the will is turned away from God, it becomes blinded, and the mind becomes unreliable. And you'll see that so much if you just listen to the public discussions today about what's good and evil. You'll see people arguing for the most outrageous things because their minds have been twisted. Now, you remember that Paul talks in Romans 1 about this declension and talks about how when people refused to retain God in their knowledge, their minds became reprobate and their feelings went crazy. And that is the story that Paul tells in some other places, but most fully in Romans 1. So now how is the heart going to be turned back to God? There has to come to it through the mind the gospel of the kingdom, the idea that there is a God who loves you and who not only loves you but invites you to be a part of his life. And that he has this intention for everyone. And so, God so loved the world. I mean, that's basic information. See, when you think about the Bible, you have to think of the Bible as having the most important or the best information on the most important issues of human life. It has the best information on the most important issues of human life. It isn't just some old dusty book. It is descriptions on how we can know reality, live in the truth, and do what is good. It invites us into the life of God. It informs us about Him. So, in order to begin to change, the gospel comes under the administration here, and with the change of the thoughts, the feelings also change. As I think about God as someone who has loved and provided for me, then my feelings begin to change. And there is set up a kind of tension now. Am I going to continue to trust myself and make myself the king of my life? Or am I going to choose to trust God? And that tension is something that runs through all of human life. And it doesn't disappear once you accept Christ as your Savior. Because there's so much in your mind and in your body that's running in the wrong direction, in your social atmosphere that is wrong, that now the process goes between you and God now. You have the responsibility of making choices, interacting with God, receiving grace, and growing in grace. And what growth in grace would mean now with this before us, that in our hearts there was more of the action of God in our soul, in our mind, in our body, and in our relationship to our neighbors. There was more of the grace of God in action changing each of those areas. Now, tomorrow I'm going to spend a lot of time on some of these areas in particular, but for tonight I'm just trying to convey what spiritual formation looks like. And spiritual formation now, as I said, is a process. And in that process, these aspects, these essential dimensions of the being, of the human being, become increasingly like the character that Christ has. The soul here, the soul is that part of you that takes all of the other aspects of your experience and turns it into one life. the heart is like the executive center of the self here you make decisions you don't make decisions with your soul your soul is what is running your life you can make decisions that will change your soul and most of these will go through what you do with your mind your body and with your neighbors And as you make decisions about those, and these come under the heading largely of spiritual disciplines, as you make decisions about those, gradually all of your life changes. Like, for example, just illustrate. I mean, you know what a problem there is in our culture, let's say, with sexual lust. and it causes so much difficulty, and there's so much delusion about it. Mr. Clinton, in one of the interviews he did on television after his book came out, was asked why he did what he did with, as he called her, that woman. And he said something that was patently false. I don't know if you saw that interview. But he said, I did it for the worst of all reasons. I did it because I could. Now, obviously, that's not the reason he did it. If that was the reason, he could have gone up to the top of the White House and jumped off. But he didn't do that. He could have done that. But he didn't. I mean, what he did was not the result of him being able to do it. What he could not say is, well, you know, I've had a trouble. I've had a problem with lust for a long time. In fact, I am a lascivious man. And what led me to do this with her was my lusts. See, he didn't say that. And his character in relationship to them. Because that would be too condemning for him. And so he said something that was patently false. But what was governing him was the practice of lusting that he had cultivated for years. Now, if you're going to change that, you're going to have to change your thoughts. When you are in a situation in life where you might be led to cultivate lust, you have to think differently about the people who are involved. In fact, you have to think about them in a way that you will not lust after them. And the way you do that is that you begin to see them in the light of God's view of them. So that whenever a man or a woman comes along, you don't automatically see them as, Aha! Here's my chance. You rather see them as something that you wouldn't think of degrading them in that way, even in your thoughts. Now then, next step. You're not going to do that unless you think that it's important for you to do it. You have to make a decision. And this goes back to your will. Are you ready to abandon lusting? Now, actually, in our culture, I think many people are formed in such a way they think they'd stop breathing if they did. Because it's so much a part of their life. And it isn't just sex. I mean, it's all sorts of other desires. See, we're in a desire culture. We're in a culture that really thinks that it's good for people to do what they desire, that it makes for happiness. And when you look under many of the controversies that we, not only in our society, but in our churches get involved in, what underlies them is the idea that desire is something to be fulfilled. It's good. I have kids tell me that all the time at USC. You know, one of the classical seven deadly sins was lust. And I remember a kid in class once, I just was explaining to him, oh, he said, lust is good, wonderful. Well, see, that's really pretty much a reflection of the dominant ideas that govern our culture. It goes along with things like you have a right to pursue happiness, that God gave you a right to pursue happiness. Can any of you find that in the Bible? But it says that in your constitution, that you have a God-given right to pursue happiness. And I may be sort of puzzling you now because you may not have thought these thoughts, but think about it. Is happiness a good thing to pursue? We don't even know what it is. Aristotle pointed that out long ago. He said, well, we think happiness is the good, but no one knows what it is. There used to be an ad that ran in the Los Angeles Times for Peugeot automobiles. It said, pursue happiness in a car that can catch it. Now, you know, happiness is a warm puppy. Well, that's one of the better ones, actually. Happiness is being Irish, being single, being married, being whatever. You know, this is the land of bumper stickers. And so, if you think that you have a right to pursue happiness, that's going to translate for most people into you have a right to do what you want because how would you be happy? Well, you do what you want. And that's a pure prescription for destruction. So I'm just using that as an illustration tonight because I'm going to talk about it at greater length tomorrow and go over some of these in greater detail. But what I'm illustrating here is spiritual formation. Spiritual formation is the process through which all of these in Christ, spiritual formation in Christ, is the process where all of these dimensions increasingly take on the character of Jesus Himself. Now, that's what Peter is talking about here in 2 Peter in the passage that I read. He's taking one cut at how you would go about that. Add to your faith virtue. Add to your virtue knowledge. and so on. Now, let me ask you a serious and sober question. When you read that, does it seem to be something that you should do? Is it a serious proposal? Now, Peter is obviously telling us to do it. But I'm talking about reading it from within the framework of our understanding of Christianity that we might have. If you knew a Christian, you walked up to them and you were to ask them, Now, is that what you do? What would be their answer? Let me let that question hang in the air. And let me put it with another question. In our churches, do we proceed on the assumption that people are making progress? For example, do we teach lessons and then presuppose that people have got those, and so we go on and build another course on that? Just think about it. Sometimes this is called Christian education. One of the interesting things about Christian education is there's no prerequisites for anything. Do you ever think about that? We don't think of what we're learning as something that proceeds through a graduated course of studies and learning and habit changing and growth, So that, for example, a person who had been through a certain course of studies and experience would no longer be bothered, for example, they would no longer be bothered with lusting. We don't think about it in that way because we don't have the conditions of discipleship and discipline that would lead there. And so, by and large, we tend to teach the same rounds of subjects to the same round of people. Now, if what I'm saying is false, I expect you to tell me. See, because I might go around the country saying this kind of thing everywhere, and if it's false, it wouldn't be a good thing. So, really, I mean, you may not want to do it now, you may want to do it tomorrow. But think about this now. Don't you find it strange when you do stop to think about it that we don't have an assumption of progress in the basic teachings and practices of our faith? Or maybe I'm wrong. You know, I have been wrong. If I knew where I was wrong, I'd stop it. but as James said you know if you talk a lot you're bound to make a lot of mistakes so I really want to engage you see in this thinking about this tonight because one picture of the church would be people come into the church they begin to make progress they learn doctrine they learn practices they learn abilities and they just keep progressing and this wouldn't just be about church as we've heard Todd talk about it tonight. It would also be, and more importantly for many people, unless we're actually exercising leadership in the church, more importantly would be on that seventh floor of the high rise or whatever. That's where we'd see people just making steady progress. And that would be a natural thing to expect in spiritual formation. now if that happened then I think we can finally say something about the last aspect of our topic for tonight how spiritual formation empowers and informs kingdom living now suppose we know what kingdom living is and suppose we know what spiritual formation is now our question is how would spiritual formation empower and inform kingdom living? Well, you know, we can say some things pretty fast here, I think. Remember now, kingdom living is coming to the place to where you routinely and easily do the sorts of things that Jesus taught and said. And that would apply to things like lusting and anger and contempt and all of the other things that he talks about, as I've said, as illustrations of a kind of life. So those would just be kind of things that would roll off of us. We wouldn't expect people, for example, having to deliberate about whether they were going to be contemptuous of someone. And we wouldn't see them just doing it without thinking because they would have come to recognize what contempt is or any of the other things I've mentioned. they would have come to recognize when it was coming around the corner because that's a major part of growing is to learn when things are coming up and to be ready for them when they get there. See, that was Peter's trouble in his denials. You remember Jesus told Peter that he was going to deny him three times? Now, Peter said, no, I won't. What was he thinking about? He was thinking about this part right here. This is what we would call his intentions. But Jesus said, you will deny me three times, not once, not twice, three times. and you might think, well, by the time he did it the second time, he would be on top of it and he wouldn't do it the third time. But no, no, Jesus is teaching him something very important. Three times. Now, if Jesus had just wanted to stop him from denying him, he could have done that. Wouldn't you agree? I mean, he could give him lockjaw. Or have an angel stand there and whack him. that sort of thing see Jesus was more interested in his growth than he was in his obedience am I making any sense you see this is tremendously important because this is how grace comes into a life of growth grace says grace will put you in a position where you can fail in order that you will be stronger because of what you learned. That's what happened to Peter. Peter did not know what was in him. And Jesus was teaching him deeply. And you see, what was in him was in this area of his body and himself. Peter probably expected when Jesus said, you're going to deny. Oh, no. Peter probably thought some big burly soldier was going to stand in front of him with a sword and say, now I'm going to kill you if you don't deny Christ. But it was a little girl standing around a fire. He was not on guard. See, that's the problem with intentions. They work only if you're on guard. And then sometimes they don't work. But the problem was not in his intentions. It was in what his body was prepared to do in a social context. So when the little girl said, you're one of them, he didn't consult, I mean his jaws didn't consult his brain, to put it on those terms. his jaws just said no I'm not that context and his habits ran ahead of his intentions and he found out that he had already done what he intended not to do see spiritual transformation is not just a matter of the will and the single greatest delusion on this is that it's a matter of training your will. And that's what we really have to understand. Here's how it works. Spiritual transformation comes through the cooperation of the Spirit, the Word, and the will. That's how it comes. It isn't done by your own efforts, but you must make an effort. That's that passivity activity thing that we were talking about this afternoon. You have to make an effort, but your effort is not what accomplishes the outcome. So your will has to be engaged with changing what is in your mind, your thoughts and your feelings, what is in your body, what exists out here in the social relationship, and eventually with the soul. So, to put it very simply, your mind has the capacity to direct your body into circumstances. I'm sorry, the heart with the mind, minimally adjusted, has the capacity to direct your body into circumstances where your mind and your feelings and your soul and your body and your social relationships will be changed. Now, here's a funny thing. all spiritual disciplines are bodily behaviors. And that is because in the economy of the person, God has set it up in such a way that we can direct our body under our mind and will towards situations that will change everything in our being. everything. And those are generally spiritual disciplines. Now Peter got a little discipline, but it was one that was imposed upon him. God does that sometimes. Actually, one way of discussing spiritual disciplines is to divide them into the imposed and the voluntary. Because sometimes God imposes things, and other times we have things imposed upon us which we can take as a discipline. For example, in my case, driving to work is an activity that's imposed on me. I live 38 miles from my office. That's imposed upon me. Now, I can choose whether I'm going to use that as a discipline or not. I could turn on the radio and listen to rap music. Not going to do much for me. Or I could play scripture tapes or music. Or I could just drive in silence, which I sometimes do. And I can just use a phrase to turn over in my mind. Hallowed be thy name. and just every so often repeat that phrase, like kingdom come on the freeway. Try it. It'll do a lot for you and may do a lot for the people driving alongside you. So see, those are choices. Now, in Peter's case, he had a discipline imposed upon him by God because God had special plans for Peter and he wanted to get this man ready to serve him. And you remember what Jesus told Peter in Luke 22. He said, Satan has desired to sift you like wheat. You know what sifting is. Sifting is a separating process. He's desired to sift you like wheat. Now he said, I have prayed for you that your faith fail not. He did not pray that Peter fail not. He prayed that when Peter failed, his faith wouldn't fail. And you'll remember the rest of the verse says, after you have turned around, then strengthen your brothers. See, that was really Peter's job. He was the right-hand guy, and he had to lead. And he did. But he did it through a process of change that involved him failing and going out and weeping bitterly. Now, we don't have to fail and go out and weep bitterly to change. We can choose to do things that will transform these. And one of the most important disciplines with a spiritual life is solitude. Solitude is an extremely powerful process of change. It involves your body. When you go into solitude, you take your body into a place where you are alone, and preferably in silence. And one of the things that is most important in solitude is learning how to do nothing. I doubt that many of us know that, how to do nothing. Solitude, its primary function is to introduce Sabbath into our souls. Sabbath. And you remember that Sabbath is a time when you do no work. Now this is one of the hardest things for people to do, but I will guarantee you it will do more for your spiritual life when you begin a serious path of discipline than any other thing. here's what it would look like finding a comfortable place a room or a backyard or a beach or a mountain or whatever you do up here lakes and you go there and make yourself comfortable and you enjoy the scenery but you don't do anything of course you know people say to me well am I going to stand sit or lie down. Well, you know, it doesn't matter much. You're going to do something. You have to keep breathing, by the way. Don't stop breathing. When I say do nothing, I mean you're not engaged in any productive efforts. That would mean, for goodness sakes, don't take the books you have intended to read but haven't. Don't take those with you in solitude. The letters. Do nothing. Just do nothing. now it will have a very powerful effect on you and probably at first you will find it impossible but that's just a sign you're beginning to make headway because you're beginning to understand your problem which is producing stuff being productive and you need to stop that so that you can live comfortably when you are productive without being harassed for all the things you haven't gotten done. You need to have peace in your heart. And you start, you have a hard time with that. It's like these little cars, you know, the kids push on the floor and it starts the thing rolling inside and after they get it started it keeps going. And you have to let that run down. And you didn't get in the situation you're in quickly and it will take some practice. Solitude, silence is awfully important in getting us off the project of controlling our environment. It's very difficult to be silent and let people think what they will. But if you can't be silent, you'll never be able to control your tongue. On the other hand, learning how, for example, such simple things like letting other people have the last word. Now, if you're like me, they pay me to have the last word. But I have watched how much good it does the people who expect me to have the last word when I don't have it. Because I allow them to be responsible and step out. And very often the best thing you can do, like if you're in a discussion and someone is disagreeing with you, sometimes the best thing you can do for that situation is simply to say, well, I think we'll just let that stand, what you've said, and let's think about it instead of giving the answer. Now, I need that discipline to keep me out of the position of being the answer man and to be able to direct people back to their own souls in relationship to God. That's very important as a teacher, by the way. I mean just in ordinary teaching, is to not always be coming along with the answer. You have to even such things as teaching children multiplication and division. The way they really learn is when you set a context in which they can work out the problem, and then they learn that. Telling them the answer doesn't help them. Sometimes telling them the method doesn't help them. They have to work it through, and then they get it. And the same thing is true in spiritual and moral issues. And silence is a way of standing back and not assuming responsibility, but letting people work out something that will stand with them. And we have a real problem in religion with this, because we are so addicted to think that the real thing is, I get you the right answer, and then you've got the right answer, and you'll know the answer when you face God or something, and you'll pass the test. When it's really what God is interested in is, who have you become? What God gets out of our life is the person we've become. That's much more important than the accomplishments that we're aiming at. Our accomplishments may be of some significance. I don't mean to deny that, but they're not nearly as important as what is happening to us. And the process of change here into Christ-likeness is what we need above all to pay attention to. Now when we do that, when we do that, then our life in the kingdom, our kingdom living, is immeasurably strengthened. I'll just mention a couple of things, and we'll have to pick up here tomorrow as best we can. But it is immeasurably strengthened because we keep ourselves rooted in our source, which is God, in the kingdom. Here's what David said in Psalm 16, 8. I have set the Lord always before me. He is at my right hand. I shall not be moved. Another passage you may recall is from Isaiah. You will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you because he trusts in you. See, where you trust, that's where your mind stays. And when our mind comes away from God, it's because we're not trusting Him, we're trusting something else. Very likely, our capacity is to act and produce. And again, I say those are important things, but they can't be the top of our list. They can't be what we're trusting. We act as is appropriate, but our confidence is in God. And that's how we have perfect peace. That phrase there is, we have, it's like, you know, we say the creme de la creme. And that passage there in Isaiah, it's like we have the cream of peace. Peace of peace. Shalom, shalom. We have the very top level. Why? because his mind has stayed on God. Now, one of the things that comes out of solitude is the habit of having your mind fixed on God. He resides there as a permanent possession. And as you build that habit of keeping him there, then you don't even have to think about it any longer. He's just there. So your mind works by habits. The habits that you form depend upon the choices you make. And in spiritual formation, it depends upon the means that you discover to carry out your decisions. Once you have decided, yes, I would like to have, for example, a body that does not already do what is wrong before I've had a chance to think about it. so that, for example, if I decide that I want to bless those who have cursed me, the cursing will not have already come out of my mouth before I think to bless them. See, that was Peter's situation. That's why he's so useful. And it isn't just, you know, one thing. This applies to everything. Like, for example, paying attention in love. We talked about that this afternoon. Paying attention in love. Does that get by us so fast that we don't do it? Speaking a word filled with grace. See, we're ready. That's the thing about the body, is that we want the readiness to do the good right there in the body. We don't want it somewhere else. We have to bring it down or somewhere we have to bring it up. A wonderful passage in Proverbs talks about this wonderful woman, godly woman, and it says the law of kindness is in her tongue. And that's where you want it, not in her head. You want it in her tongue so she won't have to think, now am I going to be kind? Because kindness will already be coming out. And our body is meant to serve our spirits. And in order for that to happen, it has to be retrained so that it is automatically poised to do the good thing. And that's a major part of spiritual formation. Well, we're going to have to... You've held up very well. We're going to have to stop for now. and we will pick up and carry on with this teaching about spiritual formation tomorrow but I do hope you've gotten sort of the basic idea and the most central thought again is it's not just will, it's not just resolve it's the will directing all of the other parts mainly by directing how the body is used so that all of this comes together in one harmonious, loving being in the kingdom of God. May God bless this to you and your thinking and give you good thoughts tonight even while you sleep. And remember, by the way, rest is a spiritual discipline. It's a spiritual discipline. If you consider all the problems that are posed by exhaustion and how hard it is to be loving when you're worn out, you'll see what I mean alright Dallas thank you so much thank you we're going to get these two right to their hotel for sleep so if you've got questions wait until tomorrow okay thanks Thank you.
