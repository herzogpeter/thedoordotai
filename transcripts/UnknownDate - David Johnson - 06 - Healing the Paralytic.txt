Thank you, Steve. Steve, the last minute we got very sick, and Steve kind of stepped into place at the last minute, and I just am very grateful. Good job. Let's pray as we go to the ministry of the word. The ministry of the Word, Father, has power when it is empowered by your Spirit. And so I pray that the Word that is now proclaimed is, in fact, your Word. From your mind and your heart, empowered by your Spirit, I pray. And another thing strong in me right now relative to what we're talking about and the text we're dealing with, the story we're dealing with, is that in this particular story, the power of the Lord was present to heal. And I can't make that happen, but I pray that the power of the Lord today would be present to heal in a variety of ways. I pray that in your name. Amen. Today, after several weeks of detour due to Advent sermons, Christmas and New Year's, we return to what we have been referring to actually for, I don't know, about a year now, I think, as a journey with the Holy Spirit, dealing of late with the gifts of the Spirit, particularly the gift of healing, with special focus lately on the healing miracles of Jesus as found in Matthew 8 and 9, the gift of healing. We've been away for a while, So to kind of get back into it and stir the pot on all of the perspectives and even emotions that surround this particular gift and how it's implemented in the church, I'm going to start with a story. Several years ago, the National Press picked up a story that I saw in both the Star Tribune and Christianity Today about a man named David Gilmore. Along with his wife, Patty, decided not to take Dustin, their 15-month-old son, to a doctor when he became ill. It began with flu-like symptoms, and when they persisted, they brought him to church to be prayed for by their pastor and elders. Members of this church believed that faith alone can heal any disease and that to look elsewhere for help, like to doctors or medicine, would evidence a lack of faith. For several weeks, they prayed earnestly, repeatedly confessing sin, real and imagined, including any wavering of faith that God really was going to heal their son because wavering of faith would be sin as well. His temperature continued to climb when he no longer responded to sound they prayed. They prayed harder when he went blind. Friends and family became concerned and assured Gilmore that to bring his son to a doctor was not inconsistent with faith, but he would not be dissuaded, not even when Dustin's neck swelled and his jaw muscles locked. On May 14th, they went to church, as was their custom, and the pastor preached a particularly rousing sermon that morning on faith. They went home greatly encouraged. That night, their spirits soared when Dustin finally opened his mouth and ate some food. The next morning, May 15th, Patty walked into his bedroom and found Dustin dead. But they weren't finished, again they prayed, for they believed that the same faith that heals the sick raises the dead. David kept it up for five minutes. Patty didn't last that long. Both were then plummeted into a hopeless kind of despair. Dustin stayed dead. It only became worse when an autopsy revealed that he died from a form of meningitis that if treated could easily be cured. So welcome back to this whole issue of healing and faith and how God does this stuff. Let me ask you a question as I read that story. What kind of things stir in you? how do you react to that? you feel disgust? anger? pity for these poor people who went down this road of sincere belief? confusion? how does it happen like this? as a teacher I read a story like that and feel a bit of a chill to tell you the truth be careful what you teach be very careful what you encourage people to think and to believe, therefore to pursue. When stories like that hit the national press, as this story did a couple of years ago, I must admit to a twinge of embarrassment. I don't know if this happens to you, but I often feel when I see Christians get on TV and they say the things they say, I just kind of go, why are they always weirdos? That's why, by the way, that's why the paper this morning, you've got to get the Star Tribune paper this morning, front page, Ephraim Smith, a weirdo if there ever was one. Yeah. Honestly, I think you know what I'm talking about. And that sense of embarrassment with stories like this is followed by a deep desire to disassociate myself from that kind of stuff and those kind of people. And here's the problem. They're Christians. They're part of our family. But I want to run. And while I'm running, shout as loud as I can to anyone who will hear, we're not all like that. The family of God's a dysfunctional family, and just like you, we got a weird uncle or two. But they're always getting on TV. But when I start to run from this kind of stuff and want to make disclaimers and disassociate myself, that is when it gets kind of weird for me. Because often in my running, I run too far. It works like this, at least for me. In the rush to get away from, to disassociate myself from the idea that God always heals if you have enough faith. Therefore, just stir up the faith. And if they're not healed, you all be done. And in my effort to rush and run away from that, unwittingly I sometimes find myself running into the idea that God doesn't heal, don't bother asking. Now I would never say that, but in terms of function, confidence that God would heal, I find myself living in a place that says don't, don't even ask. So on one hand, we have a problem where the Mr. Gilmores of the world never go to doctors. On the other hand, we have a problem where many Christians never go to God. Like, it's almost like God's the last place. They go the last thing we think of. Today, I want us to meet some people who go to God. with a friend, indeed, who go to great lengths to get their friend to Jesus for healing. But the healing goes to places they didn't expect it to go, couldn't have foreseen it to go. The story is told in three places, actually, in the Gospels. Matthew 9 is our primary text. That's where we've been working these last few weeks and months. And so we'll be getting some of the story from there. But also in Mark chapter 2 and Luke chapter 5, fills in some of the blanks to set the context and paint the picture. Matthew 9 verse 1, the story starts by setting it this way. And getting into the boat, he crossed over and came to his own city. He is Jesus. His own city is Capernaum. He is not from Nazareth anymore. He's kind of moved to Capernaum. And by all accounts, most people believe that in Capernaum, he was living in Peter's house. Just kind of keep that in mind. The story is going to take place in a house. It's probably Peter's house, Mark 2, verse 1. And when he'd been there in Capernaum, staying at Peter's house for several days, it was heard that he was home. Luke 5, 17 says then, it came about one day that he was teaching. And there were some Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting there, undoubtedly critiquing him. And they'd come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. the power of the Lord was present this day in this house for healing. Mark 2.2 then indicates that many were gathered together in this house so that there was no longer room, even near the door, as he was speaking to them the word. And behold, Luke 5.18 says, some men were carrying on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were trying to bring him in and set him down in front of Jesus. But not finding any way to do that because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiles with his stretcher, right in the center in front of Jesus. And seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, friend, your sins are forgiven you. In Mark 9, verse 2, Jesus says, take courage my son your sins are forgiven you now before before I read the rest of that story and the rest of the healing that takes place in this story take note of something that's very important and it's something I kind of want us to have in in in the pot as it were of our thinking all through this series on healing he is about to heal this man physically of his paralysis but But before he does, Jesus heals him spiritually. Your sins are forgiven. Which means, among other things, this. That there's more than one way to be sick. There's more than one way to need healing. You can be physically sick, obviously. And when we think of healing and sickness, I think that's the one we think of most. And the presenting issue for this individual being lowered from the roof is a physical ailment, paralysis. But you can also be sin sick. You can be heart sick. You can have a sickness in your soul, a leanness in your spirit. Lots of things in your life can be diseased. You could have a marriage that's very, very sick. Let me ask you a question just to kind of get the waters stirred up here. Which is the worst way to be sick? Many different ways to be sick, physically, emotionally, spiritually, which is the worst way to be sick. What occurs to me is this, it depends on what you have. Because I think the worst way to be sick is the way you are sick. In other words, if you're sitting here today and you're very sick physically, it's probably what you're thinking of. And the little pieces of information and help and hope around God have to do with your physical healing. It doesn't mean there's nothing wrong with that. But if you're heart sick today and physically you're fine and you're heart sick today and you're really, people can get so heart sick that they can look at someone who's physically sick and think, I'd rather have that, give me cancer any day. Because I'd rather be dead than feel like I. There's a lot of different ways to be sick. And when you think of all the different ways that someone could be sick and need healing, which would be the greater healing? What would take more, what would be more miraculous? physical healing or somebody's marriage being healed. Now, if you're physically sick, it feels like that would be the biggest miracle. But if you're sitting here and your marriage is diseased, you've got probably more faith that God would heal cancer than God would heal your marriage. What's the point? It's this. There's more than one way to be sick, more than one way to need healing. One Greek word for sickness, in fact, is the Greek word There's a number of words for sickness. And it's Ruth. This one simply means weak or feeble. In Romans 4.19 it says Abraham was weak in faith. So it was his faith in this particular context that was sick, weak, feeble. It was his faith that needed healing. David Gilmore in the story I told you at the beginning of the sermon was praying for his son who was sick, physically sick. I'm sure that's the only sickness he could see. That's the only direction he went. but it occurs to me that his son was not the only one who was sick. I don't mean to be mean to Mr. Gilmore, but there was something very sick in Gilmore's thinking that had his thinking over here been healed, his son over here might have been healed. He was sitting here going, heal, heal, heal. You needed a different healing. How you think needs to be healed because it's sick. If that had been healed, that would have been healed. And in ways that go beyond the illustrations I'm giving you now, there are connections of sin and different kinds of sickness and places where repentance is needed before physical healing will ever come, where any kind of healing will ever come. It's all interconnected. Many different ways to be sick. Many different ways to need healing. The first thing Jesus heals on this guy is his heart. Take courage. my son your sins are forgiven we'll come back to that let's finish the story Luke 5 21 picks it up with these words and the scribes and the pharisees began to reason saying who does this guy think he is he speaks blasphemies who can forgive sins but God but Jesus aware of their reasoning is answered and said to them why are you reasoning in your hearts this way which is easier to say your sins have been forgiven or to say rise and walk? Which is the greatest healing? Which one matters more? Which is harder to do? Which is the bigger miracle? Well, in order that you might know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to do this kind of healing, forgive sins, he said to the paralytic, I say rise, take up your stretcher and go home. I'll do this kind of healing. And once he rose before them and took up what he had been lying on and went home glorifying God and they were all seized with astonishment and began glorifying God and were filled with fear saying, we have seen remarkable things today. They were filled with fear. It's an interesting word. Phabos is the word we get our word phobia or fear. It's the same word that was used when the disciples were in the storm in Matthew chapter eight and Jesus calmed the storm and they were filled with fear. It's the same word that was used later on in the gospels where Jesus walked out on the water on the Sea of Galilee toward their boat and they saw him walking on the water in the dark and they were filled with fear. It's the same word that was used of Mary and Martha when they came after Jesus had been crucified to the tomb expecting to embalm or dress his body but the stone had been rolled away and they were filled with fear. It's reverential awe. It's being overwhelmed with the reality that God is on the move and he's moving in ways that I didn't even expect and can't manipulate or control in Acts chapter 9. It says that the whole church was moving in the fear of God. That's what happens when the power of the Lord is present to heal. Heal in a variety of ways. Some of which you didn't even know you needed. Three things about this story I want us to examine first. And it's all pretty obvious. It's probably the things you want to look at as well. I think there's three major players here. I want to look at the plight of the paralytic. I want to examine the faith of the four friends and then simply the response of Jesus to this whole thing. Let's look first at the paralytic's plight. Paralysis, as most of you know, involves a loss of motor function, an inability to move. There are varying degrees of severity from partial to complete. Some people can't move at all when they are physically paralyzed, which prompts me to say this again. I want this kind of in the hopper of our thinking all along the way, our series in healing. Just like there's more than one way to be sick and there's more than one way to need healing, there is also more than one way to be paralyzed. You can be paralyzed physically. And while there might be someone, one or two people who are here paralyzed physically, and I see people here in church who are paralyzed that come in on a wheelchair of some sort. Most aren't. There are a lot of ways to be paralyzed. Because you can be paralyzed physically. You can be paralyzed emotionally and spiritually, relationally. Some people are paralyzed with fear. And when, again, some people can be physically paralyzed, I'm guessing that there are a lot more people emotionally, spiritually, relationally paralyzed in this room than paralyzed physically. So much so that some of you can't move. Paralysis is a loss of function. I don't care where it manifests itself in your body, in your spirit. It's a loss of function, an inability to function in life. And like physical paralysis, there are varying degrees of severity from partial to complete. Some people can't move at all emotionally, relationally, spiritually stuck, have been for years. You're paralyzed. The causes of paralysis in Jesus' day were much the same as today, though there's one example I'm going to give you that I think was a little different than what we would see today. The most common then, and I think probably now, would be an accident where you would falls and experience some injury to the neck or the spine. I don't know, we hear about car accidents all the time where people are paralyzed. In car accidents, then he might have fallen off a ladder. He might have fallen off a horse. It wasn't his fault. He made a mistake. Almost a sense, as they're sitting there paralyzed, I mean, a lot of people fall off horses and they don't get paralyzed. And there's this incredible sense of why me? A lot of people get in car accidents and they're not paralyzed. They fall off a ladder and they're not paralyzed. Why? I mean, a lot of people grow up in dysfunctional families with a lot of pain, but they don't end up getting paralyzed emotionally, but I did. Or you did. And there's this place at which trying to figure out why it doesn't matter. The bottom line is you're paralyzed. Sometimes you're born with it. A birth defect causes paralysis. Cerebral palsy would be an example of that causing paralysis. Again, some more severe than others. Again, it's not your fault. It came to you. But there's one other cause in Jesus' day that we know little of now simply because of modern medicine. And it was a bit of a surprise to me when I first read this. It kind of feels like it's coming out of left field, but it's syphilis. It's weird. Syphilis, as most of you know, a sexually transmitted disease, but we have medication for that now that pretty much eliminates at least the symptoms. I'm not a doctor. I don't remember if that's curable or not, but completely curable or not, but it's pretty curable, and it's caused by multiple sex partners quite often. But in Jesus' day, there was no treatment for that, and when syphilis is allowed to run its course, it can paralyze you. So maybe that's why this guy is paralyzed. We don't really know. We don't know. There are some things we can speculate on, and I don't know if it's worth doing this or not, but I suspect that his paralysis came on later in life, whether it be through syphilis or some sort of accident, because in that culture, there was very little help for paralyzed people. Today we have even medical things and kind of machinery, wheelchairs that help paralyzed people to become mobile. In those days, if you were paralyzed, you had maybe a cot. And if you had a family or you had friends who cared for you, they would take you and carry you. Otherwise, you would lay in your own waist and die. Bottom line, we don't know why he was paralyzed. He just was. might be his fault, might not be his fault might be because of sin, might be because he bought a cheap ladder nothing to do with his sin we just don't know why he's paralyzed but that wouldn't have stopped some people who lived in Capernaum where this is taking place from thinking that they knew why he was paralyzed because the assumption in Capernaum about any kind of sickness disease paralysis or trouble in life generally was that trouble in life generally was God's judgment for sin and it was always the case and it didn't just have to be the kind of cause and effect relationship you see from syphilis having an effect in your body if you fell off a ladder and you fell off a ladder in Capernaum and became paralyzed the assumption would be you know a lot of people fall off ladders and don't get paralyzed. The assumption in Capernaum would be that if you got paralyzed, God's getting you. People who live in Capernaum are pretty sure they know why people are suffering. Probably get in trouble for using this example, but that's okay. I've been in trouble before. Pat Robertson was in the news this week. Pretty sure, pretty sure, pretty sure he knows why Ariel Sharon had a stroke. Let me tell you something. He's a brother. God bless him. Pat Robertson lives in Capernaum. Lots of people do. See, these stories aren't just 2,000-year-old stories. These stories live, and the characters all live. We saw this same dynamic a few weeks ago when we were dealing with the leopard. Do you remember that? whose disease was believed to be the physical manifestation of his sin. And people showed how holy they were in dealing with peril or leprous people by how far they stayed away from them because his physical leprosy was, everyone thought, the manifestation of the real condition of his heart. And we don't know what his sin is, but it's obviously bad and ugly. Because again, spiritual people proved how spiritual they were by staying away. That's why Jesus was so confrontational when he reached out and touched that guy. Even the disciples had this way of thinking. When they saw a blind man one day, they asked Jesus this question because it was based on an assumption. Who sinned? They asked Jesus. That this man should be blind. Was it his sin? Was it his fault? Or was it his parents? Jesus said, neither. You guys are missing the point entirely, but their assumption was that there's a cause for his trouble, a cause for his paralysis, and we know what it is, sin. It's just so nice to know, isn't it? I just love knowing. Job's friends did the same thing, Eliphaz, Zophar, and Bildad. When Job got paralyzed with grief, There's a lot of different ways to be paralyzed. When he was paralyzed with pain and the loss of his family and the loss of his health, the assumption on the part of Job's friends was this, must be sin. Not sure what you did, Job, but it must have been a whopper. Because you got lots of trouble. And along with that, there comes this strange kind of arrogance that if I don't have trouble and I'm not paralyzed, I must have done it right. I must not have any sin. All of which means that in addition to the physical pain and humiliation of this guy's paralysis, there is this sense that he lives with, maybe unspoken, but it's this sense, I deserve this. So not only is he paralyzed, he feels vaguely guilty for being so. You know, it's really hard for people who feel vaguely guilty for the trouble they have to ask for help. Because they deserve it. Maybe I'm paying for this. I'll just have to pay the whole thing. Let me ask you some questions. Just, again, get your mind around this and hopefully confuse you even more. I love doing that, by the way, because I'm confused most of the time. I just want you to join me here. Is this guy a sinner? He's a sinner. Capernaum, he's a sinner. Is this? Is he a sinner? Some of us want to go, no, no. Yes, he is a sinner. Don't wonder about that. The guy who's paralyzed is a sinner. Next question. Are you? Don't talk back to me. No, I love it when you talk back to me. I just notice it because you hardly ever do. Are you a sinner? Yes. Now, put this together. Here's another question. If people who are paralyzed physically, emotionally, spiritually, are that way because of sin. The question isn't anymore why are they paralyzed. The question is why aren't you? How come you're walking around? No sin? Is it because your sin isn't as bad? Is there an assumption that you must have done it right? Never say that, but maybe somewhere in there. Let me ask the question again. Is this guy a sinner? Don't wonder about that. Yes. Just like me. And just like you. But not everybody who falls off a ladder ends up paralyzed. And what that tells me is that that could be me on that cot. In fact, if I'm entirely honest and just kind of interact in any level of life in a real way and understand that there's a lot of different ways to be paralyzed, here's the other truth. Everybody gets paralyzed once in a while. Everybody ends up on this cot once in a while. and if you end up paralyzed there's a level at which there's a point at which it doesn't matter why you're there is it your fault? is it not your fault? at some point it doesn't matter why you need some friends who will bring you to Jesus it doesn't matter why you know this reminds me a little bit of we had an announcement today I was so excited to see the money coming in for our age project and our sanctuary project and there's just things that happen in church you don't know about. We don't need to tell you everything. But it was interesting a couple years ago when we first started this AIDS project, just the vast majority of people, you, said yes to this thing as Steve Hansen, our global outreach pastor, brought it. But there's just stuff. There are people who didn't, we had a number of emails from people who didn't like it that we were gonna minister to people who had AIDS. And more than once, the reason was, was they deserve it. They got AIDS. It's because of sin. And particularly the families we were trying to help in sub-Saharan Africa, Steve was able to say, they don't deserve it. They are kids. Particularly the ones we're missing to are kids. But after it's all said and done, it doesn't matter why they're paralyzed. Yes, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. They're paralyzed. You know what you do with people who are paralyzed? You help them. Isn't it odd how many Christians don't think that way? It's just weird to me. Let's look now to four friends. Matthew 9, verse 2, and Jesus seeing their faith. Seeing their faith. Stop right there. Let me ask you a question. How do you see faith? This on the surface, that's an odd question. Odd. There it is. the answer to the question is very simple you already know it he saw it by what they what did let me break this down a little bit the operative words relative to the faith that Jesus saw I thought of three one is this their faith was active they physically moved they acted. There's not a lot of talk involved in what they did, this demonstration of faith that Jesus saw. If they said anything at all, I mean, we don't know for sure they said nothing, but if they did say anything, it wasn't worth noting because it wasn't recorded, and it certainly wasn't what Jesus noticed. It doesn't say, and hearing their demands, Jesus, it says, and seeing their faith. What they were doing is what communicated to Jesus that they had faith. It was silent. Now, I'm by that not saying, I am not saying by that, that faith doesn't speak. What I would like you to consider about this, however, is this. I think sometimes we talk way too much. And here I am talking. Hypocrite. I'll quit talking as soon as I'm done. I think we talk too much about what we say we believe and what we say we're going to do. I don't think it's an accident that in the Matthew 8 and 9 text that we're spending most of our time these weeks in the middle of Matthew 8, remember the scribe comes to Jesus right in the middle of all this healing stuff, and he talks. He makes a big declaration, the kind of thing that sells well in church. I will follow you wherever you go. And Jesus says, great. Just understand, foxes have holes, birds have nests, and a man doesn't have a place to lay his head. So if you follow me, you're going to have to leave your comfort and security. Get in the boat and follow me. I told you a few weeks ago, the guy disappeared in the white space between the verses. I think we talk too much. I will serve the Lord. Sounds so good on a Sunday night. I will, I'll go forward. I pledge, I commit. I'm glad you're going to commit. I'm glad you're going to serve. Shut up and serve. Now, I know I'm going to have some mom come up to me and go, Pastor Dave, I'm trying to teach my children not to say shut up. and then you're up there staying set up. I just need to tell you something. My sermons are PG-15. So, kids, don't say shut up. I think we talk too much about what we say we believe, what we say we're going to do. I have a friend, one of my best friends, He's in a community group, a covenant group with some people, and they're doing life together. One of the things he told me, he says, Dave, we've even come up with this little phrase in our group because we can tell, and I know you're going to resonate with this because you've experienced this very thing. We can tell sometimes when we're getting down into some real issues in our lives, and we will spin to it, and we'll talk and talk and talk and talk, and round and round and round we go, and it feels real good. And one day, somebody said, you know, we need to quit talking and pray. And the little phrase of our whole group became, shut up and pray. Shut up and serve. Shut up and give. Quit talking. Their faith was active. If they said anything at all, because it doesn't matter what they said. Third thing about their faith was it was inventive. They cut a hole in the roof. I mean, I think that's creative. and they figured out how to do it all by themselves. They had this friend. They wanted to get to Jesus. They couldn't get in. How do we do it? Let's go to a seminar. He'll tell us how to bring people to Jesus. No. I'm not saying don't go to seminars. I'm not saying that. This is tough. It's like I want to say, figure it out. They figured it out all by themselves. Again, no seminar to attend. They had no book to read on how to bring people to Jesus. No one was laying it all out for them. If this happens, do that. If that happens, do this. Now, wait. Step number two, we're going to do 12 weeks on this, but step number two is cut a hole in the roof. Not always. No, no, here's the deal. They figured it out. Anyone know? I'm going to say, you can too. but in order to figure it out yourself there needs to be some dynamics at work inside of you that I think were at work inside these guys too that I've thought of and they were these number one they believed that Jesus could heal paralyzed people and number two they loved paralyzed people and it's out of those two dynamics not out of somebody tell them first you do this, then you do this. No, no. No, their creativity, their inventiveness came out of those two things. They believe, we believe that if we could get our friend to Jesus, Jesus heals paralyzed people, and we love paralyzed people. Let me make it even a little more practical and real. I don't necessarily think they loved every paralyzed person in the whole wide world. They had a friend who was paralyzed, And they believe Jesus heals paralyzed people. And that was the impetus or what gave birth to their creativity. Here's my question. Do you? Do I what? Do you believe Jesus heals paralyzed people? And do you love anybody who's paralyzed? And the first answer from most church people, don't you want to just go, I believe. I have an invitation right now. I believe. I care. Shh. Shh. Just be quiet. Here's a hard question around what we believe or don't believe. Is when was the last time you brought someone to Jesus? Bringing people to Jesus. This is not an advanced course. This is basic kingdom living. Just bringing people to Jesus. By the way, it doesn't say bring them to church. Now, I hope when you come to church and when you bring your friends to church, they have an encounter with Jesus. But let me tell you something that frightens me as a pastor, especially as I consider the vision God's given us, and I've been talking over and over. If you've been with us these weeks, one of the things we're talking about over and over where the gifts of the Spirit really need to happen and where this healing ministry needs to happen and where the kingdom really needs to be displayed is not in this room, it's out there. But the concern I have for the church, not just ours, but for the church in general is that for many people, the only tool they have in their toolbox for bringing people to Jesus is to bring them to church because they have no sense of their own life-giving capacity. How many of you know you can do this? these four guys weren't Phi Beta Kappas they weren't seminary grads how many of you know that in you by the life of Christ in you you have more life giving potential than you know bring your friends to church I'm not saying don't do that but how many of you know that you can pray and you can love and you can touch and coming from you can be life that is reproduced in other people. I have a picture of the church. It came to me this week in some ways that I don't have time to go into, but the picture is this, and it's not just of our church, it's the church, but ours is included, and the picture is of two. It's two pictures. One is of a 13-year-old girl, and the characteristic of a 13-year-old girl that fits this picture I have is that a 13-year-old wonderful little girl, but a 13-year-old girl has not come into bloom yet. All the equipment is in this little girl, but she's not able to reproduce yet. I told you these sermons are PG-15. At 13, still self-absorbed. It's still kind of feed me, feed me, change my diaper, feed me, feed me, change my diaper. Now, there's nothing wrong with being a 13-year-old girl. God bless you 13-year-old girls. But if you've been a 13-year-old girl for 20 years, something's really wrong with that still incapable of producing life still have not come into bloom still have no sense of the life in you that can reproduce life something's really wrong with that something that requires healing the kind of healing that would probably begin with repentance the other picture I have this is weird on one hand I see a 13 year old girl on the other I see a menopausal woman now next week all of my illustrations are going to be about men. Do you get this picture, though? It's the same thing in a different place. This one has not come into maturity. The menopausal woman used to but doesn't anymore. Used to but doesn't anymore. And the same problem, no power to reproduce. To no sense anymore that in me is the capacity to give life and to literally give life in a way that is embodied in this thing of bringing people to Jesus. And I don't know why it's dried up. Maybe it's cynicism. Maybe it's wounding. I don't know what. But this menopausal picture needs a healing too. And maybe some of that would come with repentance and forgiveness. Just let that stir. let's move now to Jesus response to the paralytic and seeing their faith he said to the paralytic take courage my son literally you have nothing to fear that's what that means take courage in the Greek literally you have nothing to fear be the paralytic use your imagination you're on the stretcher you're being lowered you're looking straight up it's all you can see your plane of vision doesn't allow you to see anyone in the room yet All you can see is what you see straight up, the hole in the roof and the sky beyond that. You probably hear the stirring of the people in the room. Maybe even they're grumbling at this interruption, which, by the way, is your fault. As you're being lowered, I'm assuming some major questions and concerns. Some of them are very practical. Are my friends going to drop me? If they drop me, I'm in trouble. So there was an element, a significant element of risk in what he was allowing them to do. more concerned, I think, than that was he and how Jesus would receive him. How will he respond to me? Will Jesus be angry, impatient, disgusted? He might have reason to be. I just wrecked Peter's roof. What do you think you're doing, guy? We're right in the middle of a meeting here. You interrupted my talk. And who's going to fix the roof, pal? You? You're paralyzed. First response from Jesus to this man, you have nothing to fear. Take courage, my friend, which now that you kind of enter into being on the cot and imagining how he might feel, would minister to you. Second response, your sins are forgiven. Why would he say that? Three possibilities. He was a sinner, just like you, and just like me. The second possibility that he said your sins are forgiven is because he lived in Capernaum, where the assumption was sickness is a judgment on, God's judgment on your sin, and Jesus in him saying your sins are forgiven, in some way may be saying to this guy as he's being lowered, first thing I want to do with you is remove that from you. Forgive your sin. Even if it's true that you're paralyzed because of sin, I'm going to remove that right now. It's not anymore. Third possibility as to why Jesus said your sins are forgiven is because he was a sinner. Not generally a sinner like you and I are, but specifically experiencing a consequence in his body for his sin. Syphilis would fit into that analogy. With those things in mind, get back on the stretcher. You're being lowered. You hear the crowd. Whatever rumbling is going on in the crowd you know is your fault. The first thing you see is Jesus. The first words you hear are, Take courage, my friend. Friend? Friend. He called me friend? He must not see my sin. Next phrase, your sins. Ah! He sees them. I'm busted. Get me out of here. Next phrase, are forgiven. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm confused. I'm entirely confused. He sees my sin. He knows my sin. He doesn't ignore it. He isn't blind to it. See, till this very moment, that was his best hope, that Jesus wouldn't see his sin, that he wouldn't care about his sin. Turns out he does care about sin. Turns out he does see his sin, but he doesn't condemn him in his sin. He forgives his sin. I'm healed. turns out he was right he was healed body and soul because there's more than one way to be sick and there's more than one way to be healed and there's more than one way to be paralyzed I want to close this sermon, and I don't know how, but that's not exactly true because I do know how. What I want to do is bring you to Jesus as we close. And in just a moment, we're going to have the prayer team, whoever's here on the prayer team, to come and take your place in the front. And I'm going to ask your prayer team to position yourself in a place. Don't go back in here. Stay up front so you're easy to get to. But for those who need prayer, I just want you to ask yourself some questions. So you can even determine whether or not you're somebody who needs to come for prayer. The questions would be these. In what ways are you sick? In what way are you paralyzed? right now? In what way do you need healing? And what part of your healing might involve the need for forgiveness? In what part of your healing might involve the need for repentance? I want you to stand. As I'm talking right now, I want whoever's on the prayer team in this service, this is kind of a random thing. We don't know who's here from the prayer team, but to come right now while I'm talking and take your place up front. And again, don't stay kind of up in the front. In just a moment, I'm going to dismiss you, and you will be dismissed, so there's not going to be a whole lot of waiting for people to come forward. If you want prayer as people are dismissed, you just come this way and be prayed for. And I want to say some things to the prayer team and to you at the same time. These people aren't your healers. Jesus is our healer. These, in ways that this sermon allows us to illustrate more graphically than maybe other times, their responsibility is just to bring you to Jesus. And we feel very confident that they can do that. And you may be looking at faces here that you don't know, and it's weird. I don't talk to them. I don't even know them. They will bring you to Jesus. And one way to do that is in prayer. Let's pray. I'm going to pray for our prayer team. Holy Spirit, I pray for these, the prayer ministry people. First of all, they are the people who have the ropes in their hands. And I pray in your name that you would give them, without striving, just a deep sense of confidence that they, in prayer, not because they have all sorts of words. In fact, I pray you just kind of deliver us from being real wordy right now. But that they can initiate by inviting your spirit. A meeting between people who may be paralyzed, who maybe need to repent. A meeting between them and Jesus. Holy Spirit, fill them for this task. Anoint them for this task. And I pray for the men and women who, in a variety of ways this morning, may be sick and need to be brought to Jesus. In a variety of ways who may be paralyzed and need to be brought to Jesus. I pray for those who may be very aware as well that part of their paralysis is because of their sin and they need to repent. I pray, I pray that the power of the Lord would be present to heal. I pray that in Jesus name Amen You are dismissed God bless you as you leave I'm going to ask you to leave
