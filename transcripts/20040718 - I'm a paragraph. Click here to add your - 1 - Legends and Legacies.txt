So let's pray. Jesus, that your kingdom would come. That heaven might come to earth in this room this morning. That we might learn to live the life that you brought, Jesus. in your name I pray amen well a few years back I went to my 10 year high school class reunion and I was kind of debating at the time whether I should do that or not and I decided to go and me and a couple buddies who haven't moved far from home headed to the 10 year class reunion and we walked into that big ballroom and I saw all my old high school friends. They were shocked I was working at a church. That's an understatement. And I looked over to the left and there was this little table and there was this little sign that said, in memory of. And there were pictures of all of the people in our graduating class that have died. and I looked at this picture of Stephanie Ladela and I remembered her and remembered her smile and her love of life and her legacy. And then I looked next to her and there was this guy by the name of Joe Shuler. And when I saw his picture, I was totally shocked. I had no idea that Joe Shuler had died. I had known him a little bit in high school, and I just was blown away that he had passed away, and I didn't really know what to do. And so I just started to ask people, did you guys know that Joe Shuler had died? And we started talking about this at the reunion, and no one had really known that he had died. And someone had said that they had heard something, that he had died in Europe, and it was kind of a strange accident. And so people began to talk about Joe Shuler, about what they remembered from his life, about his legacy, about how he lived. And as the reunion went on, we were doing some dancing and had some food and conversation went on. And I kid you not, I looked out the right side of my eye and here comes Joe Shuler walking through the door. He was alive! He wasn't dead! And people started yelling, he's risen, he is risen. It was like the Lord had risen and Jesus was back and Joe was alive. And people started to freak out. I never experienced anything like it. You know, you kind of want to experience something like that, someone raising from the dead, you know. And this was as close as I've ever gotten to it. It was amazing. And Joe came in and saw the reactions. People are hugging him and kissing him and, you know, slobbering all over him. And he looks to the left, and he sees this table, and he sees this picture, and it says, in memory of Joe Shuler. I wonder what went through his mind. I wonder if he just started reflecting on his life. Wow, how quickly it goes. I'm dead. is this a dream? I don't know everyone thought he was dead but he was alive and I think the sad thing is is that some people are dead even though they're alive yes their heart is still beating and they're still breathing but there's no sign of a fullness of life, of a supernatural kind of life, of a real God-sized life, of the kind of life Jesus talks about in John 10, 10 where he says, I've come to bring you life and life in all of its fullness, not an average or a mediocre or the mundane routine-driven life that so often I settle for the forgettable life, but a fullness of life, a life of great adventure and passion and risk connected to the supernatural purpose of God for their lives that frees them from paralyzing fear and unending hopelessness and ceaseless self-obsession and relentless anxiety, that kind of life, The kind of life that Jesus talks about in John 7, 38, streams of living water kind of life. That life that flows from within you, that wells up, that brings you life and love and joy and peace and a supernatural kind of life. The life that Jesus brought through his death. That's the life I'm talking about. That's the life I want to live. That's the life I want to give my one and only life to. It's why I love Hebrews chapter 11 so much where it lists the spiritual legends of the past that inspire me in the present to move in a way that would inspire others to move in a way of great adventure and passion for God. So let's read some of these spiritual legends about their life, about their legacy. Hebrews chapter 11, God gave his approval to people in the days of old by their faith. It was by faith that Enoch was taken up to heaven without dying. It was by faith that Noah built an ark to save his family from the flood. It was by faith that Abraham obeyed when God called him to leave. It was by faith that Sarah was able to have a child. It was by faith that Joseph, when he was about to die, confidently spoke of God's bringing the people out of Egypt and gave his instructions about his bones. It was by faith that Moses left the land of Egypt, kept right on going because he kept his eyes on the one who is invisible. It was by faith that Rahab the prostitute did not die with all the others in her city who refused to obey God. Well, how much more do I need to say? It would take too long to recount the stories of the faith of Gideon and Samson and David and Samuel and all the other prophets. But others trusted God and were tortured, preferring to die rather than turn from God and be free. They placed their hope in the resurrection to a better life. Not one of these, even though their lives of faith were exemplary, got their hands on what was promised. God had a better plan for us. They didn't see Jesus. We saw Jesus. They were on the front side of the cross. We stand on the back side of the cross. That their faith and our faith would come together. to make one complete whole, their lives of faith not complete apart from ours. Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith. a list of the spiritual legends of faith and one sentence about their legacy. I have come to love this image of all the legends of the past cheering us on in the present as we run this race of faith that somehow these people from the past are supernaturally connected to us in this room in the present. This great cloud of witnesses that in their death took a front row seat in the heavenly realm and now cheer us on as we run the race of faith. That just gets me fired up to think of that scene. this great cloud of witnesses that calls us to throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and fix our eyes on Jesus, who is the way and the truth and the life. Our life of faith coming together with their life of faith as the story of God moves from generation to generation. It reminds me of being at the closing ceremonies Of the Olympics in Salt Lake City And watching this huge stadium Filled with thousands of spectators Cheering the athletes on As they walked into the stadium People yelling words of encouragement And inspiration To those who are still in the game Well in the same way the spiritual legends of the past fill the heavenly stadium and cheer words to us of inspiration and encouragement to waste your one and only life on the God who gave you life. People like Noah and Abraham and Sarah and David and others who are not mentioned in the Bible cheer us on in that great cloud of witnesses. This passage has just got me reflecting on who that cloud of witnesses is for me, who the spiritual legends are in my life that have cheered me on in my faith. It's got me thinking about what my legacy will be when it's all said and done. what will I waste my one and only life on? So I would just like to share with you this morning who's in my cloud of witnesses. And in the end, I'd love for us to reflect on our legacies. That maybe this morning you might begin to identify who's in your cloud of witnesses. Who are those folks cheering you on? and that you might begin to think about your legacy, what you want to waste your one and only life on. Well, the first person in my cloud of witnesses is Joseph. Joseph's father, Jacob, loved Joseph more than all of his other sons. All of Joseph's brothers resented him for being his father's favorite, So much so that at the age of 17, they sold him into slavery after Joseph made the big mistake of sharing his God dream with them. Joseph's life in Egypt was filled with moments of incredible pain and suffering and moments of incredible exhilaration and success. He was a shepherd who became a slave, then a convict who became a ruler. but all throughout his life the little choices he made regardless of the circumstances that surrounded him built for him a divine legacy and in the end his one and only life pointed to his deep trust in God but what I consider to be the most fascinating thing about Joseph's life is his death so let's look at the end of the book of Genesis and just read the final statements that Joseph gives us about his life Joseph stayed in Egypt along with all his father's family he lived 110 years then Joseph said to his brothers I am about to die but God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham Isaac and Jacob and Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath and said God will surely come to your aid and then you must carry my bones up from this place so Joseph died at the age of 110 and after they embalmed him they placed him in a coffin in Egypt Joseph did something here that's totally unusual had never been done absolutely out of context and out of the tradition of his time. He did something here that we would call just a little bit nuts. He calls his family together and he tells them he's about to die and you would expect him to follow the traditions of his family and give them instructions to bury him with the rest of his family and where they are buried. Instead, Joseph does something dramatically different and beyond expectation, he asks not to be buried. For them to keep his bones and carry them until they're delivered out of Egypt. So instead of saying, bury me next to my father Jacob and his father Isaac and his father Abraham, instead of saying, bury me at the place where all of my ancestors and family are, Joseph says, don't bury me, but instead carry me until you are delivered out of the land, into the land that God has promised you, and then you can bury me. I think this final sentence from Joseph is one of my favorite scenes in all of his life. Because you would expect in some ways, when Joseph dies, that his dream would die. But that's not how it worked with Joseph. This dream receiver turned into a dream releaser. Joseph was passing on God's dream to the next generation, symbolically through his bones. The dream would not die with Joseph because the dream was connected to something bigger than Joseph. So why would Joseph do such a strange thing? Well, I think Joseph wanted his death to point to the dream of God. That Joseph wanted his death and his bones to be pointed directly at God. The God of promises, the God of faithfulness, the God of dreams that was continuing on through the generations and would not die when Joseph died. In the end, Joseph's life simply pointed people to God. That was his legacy. The second person, let me say this. I feel like in the end, I want my life to point people to God. I don't know if you're anything like me. I want to live for something bigger than myself. I want to be swept up into the grander, bigger dream of God for my life. The reason I want Joseph and my cloud of witnesses cheering me on is because I need to be reminded that divine legacies are not about me, but instead about my life pointing to the God who gave me life. So what about you? When people sit around your deathbed or talk about you at a funeral service, I wonder what your life will point to. Will your life point people to God? Or when you die, will you have never truly lived? What Joseph's legacy teaches me is that I want my bones to point people to God. the second person in my cloud of witnesses is a person you probably don't know his name is Spencer Summers Spencer became a friend of mine in junior high I didn't tell him this at the time when we became friends but I became friends with him pretty much because he was in the popular group and I was kind of on the outskirts of the popular group and so my strategy was by becoming friends with a popular person I too would become popular and then I would be invited to the popular parties and then the popular parties would get me a girlfriend. That was kind of my line of thinking at the time. But our friendship quickly moved beyond my misguided motives to something much deeper. The one thing that made our friendship different is that once a week, Spence would skip a week of school and head to the hospital for his chemotherapy treatments. It was the summer going into our eighth grade year when he itched a mosquito bite on the side of his stomach and found out that it was cancer. Even though he went bald, he always would tell us, don't treat me differently. But I've got to be honest, there was just something different about Spence. His love was deeper than most. His smile was wider than most. And his laugh was always louder. even though absolutely none of the circumstances in his life would point to that kind of behavior. The speech that he gave at his graduation, at our graduation from high school, has not only taught me how to live, but it's taught me how I want to die. Spencer gave this speech just months before he would join the heavenly realm of the great cloud of witnesses. And to this day, I can still hear his voice cheering me on with his words that have sunk into the deep places of my heart. He spoke these words at graduation. I hope I've taught you how precious each day is, Spence said. I guess I used to think of life as a long highway. I pictured myself in an old Mustang convertible with the top down, the wind blowing through my hair, and a pair of black Ray-Bans on, listening to classic rock and roll. I was just cruising along at what I thought at the time to be an endless road. I, however, got stuck with a faulty engine, And it forced me to stop cruising and to pull over onto the shoulder and start walking. And it was once I started walking that I began to see all that was only a colorful blur before. And once I began to walk, the wind didn't blow through my hair because I didn't have any. And instead of the music of the Beatles, it was the songs of the birds and the crickets to be heard. But once I started to walk and once I took off my shades, I began to see things clearly for the first time. I began to see that success should not be measured by grades or dollar signs, but by how often you laugh and how many people you can make smile in a day. I began to see that once you are at peace with God, peace with your fellow man comes as well as peace with yourself. and I began to see that our earthly highway not only has plenty of detours and potholes but it isn't nearly as long as I once thought. Now at graduation, when your futures are burning so brightly, you hear phrases like you have your whole life ahead of you. To those, I argue, you have had your whole life and all you have is today. so when you feel like your life is going too fast or you're just cruising along pull over onto the shoulder or exit on the nearest ramp and start walking start seeing what you're missing and better yet start laughing at all those stressful sports cars zipping by because in a very marginal pun if you're in the fast lane, the passing lane you're not in the right lane once we stop looking up the road for peace and satisfaction and start looking around for it, that's when it will come. I will never forget the phone call I received my freshman year of college from Spence. I heard his voice on the other side of the phone and it became evident to me that his voice was weakening. He told me really clearly that he was dying and he didn't want me to be sad. and as I started to cry I'll never forget his final sentence to me he said over the phone in kind of a quivery voice Kurt, Jesus is the answer and with those words we said our goodbye to one another and it's those words that have continued to penetrate into the deep places of my soul. You see, at the time I didn't know Jesus. But it was several months later that I decided to follow Jesus. And I've often wished I could go back and talk with Spence about my new relationship with Jesus. I understand what you were talking about, Spence. But those conversations will have to wait until heaven. And so for now, I hear his voice in that great cloud of witnesses cheering me on to give my one and only life to Jesus. And hearing his final words, Jesus is the answer. So if Joseph's legacy points me to God, then Spence's legacy points me to life in Jesus. my prayer is that my legacy would also point people to life in Jesus so what about yours the third person in my cloud of witnesses is my mom she was my spiritual soulmate she was the single greatest inspiration in my walk with Jesus she also died eight years ago after a long battle with breast cancer her legacy is best described in this story about a month before she was she would die she called one of the pastors from our church and she said that she wanted to plan her funeral service and so she went over to the funeral home with the pastor and she walked into that big room with all the caskets and she picked out her casket and she said she didn't care about the outside of the casket what she said is that she wanted a casket with a really big pillow because she was really tired from her battle with cancer and and really wanted to sleep for the first couple years of heaven and then she walked in and planned her funeral service and where she wanted to be buried and how she wanted to be buried, who she wanted to carry her casket. And when she died, we went into the funeral home, and my brother and my sister and my dad, my dad's kind of a pretty straightforward accountant, so what was about to come was way over the top for him. The man that helped her plan the funeral started to talk about her plans and what she wanted. And then he got to this spot and he kind of hesitantly looked down and he looked up and he said, she wants a white hearse and she wants you to paint it. And my dad was like, we were kind of like, what? She wants you to paint a hearse with balloons and your fingerprints. She wants you to paint the hearse with scripture, like to live is Christ and to die is gain. Pray hard, life's short. She wanted us to write on it. And so after the wake, we went down into the bottom of this funeral home. It was the strangest experience in my life. And there was this white hearse that they had to borrow from another funeral home that was parked in the garage basement. You know, it's kind of a creepy place to begin with, And this was kind of strange and getting stranger. And all of her friends and the family gathered around this white hearse. And we put our handprints on it and we painted balloons. And we wrote this scripture, to live is Christ and to die is gain. And then on the back door, in bold letters, she wanted us to write, I'm with Jesus. And I can't tell you the reaction from the people on the way from the church to the cemetery. As we drove by and through neighborhoods on the way to Lakewood Cemetery, people were shocked and grabbing people out of their houses and pointing. And what they were pointing to was Jesus. To live is Christ. To die is gain. when we got to Lakewood Cemetery she had necklaces made for us it has my name on it and I flip it over and it says my love will always be with you I can often sense her love and if I try really hard I can feel her loving hug and there is no doubt I can still hear her voice saying, I love you, Kurt. She cheers me on now from that great cloud of witnesses. So if Joseph's legacy pointed me to God and Spencer's legacy pointed me to life in Jesus, then my mom's legacy points me to radical and relentless love. I am praying that my legacy will be about that same love. So what about yours? Who are the spiritual legends in your life? What will your legacy become? When it's all said and done, what will people say about your one and only life? As I was walking through a bookstore the other day, I came across this book, and it's written by Larry King. And it's a book called Remember Me When I'm Gone. And what he did is had famous people write about what they wanted their one-sentence legacy to be, what they wanted to be remembered for. And the book's just filled with them. Arnold Schwarzenegger, he just said that his one-sentence legacy is, I had fun. Jack Carter, his one-sentence legacy was, or he wants it to be, I told you I was sick. I thought that was kind of funny. Just to lighten it up, this has kind of been a heavy service. Tommy Hilfinger, an all-American classic designer who brought class to the masses. Donald Trump a man of great vision who was filled with many dreams who loved his family and was loyal to his friends Patch Adams don't remember me when I'm gone remember to serve the cause of peace and justice and care when you're gone what do you think your one sentence legacy will be I've been thinking about this for me and I'm not sure if I'm living this I know I want to be living this but if I were to sum up my one sentence legacy it would be that I would be a passionate follower of Jesus with both my words and my life if I could sum it up that's what I would want my one sentence legacy to be and for us in this room there might be a gap between what we want to be and what the reality is today and so maybe we need to do some gap adjustment and some life adjustment in that i know i have to do it all the time and so as we close tonight or today i think it would be a very cool thing if we could begin to reflect on what our legacy will be, what we want our one sentence legacy to be, how people will remember us when we're gone, what our lives will point to. And so as Stephan comes up and I pray, we're just going to ask you to reflect on that, who the spiritual legends are in your life, And what is your one sentence legacy? And Stephan's just going to play a song and give you a chance to think that through and pray that through. And then we're going to sing four more songs. And at any time, I would love for you to come up and there's boards in the back and there's boards up front and back here. And I would love for you just to write that one sentence legacy that you want to be remembered for. And I want you to look around at the other sentences that are on the board and look around at the great cloud of witnesses that is around you and be inspired to live the kind of life that Jesus came and died to give you. And so my prayer and my hope is that we could just come up to these boards and it could become a mosaic of legacies about God and Jesus and maybe you're not ready to even write one and you just want to come up and be inspired by the words on the board, feel free to do that as well. So as we move into that, join with me as I pray. Jesus, like Joseph, I pray that our bones and our life would point to life in you. And we thank you, Jesus, for going to great lengths, to great sacrifices, to bring us life in all of its fullness. May each of us step into the supernatural purpose that God has for our lives, that we would move from the mundane to the miraculous and step into the movement of God for our lives. Pray that that would be so here today with Church of the Open Door. Amen. Amen.
