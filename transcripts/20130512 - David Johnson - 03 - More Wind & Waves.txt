Reviewer: Denise RQ On Mother's Day especially, I'm well aware that my words fall on a wide array of emotion, from celebration to grief and to every combination in between. So please know today, no matter what your story is, no matter your age, no matter your gender even, no matter if the children you hold are in your heart or in your arms or in the work of your hands, these words are aimed to bless the human heart. Don't be shy in receiving what might be for you today. So a little story to begin. Last year on Mother's Day, I shared with you a poem that I had written called The House of God. And in the time right after that, there was one line from that poem that seemed to want to live on in me. And the line was, when you stand exposed by the limits of being human. And it began to manifest itself in me in a way that tortured me, really, at first. It was this question that I kept asking myself. I kept asking, how do I stand up under the weight of affecting generations to come with my mistakes? My successes, my failures, my healed and not healed self. Thankfully, over time, the question became broader and gentler. And instead I began to ask, when the work is deeply meaningful, when we know we will not complete it, or do it to perfection, or do it like anybody else, how do we find the courage, the hope, the energy to walk into it anyway? And from there I began to ask, what does God do when we encounter our limits and our fragility? in the end I just realized how very human it is to feel at times like life is asking more of us than we have and more of us than we are to feel that life is big and ourselves small in the face of it to feel that what is in front of us is important but somehow we aren't doing it or can't do it or it's too hard and with that understanding came this desire simply to bless humanness today I don't have a complete answer to any of those questions that I've been asking but what I want to do is share with you what I have heard as I have wrestled and listened so receive this blessing repeat these words to yourself I am good I belong I am called Today you can accept That from beginning to end We are all light and dark Like those who went before you And those who come after you Everyday human Not the whole picture Not the whole story And not meant to be You were made to be one person With something to contribute to the whole And it is time Time to own that you are here now Own your gifts Own your shadows Your insecurity and maturity Your true capacity, its expanse and its limits Your place because no one can be what you are here to be. So listen to me. Take yourself off the hook. Do it now. The meat hook, the fish hook, go back to the field and back to the water. Get yourself out from under the microscope. Sit up, jump down, be moved to a spacious place. Leave the room where you sit under the juror's gaze. Stand up, walk out, and return to your home. And arrive there hearing the voice of God saying, Just rest, daughter. Just rest, son. You are good. You belong. You are called. I am giving you all you need to do the work I have for you. You don't have to be enough You don't have to be something for everyone You just need to do what I am asking you to do You are exactly who I need you to be For the tasks that are yours I am not afraid to watch you walk out your calling Along this unfamiliar path I will lead you gently I will gather you in arms that can hold severity doesn't serve knowing how is not your savior worry doesn't guard the sacred future put down those heavy bricks I will complete this I am carrying this all will be well and in answer you say the only thing you can say here I am I will give myself I will do it as me and you hear back what you most need to hear here am I here I am yours and God's simultaneous and then you will be able to say what you most need to say children I honor the life of God in you. Repeat these words with me. I am good. I belong. I am called. Today's reading is from Acts chapter 4, verses 13 through 21. Now as they observed the confidence of Peter and John and understood that they were uneducated and untrained men, they were amazed and began to recognize them as having been with Jesus. And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply. But when they had ordered them to leave the council, they began to confer with one another, saying, What shall we do with these men? For the fact that a noteworthy miracle has taken place through them is apparent to all who live in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. But so that it will not spread any further among the people, let us warn them to speak no longer to any man in this name. And when they had summoned them, they commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God, you be the judge. For we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard. When they had threatened them further, they let them go, finding no basis on which to punish them on account of the people, because they were all glorifying God for what had happened. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. And so, it continues. In the text that Jenny just read, and what continues is this reality of life in the kingdom of God that we were introduced to a few weeks ago when we came to chapter 4. In our journey through the book that is the Acts of the Apostles, and the reality that is kind of confronting us again is this, in this story, that whenever and wherever the wind of God's Spirit begins to authentically blow, which is a very good thing, the waves of resistance inevitably begin to stir, which is a very scary thing. So you have a very good thing and a very scary thing kind of happening together. Chapters 1 through 3 of the book of Acts, we experience nothing but wind. The wind being, I think you know, the literal and figurative expression of the undeniable supernatural manifestation of God's Spirit among His people. So the wind of God is blowing. It's a very good thing. began, as you know, this blowing of the wind of God's Spirit at Pentecost. In Acts chapter 2, when the closing with power that Jesus had referred to as the promise of the Father had arrived in the form of the Holy Spirit, indeed, it was a baptism of the Spirit and immersion into the power and fullness of the Spirit so that now under the influence of the Spirit, this guy named Peter who had been up and down and inconsistent at best, began to preach with a boldness and a confidence and an authority that he had never seen before, had never experienced before, as his words pierced the hearts of those who were listening in Acts 2, verse 47, such that 3,000 souls were coming to faith in that one day, through that one declaration of truth, And everyone, it says in Acts 2, 42, kept feeling this sense of awe as day by day, the Lord was adding to their number those who were coming to faith. So there in Acts 1 through 3 was lots of wind, lots of manifestations of the Spirit. And then when we come to chapter 3, verse 1, it's as if the wind that's already blowing begins to pick up even more. When Peter and John come to the gate of the temple, they were coming to the temple because they did it every day this time of day. And this day they saw this lame beggar who they saw there every day. But this time they got a word from God about what was going to happen. As he was begging for alms, Peter said to him this, I know you need alms, you need money to buy bread, but silver and gold have I none. I wish I did, but what I do have I'll give to you in the name of Jesus Christ. The Nazarene rise and walk, and he did rise and walk. And when he did, the people saw. And when they saw, the crowd gathered. And when the crowd gathered, Peter once again took his stand and began to preach the second sermon, the first, second Christian sermon in the book of the Acts. And when he preached, even more believed this time than the first time he preached. 5,000 this time came to faith. So the wind of God's Spirit is blowing. The gifts of God's Spirit are flowing in truly amazing ways and beyond their wildest dreams ways. But you can't have that much wind moving of God's Spirit in positive ways without some waves, without some resistance to that movement of God's Spirit. And here they come. The waves of resistance stirred up by the wind of God's Spirit. When in Acts chapter 4 verse 1, it says this, that as they were speaking to the people, they being Peter and John, the priest and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees as well, came upon them, being greatly disturbed by them, so they laid their hands on them and threw them in jail. And all of that is what three weeks ago I described to you as this uncomfortable truth, this inevitable truth, this recurring theme that I believe we need to see and understand. It's why we're kind of sitting on this in the early part of Acts, because we need to see and understand it in the early part of this story, I think, because all through the book of Acts, we are going to find ourselves in this story, thus making this dynamic an important one to understand. And this dynamic of which I speak, this uncomfortable truth, this recurring theme is simply this, that the wind and the waves go together. You cannot have one without the other case in points, Peter and John. In Acts chapter 4, who are having what could arguably be called, I think, some of their best days of ministry life with the baptism of the Spirit in Acts chapter 2, the power to preach that Peter had never had before, thousands believing, all that kind of one time, the lame man is walking and everyone is feeling a sense of awe. There's this incredible sense of momentum, but right in the middle, and this is the key, it's right in the middle. It isn't just a good day and then a bad day. It's right in the middle of all of these things, of all the good stuff, with some really bad stuff and scary stuff, which means that they were experiencing, like some of you do, and it's very confusing when we do. They were experiencing some of their best days and some of their worst days on some of the same days, which can be quite confusing. We kind of think a good day is a good day and a bad day is a bad day. When you have a good day and a bad day on the same day, it can throw you off a bit if you don't understand this uncomfortable truth, this inevitable truth, this recurring theme that the wind and the waves come together. You can't have one without the other, all of which means, among other things, this, that sometimes, not always, But sometimes the turmoil you sense this time, the trouble you're in this time, the conflict you feel this time is this time not because you did it wrong. Sometimes it is because we did it wrong, but this time it's not because you did it right. Because maybe this time you're feeling the turmoil, trouble, and conflict because you did it right. you told the truth. You broke the silence. You quit pretending and denying. You brought out into the light what had been hidden in the dark about your marriage and your motives and the condition of your own soul and your own heart. And when you did bring out into the light that thing you'd been hiding in the dark, the first thing that happened was maybe what you feared most. We've talked about this last couple of weeks because when you brought that thing you were hiding out into the light, all hell broke loose. It made you wish you'd never said it, but heaven broke loose as well as hope began to come. Healing finally was possible because with the wind come the waves. They go together. You can't have one. without the other, but that raises this question that we began to ask a few weeks ago, and I think it's a question we're going to be revisiting all through the book of Acts, actually. And it's a question, actually, that we're not asking when we're experiencing Acts 1 through 3. When the wind of God is blowing, God is blowing, and that's all that seems to be happening. There isn't resistance yet, but it is a question that happens when the wind stirs up the waves. And the question is this, when the wind stirs up the waves and the waves are kind of scary, do you still want the wind? Do you still want to follow what I would call the way of the wind, the things of the Spirit? Because this uncomfortable reality, this recurring theme of the wind and the waves being together is not going to stop recurring, particularly if you follow this way of the Spirit that we are going to see all through this story that is the book of the Acts. In fact, as we go through the book of the Acts, the intensity of this wind and waves dynamic is actually going to increase, case in point, our study today. This text today that Jenny just read a few moments ago where we have, among other things, a little more wind and a few more waves. It's just part of the deal. We need to kind of get used to that. It's part, I think, of growing up and accepting a reality of life in the kingdom of God. Let's start with the wind. The good stuff that is revealed in this text that Jenny just read, the first evidence of the wind shows up in verse 13. And the first evidence of wind is this confidence and clarity of Peter and John as they stood before these really scary people. Now, they had confidence and clarity before, did Peter, when he was preaching to a crowd. But the crowd was kind of with them. 3,000 said yes, 5,000 said yes. But now they're in front of some scary people. Chief priests, captain of the temple guard, Sadducees as well. But even in that text, they stood there with confidence and clarity. And even to these people who were not very friendly, the priests, captain of the temple guard and Sadducees as, well, it was obvious even to them. They could see it, this confidence and clarity. The text says they observed it, and it caused them to be amazed, to marvel at this, making them kind of scratch their heads at Peter and John, wondering, who are these guys? But the key to this particular gust of wind, if you will, actually was Peter. According to Acts 4, verse 8, just a few verses previous to the one we're dealing with today, it says of Peter this, that he was filled with the Holy Spirit. He was filled with the Holy Spirit. You see it there? So when he spoke, if you're full of the Holy Spirit, you may be speaking words, but something else is happening under the influence of the Spirit. What's coming out of his mouth is the wind, actually, of God, in a sense, because under the influence of the Spirit, it's more than words, mere words, when he said to them, verse 8, Rulers and elders of the people, if we are on trial today for a benefit done to a sick man, as to how this man has been made well, then let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that it was by the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene. Remember how he used this in his first sermon and his second sermon? It was in the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene. Remember him? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's coming back to you now, isn't it? You crucified him. Remember that God raised him from the dead. Remember that? Well, it was by this name, says Peter, that this man stands here before you in good health. Indeed, as long as we're talking about this name of Jesus, let me tell you this, verse 12, that there is no other name under heaven given among men by which you must be saved. He just goes off, does Peter. And it kind of makes you wonder if you're listening to Peter, where'd that come from? Where did this confidence and clarity, these words come from? Because I saw it in front of the multitude, but now again, he's in front of these people who are kind of scary, and it's still there. I think if you were Peter's friend listening to Peter say these things, you'd go, where does that come from? I think if you were Peter, you might be thinking to yourself, where is this coming from? I should be a little more timid here. These guys can hurt me. lots. Well, what's actually going on here is this. First, he is full of spirit. He's under the influence of the spirit, and under the influence of the spirit, you say things and do things you wouldn't normally do, just like if you're under the influence of wine, you say things and do things you wouldn't do, not necessarily good things. When you're under the influence, things move in a different direction. But what we're actually seeing here is something more. I just want to give you the whole picture because it's actually kind of exciting if you're kind of a Bible geek, maybe like me, because what this is, it's actually the fulfillment of a promise. And I wonder if when Peter was standing there saying these things, he's kind of thinking to himself, this is what Jesus talked about. I can't believe it. It's actually happening. And what I'm talking about is a promise that Jesus made to his disciples. Back in Luke chapter 12, when he was doing what we're kind of doing through this study early on in the book of Acts, when Jesus was trying to prepare his disciples for the reality of the wind and the waves being together. It's like we're kind of preparing you for that reality as well. When Jesus said to his disciples in Luke 12, verse 11, and when, you guys, and by the way, it's not if, but when they bring you before the synagogues and bring you before the rulers and the authorities, and there they are. Didn't think we'd be here, but here we are before these scary guys. Do not become anxious. I'm just warning you. You'll be full of the Spirit, and it's going to be scary. Do not become anxious about how or what you should speak in your defense or what you should say. Trust me on this. The Spirit of God in that moment, the Holy Spirit, will teach you in that very hour, in that moment, what you ought to say or not to say. How cool is that? And it kind of makes you wonder, Or, well, I wish that would happen to me sometimes. I wish those things that used to happen would happen now. I think they actually do. In fact, I think you've experienced these things without knowing you've experienced these things from time to time. Because the truth is this about your life, my life, their life as well. There are certain situations in life. And they come particularly when the waves are threatening. when the resistance is growing and fierce, and they are the kind of situations for which you can't prepare. Although you try, and I do too. I have a hard meeting tomorrow. I have something where I'm going to be in an awkward situation. I don't know what to expect, and so I spend a good part of the night making a speech in my head. I prepare what I want to say. It hardly ever is what I get to say. It hardly ever is what I actually say. So the only value of it is that I lose a whole night's sleep. There are situations for which you can't prepare. The promise in that situation is this, from Jesus to his disciples and to us, I'll give you what you need when you need it. As you move into that dark place. And some of you are thinking, I don't know. I've been in dark places. I'm in one now where the waves are crashing. But I'm not getting any words. I've got nothing to say. And some of those things, I know you have experienced this, because I have too, where someone asks you a question or confronts you in some way, and you think of all the things you wish you would have said on your way home. And I've had enough of those on-the-way-home experiences thinking I should have said that. When I come to realize, wait, wait, wait, wait, if the Spirit is with me, maybe the fact that I said nothing was precisely what I was supposed to say that time. Nothing. Really? Is that ever? And Jesus, before his detractors, said, what? Nothing. 1 Peter 2.23, being reviled. He reviled not again. While suffering, he uttered, no threats, so never speak. It doesn't mean that. There were other places he spoke. Here, Peter and John speak other times. Just be quiet. Just shut up. Sorry, I get a chore for saying. Shut up. Thank you. Back to Peter and John in this story, who in the moment are getting from the Spirit precisely what they need when they need it. And what that means, among other things, is this. If you're getting what you need when you need it, in that moment, the wind of God is blowing. The fact that even the priests, captain of the temple guard and Sadducees as well, could not deny. In fact, in verse 13, again, it says they were amazed. They marveled at the confidence and clarity of Peter and John. And part of what amazed them was they have confidence and clarity. And remember in verse 13, it says, being uneducated and untrained men. So they're looking at these guys a little confused and a little perplexed, trying to dial into who, again, are these guys. But then they begin to connect the dots. It says the picture, kind of you see something that's fuzzy, and all of a sudden you kind of do the focus thing, and it becomes clear who they are. When in the end of verse 13, it says that they began, kind of slowly, they began to recognize him. Ah, I know who they are. They're the guys who've been with Jesus. Which sounds like a wonderful thing to say, doesn't it? Like a compliment of sorts. Indeed, if someone said that of you or of me, I think we'd feel quite good. Honestly, that the only explanation is someone is looking at your life or looking at my life, and they kind of are kind of confused and perplexed by how you live and how you love and how you treat your spouse and how you talk to your kids, and they're kind of confused about that. And as they dial in, they go, oh, I get it. This guy, this gal, this man or woman has obviously been with Jesus. If somebody said that to me, it's clear to me, Dave, that you are with the Lord. I would go, okay, good, God. Because what it's telling you is that not only is the window of God's Spirit blowing somehow out here, it's kind of blowing somehow through you to other people. So I think it would feel good. But here's the deal about the text. You need to know, these guys, chief priests, captain of the temple guard, the Sadducees as well, they are not complimenting them here. They are closing in on them here, having just discovered a reason to despise them here, to discard them here because they finally recognize them, that is, Peter and John, as having been with Jesus. Oh, now I know what category to put them in because they hated Jesus. Remember why they hated Jesus? There might have been a number of reasons. We talked about this a couple of weeks ago. But part of the reason these chief priests, these religious leaders who had all of the external look of very pious people, they were jealous. Acts 5.17 says they were filled with jealousy toward Jesus. And now toward Peter and John. Remember why? They were jealous. Here's why. Because the authority of Jesus, and now Peter and John, because the power of Jesus, and now Peter and John, the authenticity of them and the life they had made their lack of those things, authority, power, authenticity, and life, look as weak and powerless, phony, and dead as it actually was. And for that reason, they hated Jesus because Jesus' authority, power, authenticity, and life made theirs look as pathetic as it was. His very life exposed them as having nothing of life. And now they hate Peter and John as well because they're doing the same. And finally, oh, Jesus, that's the common denominator here, which gave them a reason to discard them, which means that once again, huh, the wind moving of God's Spirit in authentic ways. And the waves, I can't stand you when you do that, are connected. They're together. You can't have one without the other, raises the question again, do you still want the wind? Do you still want this way of the wind? The question that actually gets tougher to answer as we come to verse 14 and 20 in our text this morning, verses 14 through 20, which is a fascinating piece, I think, to the story, because while the rulers here hated Peter and John the same way they hated Jesus and for the same reasons. They were actually in a tough spot. In verse 14, it says this, a lame man who had been healed is standing there. I mean, he's healed. Everybody sees it. So what are we going to do, is what they're asking in verse 16. Look at it on the screen. For the fact that a noteworthy miracle has taken place through them is apparent to everyone who lives in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it, though we would if we could, but we can't because they saw. So they do what you do. when you're trying to keep something quiet, when you're trying to keep something hidden, to keep it from spreading, they gave them what amounts to a gag order. Verse 17, let us warn them to speak no more of these things. Indeed, they commanded them not to speak in verse 18. Verse 21, they threatened them further if they did go on speaking out loud these things, which may be the first, I don't know, but may be the first biblical example of what we've called around here at Open Door for years, the no-talk rule. The no-talk rule is a rule that gets imposed in all sorts of systems, actually. And it's funny how these ancient stories all of a sudden come to life because the no-talk rule gets imposed in all sorts of systems, not just ancient biblical texts like Acts chapter 4, but the no-talk rule gets imposed in families and churches and workplaces and marriages too, where we, for whatever reason, can't talk about what's real or what's true for a number of reasons. Among the reasons we can't talk about it, and this rule, by the way, this rule is often imposed without anybody saying, you can't talk about that. Everybody just knows we don't talk about this. It gets imposed for a number of reasons. Among them is this, that the truth or what's real about our marriage or our family or our church or workplace or relationship, if that truth was known about what's really going on in there, it will make someone look bad. It will make, I don't know, us look bad. As a family, as a marriage, as a church. In Acts 4, it would have been the priests, captain of the temple guard, the Sadducees as well, who, if this reality of John's and Peter's authority and power spread even more, would make the priests, captain of the temple guard and Sadducees as well look bad. So they commended them not to speak and warned them and threatened them as well. Another reason this no-talk rule gets imposed in all sorts of systems is this, because in certain systems, church, family, whatever, the truth might threaten the order of things. Think on that. It might threaten the order of things, which is precisely, actually, what's happening in Acts chapter 4. where the powers that be and the powers that were in Acts chapter 4 were, again, the priests, the captain of the temple guard, and the Sadducees as, well, they fear something. What they fear is the loss of control. Because if this word continues to spread, people will start to follow the ways of Jesus. They'll start to follow the ways of Peter and John, which threatens, at a pretty fundamental level, the order of things in our family or marriage or workplace or church or temple system in Acts chapter 4. So you better be quiet. You better not say that, whatever that is indeed. Again, they commanded them, verse 18, and they warned them, verse 17, and when they had threatened them further, verse 21, they let him go. Why? And not why did they let him go, but why did they threaten them further? Here's why. Because the primary strategy to enforce the no-talk rule in a marriage, family, church, workplace, whatever, the primary strategy to enforce it is fear. And in the case of Peter and John, the fear was of physical punishment and pain. Indeed, in chapter 5, verse 40, that fear that they might have had of physical punishment and pain came to be when one chapter after this, they were beaten with whips. And ultimately, at the end of the book of the Acts, they were executed, actually. So, this dynamic of wind and waves, here's the good news. the longer you go, the more it becomes real. The more intense it becomes, which raises this question. You still want the wins. But most of the time, the threats and the fear is not physical pain, though for some of you, actually you are facing that kind of thing. Most of the time, the threat in the fear is of losing something that you value, often more basic even than physical pain because you're afraid of losing a friendship. Because if I tell the truth about this thing, we might actually get closer, but we might actually blow the friendship up. So the fear is of losing something that you value, like a job or inclusion in some group or a ministry where you know something's wrong, but if you say it, you'll be done, or the loss of financial security or even of a marriage. So we keep the friendship, and that's good. We keep the job and the ministry and inclusion in that group, but the way we did it was to hide and ignore and keep pretending, keep it hidden. It's good. And it's good because, you know, sometimes you need to because those waves are just, so I'm not ready for them. Okay, I get that, I get that, I get that. But we keep all those things, thereby avoiding the waves, the resistance, pain. But you also miss out on the wind that does begin to blow. You miss out on the life that does begin to grow in a marriage, ministry, friendship, or family when you actually do begin to get out into the light, what's been hidden in the dark, when you begin to tell the truth and quit pretending and move toward the dark and desperate, scary places in your own soul, marriage, family, church. Because it's when you move toward those places, bring out into the light what you've been hiding in the dark, that the wind of God's spirit it does begin to blow in authentic ways, making the possibility real of actual healing in your marriage and family and church. Because nothing's going to change if it stays hidden. And so the wind begins to blow, but the waves of resistance begin to come. And so Peter and John in verse 19 answered and said to them, having been commanded not to speak, warned not to speak, threatened even more not to speak, said to them. You know, a couple of weeks ago when I read this verse to you, I had Peter kind of full of stuff, and that's fine. It might have been how he said it, but I kind of see him feeling the weight of this warning and the pain that might come, the waves that might hit. And so I think he might be saying this with a quivering tongue when he says whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you or to God. I don't know. I don't know. You be the judge. You figure that out. All I know for sure is this. We cannot stop speaking. What we have seen and what we've heard so in all humility. I don't know if he had it, but I'm kind of thinking that in all humility. He could have said, you know, you do what you will. We have to say what we saw, bring out into the light. And when they did, the wind began to blow. The wind began to kick up again, and God began to move again. You'll see that wind blowing in the next few verses, in the next few chapters. but so did the waves of resistance, which raises the question one final time. Peter and John, let me ask you, do you still want the wind? Do you still want to follow this way of the wind? Acts 1 through 3, yes! Yes! How about now? Because as it turns out, actually, lots of people do say yes. I want the wind. And often they say it, especially they say it, and we say it, when they've experienced some of the wind. Like maybe they've experienced some facsimile, some reasonable parallel to Acts 1 through 3. Maybe not to the same extreme and wonderful dynamic that was there, but some, you smell the wind. You smell, you experienced the wind. And so do you want the wind? Yes! I want to win, very much like the guy in Matthew 8, who was part of the crowd that day following Jesus. A multitude, it says, were following him. And when you're in the multitude, it's kind of an exciting experience. It's kind of easy to follow as well because everybody is. And this guy, along with the multitude, was following Jesus, quite impressed by Jesus, by his words and his works. The multitude was, too, when they came to the shore, and Jesus said, we need to cross to the other side. now. And that's very symbolic language because leaving this multitude and leaving the shore is symbolic of leaving the security of the crowd and leaving the security of the shore. And the kind of the invitation here is, are you willing to follow me now into a scarier place, into the water, get into the boats? And there's a certain scribe, it says in Matthew 8 verse 19, who says, oh Jesus, I will follow you wherever you go, to which Jesus says in verse 20, great, great. But just know this. Verse 20, foxes have holes and birds have nests. But the Son of Man has no place to lay his head. And if you follow me, it might be that way for you. Because with the wind comes the waves. I want you to know that before you sign on. Do you still want to follow me now? Turns out, he didn't. Indeed, he disappears, as I've said before, whenever we've talked about this guy. He disappears in the white space between verse 20 and 21. You never hear from him again. But right behind him, right behind him in Matthew chapter 8, is another guy in verse 21 who says the same thing as the first guy. I will follow you wherever you go. I will leave the security of the shore and the security of the multitude and follow you wherever you go. But first, let me bury my father first. It sounds like a reasonable request. I mean, if he said that to me, I would say, well, by all means, go bury your father first. I had no idea your father died. I'm so sorry. I won't rush you at all. Jesus says, do you remember what he says? I don't know if it was on the screen or not. Jesus says, let the dead bury the dead, which sounds, huh, not very nice. Forget about your father who just died. Turns out his father hadn't died. what we have here is actually a colloquial expression. And what it means is this, that when my father dies, and he hasn't died yet, but when he dies six months from now, six years from now, 15 years from now, something's going to happen. Because when my father dies, I will get his inheritance. And when I get his inheritance, I will have some money. And when I have some money, I will feel secure, and when I feel secure, I will follow you wherever you go. And Jesus says, let the dead bury the dead, meaning that those who are trying to get life from things that can't give it continue to get life from things that can't give it. Follow me now, or don't. It's okay. and then there's a third guy who in Luke chapter 9, 61 says the same thing as those first two guys. I will follow you wherever you go because I really want to win. I really want more of you. Just want to hang around you, not with a multitude. Maybe just you and me. I'll follow you wherever you go, but first let me say goodbye to those at home, which again sounds like a reasonable request. I mean, if he was asking me that, I would go, sure. Bye to your family. But Jesus is not a nice person. because Jesus says this in verse 62, this weird thing. No, don't go back home. Here's why anyone putting his hand at the floor and looking back is not fit for the kingdom of God. Seriously? I mean, it sounds bizarre, insensitive, even mean, but a closer look reveals this. That those at home are friends and family, okay? That's still weird. What he's really saying here is this. What the friends and family symbolize are people's opinion. So before I follow you anywhere, but first of all, I've got to check it out with my family and my friends and make sure they're okay with this and okay with me. And when I know they are, I'll follow you wherever you go. So this is the person who, like you and like me, really does hear the voice of God say, come on. But like you and like me, they hear other voices too. And when they do, like you and like me, they look back. It doesn't make them bad. It makes them scared. Makes them scared. Because when you look back, and this is what Jesus' word, any man putting his hand at the plow and looking back isn't fit, It means you're never going to get to what you say you want. If you keep listening to other voices, because two things happen when you look back and you're trying to plow, moving toward this thing. The first thing that happens is if you look back, is you stop altogether. And you even go back. Are you guys okay with me? The other thing you do is if you're looking back, but you're trying to plow at the same time, like get over here to a deeper place with God, or whatever it is, you end up going way off course. You end up plowing a crooked line, and symbolically what that means is if you keep looking back at what everybody else thinks, eventually you're going to end up into something that you don't care about at all. Because I wanted this, and I ended up there because I kept looking back there. So what do you want? Do you still want The wind Do you still want to follow the way Of the wind Because with the wind Comes The waves Indeed it's weird Come back to Matthew 8 Just sitting there for a second Because some did follow We had these three guys who said I would follow But they didn't But if you get back to Matthew 8 You might want to read through it later this afternoon because after these guys end up not following, we find out that a whole group of people did follow, left the security of the shore and the multitude, got into the proverbial boat and followed Jesus into the water. In fact, the Gospel of Mark says a whole flotilla of boats. So quite a few people left the security of the shore, didn't care what people thought, and followed Jesus. But it's fascinating because according to Matthew 8, when they all got into the middle of the lake, these people who had followed him, guess what happened? A storm hit. In fact, verse 24 says, a great storm hit because the wind and the waves come together. I thought when I followed him, beasts. So what do you want? Do you still want the wind? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you want to follow this way of the wind? Final thought is this, that these kinds of questions you still want to follow are not answered in one fell swoop. They are not answered once for all as if I said once and that's it. That settled it. No, it didn't. You said once and then God called you again. And God called you again. And God called you again because here's the deal about life in the kingdom of God and life with this journey, life on this journey with this person called Jesus, because Jesus, on this journey of life in the kingdom of God, keeps calling us further. I mean, if you think of your life with God, it's been like that, where you said yes, and made your breakthrough, and then he calls you deeper, and you said yes, and made your breakthrough, you went deeper, and then he asked for more, and you said yes, and oh, you gave more and made your breakthrough. And then he called you deeper. And then he asked for more. And then he called you further. And it raises this question, do you still want this way? See, I'm quite sure that right here and right now in this room, some of you are being asked right now to go further. in fact it was what was on your mind you had no idea we were going to talk about it this morning but it was on your mind when you came in and you even know what it is that God is calling you further into and some of you right here, right now, in this room are being asked by God to go deeper to give more and after he asks you for more, he'll ask for more it makes you wonder how much does he want turns out all of it, he wants all of it but not all at once, hey? That's really good news. You need to know he doesn't ask for all at once. But he'll keep asking and asking and asking and asking. We sing this song. I love this song, actually. I surrender all. All to Jesus, I surrender. And every time I sing that song, something moves in me. But every time I sing that song, and you have permission to do the same, all to Jesus, I surrender. I don't know what all even is. I'll give you this. I'll give you this. Because if I say I've given it all, I'm lying. I don't even know what all is. he asks for everything but he'll probably do that one piece at a time and when he asks you to go further and deeper for more again it raises this question again do you still want the wind do you still want to follow this way and if you say yes the only thing we then can do is say Holy Spirit come because I do not have the strength to go there I do not have the courage to go there. I don't even, I'm not even sure I want to go that deep, give up that much. And so we pray, Holy Spirit, come. And then there's those among us right here and right now, I'm quite sure, who have said yes, maybe recently to a prompting or a call to go further and deeper, to give more, to leave the shore and pursue the wind. And because you said yes right now, real time, you are in a storm. And so we pray, Holy Spirit, come. Because I can't do this. I can't survive this. I can't walk through this unless somehow you give me internal realities in life that I do not have right now, and so we pray. Right here, right now. Holy Spirit, come. Stand with me, would you, as we close. I want to pray over you. I want to ask the prayer ministry people to come and make themselves available in the front. I think this is a weekend where people may need to be prayed for. You can ask friends as well to be with you, maybe around some things in prayer as well. But even as I speak, prayer team, come and make yourself available like right now. Let's pray. First of all, God, I have in my mind and we have in our minds and get our arms around those among us right now who are being asked by you and they know what this means for them to go further, to go deeper. You're asking for more and what that stirs up in all of us is fear. And so in the name of Jesus, I speak against any spirit of fear. Any spirit of fear, I command you to leave in Jesus' name. The love of God casts out all fear. Come, Holy Spirit, with a baptism of your love that secures us to go into the scariest places of our lives so we can come to life. And those among us as well who have indeed already said yes to going further and deeper and give more, and because of that, they're in a storm right now. Holy Spirit, come. With peace and peace, gifts of peace, confidence, not even that the circumstance is going to turn out the way they want, confidence in you, in you, in them, right here, right now, in the middle of a storm. Bring your gifts, release your spirit, build up your people in this place. Give us what we need from your spirit in life when we need it. As we continue to say yes. Yes and yes and yes again. Thank you.
