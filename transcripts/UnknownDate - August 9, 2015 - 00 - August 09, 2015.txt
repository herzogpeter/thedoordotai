I have the great privilege today to be in the same spot I stood in on April 19th, just a few months ago. And instead of our usual practice of reading a scripture to introduce the sermon, I read a quote from a book by Wayne Mueller entitled Sabbath. So stop now. Take your hand off the plow. Put down the phone. Turn off the computer. Let the pen rest on the paper. Leave the mop in the bucket. We stop because there are forces in the universe larger than we that take care of the universe. And while our efforts are important, necessary, and useful, they are not, nor are we, indispensable. So let it go. Put it down. Be still and know. And with those words, we blessed and then released Dave and Bonnie Johnson into God's care to begin a much anticipated and well-deserved sabbatical. There was a sense of sending them as the elders and the pastoral staff gathered around them on this stage at the end of the service. We prayed for them in some sense to commission them to go and find rest for their souls. Well, they did go, and they did find rest for their souls. And now they're back. So I am thrilled, truly thrilled, to stand here again in this spot where we release them. But this time we receive them back. We welcome them back. We welcome them home. Dave. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Wow, I'm nervous. I don't feel that way very often, especially here, though. In the middle of worship, I leaned over to Bonnie and said, I think we live here. Explain the flip-flops. I don't know why you need to, but I kind of want to. I was at Greg Boyd's church last week visiting him, and I met him in the foyer of their church, and he was wearing shorts and a t-shirt and no shoes at all. So I decided to dress up. That's what this is. A couple things just to begin. First of all, there's expressions for me and Bonnie and I of gratitude. First of all, to the elders, Nina, but all our elders who took this whole sabbatical thing seriously and took the time to learn about this kind of sabbatical and to discern the value of it and the timing of it. And just grateful for the process of that and the real endorsement of that. To those who filled the pulpit while I was gone, from April into August, Al and Vicki and Brian and Steve Hansen, and then this guy named Peter Kapsner, who sits right over here. Oh, yeah. Wow. Yeah. And you know what I love about your applause is I know what you mean. Because it's part of what I did when I came back. I didn't listen to anything when I was gone, but this week I listened to all of them and I'm going, wow, wow, wow. Wow. So, as Peter took us on a journey from the book of Genesis to the book of Revelation, inviting us with the help of the prophet Jeremiah to stand at the crossroads and look, to literally look back, particularly in times of uncertainty, to look back and to remember the ancient paths, the ways of God, and that's what you did and that's what he led us in. And so part of my reentry in all of this week was to catch up with all of that, not just Peter's talks. But I listened to Vicki. She talked about intercessory prayer. And as I listened to her talk about that, one of the things I thought, and I don't want to embarrass you, but she reminds me of Dallas Willard, and that will embarrass her. But in this way, when I used to listen to Dallas talk about some dimension of life in the kingdom of God, Whatever it was he said, I had this thing in my spirit relative to him that he knows he knows. And when Vicki was talking about that, you know how to pray, how to be with God. And Al Shuck talked about a God who was with us. Remember that? Even if the plane goes down, remember that lady he met on the plane? Even if it goes down, he is with us. He is with us. and the boat when we ascend, when we descend, and the goodness of God you spoke of last week in the context of communion, Steve Hansen and Brian Houts who spoke of the transformational reality of what happens when you give yourself to something bigger than yourself, and you go and you give, and you're kind of beyond your limit, and God meets you in those places. And then, of course, Peter, eight weeks of Peter, and I just came up grateful. And then there's this guy named Ned. Berube, that none of you know, a dear friend of mine. I've known him for three years. He's become kind of a mentor, I think, of mine. But for this particular experience, Ned became what I would call my sabbatical coach. I want you to meet Ned. Here's a picture of him there. I couldn't get a better one. That's just how he looks. Not as a dear man, and I wouldn't know what I know about sabbatical. I don't think I could have entered into it with some of the things that I wanted to do and the way I did it without some of his counsel. He helped both Bonnie and I planning what to do and what not to do, maybe where to go and where not to go. He had all sorts of rules. He's a very rigid individual. Among them was there was no ministry. I couldn't do any ministry at all, and I kept that except for one time that he doesn't know about. But the word from him to me, and I actually gave it to you, Dave, you need to let the ground go fallow, so that when the ground goes fallow, other things in you might begin to grow, things that wouldn't maybe have a chance to grow if you just keep trampling on those things inside of you, and those things inside of you are embedded like seeds that lie dormant in the soil of your soul, and when you give it some space, they might grow. Indeed, some of you might remember on the last Sunday that I was here, I kind of talked about that, not just for me, but for us. That the primary image of this sabbatical season was that of a field. That's gone fallow. You leave it alone, and when you do, things begin to grow. But it wasn't just things that might grow in me. there was some curiosity about what might grow even in us as a congregation, and kind of came back wondering about all of that, and then we left with that anticipation that things would grow in you, and things would grow in Bonnie and I. The next day, Bonnie and I boarded a plane on our way. Are you kidding me? We went to Italy. The day after I left here, first we went to Florence, in Siena, then to a place called Rada in Chianti. And part of our journey, I have to blame on Ned, who I told you was our coach, because he and his wife had had a sabbatical years ago and gone there. So months, actually, before we went, he told us about Rome and what that was like, and Venice, and Florence, and Siena, and this place called Rada in Chianti. And he talked about a bench he sat on in Rada in Chianti. Chianti is a place in Tuscany, and as you talked about Rome, it sounded like it's kind of against the law not to go there. I didn't want to go there. I didn't want to go to Venice. I wanted to get to that bench. I wanted to get to that bench and sit down, and I found the bench overlooking the Valley of Vineyards, and here it is. That's the bench I sat on, and that was the bench that Ned sat on. That was my view every morning. There's another one, the other one, there's my journal, just to prove I was actually there doing work. But every morning I would sit on that bench and get up early and go down there with some coffee and my journal and a Bible and a book, and I would read and I would pray and I'd be quiet and I'd wonder what might grow in this crazy place. And things began to grow and I couldn't always till then about, and then every morning about 10 o'clock, because the morning was kind of just lazy that way, and, but about 10 o'clock every morning, I would turn around, I would be in the bench, and I would just turn around and look up, and when I turned around from the bench and looked up, this is what I would see. Oh my goodness, there she is. I'm serious. All I had to do was turn around, and there she was, Rapunzel, Rapunzel, come down, and she would, she was very obedient on this trip. I want you to see that picture, and it really is symbolic. It speaks to me, and I know to us, as we are sitting in some of these quieter places and just going, wow, we still work. It's good to be 41 years with someone and like it. I like being with her and sitting and her with me most of the time, some of the time. It's a little over half. In Florence, there was arts. Amazing place. Michelangelo's David. I'll show you a picture of that. Okay, take it off. I'm not good in these environments, you guys. I know people go into these places where that statue is, and it's called the Academy, and all of Michelangelo's art is there, and all these sculptures, and everybody is standing with senses of reverence. People are weeping, and I'm sitting there whispering to Bonnie, do you notice anything weird about that statue? It's just, there's naked people everywhere in this thing. And there's something, this is just totally Dave Johnson. No one else would probably notice this, but I'm going, this is David. This is David, you know, and I know the story of David and Goliath, and they were calling each other's names. And one of the things that David taunted Goliath with was this, you uncircumcised Philistine. I don't know how he knew that. Apparently he did. David was a Jew, so obviously he was, you know, that. And the statue, I'm going, Bonnie, he's not. That's weird. That's a big part of the story to miss. Nobody else, I promise you. Nobody else was talking about that except me. I notice things like this. In Siena, there were churches, and they were beautiful. Here's a picture of one of the beautiful scenes, and some of them were weird. Here's a picture of the weirdness. ha it's an actual person an actual skeleton I was thinking Bonnie even wondered about what would this be, it would be cool in like our auditorium or in the gathering place what would the children do how would you explain that to the children and I thought of something we could say that's what happens if you act up so behave yourself or there you go we'd get this place out really quick in Ireland we met with our forever friends Raymond and Helen and then there was this cottage we stayed in oh there's Raymond and Helen and I face bombed them or a picture, what do you call that? you know, photo, bombed them known them for 18 years there's the cottage we stayed in thank you Mike and Carolyn Anderson and this is the bench I found just behind ooh that's where I journaled in Ireland and Bonnie met me there as well and every day we would explore every day we would get lost I called Michael one day he was back here in the states and he said it's a great place to get lost and I said it's a great place to get lost we'd go to the bottom of the road and go you want to turn right or left today and we'll go right because we turned left yesterday and we would continually find these wonderful things and as the days went on it made us wonder what might grow we didn't know the food was amazing This was lunch one day. I love that picture. Sent that one to my grandkids. That was not helpful. I'm going to do the timing on that picture better in the second service. So anyway. And late May we came home. The big international stuff was over. But we left immediately for Chicago and a wedding of my wife's sister's son. And so our whole family caravan down to Chicago. And we had a wonderful time kind of reuniting with our kids. And then Bonnie and I went on a road trip to visit our other daughter. And Erica and Hain and her two kids, Layla and Cord, came back, finally started to settle down. And in the settling down at Holomb, I went on a three-day retreat with my good friend Ned Berube in Wisconsin. And it was good. It was tov, to borrow a word from Peter. But I started talking to him about what's growing and what's not. And I go, I'm just kind of afraid. I don't have any great revelations yet. actually it feels like the only thing that's growing is my waistline so far. I'm getting about 20 pounds here. And I also said, you know, it feels like some weeds are growing. You know, you let the ground go fallow, just leave it alone. And weeds, you know, other people's spiritual things grow, and I'm getting crabby, and Bonnie thinks I'm kind of selfish. Who knew about that? And so we talked about weeds that sometimes grow in the soil of our lives. And there were echoes from home, from you. One of the echoes looked like this. I love that echo. Oh, what a wacko. And I would hear about what God was doing here. The context of the worship, I would hear about Peter's voice is being clear. I hadn't heard the talks yet, but it's a clear voice. It's a voice that sounds like us voice. And I heard about the response to our formation center. It's being overwhelming that we're going to start one, and it's already had to cut it off, so people are going to have to wait, and people are really angry that they have to wait. That's wonderful, because I think that's a very formational thing, because the number one thing in formation is how you deal with it when you don't get what you want, so there we go anyways. And then we were home. It was good to be home. And then to dial it down a bit, and dial in a bit, and return to the questions I was asking, and Bonnie and I were asking before we left, about me and about the church and ministry and calling and what maybe needs to change. and what better not change and is there something different or is there something more? What do we need to notice? Bonnie, let's get with God again around this. What do we need to see? I ran out of things to do. I wash my car a lot. My car's never been so clean. He visited some churches. Like I said, we were at Greg Boyd's church last week. One of the highlights for me was somewhere in June. I went to Steve Ween's church and Genesis Church, and then got there a little bit early, so I was able to sneak up on him from behind and grab him by the neck and saw people that we know and we love, and it was wonderful. And I sat in the worship looking down at him, and all I could think of was how much I loved that guy. Who knew? Really do. In fact, it was really funny, because I got there early enough, there was a bit of a buzz, and I saw Rick and Becky Patton, who, Rick and Becky, who have been here for years and years, but they're part of the leadership team with Steve, and it's a very good thing. She was doing the announcement, and she introduced everyone to Open Door. I loved it. It was so funny. The place just went to pieces, which was nice, too, because I love being the center of attention, as you know. In early July, I went to California, mostly to visit a friend of mine. His name is Kent Carlson. Some of you maybe recognize him. Kent was here a year ago in July in this pulpit and brought a beautiful sermon about the second naivete. I don't know if you remember that talk. If you were here, I'm sure you do. But Kent is a dear friend of mine. And I knew that part of the sabbatical needed to include connecting with him and just being with him and talking. He's in very much the same stage of his life and his ministry. So that was good. But also I was there to kind of connect with and attend this conference, which is where I did the one ministry thing that I had to do as a keynote to the North American Baptist Triennial Conference. I had to do one of the keynote speaking things there, and Kent sent me a picture of me just two days ago, and that's this. And he sent, obviously, because you look like an idiot, Dave. Here you go. Do I always look like that? I look kind of like I'm about to wrestle somebody. But it was there at that conference, and being with Kent, that things actually did begin to turn in my mind and in my heart, and my heart began to stir, and I began to hear some things for me and for us, which brings me now to my re-entry and the meeting I had with our elders a week ago last Thursday to talk about what I'm coming back with, to talk about what grew in me, what still concerns me, but also what's clear to me. And there's lots of times when you're in the middle of the stuff that we do, Things aren't as clear, but it became clear. What's clear to me, among other things, is this, our vision as a church, is clear to me and quite compelling, too. And part of it is because of what I was sitting in. And even at that conference, our vision is compelling to me, given, among other things, the post-Christian culture that we live in and the growing irrelevance of the North American church and its ability to connect with that culture in kingdom kinds of ways. Richard McNeil was one of the other keynote speakers at this conference. Some of you maybe know that name. He's kind of a missional guy. He's written books like The Present Future, Missional Renaissance. His most recent book, Kingdom Come, is a really good one. His primary thesis was this, that the church in many ways has lost its sense of mission, that we need to change the scorecard, our definition of success, if you will, to not it being how many people come to your church, and this is going to sound familiar because we talk about this a lot, but the scorecard being more about how many from your church are being equipped and empowered to go into the world, to go into their world with the life of God pulsing through their veins. One of the things that caught my attention was on the first talk that he gave when he said this, that for the last 500 years since the Reformation, we've been trying to fix the church. With this assumption that if we fix the church, they will come, which, according to McNeil, is actually what gave rise to what we commonly refer to today as the attractional model of the church that we are all familiar with. I think the attractional model built on this assumption that if we fix it, that is the church, if we just get better at what we already do as a church, if we do it slicker and nicer and more contemporary, if we make it more inviting or more entertaining, if we make it more friendly and fun, If we make it more biblical and true, they will come. And so over the years, we've fixed the church by becoming this or that. With this assumption, always underneath, if we fix it, they will come. And 500 years ago, that was true. In fact, think back, 500 years ago, Reformation, Martin Luther, when you talked about the church, it was absolutely connected to the culture. So if you change the church, it's in the culture. The culture has great respect for the church. Even if the church is a mess, you change the church, you change the world. And the culture with it, indeed 30 years ago, in America it was still true. That was, though to a lesser degree, because the culture at some level was still kind of respectful of the church and desirous of maybe what it would have if it was healthy. but that's not true. It's not true anymore. Last week I saw a YouTube video sent to me by Taylor Baumgarten, who is standing right up here on our worship team, a YouTube of a guy named Sky Jathani, who kind of gave this historical perspective in 1970. That's not that long ago. The change has been stunningly fast. 1970, the church, the institutional church, was the most respected institution in the United States of America. Today, it's not even close. It's not even close. Lots of reasons. We can all name the scandals and things like that. But there's other things involved as well, including a next generation of Gen Xers and millennials, they're called, who have tremendous distrust for any institution. Not just the church, but anything that's institutional is going to be suspect. Boomers like myself, even though we were all kind of into this protest thing with the Vietnam War and we were raging against the man all the time, we loved institutions. If it was big, it was good. If it was big, it was reliable. Not so what's coming down the pike in this particular generation. 1970, this guy said the most trusted news anchor was a guy named Walter Cronkite. Some of you remember that name. Today, the most trusted news person in America is a guy named Jon Stewart from Comedy Central. He's a brilliant person, but it's the cynicism that they trust. It's that kind of thing. He showed a graph, did Sky Jathani, that showed this. Over the last 30 years, we've seen the exponential growth of the institutional church in the United States. And by that growth, he did not mean the number of churches or necessarily the impact of churches, but the actual footprint of these churches as they add more and more features to their church to attract more and more Christian consumers is my quote of him. That's what he said. But at the same time, as we're seeing these megachurches rise and their footprints get bigger and more and more people leaving their little, you know, Ma and Pa church to go to this huge church, at the very same time, a significant decline in trust is happening. At the very same time, a significant decline in trust of our larger institutions, particularly among these Gen Xers and Millennials demanding, most people I'm listening to say it demands a different paradigm for how we do church and how we see the church. Not an attractional model but an incarnational model. An attractional model says we want to be attractive enough to draw those people out there to come here. An incarnational model says we want to have such a reality of the life of God in us that we are incarnating that and moving into a culture that we're not trying to get to come to church or want to give them the life. We come here, find out what it means to be formed in the image of Christ, and then our entire focus is out there. Alan Hirsch, in a book entitled The Forgotten Ways, it's something I've mentioned to you before, He has this pie chart, and in the pie chart, there's 13% of the population, he says, right now in America, would be interested in some sort of church kind of activities. 13% of the population. And he referred to that little slice in the pie as the red water. Remember that? And he calls it red water because it's red because there's a feeding frenzy. Because 13% of the population would go to some kind of church. All the churches are fighting for that population. and wanting to be as attractive as they can, thus the attractional model, to get all these people who would maybe go to church to come to ours and the rest of the culture, all the blue water, couldn't care less what we do. They're not even mad at the church. They just couldn't care less what the church does. We're just fighting. We're over this thing which demands a different model, not attractional. It's got to be incarnational. It has to be incarnational. We've got to get a different picture. And I started thinking about our vision. And it feels clear to me, and it feels compelling to me. You know, I've always felt like we were not an attractional model church. Because, you know, seeker-sensitive churches and some of that kind of thing, they're the ones I never bought into. We never bought into that. We're not a secret church. We didn't want to do that. So I thought we weren't an attractional model church. and then when he said that is Reggie McNeil said what he said about for 500 years I've been trying to fix a church I had this memory and it was of me going into ministry 30 well now almost 40 years ago and my entire passion was I'm going to fix a church I grew up in church I hated church so I'm going to fix a church with this amazing grace of God message and we're going to quit pretending we're going to take off the mask and how things look is not what matters how things really are is what matters we're going to get out here, what's going on in here so the grace of God can heal it. And people came. Lots of people came. And we weren't doing it to get people to come, but they came. Actually, by the thousands, they came. And the most common testimony I heard in those days, this is another memory, was I feel born again again. Well, I love that. I love that. It makes me cry sometimes when I think of that. I can see the faces of people who used to say that, but then I ask myself a question. Now I'm, you know, 62, and here we are, and the culture's changing, and what I'm asking myself now is, where'd that person come from? I feel born again again. Where'd they come from? Who are they? They are a church person, and they came from that church over there, and the church over there, and I'm not saying we didn't reach out beyond any of that, but we were without trying to be an attractional church. And it wasn't fleshy or wrong, but that's what we were. So I'm coming back with all of that. An awareness, belief, that maybe we're more steeped in this attractional model than we know, but that our vision is calling us to a new paradigm. And I don't always hear this when I hear the vision, but it is. And I hear it now. So listen for it as I remind you of it. That is our vision, to be preparing a people for next. A people with, among other things, a radical commitment to spiritual transformation. And there's ways, and there's things in our church right now I can look at that give evidence of that. Our worship gives evidence of that. What we do in this room gives evidence of that. The things that Al Shuck teaches in discovery classes gives evidence of that. a center of spiritual formation being started here. Church gives evidence of that vision to be a people with a radical commitment to spiritual formation for the sake of others. That's the missional. We do that here to go out. There is for the sake of others. It's all about incarnational. A people with a formational focus and a missional mandate. And again, I see all this evidence of our commitment to the formation, and I know that organically in the lives of many people here, missional living is part of how you live. A few weeks ago, we had, well, a few months ago now, Al brought up a group of people, a group of you up here to talk about that missional kind of life, and very organically, under the radar, without any of us knowing things like that were happening, but I had another memory, and it was this. 13 years ago, I don't know, next week, it's right around here someplace. 13 years ago, right now, we moved into this building. And I remember it very well because we had kind of a dream. And I remember preaching, and if you were here when we were here, we talked about this all the time. And the dream was this, that in 10 years, in 13 years, the people who live in Maple Grove will be glad that our church is here, even if they never come to our church. So the point even then was not get more people here. The point was to kind of minister in that kind of way. Well, if the people in Maple Grove were glad that we were here, what would that take? We'd, I don't know, have to serve them, to bless them. And I haven't taken a poll, so I don't know, but I don't have a sense that that's happened. I don't know. I'm not upset. I'm thinking we need to turn our face outward in little ways and big ways. So what am I coming back with? what has grown in me. All of that has grown in me and more I'm here to do four things. I told the elders last week, I want to preach. I love to preach. But more I want to teach. I want to get down into other environments where I'm not just talking. We can go back and forth. I want to teach in this center. I want to identify along with others, the elders and others. I want to identify and discern who is the next generation of leaders here at Open Door and invest in you. I want to invest there. And fourth, I want to champion this missional thing. I don't know how. You know, you tell me how. I mean, you know, usually the teacher guy tells you the answers. I'm asking the question, how do we do this? I don't know. We have to do this. One more thing, and I close with this. Ned, my sabbatical coach, gave me an assignment to close my sabbatical. He said, I want you to make sure before you go back that you find some time. And I did last Saturday, actually, at least three hours by yourself, get by a lake, sit in a chair, and ask God to come present to you and ask God to bring to your mind all the way through your whole life where he has met with you and been there with you. I thought, oh, okay. Last Saturday, I woke up pretty early and on my mind was this phrase. I don't even know where it was, but it was, where can I go from your presence? And I looked at it, okay, that's Psalm 139. So I got up before I went to the lake and I read through Psalm 139 and here's what it said. You have searched me and known me. And this applies to you too. Hear this for yourself. You know my thoughts. You're intimately acquainted with all my ways. And my ways, by the way, are not all... I have a way and it's weird. So he knows. He knows yours too. Before words on my tongue, you know it. Indeed, you've laid your hand upon me. I know that. So where can I go from your spirit or flee from your presence? If I ascend to the heights, you're there. If I go to the depths and make my bed there in a dark place, you're there. Even there, your hand will lead me. That got me. That caught me. I've read different translations. Even there, your hand will still love me. No, even in the dark, you will be led by me. Your little right hand will lay hold of me. When darkness overwhelms me, I cannot see the light. It isn't dark to you for darkness and light are like to you. The night is as bright as the day. You formed me in my inner parts, my heart, my soul. Your eyes have seen my unformed substance. I've always thought of that as before I was even born. What I know about him seeing is he sees my unformed, right here, substance and what has been formed. How precious are your thoughts. To me, how vast are the sum of them. So I went to this lake. This is where I ended up. Right there. Show it again. Last Saturday morning, 7 o'clock. I was in for about an hour, by the way, and a group of people came down. It so irritated me. I'm making all this noise. I'm being with God. And they had a baptism right in front of me. Okay, whatever. You're not a good person. Okay. But I began to remember. I began to remember. And I wrote it down. I'm not going to bore you with all this. But I remember kneeling at my parents' bed, eight years old. And I did it the way an eight-year-old does. I asked Jesus. I asked you. I was talking to God. I asked you into my heart. Whatever. I remember 806 North 6, Maywood, Illinois. That's where I grew up. I remember Grandma Johnson and push pedal cars running round and round and round. And even there, even then he was there calling me, inviting me. You could do the same right now in your own mind. And then fast forward it to high school and college and a girl named Bonnie Nichols. And whoo, she looks. I like that. Anyway, very formed at that point. And then came Bethel and kids and ministry and open door and scared to death to come here. And my life just kind of went out in front of me. And I remember when my dad died and Dave Busby died and other things were lost in dark places. I remember dark places, but sitting on the bench, I could look back on those dark places where I had no sense of his presence, no sense of, and I can look back on it now. And I know, I know he, his hand was leading me in us when I couldn't see it. I know it, and I went through my life. I go there and there and there and there, and I'm coming back with that too. because we as a people, as a church, ascend to heights from time to time and he's there and there's other times when we're in the dark and you need to know something that I know because I've seen it over and over. Even in the dark, his hand is leading us. So I'm coming back with that. And I want to invite you into that just briefly right now. Joel, would you come and... I asked Joel to just play some music. It might feel cheesy to you, but it isn't to me. In fact, I heard Greg say this last week. Music, it does. It opens our soul. So let the strumming of the guitar open your soul. And hear these words again and wonder about your own life. You have searched me and known me. You know my thoughts. You're intimately acquainted with my ways. If we ascend to the heights, you're there. If you go to the depths, if we make our bed in Sheol, if we find ourself in a dark place, can you see the dark place?
