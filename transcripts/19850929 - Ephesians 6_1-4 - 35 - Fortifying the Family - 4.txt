Chapter 6, verse 1. Children, obey your parents and the Lord, for this is the right thing, the righteous thing. Honor your father and mother, and that is so important that it's the first commandment that was ever given with a promise, that it may be well with you, and this is the promise, that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth. And the verse we're focusing on again this evening is verse 4. fathers or parents, do not provoke your children to anger. Instead, bring them up in the discipline and the instruction or the nurture and the admonition of the Lord. Let's pray as we begin. Father, I feel a real need every time we open your word, not as a form of ritual or just something we do every time, but in a real way to acknowledge firmly our dependence upon you to receive the deep truths of your word. And I ask your blessing upon it and that you would be our teacher this evening in your name. Amen. I'd like to begin with just two very quick comments to start off with. First of all, I'm real aware of the fact that the subject we're dealing with tonight, discipline in the home, is a subject that is of interest to some more than others. But I also believe, and that is simply because some of you have little children in the home and you're really interested in that, and some of you have children who are a little bit older and you're kind of interested in this, and some of you have kids who are gone and you're wondering what you're doing here with this particular topic. But one thing I do believe, and I believe this firmly, and it isn't some sort of excuse to go ahead and talk about it or give you a reason to be here, But any time we open the Word of God, it's of benefit. And we grow by it. There's not a doubt about it. And also, one of the things that we have discovered as we've gone through this entire series on fortifying the family is that so many of the principles that we are dealing with do not just have to do with relationships between a parent and a child. Every one of us are children. I don't care how old you are. We are dealing with relationships and how we relate to people and how we talk to people and how we accept people. There's something else that we have discovered and that is this. That we are really blessed in this church to have a lot of young families. I've told you over and over again that one of my favorite parts of church is as we go out into that foyer and see all these little bumpkins running around and jumping in the fountain and all these mischievous things. and there is a way in which we are intimately involved in every one of these families. We are the body of Christ and we cannot separate ourselves from any of the families. When the Pritchards bring their little child up here, it is not us commissioning them and go off and do your thing. It's us commissioning them and we are in this together and so these things are of utmost importance. But there's another thing I think we need to know. I think it's incredibly important that we realize the high priority that Jesus himself placed upon children in Matthew 18 verse 6 he said this one of you who would cause a little one to stumble to be wounded to fall into disbelief if one of you would do that it would be better for you to have a millstone hung around your neck and cast into the sea how we treat our children whether they are ours or whether they are ours is incredibly important to God there's something else and just by introduction I want to share with you this evening and that is this that I do not have an exhaustive supply of knowledge concerning this subject I'm a minister of the word and this is where I function and this is where I thrive and this is where I feel any wisdom that comes comes from my dealing with the word and in some of these areas I defer to people who I think know a lot more than me about this and even as we begin And if you're taking notes at all, there's a couple of things I'd like to recommend to you in terms of books for reading. Now, a couple of these you're very, very familiar with. Dr. James Dobson, a Christian psychologist, dealing specifically with children is extremely helpful. And I know any of you who have children have already plugged into that kind of thing. But two of the books that I found extremely helpful in dealing with this were Dare to Discipline. I'm sure you're familiar with it. If you're not, though, I still want you to know about that. And Hide or Seek is another one. And another one, just one other book that you may not be familiar with because this one was brand new to me, is written by a woman named Jean Ilesley, I-L-S-L-E-Y, Clark. C-L-A-R-K-E. The name of the book is Self-Esteem, A Family Affair. And this is the textbook that we are using in our Sunday school class on the family during this quarter. And if you're interested in that book, I recommend that heartily. i need to indicate however that as i go through this it is going to be strictly a biblical kind of study giving us a foundation i believe for any other endeavor that we might like to go into let's get back to the text the first thing we have discovered in this verse is this an instruction fathers parents don't provoke your children to anger instead don't don't incite them to to hostility. Don't frustrate your children. Instead, the alternative is this. Bring them up. Don't beat them down. Bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Now, if you remember, we had some frustration trying to figure out what exactly it meant to bring them up. The Greek didn't give us a lot. It meant to rear them, to train them, that kind of thing, and it really didn't help us a lot. So we looked for synonyms, and we found that in the Hebrew, there was one. And the word was found in Proverbs 22, 6, where it says, Train up a child in the way he should go. Another term, a verse that we are very familiar with. And we learned several weeks ago that to train up a child is not so much to teach them specific little behaviors. That is part of it. We need to control behavior. But there was a deeper meaning to it, and it had to do with the root of the word was palate or gum. And in those days, a woman would put her thumb in a cup of grape juice when a baby was born and rub the palate and create a sucking sensation. It was to create in them a taste, create in those children a taste, train them up or create in them a taste for the godly thing, for the righteous thing, for the proper direction. And we found even then, even though we weren't talking specifically about discipline, we discovered then that that really did speak to discipline, didn't it? Because if I am going to create in them a taste for something, I'm not going to be able to beat that taste into them. A taste is something you like. And my job as a parent is to create in them, because of the example I'm showing them, things that they desire to emulate in me. Incredibly important concept that we understand. Train up a child, create in them a taste. The second part. Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it. In the way he should go. We discover literally that meant in his own way. In his own way. Now that doesn't mean that you let him do whatever he wants, that you let him go his own way and never have any control. What that means specifically is our job as parents, our task as parents, is to discover who that child is. Every one of our children are different. Every child that God has placed into our homes has a different personality with different characteristics, and they're going in different directions. And if I as a parent have decided that this is the way they're going to be, or if I am trying to plaster into them the dreams I have for them, we're going to have all sorts of frustration. And when they are old, they won't know who they are. My job as a parent is to discover who that child is and train them up according to their particular characteristic. And the promise from God is, if I discover who that child is and train him accordingly, when he is old, he will not depart from it. so to bring them up we saw two things first of all i want to create in my children a taste for that which is good secondly i want to be about the task of really knowing my children and knowing their distinctives and knowing their differences and training them up accordingly and i'm going to treat one differently than i do another and you might think boy oh boy oh boy if i've got to do all that that's a lot of work it's so much easier just to get a book and do it all The same, yeah, it is. And yes, I want to tell you right now that I think, and the more I'm doing it, and the older my kids get, and the crazier they get, it is a lot of work. And there's no way to get around it. And I don't think it's easy. And I need to do a lot of thinking and growing and stretching and learning as a parent to be the parent that God wants me to be. So we created them a taste. And we are to be about the task of knowing them. And thirdly, we are to be about the task. We did this last week, or two weeks ago, of affirming them. Affirming them, or loving them. We discussed the word affirm. It means to validate them. It means to yes them. My posture towards you is yes. We saw the damage a couple of weeks ago. Of what we have in a home when we have the kind of love that is a love that's because, that's a conditional love, it has strings. I love you because, I love you if, I love you when, I love you as long as you perform the way I want you to, you look the way I want you to, you act the way I want you to, and on and on and on. We saw the damage of that very specifically in a biblical model of Esau and his father, Isaac. It said in that text that we read, and Isaac loved Esau. Why? Because. And the rest of that verse didn't even matter. It didn't matter why he did. all that mattered and the only thing we had to focus in on to know that there was going to be trouble in that home was that even though he did love him and even though that emotion was positive that emotion was real precarious and that bond was real precarious because the love that was being demonstrated or given to Esau was based on a condition that was that he could hunt and that he could fish and that he loved to go out into the wild and he was real hairy. But not everybody can be real hairy. That's not something that everybody can do. He wouldn't like me very much. we also learned that rebecca hated esau because and there was nothing he could do about it and jacob was in the same web esau isaac didn't love jacob as much as he loved esau and again why because because jacob liked to be indoors jacob was totally different and rebecca loved jacob why because and the result was that there was a tension and an anger and a hostility in that home that lasted the span of their lives. And we also saw that the disease that was in that family visited into Jacob's life and his family as well. As we saw the same kind of conditional love being borne out in Jacob's relationship with his 12 sons. And then Joseph came and Jacob loved Joseph. Why? Because he was different. There was something special and on and on and on. And we know about the hatred that was there. We are to be about the task of affirming our children, no matter who they are, no matter what they are, no matter what they look like. And when that is established, they are free to stop performing for us. They are free to start discovering who it is that God wants them to be, and they're free to discover what it is that God wants them to do. And now, tonight, I need to add one further dimension. And if all we do is talk about those first three things without adding this dimension, We just haven't completed the cycle. It isn't full. It isn't balanced. The final dimension is the dimension of discipline. Discipline. This is a hard thing for some people to talk about. It's a hard topic for some people even to hear. Sometimes it's a very tense subject. There are people who have gone through severe kinds of discipline. The kind of discipline that we're going to define tonight as not being disciplined at all when they have been the recipients of a discipline that was lacking love. And when we talk about some sort of discipline being born upon a child, it's something that they reel away from. Very often we have the feeling in our minds, some people have the feeling in our minds that to talk about discipline and then to talk about an unconditional love, what you're really doing is talking about two different things. You can't have them both at the same time. They're somehow ancillary to each other. They're somehow in opposition and at war with each other. I hope that tonight, when we're done with this, we come away with a fresh kind of balance. And if you've already got the balance, what I want to do for you tonight is just affirm that in you to keep on going and keep on struggling to maintain that balance. If you really love your child, how could you ever invade their space? You know, if you discipline your child, you're going to inhibit their creativity and you're going to inhibit their expression of themselves. You know, if little Johnny wants to throw a brick through the window, maybe he's going to be an artist. You ever see how neat those little jagged things are? I mean, it's real creative. That's a bit extreme. But what we need is a balance, isn't it? Dr. James Dobson, in his book, Hide or Seek, said this. Studies have shown that the child who is suffering with the lowest sense of self-esteem is the one, first of all, who isn't permitted to say anything. He is beaten down. Nothing he says is of value, nothing he says or does is of any concern to the parents. Children are to be seen and not heard. Some of you grew up with that. I don't believe that. The child who has the lowest sense of self-esteem is the one who is permitted to say nothing. You want to know what the next child with the next lowest sense of self-esteem is? The one with the next lowest self-esteem is the one who is allowed to do anything he wants, to dominate the conversation, to go where he pleases, to do what he wants, to say what he wants, when he wants, all the time. Highest on the list of those who have a good sense of who they are and where they're going and a good sense of self-esteem are the children of parents who are saying things like this. Yes, you can speak. when it's your turn. And there you have in a small illustration the balance of love on one hand and respect on one hand. Yes, you can speak, and control on the other hand. And I am not going to stand here tonight and pretend that that balance is an easy one to maintain. I don't think it is. And I think one of the struggles we have all the time as parents, and even in our relationships with each other as adults, is to maintain that balance. We find ourselves flipping into one or the other, overly conciliatory or overly disciplinary. Very often there's many reasons for that. Sometimes you deal harshly with the kid and then you compensate for that, or you compensate for that, or you have a rough day and you deal harshly with the kid. There are all sorts of reasons. They don't matter. We know that the balance for that is hard to maintain. Three things I want to hit you with tonight and share with you that I trust will help us hit that balance. The first thing I want to hit is the need for discipline. The need for discipline. The second thing I want to touch on are the prerequisites for discipline, especially for corporal kinds of physical punishment. And the third thing I want to talk about is the administration of discipline. First of all, the need for discipline. Prevalent, absolute. Proverbs 22, verse 15 says this, Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child. Foolishness, that word foolish, please understand this, does not mean that children are foolish as in stupid, or foolish as in ignorant and dumb, and lacking in any capability of handling anything. It doesn't mean that at all. That would be a real bad way to interpret that. Foolish also doesn't mean foolish in kind of a silly way. Children are silly. That's part of who they are, and that's to be appreciated, and that's who they are. You try to beat that out of them, and I don't know what you're going to be doing. That's a child. The foolishness that is being dealt with here is a foolishness that is bound up in a child and is bound up in every person, the potential for rebellion and out-and-out disobedience and moving in ways that are absolutely opposite what you would have them go and what God would have them move in. Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child. It is buried in each one of them. The potential for destruction is in each one of them. And discipline, it says, is the thing that can drive that foolishness from them, that self-destructive kind of behavior from them. Discipline is what will do that. In fact, we have warnings in that same book, Proverbs, concerning the house or the person who did not receive that kind of guidance and those kinds of boundaries in their home. Proverbs 14, verse 1 says this, The wise woman builds up her house. She builds up her house. But listen to this. But the foolish woman, the one who didn't have discipline, the one who didn't have any boundaries, the one who didn't have any guidance in the home at all, You know what she does? She tears down her home with her own hands. Proverbs 14.9 says this, Fools or undisciplined sons mock at sin. They mock at sin. Ha! You don't have any authority. And that's the society we're living in. If we have any teachers here today, you can tell us stories after stories after stories of the problems that the schools are having today. Fools mock at sin. No discipline. Proverbs 19.3, The ultimate in all of this, the heart of a fool, the heart of one. Again, this is not talking about ignorant people. This is talking about undisciplined people. The heart of the one who is undisciplined rages against the Lord. He rebels even against God and can't respond to the authority of God because he never learned at any time to respond to the authority of his parents. Jean Clark, the woman who wrote this book that I recommended some time ago, Self-Esteem is a Family Affair, and speaking of discipline was speaking of one of the dimensions of a lack of discipline that's very damaging in the home. And again, she was speaking of this balance. And she was speaking of the parents who was constantly giving in to the kids and constantly going their way and always being intimidated and the kids just manipulating the family all around. She gave a term to those kinds of parents as being marshmallow, Parents. And whenever behavior by a parent toward their children was one of constantly giving in and never setting any guidelines at all, it was considered marshmallow-ing kinds of behavior. And she said basically this, that parents are in a home, parents are there for this specific purpose, to give the children a firm foundation from which they can push off into life. And marshmallows aren't very good things to push off from. There's no sense of security or stability from which to firmly launch. No direction. Again, I need to give you, again, since this is not my realm, I start quoting people when I start talking about that kind of thing. I need to give you a biblical example of this, and it's really easy to find one. I think a beautiful example of a marshmallowing kind of parent was Eli the prophet. Now, we all know about that, and I want you to turn to it. 1 Samuel, chapter 1. put your finger in Ephesians we'll bounce back there in just a few minutes 1 Samuel chapter 1 3b we're talking about Eli and it says in the end of that verse and the two sons of Eli Hophni and Phinehas were priests to the Lord there Eli had two sons Hophni and Phinehas now I'm going to tell you something with names like that you don't have much of a chance right off the bat I mean you're going to have problems if you name your kids Hophni and Phinehas just like I'm going to have problems if I name our kid Methuselah. We're going to have problems right off the bat. So that's his first problem. Give your kids a decent name. It has nothing to do with it. What we have here basically is we know that Eli has two sons and they have followed along in daddy's footsteps. They're both priests. The problem that Eli had, however, was this. And I don't want to sound crude, but I'm going to do it anyway. No, I'm not. Eli was very much like us. He knew how to pass on a physical seed, but he didn't know how to pass on a righteous seed, not to his son. He had his head buried in the sand when it came to passing on a righteous seed to his kids. And by the way, we don't have time to go into this study, but that was borne out when Samuel was given to Eli. The same kind of problem was there. He didn't have, he had his head buried in the sand when it came on to passing on the righteous seed to his kids. It says that very thing in Samuel chapter 2, verse 12. Turn to that. Gives us an indication of what those kids were like. Chapter 2, verse 12, Now the sons of Eli, they really beat around the bush in the word of God, were worthless men, were worthless men, and they did not know the Lord. I think in the King James Version it says they were sons of Belial. They were sons of the devil, which basically meant they didn't know the Lord. They didn't belong to God. They belonged to Satan. They were bad kids. By the way, that's a real indictment, or not an indictment, but a warning to some of us who come to church all the time and know the Lord and love the Lord and think that somehow by osmosis our kids are going to get it. They won't. Not just by osmosis. There needs to be that involvement with those kids and the disciplining of those kids and the giving of the guidelines and that whole shot. His kids were worthless. They didn't know the Lord and the result of that condition was that God judged that family. God dealt with Eli. The first thing that Eli lost was his ministry. We see that in chapter 2, verse 30. The second thing he lost was his sons. Both of them died on the same day, and God said it was going to come. And he said, Eli, this is my judgment of you. First of all, your ministry is over, and second of all, your sons are gone. They died. Now, that's a pretty heavy price to pay. Why? What did Eli do wrong? That's what every one of us as parents say. When things go wrong and our kids go off, and we don't know what to do, and we say, why? There's two real obvious problems that Eli had. Eli was terribly lacking in both of the dimensions we've been talking about. First of all, if he loved his kids, if he loved his kids, he didn't let them know. He might have loved them way down deep in his heart, like we love our kids. Why? I love my kids. They didn't know it, and I'll show you that in a minute. And the second thing is, he didn't discipline his kids either. Both of those dimensions that we think here from the word of God are absolutely necessary were both missing in Eli's relationship with his children. Let's look first of all in chapter 2, verse 22. Chapter 2, verse 22. Now Eli was very old and he heard all that his sons were doing to all of Israel and how they lay with the women who served at the doorway of the tenth of the meeting. And he said to them, why are you doing those things, the evil things that I hear from those people? I hear from those people that you're doing those things. Now my sons, for the report is not good, which I hear the Lord's people circulating about. Where was he? One of the problems that Eli had was that he wasn't there. He didn't know at all what his kids were doing. He was hearing from other people what was happening, and he wasn't involved with his children's life. He wasn't home. He was busy doing God's work, and he wasn't doing the things that God had called him to do in the home. How were they supposed to catch his love? were they supposed to just know it I don't think kids just know it I think that's something we really need to think hard on it's amazing to me how artificial sometimes it feels for me to sit down with my 5 year old and my 4 year old right there and look them in the eye and say I love you and they just beam and it feels so well they know that I don't have to tell them yes I do yes I do and yes you do I don't think you just pick it up kids don't have the ability that we think they should to just be able to decode all of our behaviors well this behavior means da da da da I think they need to be told you know what I don't think Eli played with his kids I don't think he wrestled with them can you see Eli the prophet wrestling with Hophni and Phinehas picture that no can't do it I don't think he played with them I don't think he had a relationship with them the second thing however that he did that was also the defilement of that relationship was in chapter 3, verse 13. Listen to this. Verse 13. God's talking to Samuel here, by the way, and he says this, For I have told him that I am about to judge his house, Eli's house, forever for the iniquity which he knew. Because his sons, listen to this, because his sons brought a curse on themselves, and listen, and he did not rebuke them. I want to introduce something to you here. I don't really believe that Eli's biggest problem was the fact that his kids went bad. Eli's biggest problem, and the reason Eli was accountable to God was one, because he wasn't involved in their lives, and two, because he didn't discipline them. You remember what the qualifications for leadership in a church are? You remember, we could go to 1 Timothy 3, 1, and you could be able to almost recite it by heart. He's to be blameless, above reproach, the husband of one wife, and one of the verses in verse 4, I believe, verse 3. 4, verse 4. He is to be able to manage his household well. He is to be able to manage his own household well with all dignity. And if he can't do that, then how is he able to manage, same word, the house of God? The word manage there is extremely important for us to understand. It means to stand before. It means to lead in that home with care and diligence. And the simple truth is this, that if you don't stand before your family well, If you don't lead with care and diligence in your family, there's no way in the world and there's no reason to believe that you're going to lead with care and diligence in the church of God. I want you to notice something, and I believe that's important. I believe that it's possible for parents to manage well their homes, to stand before in a godly way, to stand before them and share their lives and have good discipline, and to still have those children leave and reject. one of the things we're studying in Ephesians 4 in Ephesians 6 1 through 4 is that there is a responsibility for the parents and there is a responsibility to the children and the children are responsible for their decisions and their directions in the Old Testament in fact there is provision made there are examples given of parents who had trained their children and loved their children and there was still rebellion wrapped up in their hearts and at that point they were brought to the temple or in our day they would be brought to the courts and they were punished there because they wouldn't receive the discipline in the home I do believe that it's possible for us to manage well the home and still have the kids rebel I think it's an incredible guilt trip we sometimes lay on people just absolutely assuming that if our kids are struggling then you must have done something wrong well we all do something wrong none of us are perfect parents. I think that's important to know. And the way I can even illustrate that in the body of Christ is by saying simply this. Our responsibility as leadership in the church is to do what? Is to manage it well. Is to tell the truth. But that is no guarantee that the people in the congregation are not going to go the other direction. There's no guarantee. Our responsibility is to manage well. The congregation's responsibility is to respond to God. important you know what else that means I'll just lay this on you I also believe that that it also means that if my responsibility is an individual kind of thing and my responsibility is to manage well that house and love those kids and discipline those kids and what they do with that is their responsibility now that it's also possible to have the exact opposite thing that just because my kids are okay and find the Lord and even end up serving him that it doesn't necessarily mean that I manage my household well. Might have been incredibly immature, might have been incredibly lacking love, might have been incredibly lacking discipline or too much, and yet somehow God intervened and picked that child up and dealt with him and began to use him, and that child's responsibility was caught by them. I don't want to just pick somebody out, but when I was doing this, I thought of John Egan. I remember him preaching and telling the story of a father who was an alcoholic, and he never felt loved, and he always felt abused, and yet God picked him up and moved him out, and his father didn't manage well. My responsibility as a father is to manage that household well. My children's responsibility is to respond to God, and I'm going to lay that responsibility right on them. Dads and moms manage your households well. Discipline's a must. Maybe a simple definition of discipline to help us kind of, and this isn't all inclusive, but one that might help you put some hooks on, is discipline is letting your children experience consequences for behavior. Okay? Letting your children experience consequences for behavior. Now, I want you to notice something that that broadens the word of discipline for me quite a lot. That means it broadens my definition of discipline because what that does, is discipline doesn't just become a thing that I'm inflicting on my children. No, discipline is when I go, whammo, because you're bad. Discipline, then, if discipline really is letting them experience consequences for behavior, then a consequence for a good behavior is a reward. That's good discipline. You got that? Then a consequence for a good behavior, for good achievement or a good attitude, is a reward. Right now. It seems too often that as parents, one of the things we're always going toe-to-toe with our kids on and looking eyeball to eyeball is when they've done something wrong. Think about that. It's always that negative contact. you know, I wouldn't talk to my kid if we didn't fight. Discipline, letting them experience the consequences for behavior. Let me just give you some suggestions, and these aren't canon. These are just some things that my wife and I even are just kind of working through and trying to learn. First of all, in discipline and letting them feel the consequences of behavior, look for ways in which they can learn from natural consequences. See, I believe that God has built into an awful lot of our behavior natural kinds of consequences. I think the older the kids get, the better this works. That's why when they're young, I think often the little part of their body on the back with all the flesh is a real wonderful place to have a natural consequence happen on them. And when they get older, there are natural consequences that I can deal with them on that are very helpful. But even as a young child, just give you some examples that are just incredible traumas in our house when somebody spills milk. oh i remember when i spilled milk when i was a kid it was about the end of the world what's the consequence for spilling milk you clumsy how come you do that you know and on and on and this is a major trauma natural consequence for spilling milk now this is for my kids they're five they're old enough to do this you clean it up and you don't have any milk left it's a natural consequence you do without milk and you clean it up all by yourself i'm not going to jump and clean it up and yell at you while I'm doing it. That's what we do. I grab this one. I clean it up. Natural consequence, good discipline, teaching himself discipline, clean it up, no milk. Another good one that happens to us. And all this revolves around eating. I don't know. We have wars, or did. We don't have any more. When we eat, there's just these, you know, you better eat your food.
