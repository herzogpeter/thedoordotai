We come now to the Word of God. Our study this morning brings us to Acts chapter 2. Continuing our study in the 37th verse through the 41st, I'd like you to open your Bibles to that passage this morning. As you do, I'm going to remind you of where we are in the study. Last week as we came together, we heard the Sermon of Peter, where in an effort to explain the amazing events of Pentecost, he took his stand with the eleven according to chapter 2 verse 22 and began to preach Jesus as the explanation for these events. In fact it says that in verse 33. It is he, that is Jesus, who has poured forth these things which you have seen and heard here today. The wind and the fire and these languages from common Galileans. Jesus the Nazarene is the source of it all. But he began to preach Jesus in verse 22. The Nazarene, remember him? The one you rejected, he was a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs. You rejected God, attested to him. He affirmed him. You despised him. God had a different opinion. He delivered him up as the worthy lamb, the holy one, the spotless one. You killed him. God had a different opinion, so much so that he raised him after you killed him. You reviled him. God had a different opinion. God exalted him and then said to him, sit at my right hand. Right hand, in the place of authority, the place of ruling. I want you to sit there until I make thine enemies a footstool for thy feet. You scorned him, but God had a different opinion. God made him both Lord and Christ. God declared him to be king. Therefore, verse 36, let all of the house of Israel know for certain that God did indeed make him both Lord and Christ. Peter preached Jesus. And I believe with all my heart that when we do that, even today, preach Jesus, that it has an effect. Especially when the preaching of Jesus is coming in the context of the empowering, the raw empowering of the Holy Spirit of God. As clearly as it did in Acts chapter 2. It has an effect. Sometimes the effect is that people bolt for the door. Sometimes the effect is that people bow to him as their sovereign king. Let's examine the effect of the people who were listening to Peter's words on this particular day. Verse 37. Now when they heard this, what God's opinion of the Nazarene was, they were pierced to the heart. And said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, brethren, what shall we do? We rejected him. It's too late for us. And Peter said to them, repent, and let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit for the promises for you and for your children and for all of those who are far off from God. My addition from God. As many as the Lord our God shall call to himself. And with many other words, he solemnly testified and kept on exhorting them, saying, be saved from this perverse generation. So then those who had received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about 3,000 souls. Let's pray as we begin. Father, I really believe this is an important word. And sometimes when I feel that there's this tendency in my flesh to somehow crank it up in my flesh. And I pray that you just deliver me from that. I pray if anybody's heart gets pierced today, it'd be mine. Do it even as I preach. And God, I pray your spirit would be the voice we hear. I pray it'd be your voice we hear. Do your work. Anoint your word. May the Logos become the Rhema, a specific word to our hearts. I pray that in Jesus' name. Amen. There's four aspects of this event that I think are worth examining. First of all, the conviction of heart that we see in verse 37, I think is an incredible thing. I want to examine that. The second thing I want to look at is the call of Peter in verse 38 to these people who were under conviction. What do we do? The third thing is the promise. And the fourth thing is the conversion itself that we see, the turning of their lives in verse 41. Let's look first of all at the conviction. Now having heard this or these words that God's opinion of Jesus the Nazarene was that he was Lord and Christ, they were pierced to the heart. Literally what that means, it's an incredible picture. It means to penetrate or literally to pierce with a sharp instrument like a needle or a knife. Picture that, like a needle or a knife coming into the heart. It carries with it the idea of suddenness. It carries with it the idea of being jolted in some way. It is intrusive. It is arresting. It is in every way an interception. It's the picture of someone going in a certain direction and also all of a sudden being penetrated in the heart or pierced in the heart. It means there is an arresting. It is a sudden thing. It is a jolting thing. I do not think it is an altogether pleasant thing. It is not an altogether unpleasant thing. But being pierced to the heart isn't warm and gooey, I don't think, on the front end anyway. These original hearers in verse 22 were defined for us as being the men of Israel, the people of Israel. They were defined even further in verse 5 of chapter 2 as being devout men from every nation. That means, according to our study last week, we discovered is that they were religious people. They felt they knew God. In fact, they felt they knew God more than most people know God. They were going through their lives at this particular time. And I think like a lot of us, maybe even in this room, they were pretty much minding their own business. They were pretty well satisfied, I think, with the life that their direction, the direction that their life was going. I think they were satisfied with that. They were following the tradition of their elders. They were keeping their rules. They were zealous in keeping the rules. They were indeed devout. And suddenly they hear this message from this man, fisherman. To us he is the apostle. To them he was this common person. A sermon that basically said this to them. You could not possibly be further from God than you are right now. You need to know, men of Israel, devout men of Israel. you are going in entirely the wrong direction. You are giving your lives to entirely the wrong things. And at that moment, at least these people in verse 37 were intercepted. They were arrested. They were brought up short. They were pierced to the heart. And as I said a moment ago, it is not an entirely pleasant experience to be told you are going in absolutely, completely the wrong direction. I want you to think with me for a moment. have you ever been pierced to the heart you ever fallen under what the bible calls conviction i want to clarify that because when i ask you that question i am not talking about a phony manipulative guilt trap guilt trip uh we've all fallen under that kind of thing and that is not what I'm talking about. I'm not talking about Matthew 23 where Jesus confronted the Pharisees for this kind of behavior where they were tying heavy loads on people and doing nothing to lift it off. Those kinds of things are coming from the enemy. I'm talking about a whole different thing. I'm talking about what happens when the Spirit of God falls. I'm talking about what happens among God's people and even among people who aren't God's people. What happens to them when God shows up. You know, all through history, as history records, certain times of revival, there are marks of revival. And much like Pentecost, what marks revival are signs and wonders and wind and fire. What marks revival and what marks Pentecost is an empowered people and powerful preaching. But one of the things that constantly marks the moving of the Spirit of God without manipulation, empty, demonic even guilt trips, is the moving of the Spirit that brings a different thing, that is conviction. the piercing of the heart. It is what happens when, for some imperceptible reason, some supernatural reason, we are hearing the voice of a person, the voice of a common man or a common woman, and somehow, someway, God takes those words that are altogether human and they become God's words, and when it becomes God's word, it pierces the heart. Hebrews 4.12 says God's word, more than, by the way, just the written word, but God's word. Have you ever studied the Bible and it was dry? It's just because this thing you were studying. And then somehow the spirit invades it and it becomes literally God's word. And what God's word is, is living. God's word is active. God's word is sharper than any two-edged sword. And God's word has the ability to pierce as far as the division from soul and spirit. I can imagine preaching a sermon that would do that. Those are my words. My words cannot do that. God's word does. When all of a sudden the words of a man gets translated into God's word, things begin to be exposed. And God's word is able to judge the thoughts and intents of the heart and all things get laid open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do. Those kinds of experiences are the things that move us into life, but on the front end, those things are not altogether pleasant, but they are good and they are necessary. And for some people, at certain times in their lives, they are absolutely life-saving. You need to understand that this kind of piercing is different than listening to a sermon or some sort of word and just thinking, hmm, that's a good word. It's different than that. It's not just thinking, hmm, that's a good thought. You know, I like that. That really makes me think. Okay, that's a good, that's very good when that happens. Profitable. It ought to happen every time someone opens the word. but when you've been pierced through the heart it's an arresting it's an intrusion it's a word that says you know you know you know you need to think about something you need to think about that maybe you're going in the right direction because it is intrusive it is not always received well in fact it's interesting in acts chapter 5 verse 33 peter is preaching jesus peter is preaching jesus again under the anointing empowering of the holy spirit of god and the result of his preaching in verse 33 is this. They were cut to the quick. Again, just like here, pierced to the heart. Only in Acts 5, the response to this piercing of their heart is that they sought to kill Peter. Different response. In Acts chapter 7, verse 54, Stephen is preaching Jesus under the anointing of the Spirit of God. And the result in verse 54, they were pierced to the heart. Something got through and it revealed them to themselves. And the result of that was not repentance. The result of that was that they began gnashing their teeth at Stephen and picked up stones to kill him, and they ultimately did. Whatever else that communicates, what it tells me is this, that just because we get our hearts pierced, just because the Word of God does come with power and open us up, even expose us to ourselves, it does not automatically mean that all by itself that has redemptive value, that has healing value. See, how we respond to that exposure is what determines whether we move into light or stay in darkness, whether we move into life or remain in our death, whether we move into grace or remain under judgment. This group, having been pierced to the heart, at least 3,000 of them responded very well. They responded with this phrase, what do we do? Think of all the ways they could have responded. They could have gotten angry. Oh, boy, did they have reason to get angry. You've got to remember again who he's saying this to, devout men, devout people in Israel, there at the Pentecost feast because they were knowing God and Peter in this sermon that I can't resurrect from last week, but if you could play it back, the theme of it was this, you who think you know God couldn't possibly be further from God. They could have gotten angry, they could have gotten defensive, but they didn't for some reason. And I think the reason was simply the overwhelming presence and power of the Holy Spirit. For some reason, they were able to put down their defenses. You've ever been able to do that? You might have even been defensive, but somehow the Spirit moved on you. Your Spirit just moved on you, and you put your defenses down. It is so frightening and terrible, but it's so liberating. For some reason, you put your rationalizations away. You know, we come to meetings like this even. I have them. I know what that tension feels like of hanging on to my ration and my denials about what my issues are. But for some reason, when the Spirit falls, all that stuff just gets put away. And these men and women, for some reason, I think the Spirit, they allowed themselves to feel what we would do just about anything not to feel. They allowed themselves to feel a desperate kind of sadness, a godly kind of helplessness, and a healthy kind of fear. What do we do? What do we do? get a sense of their sin. I really do believe we would do just about anything to avoid those kinds of feelings. But the fact is this, if you never ever at any level get a sense of those kinds of feelings because by the presence of God, your rationalizations and your denials are stripped away and you begin to see what some of the hidden things in your life are, if you never ever experience that and manage to avoid it and keep your denial system well intact, the saddest part of that is you will never experience amazing grace. Because amazing grace comes to the desperate who are saying, what do we do? What do we do? We can't undo what we have done. We have rejected the Holy One. Point number two, Peter gives them an answer. It comes in the form of a call to repent. He says, repent. Repent. Think on that word a little bit. let me ask you a question about that word the question is this do you like that word? is that a fun word for you? you know it dawns on me and this may be just going through my grid but sadly many of us myself included often associate this word with legalism it is not a legalistic word we associate it with my mental image of somebody screaming at you with a long bonny finger You are all scum! Repent! You know, and we all go, okay, great. We associate it very often with a fanaticism that repels and alienates. But I want to stand before you this morning and as gently, but as powerfully as I can appeal to you, say this. This word, repent, it's a good word. It's a good word. It's a God word. It's a welcome word in this church. It is a grace word. It is a word, in fact, that I believe needs a resurrection in the church of Jesus Christ. Repent. And I'll tell you why I think it's a good word. It's because with this word comes forgiveness. That's why it's a good word. With this word comes freedom. With this word comes the gift and the gifts of the Holy Spirit. With this word, repent, comes the grace that we preach from this pulpit Sunday after Sunday after Sunday. Beloved, we need to embrace this word. It needs a resurrection. Repent. What does it mean? literally many of you probably could teach this part it means a change of heart it means a change a turn a change of heart the turning of direction literally at the at the base of it it means to change your mind to change your mind question that would follow that would be this about what change my mind about what things might run through your mind well we need to change our mind about sin we need to change our mind about behaviors and priorities and that is all true and that is all part of what we need to repent of, I suppose. But one of the things that we do in this church week after week is try as hard as we can to stay with the text. And if we are to stay with the text, the text reveals that what Peter is asking these people to repent of or change their mind about is something that is deeper than the behaviors. Behaviors are incredibly important because of what our behaviors reveal about what's going on in here. But Peter is getting to the very core through this call of repentance to these people of their lives. What they needed to change their mind about was the Nazarene. What they needed to change their mind about was who Jesus was. Their opinion, these people Peter was speaking to, of Jesus until now was that he was of no account, He was irrelevant. He had no say in their lives. He was impotent. We might feel sorry for this Nazarene. We certainly wouldn't bow to him as a king. Maybe now it wouldn't be so much pity that you would have for Jesus. I would imagine some of you, however, would be at best in terms of your dealing with the Nazarene polite. We will be polite. We will tip our hat. We will be respectful. but this concept of him being a king is something that does not affect you. What we need to hear in Peter's sermon is this. God's opinion of the Nazarene is this. He is both Lord and Christ. That means this. He is the king. He is not just my savior and redeemer. He is my king. And as a king, what that means is he's got a right to rule right here. And sometimes I need to change my mind about who's in charge. Sometimes I need to change my mind about who decides for me. Sometimes I need to change my mind about who's in control, about who runs the show. Because every once in a while, the person I think decides and is in charge and runs the show and is in control is me. And then I'm the king. And God said, he's the king. Repent means we need to change our mind about who the king is, who runs the show, who decides for me. You see, at the core of my view of what sin is in my own life, at the core of my behaviors, at the core of my attitudes, at the core of my entire philosophy of life, at the core of my understanding of morality, what is right and what is wrong, is a question. And the question is this, who decides that for me? Who decides that for you? Who decides for you what is morally right, what is morally wrong? Who decides for you your philosophy of life? Who decides for you the behaviors? Who decides for you what is sin and what isn't? Who decides for you? You? Then you're the king. Who's the king? Who's the king? I've got to tell you that I'm giving this to you, but this is something, as much as I know how open in my heart to this, God, I want you to reveal places in me where I need to take a real hard look about who's deciding, who's the king, who's in control. These concepts come to me, I think about it during the week. You know, all week long I'm thinking of these things. Who decides all this? Who's the authority? Who decides what's right and wrong? And on and on. And it just gets kind of laid over in my life. You know, the things I hear all week long on the radio, on the television, what's going on in my house and all these other things. And I begin to just ask weird questions like, you know, who are the authorities in our world? Not just in the church, but in the world. Who are the voices that we listen to? And it's hard for me to ask that question without thinking about the media. You know, just the whole media. And I know they're a great target, and preachers love to yell at the media. I'm going to do it, I guess. You know, who decides for us what's morally right and morally wrong? I think Phil Donovan. You know? Phil Donovan. Oprah Winfrey. And all these talk shows. You know, I think it's on my TV. I'm watching. I'll listen. It's fun how they have entertainers. Let's put a microphone in an entertainer's mouth. What do you think about morality? Tell us. You are the authority. Why? Because they dance. I don't know why. Why are they the authority? we love to ask athletes well how do you think someone should run their life Bo knows you let's ask Bo no bro is a great football player I love watching Bo I don't care what he thinks couldn't care like couldn't I who decides who decides Peter at the beginning of the ministry of the kingdom of God the new covenant is laying on the first words. We need to change our mind about who the king is. We have a very large church. I don't know everybody here, obviously. Sometimes I get this yicky feeling. I don't know hardly anybody here. But I think I'm pretty well in tune, and I hear things, and I just kind of pick up the spirit of the age, that has, in ways that we might not even like to think of, have invaded our homes and even our church and even my home and my thinking. And I think young people, older people, who decides for us about our attitudes toward things as basic and I think important and not spoken enough from the pulpit, issues like virginity? Who decides for you about that? You? Then you're the king. Who decides for us issues like fidelity and purity and just common morality? Who decides for us? I think it's time for the church to ask that question. Who decides for us? In ways, and this is not that. This is an appeal. Let's pay attention to the voices we listen to. Let's pay attention to the voices. We listen to a lot of liars. We do. If I'm lying, don't pay attention to me. We get lied to all the time about what is right and what is wrong, about where life is and where it isn't. And just hear the words of Peter. Deny his word if you want, but here's Peter's opinion. God made Jesus Lord in Christ. He's the authority. He decides. Young people, older people, somewhere along the line, we need to change our mind about who decides what happens on our dates. And somewhere along the line, the king has got to begin to have a powerful impact on how our families look and how our church looks and how our dates look, right down to where we live. Hear my heart on this. Just hear my heart. The core of repentance is changing our mind about who decides. See, I could yell and scream and threaten and warn all day long about sinful behaviors and wrong perspectives. But you know what I know? If Jesus isn't your king, it doesn't matter. so that's where I'm going to go I'm going to go there we can argue about behaviors and you'll go I don't think it's wrong and I'll go I don't think it is I don't think it is I'm not going to do that with you I'm not going to do that with you I just want to give you this who decides for you who decides who decides God made him Lord and Christ he is the king he's got a right to rule or else he doesn't decide repentance means changing my mind about who decides. It also means changing my mind about who is the source. You know, 1 Thessalonians 1.9 says, they turned to God from idols to serve the living God. There was a turning there. Did you hear it? They turned to God from idols to serve the living God. Now, if you've been around here long enough, you've heard us talk about idolatry. And idols and idolatry is not just a little stupid statue, a big fat Buddha, that weird pagan somewhere in another part of the world bow down to and chant weird chants. Idolatry is simply this. Anything other than God that I look to to get my life. Anything other than Jesus that I'm using to fill the empty places in my life. Sometimes the things that I use to fill the empty places in my life look real good. Sometimes what I try to fill my life with is even my ministry and all the things I'm doing. And you know what? If I'm doing what I'm doing because I'm connected with my king and my source and getting life from him, and from that flows my ministry, that is a wonderful thing and it is even a fulfilling thing. But if I have begun to do my ministry and all my churchy things to get full, it is idolatry. And these people turn from their idols to God to serve him, and from that came their ministry. Sometimes it's less, it's more subtle things even than that. Well, more bold things. That's the most subtle, I think. That's the one that's hardest to confront. But sometimes we get our life from the houses we live in, the cars we drive, the careers, the money, the status, our family. Sometimes it's things that we would identify as patently negative. Whatever it is you get your life from, whatever it is you bow down to as the source of your life, that thing is what you'll give your life to. So if you're trying to figure out, by the way, Well, this is such an obscure concept. I don't know about where I get my life. What do you serve? What are you giving your life to? You've just found what it is you get your life from. So that's a weird thing, too. It's not like, serve God! That's like arguing about behaviors. Who's your source? Who's your source? You know what? If he's your source, if you get your life from him, what I know about everybody, whatever they get their life from is what they give their life to. It's just the way it is. And some of us need to change our mind about who the king is. Some of us need to change our mind before they walk out that door today about who decides. But some of us need to change our mind today about who the source is. But see the good news here while I'm kind of yelling at you? The good news is if you're getting your life from anything but Jesus, you're going to keep on being thirsty and you're going to keep on being hungry. And there's a well that you can drink from. And the well is Jesus. and from that well, when you drink from it, you will never thirst again. You could even die and you will live. So repent, change your mind. I hope you catch the fact that this is a word to unredeemed people, but it's also a word to redeemed people, isn't it? Even those of us who've been in need of Jesus as our king and our source, constantly, like sheep that wander, we wander to other kings and other gods and other sources, And constantly the shepherd who loves us brings us back and brings us back. And that's why we need to repent and turn, change our mind. And be baptized in the name of Jesus for forgiveness of sin. Oh, my. Oh, my. This is kind of weird. It sounds like the essential ingredient for forgiveness here is baptism. It sounds frighteningly legalistic. I get baptized and you can't get forgiven unless you get baptized. The fact is this indeed, some do teach that without baptism, until you are baptized, you are not forgiven. So in the gap, excuse me, sniffing my nose constantly sounds real tacky on the tape. So in this gap, you see, between my genuine godly repentance and coming before him for forgiveness, and my baptism, I'm not really forgiven. If it's true that this verse is teaching that, then we've got a lot of problems with other passages. And I know for a fact that there are a number of people in our church who are coming out of a background where this theology is indeed taught, baptismal regeneration. I think it is a false doctrine. I'm just going to give you one passage to deal with, list a few others. I just want to read one. Of him, and this is Acts 10, verse 43 and following. Of Jesus, all the prophets bear witness that through his name, only. Everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sin. If baptism is the exclusive, if it is the essential, rather, the essential ingredient for salvation and forgiveness, why does this verse not include it? Everyone who believes on his name receives forgiveness of sins. Then it moves on to say this. Then Peter, while he was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the message. He is speaking this the Gentiles. The Holy Spirit fell on them. They hadn't been baptized yet, but the Spirit right here has invaded them. And all the circumcised believers, Jews, who had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit for infilling and empowerment had been poured upon Gentiles of all people. For they were hearing them speaking with tongues and exalting God, just like Acts chapter 2. And then Peter answered, because there was this little argument, surely no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized who have already received the Holy Spirit. What does that say? Among other things, it says that without baptism, they have already received the Spirit. They are already redeemed. They are already empowered. They're already speaking languages to people who can understand the mighty deeds of God. And then they went ahead and did get baptized. Some of you don't struggle with that. You're going, you're yelling at me. I'm preaching this. I already believe this. Some of you do struggle with this significantly. That's one passage that would hopefully clear it up a little bit. Let me give you some others to look at later that clearly reveal that baptism is not the essential ingredient of forgiveness. Acts 13, 38 and 39. Acts 13, 38 and 39. Acts 15, verse 9. Acts 15, verse 9 and Acts 16, 31. And that is only the book of Acts. All through the epistles, you can find places as well. Well, okay, if, David, baptism is not the essential ingredient for forgiveness, what is the point here? Then why does it say it that way? I believe that it says it that way because this baptism here, especially for these people but also for us, is an important part of turning, this changing of the mind. I also believe it is one of those places we need to get into the mind of a Jew to understand their thinking because I really believe that they would have had an understanding of this beyond our understanding of this, therefore responding to it probably more appropriately than we do, and even understanding the exhortation from the beginning. Let me explain this. You see, before baptism or immersions were ever a Christian experience, they were an altogether Jewish experience. What I mean by that is baptism was going on among God's covenant people long before this. this. I don't know if that's a revelation to you, but it was a little bit to me in terms of my broad view of things. I kind of had this idea that maybe John the Baptist's baptizing was the first, and then there's Jesus, and then there's the Christian experience. The Jewish people, God's covenant people, had experience with baptism far beyond any of ours, and understood much of its imagery far more than we do. In fact, the roots of their understanding of baptism and the significance of water being spiritual and having redemptive significance goes as far back as to Noah and the flood and Moses and the Red Sea in Genesis chapter 6. Noah, with God's covenant people, you remember the story, the rains came, the floods went up, covered the earth and all that was in it, killing all that was in it as a judgment. But the word of God says in Genesis 6 that God's covenant people, Noah, passed through the flood, were raised up out of that death to newness of life. And that sounds an awful lot like Romans 6, doesn't it? When you were saved, you were baptized into his death, but you have now been raised to newness of life. That imagery was not lost on Israel, on the Jews, God's covenant people, the Red Sea. This water thing, again, was coming up in terms of significance. You remember the Red Sea? The Israelites were coming, the Egyptians were chasing, the water parted and they passed through. and the water that they passed through separated them from the sin and death of Egypt. And as they passed through and came out the other side, the water came back, and the sin and death of Egypt was in that water. Again, the imagery that kind of emerges from that as it relates to baptism is this, that in that water the old man is dead, and I've been raised in newness of life. Now again, that spiritual imagery was not lost on God's people, and it issued in innumerable baptisms and washings and ceremonial cleansings among the Jews. And when I say ceremonial cleansing, I do not mean insignificant. They spoke to things, these immersions did. They communicated truth, and they created important images of purification, of cleansing, of literally a change in status from being unclean to being clean. The baptism did not make you clean, but it spoke to that. It created a spiritual image that was vitally important for God's people to understand. Aaron, the high priest, when he entered into the Holy of Holies, before he could do his priestly ministry there, needed to have an immersion. And when he went into that immersion, it created for him ceremonially a change of status from being unacceptable to acceptable. Accepted, now he could go into the holy place. Leviticus 14, when lepers got their healing, they would have to go to a priest before they could go into society. They would, after being approved by the priest as being genuinely healed, have to receive an immersion. And the immersion spoke to and imaged for them a change in status from unclean to clean. Now you can move into society. And as I said a moment ago, there were innumerable immersions. It seemed like for a number of facets of their life, they would have not just sprinklings, but immersions. these immersions baptisms were part of everyday life for a Jew and they all spoke to a change of status a cleansing and a purification I believe what Peter is saying here at least in part would have been picked up by the mind of a Jew is this when you change your mind about this Jesus the Nazarene when you repent and turn what I want to tell you is there's going to be one more baptism and this baptism is going to replace the Levitical Mosaic ceremonial baptisms, and this baptism is going to be in the name of Jesus. And from now on, know for certain that your change of status and your cleansing and your purification is not going to be in the Levitical cleansing, mosaic or ceremonial cleansings. It's going to be in this cleansing in Jesus' name. In fact, this one isn't, your cleansing now isn't even going to be in the baptism. It's going to be in the name of Jesus. I want you to be baptized one more time. No more of this. No more mosaic ceremony. Just one more baptism in the name of Jesus this time. And it's in the name of Jesus you're going to find your cleansing. It's in the name of Jesus you're going to find your new status. In the name of Jesus you're going to go from unclean to clean, from unacceptable to acceptable. A brand new person raised to newness of life in the name of Jesus. The focus is the name of Jesus, not even the baptism. They understood baptisms as being symbolic and creating powerful imagery of going from death to life. The physical baptism was physically entering into a spiritual reality of new status, forgiven. Our forgiveness comes from the grace of Jesus. I think another piece here very quickly of the baptism and the importance of it for these people as it related to repentance and changing the mind is that it is publicly identifying them as belonging to the Nazarene. This one that just 50 days ago we rejected and reviled, this public baptism is a public declaration that that one I wanted to nail to a cross 50 days ago, I am now out loud saying to my entire community, he is my king. And public declaration of Jesus' king is important. It's important. You know, we joke about there's a couple things you can't talk about. You can't talk about religion and you can't talk about politics because they're what? Personal. They're personal. And I have my personal relationship with Jesus and it's just me and him and it's very quiet and in the quietness of my own heart, I'll change my mind. And I wonder if Peter was even knowing that the kind of tension that would happen to people if they started publicly acknowledging Jesus as their king, this Nazarene. He's thinking, you know, some of them are thinking, okay, I won't tell anybody, I'll just kind of change my mind and I'll just kind of change it. I really think that part of this baptism is Peter saying, you know, I want some of you to count the cost about this. There's no such thing as a secret disciple. No such thing. Ryrie said this, to this day for a Jew it is not his profession of Christianity, attendance at Christian services, nor acceptance of the New Testament, but water baptism that finally and definitively excludes him from Jewish community and marks him off as dead to his family. It is saying publicly, I choose to bow, in the words of Dan's song, I choose to sing, I choose to crown him the king of kings. Out loud, he is my king. Out loud, he is my source. I have no other. From that flows the promise. It's twofold. Number one, forgiveness. Catch the flow of this. From the desperate awareness of sin in verse 37 came repentance in verse 38, issuing in forgiveness verse 38 at the end of verse 38, and with that forgiveness comes relief, freedom, cleansing, and grace. But this is great because something else came, and it was, dare I say, greater than forgiveness. That's maybe not accurate. It's not good to say that. It's more. It's more. Because not only does he give forgiveness, he gives you the gift of the Holy Spirit. See, not only do you get forgiveness, you get God. You get God. You get God alive in you. Picture it like this. We got more beloved than God at some distance judicially pronouncing acquittal upon us. You know, that would be great if that's all it was. If all he did was say, you are all forgiven. I acquit you. That would be great, and I'd feel the load come off. We get more than that. What we do is we get God. We get the indwelling spirit. We get Christ in me, the hope of glory. We get now born again by a righteous seed, a brand new person, a brand new heart, a brand new identity, dead to the old life, raised to newness of life. God in me, the spirit in me, not just judicial forgiveness, but a brand new life. And what we get that Holy Spirit gift for, among other things, is empowerment. Empowerment to become a child of God. John 1, 12 says, But as many as change their mind about the Nazarene, but as many as receive Christ, to them he gives the what? Power by the Holy Spirit indwelling to become a son of God, even to those who believe on his name. We get the Holy Spirit not only for that, but we get the Holy Spirit for empowerment to walk in true holiness. Not this external performance, but by the filling of the Spirit, genuine sanctification, born of God and not my striving. And not only that, with that gift of the Holy Spirit comes what we're talking about all through Acts chapter 2. This empowering to minister beyond any capacity that I have in human stuff. We get the Holy Spirit. What a gift. What a gift. And this promise of the Holy Spirit and new life and forgiveness is for you, and it's for your children, and it's for all of those who are far off. In one sense, it could mean everybody you know who is far from God. In a real technical sense in this passage, it's speaking specifically of the Gentiles. Ephesians 2 speaks of the Gentiles who are far off, alienated, strangers from the promise, without hope and without God. This word of the gospel is for them too. As many as the Lord our God shall call to himself. And with many other words, verse 40, Peter solemnly testified and kept on exhorting. Just a little note here, many other words. What that tells me is that Peter preached long. So just deal with it. He preached longer. It was longer than this passage, you know. Nobody's ever come to me about this, but I've thought, you know, Peter preached a sermon from verse 22 to 47. I read it in two and a half minutes. How come you take 40 minutes for three weeks? 40 minutes, you're being nice, too. He said many other words, many, many. In the Greek, it's many other words. last thing is conversion verse 41 so then those who had received his word were baptized and there was added to that day about 3,000 souls it's a real important thing 3,000 souls 3,000 souls then say 3,000 church members then say 3,000 people who came to an auditorium said 3,000 people were redeemed made new went from death to life some people changed their mind that day about who was the king and when they did God changed their status from unclean to clean from unacceptable to acceptable from being far off to being brought near by the precious blood of Jesus no longer strangers and aliens but fellow citizens with all the saints and of God's household when they heard this, verse 37, they were pierced to the heart, said to Peter, what do we do? Peter said, change your mind. Can I just end with that? How many here need to change their mind? Anybody here need to change their mind? Maybe redemptively, there's some people here in significant ways who deny and reject and ignore Jesus. Oh, okay, you know, I'll respect you as a person and welcome you here. Would you just hear God's opinion of the Jesus that you scorn? God's opinion is this. He is both Lord and Christ. He is at my right hand. I affirmed him, God said. I raised him, I exalted him, and I made him Lord and Christ. But I want to also talk to believers today, because I think this is a word for believers too, who at some time in their life and in a very real way have acknowledged Jesus as their Savior and as their King. but as I said even earlier like sheep we wander like sheep we wander and we listen to other voices you know at the end of verse 40 it says be saved from this perverse generation one of the things I think about when I hear that little phrase if I were to say that here it would be we need to know that we live in a generation that lies to us you're being lied to every day about where life is found you're being lied today every day of our lives we get lied to about who has the right to decide you have it, you are the king that's what we hear all the time nobody can tell you what okay fine nobody can then you're the king but to believers I would like to think I've got a hook here somewhere that says that Jesus in you is calling for repentance of some sort that says maybe you need to change your mind about who decides maybe you need to change your mind about who's in charge who's in control who runs the show conviction of sin and repentance toward God is one of the marks. Not of getting yelled at and screamed at. It's one of the things that happens when the spirit falls. It's one of the things that happens when we preach Jesus. I'd like to ask God to bring it here. Would you pray with me? Stand. Lord, again, I am struck with the reality that whatever the words that I just said were, some of them I'm already forgetting them. They run together with all the three different services. It might have been right and good, and we might have even rightly divided the word, and that's a good thing and important, and you've called us to do that. But if your spirit doesn't come and move, what pierces the heart is your voice, your word. And so in Jesus' name, without any stirring anything up, I just ask your spirit to come and fall upon your people here. And just reveal to us maybe some of the blind spots we've got where we're acting like we're the king. And Father, that you would move among us in such a way so as to continue raising up a group of people who really know what it means to bend their knee to you. As a sovereign king, God, you have made him both Lord and Christ. We acknowledge that. We really do. But we've got blind spots where we're acting so arrogantly, like we're the king and we decide. We don't, you do. Bring a spirit of conviction and, God, I pray, a spirit of repentance as well. Not phony guilt. Not false guilt. But a born of the spirit repentance that leads to forgiveness and life and light. and the power of the Holy Spirit.
