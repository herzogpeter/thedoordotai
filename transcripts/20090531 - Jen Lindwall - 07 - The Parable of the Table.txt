Being important means more to me than my husband and my daughter. Now, you're probably sitting there hearing that, thinking, what? That is not true. I say that, and I think, that is not true. But how I live proves that is, in fact, true. Case in point, a few months ago, I was asked to do a seminar at a conference by a professor from a local college. I was kind of flattered by the invitation. I haven't been invited to do this too much. And I thought, this is a kind of important opportunity for me to present some of the things that I'm learning, to kind of be with people in my field and give some legitimacy and value to my job. Plus, there was brochure with bios and headshots. It's not bad, right? And so with little information but that, I said yes. right away. Some of you already know what I might have left out of this equation. I did not talk this over with my husband. And for those of you who don't know me, in our family, my husband is the primary caregiver for our 18-month-old daughter. And so when I decided to say yes for me, I also said yes to something for him. I did think of telling him later that day, but since I'd already said yes, I thought, you know, I should just try to slip this in somewhere. Maybe when we're going to bed sometime when it won't stir up too much dust, but I didn't tell him that night, and I didn't tell him the next night, and I did not tell him the next night. And as time went on, I got more information about what I had signed up for. Turns out the conference was actually at a camp up north on a Saturday. Whoops, that was a little bit harder to just slip in. A few weeks passed, and then a month, and at this point, I realized there was no going back. I could not reverse my decision, and it wasn't until nearly six weeks later. We were on a date or something, and I started a sentence with, I'm really sorry, honey, but. And as I was giving this sort of pre-planned spiel, I was thinking, what on earth was I thinking? What would make me think that it was okay to say yes to a full-day commitment on a Saturday without talking to my spouse? I made this decision without really considering what I would tell you is the most important thing in my life. Do I really think I'm that big of a deal? Am I really that obsessed with being someone, with having some sort of social recognition, that I would marginalize my own husband and daughter to teach a seminar at a conference? Because the way I behave and the decisions that I make communicates to you what I care about and who I care about. not what I tell you I'm about or who I try to convince you that I care about. And if this is true, my question this evening is, what would it take to convince me that my quest for social significance is not the most important thing? What would it take for me to really want to be about something other than myself? Will you pray with me as we jump in? Spirit, please come in this room among us. And just give us the eyes to see, the ears to hear, the courage to consider what we think is the most important thing, how we live that out. Amen. In Luke 14, Jesus finds himself at the house of a prominent Pharisee. He was in a situation that was ripe for him to expose a group of people who cared about little other than themselves and their own importance. And as the guests begin to come through the door to this meal, Jesus watches them and he notices something. They are all taking the place of honor next to the host. So he tells them this parable. It's in Luke 14. It starts in verse 7. When Jesus noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable. When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor. For someone more distinguished than you may have been invited by him. And he who invited you both will come to you and say, Give your place to this man. And then in disgrace you proceed to occupy the last place. But when you are invited, go and recline at the last place. So when the one who has invited you comes, he will say to you, Friend, move up higher. And then you will have honor in the sight of all who are at the table with you. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted. For this parable to make any sense to us, I think we need to understand the significance of meals and banquets and feasts like this in Jesus' time. Meals like this were extremely important social occasions. We see in other places in the Gospel of Luke that who you were invited to eat with, whether or not you cleansed properly before that meal, where you sat at the meal, those were all really important parts of revealing your social status to the people around you. These things communicated to other people who you were and what you were about. In Luke 5.29, the Pharisees accused Jesus of eating with tax collectors and sinners because it mattered who you ate with. The main purpose of the banquet was to underline the host's position at the top of the social hierarchy, and those seats of honor were for the top guests of honor. The meals often took place in a specially designed and created house, part of the house that was called the triclinium. This area usually had three dining couches, and it was in a U-shaped, around a low square table, the middle one for the host, and the two on the sides for the guests. And there was this elaborate, colorful mosaic, and that center part where those couches were was pure white. Tons of emphasis, plenty of breathing room, and the couches were chosen because when those guests came and reclined, They needed tons of servants to wait on them because they couldn't even sit up to reach the food themselves. You could often see this area of the house from the outside so people walking by could look in and see who was sitting in those seats. The less important guests who sat further down were away from the host, sometimes were fed different food, cheaper wine, had less servants. They missed out on that important central conversation, and people passing by could see that they were not the most important guests at the party. So I'm going to read this parable one more time, and as I do, I invite you to picture a scene similar to that in your mind of where Jesus is at and who he's talking to. When Jesus noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable. When you're invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor. For someone more distinguished than you may have been invited by him, and he who invited you both will come to you and say, give your place to this man. And then in disgrace, you proceed to occupy the last place. But when you're invited, go and recline at the last place so that when the one who has invited you comes, he may say to you, friend, move up higher. Then you will have honor in the sight of all who are at the table with you. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted. This is a bold move by Jesus because he is taking a situation he is currently in, something he just saw happen, and turning it into a parable. He is telling it to the people who he saw do it. This is in no way hypothetical or theoretical. It is literally what they're in at that moment. And in this parable, Jesus confronts their entire system of honor, of how a person was recognized and ranked in society. A practice that was at the core of how they lived their lives, part of the foundation of their entire social system. he didn't seem like he even cared about the seats of honor in fact Jesus spent so much of his time with people who had no honor for example on the way into this very meal Jesus encounters a sick man and heals him even though it's the Sabbath and the Pharisees looking on are silent and shocked at what he did he spent his time in places where people did not have honor were on the outside and so Jesus is telling them that what they think is most important is not, in fact, important at all. He acts as if they're even ignorant, foolish, to think that they matter as much as they think they do. So glad we've moved on from that, aren't all of you? A good thing we don't rank ourselves in society, work so hard for recognition from others, feel left out when we're not at the center of some situation. Even though we don't often use the word honorable or have these really specific, strict, cultural customs that communicate our worth. You know, we just didn't grow up with that kind of mindset. This is still a very central part of how we live our lives. And when I first read this parable, I thought, you know, I can't really relate to this meal situation. But when I thought about what the men were trying to do, I saw myself more and more and more. Because the idea of being a person who matters, who's important, has not left our culture. I think we've just revamped it a little bit because now we want to know that we're going somewhere, that we're relevant, that we're successful, that we're effective and efficient at what we do. I matter in the world, and I will convince you of that in whatever way I have to. And so much of this goes on beneath the surface for us. You know, this pushing and striving and seeking to be important comes in these little decisions that we make day to day. Sometimes you get an email from someone maybe that you don't know or you do know and you don't like. You read the email, you put it aside, and you get back to it when it's convenient for you. But there are a list of people who, if they emailed me, would get an immediate response. It's true. I had this happen recently. I got an email from somebody who I, you know, maybe would have considered important on some level, and then in the afternoon I didn't have Internet access, and I really wanted to get back to this person to show them that I cared, that I was so glad they thought of me, And so I'm driving around in my car looking for Internet access so I can email this person back. Why was I doing that? Another subtle tactic that I use is self-deprecation. I mask my concern as kind of humility in an effort to prove to you that I'm not obsessed with myself. In fact, I think I'm totally worthless. So I use energy to convince you of that. With my comments, the way I carry myself, by making jokes up here on stage, whatever. But the truth about that for me, and I think for many of you, is that that's still wrapped up in my effort to be at the center of a situation. I still have an obsession with being noticed and seen and significant and at the top, and so I claw my way slowly but surely to try to get to those couches, to be at the center of that situation so I can be on the inside. These men had this need and this obsession, and when Jesus saw it, he used this parable to expose how wrong their assumptions were about what mattered. He reveals how foolishly you have to be thinking about yourself and other people to actually think you're the most important thing in the world. For one, you have to believe that the most important thing in the world is you being important to actually live in this way. you are asserting that you deserve to have the top seat, to be on the inside at the table. These men went for the seat of honor because they thought they should have it. I deserve to be where the action is, where people who are looking on can really see me for who I am, important, relevant, successful. So I come into a situation, a meal, a meeting, a phone call, thinking about how it's going to benefit me, how I can sort of accomplish my agenda through this conversation, how I can show you that I matter, to which Jesus says to these men, when you are invited to a wedding feast, go and recline in the last place. Have you ever been forced to sit in the last place in some situation? You know, maybe some place where you didn't have control and you sort of were put at the back of the wedding, the back table, or this person who you felt like you knew really well couldn't remember your name, or you had this great idea at work and then it got credited to someone else, it's not really a fun place to be. I had this happen to me recently. This is a really trivial example, but a few weeks ago I was dropping my daughter off at the child care at the YMCA, and this gentleman that I've been taking a workout class with for three years saw me, and he said, is that your daughter? I was like, yeah, this is my daughter. She's 18 months. And he's like, wow, all this time I thought you were 16 years old in class. To be honest, here's what rose up in me in this moment, okay? I know I look young, but I thought, 16? 16? I mean, buddy, you don't even know who I am. I mean, I'm not only a mother, I'm a wife. I work at a church. I speak up front sometimes, you know? I wear this mic. I have this pulpit. I mean, I'm kind of a big deal. I think I deserve to be a little bit better than some sophomore high schooler at the back of the workout class. I even found myself asking, how could I have made it more obvious who I am? I mean, do you think I should have been more social or should I have worn an outfit that matched? Or like, what would have, you know, given it away? You know, and as I sort of thought these ridiculous things, I was thinking, I'm not really asking that much. I'm just asking to be recognized for who I am. You know, I'm not actually in high school. I don't really want to be seen that way, so I just think I deserve to be seen as who I am. See, when the guests claimed the place of honor at these meals, they needed people to see them for as important as they thought that they were. They deserved at least that. But Jesus still says, go and recline in the last place. It doesn't matter who you are. number two thing that you have to do to demand a place in the center is push someone off to the side jesus calls this in this parable taking someone else's seat the definition of marginalizing another person is to put them to the side to literally push someone over and so deciding that i am the most important whether it's conscious or not oppresses and marginalizes someone else when i decided something on behalf of my entire family I marginalize them. I marginalize my husband and daughter when I push them aside to do something for myself. And we do this all the time with our spouses, our kids, our families, our friends. I mean, have you ever faked that you're asleep when your child has woken up at night so your spouse has to deal with it? Or freaked out in your car because someone wouldn't let you in, and then the next day, you know, you got upset and wouldn't let someone else in? Every time we decide that we're the most important thing, we push someone else to the side. We marginalize someone. And so we talk about marginalizing big groups of people, marginalizing the poor and oppressed, but it starts so much earlier than that. In these small ways, with the little decisions that we make in our lives that say I matter the most in this situation. We decide who's important ourselves and push other people to the side. When I claim something belongs to me that I deserve something, I don't take that from somewhere, I take it from someone. And that could be money, recognition, safety, security, it could be anything. It starts in these small ways and then it grows into bigger ways. And I think as we, you know, push to the side the people in our lives, we maybe find it easier to push to the side groups of people, nations of people, whatever. A third thing that you have to do and I have to do and these men had to do to be the most important is to compare yourself to everyone else around. The primary way that I think we find our place in the world is by comparing ourselves to each other. We decide what we deserve based on what we think other people, where they're at, how we compare to them. So a man would enter a room and he'd decide about his own importance by ranking himself. I love how being a parent gives you sort of free reign to compare your kids to everyone else's kids and yourself as a parent to everyone else as a parent. You're not judging them. You're concerned for them. Right? So Ben and I have a lot of friends that we parent differently than, as all you parents probably do. And as our kids have gotten older, we've seen that there's some really different methods that we use, and it's become really obvious. They're using the wrong methods and our right methods I'm talking about here, okay? Recently, we noticed that every time we'd leave from being with certain friends, Ben and I would be just picking apart everything they did and saying comments like, well, that's why their kid is going to be this way. And we'll never do that because we want Esme to be this way. And I was thinking, what is making us think that this is okay? Martin Luther King once said how hard it is for people to live without someone to look down on, really look down upon. It's not just that we feel cheated out of someone to hate. It's that then we have to look at ourselves more closely and the things that we don't like about ourselves. I have no idea how to figure out if I am being a good mother or a good person for that matter without comparing myself to others. I have not been taught to find value in any other way. I don't know what other information to gather to create some sort of roadmap that I would relate to people by. Jesus says in this parable, when you're invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor. For someone more distinguished than you may have been invited by him. In other words, your method of comparison is totally flawed. You don't get to size everyone up because you don't even know who's been invited. The whole system that we have built on how we decide our worth is not even based on fact, on things that we even know. You don't know who's been invited. Neither do I, because I'm not privy to the kind of information that would tell me that. There's this group of verses in James 2, and I want to read it to you. It says this, Suppose someone comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor person of filthy clothes also comes in. If you show special attention to the one wearing fine clothes and say, here's a good seat for you, but to the one who's poor, you say, stand there, or sit on the floor by my feet, have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? Listen, my dear brothers and sisters, has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised to those who love him? your scope and perspective, my scope and perspective on people is limited. We're making our decisions about people based on a partial view of what's going on in the kingdom of God. And even though I know this is true, I still decide how I relate to people based on comparison. Because how I interact with people has to be based on something that I can gather, something that I can know. And at best, this can be embarrassing or a little bit frustrating. I think at worst, it can be devastating for people and relationships. But if I can't rake myself, then how can I figure out if I matter? And if I can't figure that out, then what? We would all love to be the kind of people who are about things other than ourselves. I believe we would. I would, you would, but we can't wish ourselves into this kind of living and this kind of thinking and this way of making decisions. Because to live in this way, we would have to see and believe and experience and understand something more. Jesus tells a second parable at this meal to the host of the party this time. I'm going to read that parable to you. It starts in Luke verse 12, 14 verse 12. And Jesus went on to say to the one who had invited him, When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your rich neighbors. Otherwise, they may also invite you in return, and that will be your repayment. But when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, since they do not have the means to repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous. Now, we just learned about meals and what they meant in this time. So if you were to have a feast and invite who Jesus just described, you'd have to be pretty much crazy. I mean, it's pretty outlandish for him to say this to this group of men. You'd have to be out of your right mind to have a dinner party and invite all the outcasts and nobodies in your society. When I throw a dinner party, I like to invite my friends because I like them, because I can relate to them, because they give me some sense of belonging. What's so wrong with that? What's so wrong with community and relationship? But when I go weeks on end hanging out with only my friend and my friends, something else starts to happen. I, in some ways, put a message in a bottle and send it out to the world and say, just so you all know, these are the kind of people I hang out with. I only hang out with people who live this way or that, vote this way or that, drive this kind of car or that. My people are not the ones who live in the city or the suburbs or who vote Democratic or Republican or who drive 82 Honda Accords or SUVs. As I begin to exclude myself from the rest of the world, I become more and more distant from those people, whoever those people are for me. I am increasingly convinced that I am right, they are wrong. We have it figured out and they do not. And I have control of my image and can maintain it in whatever way I want. And as I become more protected and removed from people who are different than me, who would challenge me and ask me questions and cause me to think, I stunt my own growth. So invite your rich neighbors and they'll invite you back. Love your friends and your family and they'll love you back. If the short-term benefit of being important and looking good and having people see you as you want them to see you is what you want, then that's what you should do. But if you want something more, if you think there's something more important in this world than yourself, I suggest a different way. Jesus says, when you throw a party, Here's what jumps out about this parable to me the most. Jesus does not tell them to help the poor. He does not tell them to serve the poor. He does not tell them to save the poor or give to the poor. He tells them to be with the poor. Not to do for, but to be with. To share a meal with the poor. Jean Vanier, in his book Living Gently in a Violent World, writes about our tendency to want to help people and fix people. He says this, The heart of the vision of Jesus is to bring people together, to meet, to engage in dialogue, to love each other. Jesus wants to break down the walls that separate groups and people, And we have a call to make history, not just accept history. We're called to change things, to change the movement of history, to make our place a world of love and not just a place of conflict and competition. So what would make me care about the people that are on the outside so much that I would quit thinking I was the most important thing? Could it be wrapped up in actually knowing them, being in relationship with them? we will probably never feel the way about them, the poor, the people on the margins of our lives that we think we should. We might never feel like we have the right motive or words or actions or perspectives, but if we want to follow Jesus even more than we want to love our friends and families and the poor, then he leads us to the margins of our lives and of society. In Psalm 23, it says that God prepares a table for you in the presence of your enemies, Not to mock them, not to eat while you shove it in their face, but to sit across from them. Because I think God knows that at the table, margins are blurred. It becomes more difficult to oppress and judge, to brush to the side someone who's at your table day after day. Because something happens when you share a meal with people. You sit around a table face to face as equals. You might have these awkward silences, but eventually someone says something. You might get food stuck in your teeth, and someone might even laugh. You ask questions about small things and then big things. You share stories, and you ask each other questions, and you share about your life. The mealtime is when people move beyond being acquaintances to being friends, oftentimes. And you can begin to see beyond people as projects, and maybe start to see people as human, if you did this with them, as human like you and human like me. I have a really good friend in our congregation who called me one day and said that she had heard a special on news about how there were people in Minneapolis who were homeless and had no beds to sleep in. And so she was on the way to downtown in her minivan with no idea what she was going to do. And she was calling for me to tell her that she wasn't totally insane. Which, you know, I mean, maybe a little insane, but not totally losing her mind. What am I supposed to do here, Jen? I mean, I am willing to go beyond just having my friends and neighbors in Maple Grove be at my table in my life, but I don't know what to do. Am I supposed to drive my minivan downtown and pick up a bunch of people who are homeless and have them sleep in my basement? I mean, probably not. And my friend, though she didn't know quite what to do, was asking extremely important questions that were leading her somewhere about what table she sat at and who was there with her, and about how her table could start to reflect what she believed was the most important thing. And so we ask ourselves today the same question. What table are you at? And who's at your table with you? What does that table say about what you think is important? And if following Jesus is your most important thing, how would your table need to change? To get repaid at the resurrection of the righteous, Jesus says you have to break bread and share life with people who are on the outside looking in. We read in James 2, God has chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world in many different ways, poor I believe, to be rich in faith and inherit the kingdom he promised to those who loved him. So the most important thing in the kingdom of God is to actually be on the outside. That's where something big is happening. It's not even just about your own growth and formation. It's something bigger, a bigger movement of the kingdom that goes way beyond you and way beyond me. I have a friend I've mentioned up here before, and he quit his corporate job after 25 years to start an urban retreat center and work with young artists. And he dramatically changed his table. In the course of 24 hours, he made this decision. I talked with him this week, and he was telling me that out of every window in his house, he can see the building he used to work at downtown. And when he washed his dishes in the sink, he said he used to be home on a Tuesday morning or a Wednesday afternoon and think, what am I doing here? I mean, I used to really be someone. I used to be inside, in there. I used to go to dinner parties and impress people when I told them what I did, what I was a part of. But somewhere along the way, he said he let go of what he called the need to be special, to be important, to be on the inside, to have people see him as important. And somewhere in there, the top blew off of what he thought was possible for his life. he said the lid just like exploded off and he realized that he didn't leave that table for nothing he left it for something incredible this week at message team Steve was joking about those the Oprah giveaway that Oprah does where she gives away cars or iPods and he was saying what if Oprah her giveaway was like spending a week with a homeless person or something or with you know adults with developmental disabilities you'd have to be kind of crazy to choose that over an iPod and we started talking about why Well, you know, we don't really believe God can teach us in that way, do we? And plus, we actually know how to use an iPod. Some of us maybe do, some don't. I mean, what the heck do you do with someone who's so different than you that you have no idea where to start, what to ask? I mean, what do you do when you find yourself driving on a highway down to Minneapolis in your minivan in the middle of winter? This organization called City House, it's a great organization that works with people on the margins and their spiritual development. People who are homeless, have mental illness, are in treatment for chemical dependency, and they've developed a leadership program for corporate executives. And the whole goal is to help them embrace their humility and get a new perspective on their power as leaders. And so they bring them through some learning experiences on vulnerability, on calling, and then they mash them up with a mentor, something we've been talking about around here a ton. but here's the twist they mash them up with a mentor who's homeless or just coming out of prison and the corporate executive sits at that person's feet and learns from them they did a mini course last week for 16 executives from a fortune 500 company they spent part of their day with this mentor and then they went to a homeless shelter and instead of serving the meal they were served the meal and they ate with their mentor and the other clients who were at the shelter and at the end of the day they said the hardest part was serving, being served a meal that they should have been serving to others. And sitting across the table from these people that they were so different from. I mean, that is so backwards. Being mentored by a homeless person, being served a meal that you should have been serving. Jean Vanier, in this same book I quoted before, says that we have to be with the poor. That seems a bit crazy because it doesn't look like a plan to change the world. but maybe what our world needs more than anything is communities where we celebrate life together and become a sign of hope for the world. Maybe the world needs signs that it's possible to love each other. Our rabbi Jesus said that they will know who we are by the way we love each other. One woman on staff at City House who was in this leadership program was sharing with the group that she didn't think this was really going to impact her because she doesn't really feel uncomfortable if people are homeless. Guess who her mentor was? a corporate executive at the IDS building, who she told me last week changed her entire perspective on what it means to be a leader. When you're willing to go and sit at another table, a different table that is uncomfortable for you, seeing yourself as the most important thing becomes a super small way to view the world. You get this glimpse of a kingdom that is so expansive that it almost might seem funny that you thought you were at the center of the world at one point. Now, maybe it's not in your scope to quit your corporate job or to do something like this leadership program. It's not in mine right now. But I still have to ask my question, who is at my table? What table do I want to be at? What table am I called to be at? Knowing that when we do this, we go against the flow of society. We go against the flow of culture. And there are risks. Throwing a party for a bunch of lepers and poor people in Jesus' day would have been a catastrophic impact on the lives of the men Jesus was talking to. Because when you care for people, when you're in relationship with people, there's so much of a bigger chance that things are going to get messy. That people are going to judge you and decide about you and leave you and take advantage of you. You can feel so drained, I think, and confused and feel like you're living in a never-ending parable. When you change your table, when you do the hard thing Ben and I love to cook and sometimes we'll plan like a whole five course night where we're just going to cook all night last summer we were doing this and it was about 8pm we were on our fourth course, we had put our daughter to bed we were having grilled steak really excited about it and in the middle there was a knock at the door, my first thought was oh, who's interrupting this a neighbor had come, my seven year old neighbor Rayshon and when I opened the door where he was standing on the doorstep holding a can of string green beans in his hand. And it looked like it had been beaten with like a hammer and a pen. It was a supper. And he held it up and he said, my mom's not home. We don't have a can opener. Can you get this open for me? And I just stood there. As Ben manned the grill in the backyard, frozen. I had no idea what to do with that. And a year later, I still have no idea what to do with that. It made me wonder if changing up our tables is really such a good idea. But I know this, experiences like that help remind me that I am not the most important thing. And in that place, there is true life. Kingdom of God type of life for me. And I believe for you. Just because we find social significance in our life or in our job does not mean we necessarily need to leave it. If everyone did that, I think we'd be in trouble. But how am I making decisions in my life? About my job? How are those things reflecting what I really care about? Do I have any idea who I would be if I did not work at Open Door? Is this the only table that I'm willing to sit at? Because if it is, I'll continue to walk through my life pushing people to the side, marginalizing people that I say I care about the most because I can't figure out how to live out what I say is most important to me. Dave ended his sermon last week with a benediction. It was a prayer. Lord, where I'm blind, particularly to the needs of the least and the lost and the poor among us, help me see. Where I've forgotten who I am and why I'm here, help me remember. If you were on the message tool last week, you were channeled to pray that every morning and every night. And I bet you started asking yourself, how can I change my table? How can I mix things up a little bit? Here are just a couple ideas, things that came as we talked in message team this week about things we could do. There are hundreds. You could think about a person in your life who annoys you the most and ask them to coffee and then only ask them questions about themselves the whole time. You could start every meal at your house with a prayer for people who don't have food. You could check out a documentary or something at the library about a group of people that you feel like is maybe on the outside looking in in some way. Watch it with someone and discuss it. You could go on a tour of North Minneapolis that the Peace Foundation offers one Saturday a month, or take a class called City Matters that Sanctuary Community Development Corporation offers, where they talk about things like housing and hip-hop and racism and how that's impacted the Twin Cities. And I think as you do these things, as we begin to mix up our tables and be open to what God might teach us there, we'll start to think about what is the most important thing very, very differently. I want to invite you to stand and I'd love to read a benediction over you this evening before you go. This benediction comes from the message translation of Galatians. It starts in verse 22. What happens when we live God's way? He brings gifts into our life much the same way that fruit appears in an orchard. Things like affection for others, exuberance about life, serenity we develop a willingness to stick with things a sense of compassion in our hearts and a conviction that basic holiness permeates things and people since this is the kind of life we have chosen the life of the spirit let us make sure that we do not just hold this idea in our heads or the sentiment in our hearts but we work out its implications in every detail of our lives that means we'll not compare ourselves with each other as if one was better and one was worse we have far more interesting things to do each of us is original amen and bless you as you go Thank you.
