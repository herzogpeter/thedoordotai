Let's pray. Father, I pray that as you have by the power of your spirit been at work in the worship be now at work in the word, I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, greetings from Belfast, Northern Ireland. If I could do an Irish accent, I would do that. It would be very funny, I'm sure. But every time I do an accent of any kind, I sound like I'm coming to you from India I thank you many times. That's what I sound like. So there's my Irish brogue right there. I actually do want to thank all of you who prayed for Bonnie and myself, who in a very real sense, some of you who prayed for us, went with us as we went to Belfast. There was a little bit of tension. We left for Belfast the day the war began, and so we were kind of anxious about that. Many of you know that this is the third time that we've had opportunity to go there, an opportunity that was made possible by the distribution many years ago of some tapes here at Open Door that got into some hands of people over there, unbeknownst to us, and the story that unraveled from there has resulted in this wonderful relationship we have with particularly a group of people at the Newton Brita Baptist Church and had a wonderful time again with them. This year, that circle of friendship and opportunity for ministry was enlarged to include a congregation entitled the Glen Abbey Church. They were an interesting group of people to meet, about 500 people in all, meeting in a warehouse. They've been meeting in a warehouse for 15 years, wondering if they're ever, ever going to find a permanent place to be. And I told them, I just was so, I said, it's never going to happen. Never in a million years. We can, as you imagine, you can imagine, We had some wonderful time sharing stories and journey. In addition to all of the get-to-know-you stuff that you can assume is happening in meetings with key leaders of both churches and a pastor's conference wedged in between those two church involvements, what I did when I was there was preach things pertaining to the kingdom of God. In fact, what I did there was what I've been doing here, what we've been doing here, is we've been wondering together about what it is we're asking for when we ask for the kingdom to come. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth. Right here, right now, in Northern Ireland, Belfast, Northern Ireland. And it really is an exciting thing, and you need to know about it, how the word of God has the same effect on people's hearts there that it does here. It's a very encouraging thing. And we are grateful for your support as we went. I also wanted to thank all of you who visited our home while we were gone. Apparently, we had a two-week-long open house hosted by my son, Christopher. And we just want to thank all of you who came for leaving our house intact and removing as much evidence as possible. I guess I just wanted you to know you didn't remove it all. Ha, ha, ha. Well, that's quite a come-home thing. We gave to Gene and Dick McCauley, who are our neighbors. Bonnie gave them our garage door opener when we left. I mean, it's a stupid thing to leave your neighbor. But we do the garage because our boys are going to be there, and they always leave the garage door open. So we'll walk out in the street once in a while and just close our garage door. So that's how she every Wednesday in a while walked out and says, you know, you don't have a driveway. You've got a parking lot over there. Anyway, it's good to be back. The house is great. The kids are great. I also wanted to publicly thank, however, Ephraim Smith, Mark Stromberg, Tom and Steve, who not only filled the pulpit when I was gone, but who, in a way that is critical to the journey we're on right now, and the vision we are as a church trying to embrace, began to dress out in specific ways what we mean by becoming a church that is moving beyond belief. You may recall several weeks ago, actually it was the Sunday just before we left for Belfast, I introduced that phrase as being the embodiment of what we believe God is saying to us as a church these days, the phrase of the statement serving as the overall theme for this season in our church's life is this, moving beyond belief, thy kingdom come. Because we believe that it's one thing to pray thy kingdom come, but quite another to move beyond belief, to move beyond what we say we believe and desire into actually acting on those things. because what we have come to discover is this, that it is in the doing of the kingdom, acting on what we say, we desire, and believe, that we as individuals and as a people begin to see and experience supernatural inbreakings of the kingdom of God in ways that really are beyond belief. Now, it was in the spirit of that desire to move beyond belief on the Sunday before I left that I introduced to you what we referred to as three bold kingdom moves that we see as being absolutely critical to our ability as a church to faithfully step into the future that we believe God is calling us to as we so clearly believe he is calling us to whatever else it is. It's this, to be a people who are moving beyond belief. The three bold moves are these, first of all, that we need to take care of the home base. Bottom line, we need to pay our bills. And while at first blush, that may not sound like a bold move. I mean, actually, that just sounds like a necessary move. The boldness of that move comes into clearer focus as we all begin to get a better picture and a better understanding of what it actually does cost to live in and do ministry from this, our new home. Because the fact is this, as most of you know by now, it costs significantly more to live in and do ministry from this permanent facility than it did when we were renting for all those years at the Robinsdale High School. The proposed budget, again, as most of you know, for the next fiscal year is $5.5 million, which represents an increase in the general fund of about 22%. And part of that increase is reflected in the fact that we no longer have a general fund and a building fund, those two things are put together, and those two things together is what it costs to live here and do ministry from here, requiring from all of us who consider this their church a kind of adjustment financially to the reality of what it actually costs to live here, to be an owner, particularly in this, our first year of ownership. You may recall that I've kind of been comparing this move to someone who just bought a house for the very first time, moving from a renting experience to an owning experience, and that that first year of ownership, if you've ever done that, you know that first year is a big adjustment. But it's an adjustment that needs to be made, and it's an adjustment that can be made. People do it all the time, and so will we. Now, I'm going to come back to that stuff in just a bit, but let me remind you first of the second bold move that we feel compelled to make during this season of our church's life. Kingdom move number two was introduced three weeks ago by Ephraim Smith, who actually spent two weeks with us. Ephraim Smith, with whom we are going to collaborate in the establishment of a multi-ethnic outreach base in North Minneapolis embodied in a church called the Sanctuary that believes, as we do, that when the kingdom of God comes, when the kingdom of God manifests itself among people, It impacts and affects the lives of those people in very, very practical ways, which is precisely why this church plant is not only committed to, but it is going to be defined by community and economic development, health care and housing, the feeding of the poor, thereby earning the right in North Minneapolis to share the good news of Jesus Christ. Ephraim called the vision God was giving him and us to collaborate with him in a glimpse of heaven. Remember that? I listened to the tape as soon as I got home, and he called it a glimpse of heaven, and at least in part of because of the way Ephraim could say it. Do you know what I'm talking about, about the way he could say it? Part of, at least in part because of the way he could say it, I could see it. I could see the glimpse of heaven, and I think you could too. Did you enjoy Ephraim when he was here? I think you did. I think you did. Second week he was here, he talked about being a salty church and that whatever else salt does, it spices things up. Remember that? Spice. It isn't boring. It isn't dull. It isn't bland. And then he started talking about the Bible, and the Bible isn't boring. The Bible is salty. He says, my Bible's salty. It isn't boring. It isn't dull. It's a spicy Bible. He called it a spicy. It's a greasy Bible. It's a Cajun Bible. Yeah, they clap. You clapped on, too. he called the bible a greasy bible i was sitting down on a stairmaster listen to the it's a greasy bible my bible's everybody's applauding i'm sitting on a stairmaster i started applauding i was crying i thought it was incredible and then i began to think who who who calls the bible a greasy bible who gets to do that i'm telling okay here i am it's a greasy bible it didn't work did it it didn't work. You know, I call it a greasy Bible. It's heresy. Ephraim Smith calls it a greasy Bible. It's a revelation. Yeah. Yeah, you clapped four times when he preached. I counted. We have some issues. We need to talk. You know how I got you to clap? You know how I got people to clap last night? Mentioning Ephraim. Okay. I loved it. It was good. It was good. Last week, Steve Hansen came. And Steve Hansen did what he does so well. He helps us see the world through a lens of compassion. And then he made us aware as a church that we can make a difference. And we got excited because he made us aware that we can play a part in addressing an issue that the church of Jesus Christ in America for far too long has been slow to respond to, and that is this, people who are dying of AIDS, particularly people on the continent of Africa who are dying of AIDS, where we discovered last week 8,000 people a day are dying from on that continent. Of all the things Steve said last week, what I remember most was this, that the least likely group in America right now to move toward that issue of AIDS with a heart of compassion and a hand to help is a group called Evangelical Christians. And as I sat in church last week, sitting right over there in the first service, listening to Steve say that, I found myself muttering determinedly under my breath, we don't have to be that way. We're not going to be that way. I'm really glad we're not that way. I'm really glad that one of the three kingdom moves we feel deeply about moving into is moving into issues such as that. But here's the deal. For us to address these things, these three bold, important kingdom moves, for us to do these things is going to require some things. Chief among them is what Steve spoke of so powerfully last week when he spoke of the need on all of our parts to reevaluate what it is we think we need for daily bread. Because when the kingdom comes, it touches every aspect of our ordinary lives, not the least of which includes our daily bread, not the least of which includes our stuff. I thought of entitling this sermon today, the kingdom of God and our stuff? Or what happens when the kingdom comes to my stuff? Because we've been real excited over the last several weeks about learning how to pray the way Jesus taught us to pray when he taught us to pray this way, thy kingdom come. Oh God, that's what we want. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth right here, right now. And we've even come to understand that when we pray for the kingdom to come on earth, we do not mean, at first anyway, the whole wide world. It might get there someday, but when I pray, when we pray, thy kingdom come on earth, what we are saying is, first of all, this earth, this dust, my life, my heart, my body, all of which, by the way, includes, among other things, my money, my stuff. This past week at the message team meeting, we were discussing these vision talks and where we needed to go with them. among the things we were talking about, we were talking about what it will realistically take to make these three moves financially, particularly the 5.5 million we need for the general fund because that, by far, is the most critical to our everyday existence and functioning as a church and ministry. And among the things that we wanted to make clear from the message team when we began to talk about was to kind of try to help people get a perspective of how actually doable 5.5 million is. You see, I mean, I think it's important to maybe give some perspective on that because I don't know about you, but when I hear 5.5 million, I mean, my eyes just kind of glaze over. It's a very overwhelming figure. So let's put some perspective on that. This kind of came from the message team this week. Here's some perspective. If every adult who normally comes, we didn't have any growth at all. If every adult who normally comes to the weekend services gave $35 a week, $35 a week, we would be fully funded. And when I hear that $35 a week, hope rises. I go, huh, that feels doable. That feels hopeful. That feels like it might even be easy. I mean, $35 a week, I give less to that. That's less than what I give to Applebee's in a week. We could maybe do that. How about this? Here's some other perspective that's maybe helpful. If everyone who is presently giving gave 10% more this year than they gave last year, we would be fully funded. I'm not good at math, so they did it for me. Here's the analogy. If you gave $100 a week last year or a month or a year, that's $110 this year. You can find $10. Okay, it sounds doable. Doesn't that sound helpful? And on and on you go. If you give $3,000, then it's $3,300. If you gave $10,000, it's $11,000. The point is this. When you frame it like that, this feels a little bit more manageable. But there's a problem with doing it that way. Among the problems is this problem. For some among us to give $35 a week would be nothing short of sin, revealing absolutely no alignment at all of your finances under the rule and reign of God. While for others to give $35 a week would be the widow's mite. It would be for some, and by widow's mite, I do not just mean some high percentage of what you give, what you have, because the widow's mite was not a high percentage of what she had. It was everything she had. The possibility does in fact exist that for some among us to give $35 would be everything they have. You see, while it might in fact be helpful to break it down that way, to reframe this stuff, to make it feel more manageable, the truth, beloved, is this, That if you and I, if all you and I do is follow a formula, oh, I know, I'll give 35 bucks. Oh, I know, I'll just raise it up 10%. The danger of that, the problem of that is this, that then we don't have to pray and we don't have to wrestle and we don't have to wonder what God is saying to us about these things. Just do 35 bucks. Just do 10% more. We don't have to develop a habit of trust as I give. We don't have to come to grips with what it really means to have rightly ordered finances under God where it might actually begin to really look in our real life like God has a right to rule in this arena of our life. And so we pray that kingdom come to our finances. Or do we? See, all of this stuff raises that question again that we've raised all the way through this series. Do I really want to pray this way, thy kingdom come, when I begin to get a picture of where the kingdom in my life wants to come? See, I liked it a lot better when the Lord's Prayer and this thing of kingdom come that kind of puts tears in our... I liked it much better when it was a bland, innocuous prayer, when I was able to recite it as mindlessly as I recite the Pledge of Allegiance. But let me put this whole thing a different way. See, here's the real question, and this is the exciting question. This is the question that gets my heart stirring. This is the vision-casting kingdom question. What do you think would happen? Wonder with me. Dream with me. Just dream with me. Dream with me for just a moment. What do you think would happen? What do you think it would look like if the rule and reign of God really came to your finances and my finances? In other words, our finances came under the rule and reign of God. Do you think our budget would be met if our, your, my finances came under the rule and reign of God? Instead of, everybody gave $35. We had a program. Give $35 apiece. And instead of, I'm going to make me puke. I was going to say puke. I'm going to say puke. If we got our budget made, because everybody did a program of $35. There's nothing of the kingdom in that. There's nothing of God in that. There's nothing that demands growth in that, submission to God in that. Do you think our budget would be met if everybody's finances came under the rule and reign of God? I do indeed. I believe that beyond our budget being met, I think we'd be talking about a lot more than $100,000 for urban renewal and $50,000 for an age project. I think we'd be talking about what my prayer is and I hope your prayer is as we pray the kingdom to come. that we will begin to be talking about the kind of kingdom impact that could literally change the face of a city, beloved. And that is why we pray, thy kingdom come to every aspect of our lives. Some of you may recall that about a year and a half ago, I did a series of sermons on money, sex, and power. We dealt with sexuality, disordered, and rightly ordered sexuality. the first after six weeks of that, we began to talk about money with this interesting discovery up front. And this is a bit of a surprise, I think, to all of us, that as difficult as it was to talk about sexuality in church, and it was at times, and a little strange, and I remember having, you know, warnings. This sermon's PG-13. Take your kids out. Stuff like that. But that as difficult as it was to talk about sexuality in church, money was worse, More difficult for a number of reasons. One is that like sex, money is personal. It's kind of none of your business. I mean, honestly, when I think of my sex life, well, I don't want to go there. It's none of your business. That's what I was trying to say. Same way with our money. Our money is none of your business. And at one level, that's absolutely correct. But what if it's disordered? What if our sexuality is disordered? Would we move in on that? In the community of faith, disordered sexuality is something that with a whole lot of grace, we would move toward and call people out of disordered sexuality. Because we all know, I think God has a lot to say. The Word of God has a lot to say about what rightly ordered sexuality looks like and what disordered sexuality looks like. And God has called us to a glorious thing in that arena of our life. If we saw disordered sexuality or disordered finances, would we be as quick to move on that? I don't think so. I don't think so. It's none of your business. This stuff is mine. And the Bible doesn't say anything about that anyway, does it? I'll come back to that in a second. Because it leads to another reason that I think it's hard to talk about money in church. It's this, the impression that many have that money is secular and church is spiritual. Randy Elkhorn addresses this quite well in a wonderful book. I highly recommend it to you on this issue if you're interested. entitled Money, Possessions, and Eternity. He says it this way, we come to the Bible for comfort, not for financial instruction. If we want to know about money, we're far more likely to pick up the Wall Street Journal or Fortune or Forbes or Money magazine. Scripture should concern itself with what's spiritual and heavenly. Money is physical and earthly. The Bible is religious. Money is secular. Let God talk about love and grace and faith. Let the rest of us talk about money and possessions and do whatever we want with them, end quote. But the problem with that, as I think most of you do in fact know, is this. The Bible in general and Jesus in particular has a lot to say about money and how we handle it. In fact, Jesus spoke more about money and our relationship to it than just about any other thing he spoke about other than the kingdom of God itself. 17 of the 38 parables are about possessions and how we deal with them, how we pursue them, how we treat them as if they are God, how we hoard them, how we share them. Jesus talks about money three times more than he talks about love, seven times more than he talks about prayer, eight times more than he talks about faith. And if you begin to do the math there, you begin to get the impression that our relationship with and handling of our stuff is central, not just to the making of our budget. It is central to our faith, our life in the kingdom of God, for it reveals things about who we are and what we love and who we love and who we serve. Indeed, it was about halfway through that series a year and a half ago on money. and we spent 10 weeks on that, that it began to dawn on us that maybe the primary reason we actually did have a harder time talking about money in church than we had talking about sex in church was that because many of us had a more disordered relationship with money than we actually had a disordered relationship with sex, which is really saying something when you consider the level of disordered sexuality, not only in our culture, but in the church as well. all of which raises this question why why does jesus talk about our stuff so much why does it get our stuff get so easily disordered our relationship with money well to fully answer that would would take far more time than i have this morning again just keep in perspective we spent 10 weeks on this about a year and a half ago so so let me just give you one answer to that question that may open the door to other answers as well. It's one we've dealt with here before. It's kind of a foundational teaching here at Open Door. It's this. We need to understand when we're dealing with money, that when we're dealing with money, we are dealing with more than money. We are dealing with more than coinage. We are dealing with what Jesus called mammon. In Matthew 6, Jesus said it this way, and it's a passage you're all familiar with. You cannot serve God and mammon. Some Bibles translate that money, and that's accurate, but I like the word mammon better because the actual word in the Greek is mamonas. It's an actual word. And when Jesus uses mamonas, that word, he is speaking of something more than physical money. He is speaking of a spiritual force behind the money, a spiritual force whose job it is to seduce you and me into believing That in money we can find our life, our joy, our peace, and our security. And if you do indeed believe that, you will then pursue it, attach yourself to it, bow down and worship it, give your life to accumulate and hoard it as if your life and joy and peace and security depended upon it. Richard Foster in his book, The Challenge of a Disciplined Life, helps clarify this when he says this. When Jesus declares you cannot serve God and mammon, he is personifying mammon as a rival God. He is making it unmistakably clear that money is not some impersonal medium of exchange, but that behind money there are very real spiritual forces that energize that money and give it a life of its own. Hence, money is an active agent. It is a law unto itself. It is a power. capable of inspiring and then demanding great devotion. Milton, in his classic work, Paradise Lost, kind of paints this. This is my favorite picture that helps me understand what I think Mammon really is. In Paradise Lost, he fictionalizes Mammon, saying this, that even before the fall, Mammon existed as a spiritual being, much like an angel. But even before the fall, Mammon was thought to be the least upright of all the spirits. For even when Mammon was in the presence of God, before the demonic hordes followed Satan into his rebellion against God, even then the angel Mammonas studied the gold of the streets more than he studied the glory of God. Interesting posture. Studying the gold of the streets rather than upright. Bent to the earth is Mammon. scratching, grasping, digging in the earth. The picture I have of Mammon, if I have to kind of embody him in something, is I think of that character in the Lord of the Rings Golem as he's holding him, my precious, my precious, just groveling and scratching to find life in this. And that whole posture is in stark contrast to men and women of faith in the kingdom of God or learning how by God's grace and power at work in them to begin to be a people who are standing up straight into their life in God with arms raised and hands open. All of which raises a question. How can mammon's grip be broken? Because all of us, beloved, are in its grip. And I don't know if you feel like this in your life, but you get free and then it comes back and you get free. So how is the grip broken? Well, once again, I think there are a number of things and time would limit me to go into all of the different nuances and the places I would like to go with this. But I truly believe that the most practical and effective tool, if I could only give you one, and that was all the time we would ever have, the most practical and effective tool to break mammon's grip, bar none in my opinion, is to give. Richard Swenson in his book Margin says it this way, There is one act par excellence that has the power to break the grip of mammon by going directly against the law of mammon, an act for which money is not made. That act is to give. When we give money away, we not only neutralize its power over us, but we also bring it under the domain of the kingdom of light. God is honored and his lordship in our lives is reconfirmed. See, this is the point at which we begin to understand giving as a spiritual discipline, which like all other disciplines is of tremendous value and the number one core value of our church, spiritual formation. I want to say that again. Giving is a spiritual discipline, which is of tremendous value in spiritual formation. As we begin to learn, first of all, to give regularly. And giving regularly is part of the spiritual, in fact, I think that's a spiritual discipline, along with all the other spiritual disciplines. Giving regularly is a spiritual discipline. And the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 6, 2 said it this way. on the first day of the week put aside and save giving to god the first fruits the first fruits is i think as you can guess what's right off the top not what's left over after we've spent it all but right off the top give it to god so that instead of doing what most of us do being in a position where our lifestyle is determining what we give and what i mean by that is this. Many of us, and myself included, have gotten into this and have had to come back and reorder our life around a different way of living, but we buy into everything we hear in our culture, and we pursue all the stuff. We get in debt up over our eyes. We are in all sorts of trouble. We've got the American dream, and the little pittance that's left over, well, we'll give that to God. There's hardly anything left over. First fruits reorders your life. First fruits giving is a discipline that says we're going to give to God first, and after we give to God, what is left is what we'll decide to live on. It changes your whole lifestyle. God has really infected numbers of our people with that glorious kingdom orientation. It's brought great freedom to their lives, but sometimes getting to that, having lived the other way for a while, takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of discipline. It takes a reordering of your life under the kingdom of God, just like every area of your life that has been disordered, sometimes takes time to bring it in order under the kingdom of God. We give systematically and purposefully a tenth, a tenth. Here at Open Door, we teach what we call here the spirit of the tithe. We do not apply the tithe. The tithe is a tenth of all you have, and it would be right off the top, first fruits principle. But the tithe, as it's taught here, as we have embraced this, is not arbitrarily given. It's not legalistically applied, I don't think, in any way at all. In fact, it can best be understood this way. For it is embodied in Abraham, who modeled the spirit of the tithe, this way when he said in Genesis 14, 22. Just listen to these words. As it reflects an alignment of life in the kingdom of God. He says this, I have lifted up my hands to Lord God most high. By the way, notice the posture. It's opposite of Mammon, who was looking at the earth. I have lifted my hands to Lord God most high, possessor of heaven and earth. Here's what I acknowledge. Everything I have belongs to you. And from this posture, from this perspective of life, Abraham gave a tenth of all he had. Wasn't a law. Wasn't a rule. It was an alignment of life under the rule and reign of God that helped him remember that everything I have belongs to God. And few things I know, beloved, have more power on earth, practical power on earth to break in your life and mine, the power or the grip of mammon, than the spirit of Abraham, what we call here at Open Door the spirit of the tithe. The spirit of the tithe that on a consistent basis, when entered into on a consistent basis, says this, I will lift up my hands and open them wide, to Lord God Most High, acknowledging him as possessor of heaven and earth. Everything I have belongs to you. And to remind myself of that fact, by way of spiritual discipline, I will give a tenth of all I have. And I will do it every week. I will do it every month. I will do it every year. I will purpose in my heart to do this, not crutchingly nor of necessity. I will do it joyfully because it delights the heart of God, because it releases the resources of God for the advancing of the kingdom of God, because it breaks the grip of mammon on my heart and it brings my finances under the rule and reign of God. And so we pray, thy kingdom come to our finances. But we have learned, beloved, over the course of this series that it's one thing to pray, thy kingdom come, and quite another to move beyond belief. to move beyond what we say we believe and desire into actually doing these things. But we have also learned that it is in the doing of the kingdom of God that we begin to see and experience on individual levels and on corporate church levels in breakings of God's kingdom that really are beyond belief. Let me close with this. I've been in ministry family all my life. Grew up in a church. My dad was a pastor. I've been a senior pastor here at Open Door for 22 years. Whatever else that means, it means this, that I see this whole issue of giving and finances and funding and all that stuff. I see it in the context of journey, both my personal journey and my family's journey and our corporate journey as a church. And the truth about my journey and our journey is this, that sometimes on this journey, I have been and we have been limited by what we didn't know. I mean, I don't know, you could probably look at any part of your spiritual life and look back 10 years and go, there were things I wasn't experiencing in the kingdom of God that I am not, because I just didn't even know that about the kingdom of God. So there are things in my journey, our journey, around this aspect of kingdom life that we were limited by because of things we didn't know, because of things we didn't believe, Because of things we wouldn't do. Because of things sometimes we weren't ready for. Just because of where we were with our walk with God. And that's true of every aspect of our kingdom life and walk. Ten years ago, I think all of you know, we've referenced this kind of a point of reference of our church's journey. And certainly it's part of reference in my life's journey. We kind of hit the wall here. Remember the word of God to us at that time? What was it? Church of the open door? Grow up or die. well one of the things that was going on there was part of the wall we hit in those days that was that we had attempted and failed to purchase some land and build a build build a home and you know what 10 years ago we desperately needed a permanent home but we had the wall there was just no way that was going to happen part of the reason that that wasn't going to happen 10 years ago was because the level of giving here at open door was exceedingly low it was it was way below even what would be called average giving in normal churches. George Barna, I've referenced him from time to time. He does studies, and he's kind of the Christian version of the Gallup poll. He did a survey recently and discovered that the national average for most evangelicals, I talked a minute ago about 10%, the average for most evangelicals in America today is about 3%. Now, obviously, there are many people who give way more than 3%, way more than 10%. Obviously, there's also others who give absolutely nothing. They have no sense of their finances coming under the rule and reign of God at all. But the average for evangelicals, evangelicals is around 3%. Well, 10 years ago, the average in our church was around 1%. And that made a lot of people feel bad when you hear that because an awful lot of people at that time 10 years ago were given way more than 10%. But some had no connection, no understanding whatsoever of what it looked like to have finances come under the rule and reign of God. And among the things we took seriously about the grow up or die message to open door, and it had to apply just in a multitude of ways. One of the places was around our finances, and if you were on the journey with us, you know that. And the good news is this, that the very fact that we are in this place affirms the fact that we have grown in amazingly significant ways as it relates to finances, which I think is reason for great celebration. Today, as we consider our financial situation and where we are relative to our size, our giving patterns are now average here at Open Door. Average, however, means that people give at a rate of about 3% at the national average. Now, that might irritate or, you know, frustrate some of you because you're going, 3%? We give so much more than 3%, 10%, more than 10%. That's true. But a lot of people have no sense at all of having their finances coming under the rule and reign of God, like none at all. The fact that we're average, though, I remember at the board meeting where we announced that we've reached the average, it was like, wow, we're finally there. It was 3%. It was, oh, hmm. See, as I say that, as I say that, we're average at 3%. I wonder if there's anything that stirs in you the way it stirs in me that says this, golly, God, I think you're calling us to more than average. I think you're calling us to something beyond the national average. In fact, it seems like in every arena of your life, you seem to be calling us to something beyond belief. Something beyond belief. Something beyond belief that could just maybe, if we're faithful, change the face of a city, beloved. And so we pray, and so we pray, thy kingdom come. And God, when you come with your kingdom, touch every area of our ordinary lives. Beloved, when you take these cards that are in the bulletin, they've been in here for the last couple of weeks, and you look at them and bring them home, the actual card that we're going to ask you to fill out is going to be in the bulletin the week after Easter, after next. I just want to call on you to pray we don't have a $35 a person program, yuck I want to call on people to pray and wonder what it means wonder what it means to have our finances come under the rule and reign of God and know what I want to ask you to do is if you believe in this ministry and you're part of what God's doing here and your heart burns within you relative to what he's calling us to that you would participate that all of you would participate and fill this card out so that we would have a handle on what kinds of ministries we can expect and what directions we can expect to be able to go in the next year. And for some of you, you may be doing this for the very first time as you are new to us and you're just getting on board and your hearts are saying yes to this. I just encourage those of you who may be doing it for the first time to do it for the first time as we attempt as best we know how as individuals and as a church to obediently move beyond belief. Let me close with this word. It comes from the Apostle Paul. It's found in 2 Corinthians 8 verse 7 and I would read this as if it's coming from the Spirit of God to our church. The word is this, church of the open door, just as you have excelled in so many things. And can I tell you something? That as the guy who's been here for 22 years, I can say, this is not smoke I'm blowing at you. You have excelled. We have excelled in so many things. You have grown. We have grown in so many ways, in faith, in utterance, in knowledge, in earnestness, and in love. Then Paul says, you guys, see to it now that you excel in this gracious work as well. See the kingdom come to this gracious work as well. And he was talking about giving. May the God of grace be with you all. Let's pray as we close. And so we pray thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth. Right here, right now, in every arena of our life, Including this, we pray in Jesus' name. And all God's people said, amen. The altar team will be here for anyone who needs prayer for anything at all. The rest of you are dismissed. God bless you as you leave. Thank you.
