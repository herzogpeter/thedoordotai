Ephesians chapter 6, and let's start down in verse 13, okay? Therefore, take up the full armor of God that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. Stand firm, therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace, in addition to all, or above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming missiles of the evil one and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, and pray all the time. Let's pray now as we begin. Father, you know about the war more than we do. We are discovering it. I thank you for that. father I do not know of the personal kind of warfares that are going on right now in the hearts and minds of the believers in our congregation this morning I know about mine and it's very real to me and father we ask in your name for the victory in that warfare in my mind in the hearts and the minds of people here have your way among us through the preaching of your word this morning. In Jesus' name, amen. We have been studying these last few weeks the great truth of this text as it relates to the believer's warfare. Over and over and over again, we have indicated that as believers in Jesus Christ, we are in a war, and we need to know that tremendously. Verse 12 says, For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, The word there is struggle. In the King James Version, it is wrestle. And it is not to be minimized at all. The word wrestle there does not have to do with some little kind of skirmish that is going on, a little bout here and there. The word wrestle that Paul was alluding to there was the picture he had in his mind of two people who were fighting a fight that was to the death. It is a hand-to-hand, mortal kind of combat. And I know, if for no other reason that these last few weeks we are confronting the warfare and in a way going toe-to-toe with Satan, that many of you know just exactly what that means. Toe-to-toe, hand-to-hand, mortal combat. I've talked to some of you in the last couple of weeks who have expressed the fact that you're going through some struggles that just aren't normal for you, some doubts that just aren't normal for you, from hesitations and fear that just isn't normal for you. We're in a war. And these last few weeks we are confronting it and we need to be prepared. And I want to tell you something, just as I'm before you now. I am in a war. I told my wife this morning as I got up, I can't wait till we're out of this passage. I know that sounds terrible and I said this too, but I'm going to do it again. I'm never going to preach the warfare again. because I feel like I'm right in the middle of it. And until a minute ago, I didn't know if I was going to have the strength to stand up here in front of you. And I want you to be praying for me. When Dean asked that you would, that was because I asked him to do that. As we move into this and wage war, we have learned many things in this study the last couple of weeks. One of the very significant things we learned was why it was that Paul placed this exhortation at the end of the book, at the end of the epistle, after telling us all the wonderful resources that the believer has, who we are and what we have in Christ, he has delineated all of those things and he has told us what the walk of the believer is. We have seen that God has called us to walk in a manner that is worthy of who we are. Remember the first three chapters? You are redeemed, you have an inheritance, you are among the chosen few and on and on and on. Now, walk in accordance with that. Walk worthy means to balance the scales. Be on the outside who you are on the inside. That walk involved humility. That walk involved gentleness. That walk involved love. That walk involved letting the light of God's Word hit my life and changing. That walk involved submission to God, the filling of the Spirit, the fullness of God. It's a walk that if it is being applied to our lives and if we're learning day by day what it means, it's a walk that violates the status quo. It goes against the grain of the status quo. It goes against the grain of the secular status quo and it goes against the grain just as much of the religious status quo. When Jesus came into the world, the people who he had the most trouble with were the very pious and proper religious people. Because they were wrapped up in externals of religion and they cared about the things, how things looked and how things appeared. And little duties that people were doing and Jesus wanted to get into the heart. And if we begin to walk a walk that is based on that, we are going to violate the status quo every time. It goes against the grain of mediocrity. And one more thing it does, it sets us in direct opposition to Satan. it sets us in direct opposite opposition to Satan and the warning has been this these last couple of weeks that if we really do get involved in this process of breaking ourselves before God humbling ourselves before God and begin that process with all the other dimensions of the walk another dimension is this it's a process walk remember? it isn't wham, it's done I'm all in a sudden victory forever and ever it's a process walk I begin to strip off the old and put on the new and I continue doing that all my life, stripping off those things that don't need to be there and don't apply. But if we get involved in that and if we begin, even in small ways, to discover the living reality of the fullness of God and the filling of the Spirit, you will be opposed. You will be resisted. You will be in a war. before we ever started this. And we were just dealing with some of the dimensions of the book of Ephesians. One of the joys of my heart, and yet one of the struggles of my heart, was that so many people were coming up to me and saying, Dave, I'm really opening myself up to this. I'm really learning what it means to deal with some of the things in my life that I've left buried all my life. This again, I said this when we first began this series, this has been the best year of my life. And it's been the worst year of my life. because I'm beginning to grow and when I did, I entered into a war. We've also discovered that after being warned that he will oppose your moving into the fullness of God, that primarily the aim of his attack is to do simply this. It's to get you to stop. It's to get you to stop. It's to get you to quit growing, to go back to wherever it was you were before he started. you know i was thinking about this in terms of how we change as the spirit of god continues to to control our lives and we continue to strip off the old and put on the new and this may sound a little bit ludicrous but my mind went back to when i candidated here as a church at the church and you were asking me questions and i was asking you questions and you wanted to know who i was and you want to know what i was like and i told you this is what i'm like and this is who i am and i asked you what are you like and then who are you and all this kind of you told me all those things but you know what? You got a different pastor this year than what you had last year, don't you? I hope so, because I've grown and I've changed, and I feel like I've got a totally different congregation than I had last year. And next year, the same. And the year after that, the same. Why? Because we're stripping off the old. We're stripping off the old, and we're putting on the new all the time, every day. But that means warfare. And what he wants you to do more than anything right now is, As you've moved into this new territory, it's to get you discouraged and to get you to stop. Do all sorts of things to accomplish that. One of the things he uses, I hope he's not using it here. I like to think that you'd never get exposed to this here, but I don't want to be naive. It's in the Word, and we're always warning that's false teaching. False teaching is one of the things that would knock you off. If you're continuing pressing on toward the goal, false teaching. Weak teaching can do the same thing. taking the truth and treating it in some sort of insipid, weak, watered-down way can keep you from really realizing that you even need to press on and to keep moving. We have been called in the church. The purpose of the church is chapter 4 of Ephesians. I hope you even see this in a new light and with a greater force. He gave some as apostles and prophets and evangelists and pastors and teachers. Why? For the equipping of the saints. For what? For war. that's what for war one of the things that will knock you off and get you to stop is teaching that's insipid and weak and we can't have that and if I ever move into that and if I ever quit moving and if I ever quit growing you have a responsibility to pull me aside in any other dimension of our leadership and say listen Dave we need to grow we need to keep growing fear and discouragement he'll use that as you grow you're going to be moving into new territory, stuff that you're not used to, areas that are brand new for you, and that's exciting, and it's real, and you're seeing God move in your life, and in your marriage, and in your family, and in our church in ways you've never seen before, but as well as being exciting, it's terrifying, because now I've got to trust God completely. I never had to do that when I was sitting still. And Satan wants you to stop. And maybe one of the hardest ones for us to handle is the one I mentioned last week, that he can actually use other believers. to get me to stop, to get you to stop, your best friend, your mom or your dad, your pastor. Heaven forbid, but it can happen. If you begin to grow in the fire of God's reality and the deeper dimensions of walking in the Spirit and again, stripping off the old, begin to come alive in you. Those who aren't in that very same kind of endeavor are going to want to pour water on you because you make them feel uncomfortable. people who are comfortable with their mediocrity are going to get you are going to try to put your fire out and we need to be warned about that that is a dimension of the warfare that we need to be alert to we need to love those people we need to encourage those people we need to continue to say get in the race get in the race get in the race but if they don't don't you stop you stand firm you fight the good fight of faith you run the race with endurance you forget what is behind reach out toward what is ahead and press on toward the goal of the high call that we have in Christ don't stop don't stop I know it's scary I know it's terrifying I know it's a struggle keep trusting God and keep growing keep moving into that territory. Keep doing it. Don't stop. By the way, you know that's another reason we come to church. It says exactly that in Hebrews chapter 11, verse 23 and 25. The reason we come to church is to encourage one another not to stop. Know that? It's to encourage one another not to stop, Not to give up. Keep moving. Fight the fight of faith. Hebrews 11, 23 says, Let us hold fast. You know what that terminology is? It's warfare talk, isn't it? Hold fast. To the confession of our faith without wavering. More warfare talk. Without wavering, standing firm. For he who promised his promises to you is faithful. Believe him, believe him, believe him. He is faithful. Hold fast. Stand firm. Don't waver. So what I want you to do With that exhortation is this Come together And when you do This is what I want you to do Consider Think up ways Just go into all different directions If you have to But think up ways To stimulate one another My word Agitate And I use that all the time Agitate them to grow Agitate you to grow Stimulate them to grow It's like electricity moving And I zap you one And you zap me one And it's stimulating one another to grow agitate each other to grow stimulate one another to grow to love and good deeds that's what it is to love and good deeds and then it goes on don't neglect assembling together but encourage one another to do what? to not stop to not stop what do we do when we come to church? two things when we come to church we stimulate one another to love and good deeds we stimulate we agitate one another to grow and then the second thing we do right behind that is we encourage it. Don't stop. Don't stop. Keep going. Be encouraged. And if as a church we're not doing that, then our gathering is missing something of the deep dimensions of what God has called us together for. We're in a war and Satan's job in that war is to hinder us as a church and as individuals from realizing in our living and in our church what the real purposes of God are. And the purposes of God, I don't have time to do it, but it just kicks back to all five chapters of Ephesians, doesn't it? The fullness of God, the filling of the Spirit. And Satan's job is to keep us from experiencing any of that. Satan's job is to keep our faith positional. I hope I don't have to define that word for you anymore. Just keep it theological. I'm forgiven and all that kind of stuff, and I know it, and it's true. But never experience it. That's his job. That's his job, to keep it way out there and distant and mediocre and nothing. Never experience it. Keep it from ever being practical. To keep us floundering in mediocrity. And then the next thing he does, not only does he get us to flounder in mediocrity, we do that, all of us. From time to time, there are times in our lives when we just can't press on anymore. And you need to back off. But you know what else he does? After he gets us to flounder in mediocrity, and we haven't come maybe together and been stimulated, the next thing he'll do is he'll convince you that it's normal. He'll convince you that it's normal to not see the fullness. He'll convince you that it's normal, that when we talk about exceeding abundantly beyond, that that really isn't something we're going to see. And then we begin to buy it. You know what? It's not normal. It's not normal. You remember when we preached in Ephesians 5, chapter 1? What's the most normal thing for a believer? The most normal thing for a believer is to look like the father who bore him, isn't it? Just like I have resemblances and I look a lot like my physical father. The most normal thing for me, for you, is to look like the father who bore you. Be thou therefore imitators of God as children who imitate their father, who look like their father. when my life is filled with bitterness and wrath and anger and slander and evil speech satan would come to me and again those things creep into the lives of every one of us myself included you don't think i struggle with bitterness and anger and slander it rises up in me the same way it does in you but satan would come to me and say Dave, it's normal. You're a human being. Do you know what they did to you? Do you know what they said about you? Have a right to be like this. No, I don't. That isn't normal. That isn't what God has called me to at all. And when I believe that lie, I'm just playing right into the hand of Satan. It's not normal. It's not appropriate. it. He's a liar. And he's attempting to do in your life and in my life, even this very moment, what he's always done. And that is this, steal from you and steal from me the reality of a living Lord in my life. To keep it out there, keep it theological, keep it abstract, and never make it real. It's always been that way, folks, even in salvation. I don't know where everyone here is. I assume when I'm talking to this many people that all of you don't know Christ as your Savior. But even at salvation, the Word of God tells us the gospel comes, Christ is speaking, and he says the gospel comes to some, and Satan's job, his function, what he will do in your life is come to snatch it away before you can respond. He'll snatch it away. And then when you become a believer, joy of joys, what happens to you when you become a believer? The worst thing that can happen is you can get into a church that's kind of living in this mediocrity. You know, have any of you ever been caught in that kind of thing? You just came to know the Lord and you're all excited and hey, man, I want to tell everybody and you come and all these people have been Christians for years and years and years and you go, isn't this wonderful? And they go, yeah it's pretty good not bad being a Christian you go what what what do you do you go back don't you you go back and so before long you begin to learn the rules too and you just sit there and you even try going from church to church to church and thinking maybe it's here maybe it's here maybe it's here and finally you get to the point where you believe the lie and that is that it's not anywhere the abundant life is nowhere it's nowhere to be found we'll talk about it but it isn't real and it'll keep it out there and it'll keep it distant and it'll keep it theological listen there's nothing wrong with theology I keep using that little phrase theology is the basis of our faith but theology that's just theology out there what I know is nothing it'll get you to think again that this is it and it isn't and that's why he gave us chapter 6 verses 10 and following it's saying basically this yes you will be attacked believer you will be opposed satan will try to steal your joy he will try to kill the life that you have but no you don't have to just stand there impotent there is something you can do be strong in the lord in the strength of his might put on the full armor of god that you may be able to fight, that you may be able to stand firm. But that's not enough. Put on the full armor of God. That sounds real grandiose and way up there, and I'm not even sure what that's saying. He gets real specific in the next following verses. Verses 14 through 18, he tells us specifically, piece by piece, how to put the armor on. Last week, we started with the first piece. Having girded your loins with truth. The first piece that we want to put on in preparation for this battle that Satan is moving against us with is the belt of truthfulness. The belt of truthfulness. And to gird up your loins. Remember last week we learned that basically what that means is to be ready, to be alert, to be aware, to be awake as a believer. The people of Israel, when they were leaving Egypt, they were told this, have your loins girded and your staves in your hand. What does that mean? Be ready. Jesus was speaking concerning how we are to live in anticipation of his return. He said simply this in the book of Luke. Have your loins girded and your lamps lit. Be ready. Have that belt drawn around you. Remember the imagery we had was that the Romans at that time wore a tunic. There was a hole for the head and two holes for the arms. And this flowing gown was wonderful and it went all over the place. When I was lounging around the house, it was tremendous. Felt great. But when I was going into war or when I was going even on a trip, What I needed to do was take that belt and wrap it around me and pull in all the loose ends. I didn't want anything flapping around. And the exhortation here is, dear believer, pull in all the loose ends of your life. Pull them in and get rid of all the entanglements in the world and the attitudes that would destroy you and pull it all in with the belt. Gird up your loins. Be ready for the war. Then we even learned what the belt was made of. The belt of truthfulness. The belt of truthfulness. And we learned last week that this did deal with content. It dealt with girding yourself with truth. The Word of God. But its fundamental meaning was not that. We are going to deal with the truth of God's Word when we talk about the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. This truthfulness that we are to gird ourselves with, prepare ourselves with, is truthfulness as in non-hypocritical, without hypocrisy. a commitment to Christ to the word to the truth that is without hypocrisy it is undefiled wrap that around you wrap around yourself in preparation for battle an unbridled commitment to the war to the truth to Jesus Christ wrap it around you be ready pull in the loose ends of your life this morning I'm going to try like crazy but I don't think I'm going to no we're not going to we're not going to get to the next piece of armor. Our time is short. But I need to give you some things that the Lord has laid on my heart very quickly here by way of underlining some of the things we dealt with last week. This is not going to be redundant. It is not going to be the same sermon. What I want to do, though, is underline the importance of being girded and ready for warfare. One of the things that happened to me this week when I was studying was as I was turning over these little phrases, and I do these word studies all the time, and the basic fundamental exhortation here is, be girded or be ready, be alert. And I kept looking up all these phrases, and I couldn't believe how many times that little phrase is found in the New Testament. Over and over and over. Be aware, be alert, be vigilant, be ready. Over and over again. Until that little phrase became more than just something that I, a believer was supposed to do once in a while. You know? It became for me, and I want it to become for you, one of the characteristics of a believer. Not only what I do, but who I am. That along with love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, being characteristics of a true believer, I want you to add to your list alertness, readiness, being totally prepared to do battle. A Christian is alert. A Christian is aware. 1 Corinthians 16, 13 Paul says this after all the teaching and all the rebuking that he had done to that church in Corinth was finished he finished it by saying this in that 13th verse and after I've done with everything I've got to say here's this be on the alert be awake don't be sleeping anymore revive us again we sang reviving us simply means quit sleeping wake up 1 Thessalonians 5, 6 says this, So let us not sleep as some do. Some believers do sleep, but let us be alert, awake, ready, and sober. Now, according to most lexicons, this is really interesting. This kind of broadened this out for me a little bit more. According to most lexicons, that particular word, when it talks about being alert, ready, sober, ready for action, awake, does not just mean be awake as opposed to being asleep. You know, some people are awake And some people are asleep But I'll tell you something else There are other people who are awake You know They're awake, you know, barely But they're awake like you are in the morning Before 12 cups of coffee, right? You're there, and you're at work And you're kind of hoping that you don't get your foot Or your hand caught in the thing And then there's other people who are awake And they're awake, you know The word here, most of the lexicons, again Are dealing with that kind of concept It's not just be awake as opposed to be asleep but be really awake. Don't be. Oh boy, be awake. Be aware. Be alert as a believer that your enemy, your adversary is moving against you even now. Be alert. The Christian life is to be characterized by being prepared, girded and ready to go, senses tuned, acutely aware of what is going on. We are not to be naive people. you can't live the Christian life in a stupor you can't live the Christian life in a sleepy way you can't do it it goes against it's non-characteristic it's a contradiction a sleepy Christian who isn't ready for warfare is a contradiction in terms all through the New Testament we hear this exhortation coming over and over again and the sound is simply this believers wake up be revived be aware 1 Peter 1.13 he is talking about the riches we have in Christ and one of the things he says is gird up the loins of your mind know what that means? what does it mean? we know the term it means simply this let your mind be working let your mind be thinking gird up the loins of your mind be ready to do action with your mind and think about the deeper things and think when you go into the word gird up the loins of your mind 1 Peter 5.8 the one we're familiar with Just because of our study. Be vigilant. Same word. Be vigilant. Awake. Aware. Girded. Why? Because you have an adversary, the devil, who's walking around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. And you know who he gets? People who are taking a snooze. Picture, you go to lion country, you know, a little lion safari, you drive your car. I don't see any lions. You go out, get out under the tree, go to sleep. You're dead. Sleepy Christians, it's a contradiction. It's a contradiction. Jesus himself in Mark 14, 28 says this, listen, watch and pray watch, be alert and pray why? lest you fall into any temptation I don't think as believers we can waltz around in the world thinking and exposing ourselves to all sorts of junk thinking that somehow that's not going to affect me watch and pray, be alert, be aware apathy and indifference apathy, oh, and indifference That's a definition of sleepiness, isn't it? Just kind of, ah, touch and go on with the flow. All it is is sleepiness. The book of Revelation, chapter 3, verses 1 and 2, talk about a sleepy church. It was a church in Sardis, and he says this, Dear church in Sardis, I know your deeds. And I know that you have a name that you are alive. I know that you have a name on the side of your building, and it says First Church of Sardis. And I know that the program is moving, and I know that people are coming, and I know that you have a name that you're alive but you're dead because all you're doing is going through the motions. The classes are there. Everybody's busy. But there's one problem. There's no life there. God's not there. The glory's departed. Ichabod is written. And you know what he says in the very next verse? What do you think? What do you think? Wake up. Wake up. And then he says strengthen the things that remain. You know what that means? It means this. The things that are dead are dead. The things that are dead are dead. What you need to do when you wake up out of your sleep is do an inventory of your life and do an inventory of your church. Look at the things that are dead. Recognize their deadness. Find the things that are alive and strengthen them. Real important instruction. What do we do? Where do we go? Find the things that are alive. Give them strength. Don't let them die too. Verse 3, real scary, says this. But if you don't wake up, if your body, if your church isn't characterized, if your life isn't characterized by an alive awareness, I will move against you in judgment, it's over. It's over. A sleepy church, adult church, is not a church. Did you get that? I think that's a pretty strong statement. Adult church, a sleepy church, is not a church. The Word of God tells us that. You have a name that you're alive, but you're dead. 2 Timothy 3 says, Watch thou for false teachers be alert. goes on in 1 Peter 4, 7 and Ephesians 6, 18 when you pray when you pray you know how you should pray? alert pray in such a way that you're alert don't just pray vaguely and go through a list don't just pray in such a way oh bless the missionaries be specific pray alert get your mind girded for what you're doing and even in the Lord's return watch be alert what does that word mean there? you know I don't even need to read you the parables of that but over and over again we've heard that thing you know what I say to you I have said to all, watch and pray, be ready for the Lord's return. What does that mean? Well, when I was a kid, I used to think what that meant was I was supposed to look up in the sky and watch. Right? And I used to do this. I remember, I don't know how old I was, but I remember sitting in this apartment looking out the window and clouds would start rolling. This is it. Here it comes. I've been watching. I remember also when I was a kid, one of the things we used to hear in church was when it means be watchful and ready for the Lord's return is make sure you're not doing anything that you shouldn't be doing when he comes. Remember that one? Make sure you're not in a theater going to a movie when he comes. Would you want to be there when he comes? You ever hear that one? I heard that one. I can even say it good. Make you feel guilty. You know another place you don't want to be? Listen to this. Another place you don't want to be when he comes because what it means to watch and be ready for the Lord's return doesn't mean to be watching and be anticipating even and be excited even. It means more than that. It means all those things, but it means more than that. It means be doing, doing what God's called you to do. So when he comes, what you're doing is swinging the sword and winning the lost and healing people's lives. Be involved in the ministry when he comes. Watch, be ready, be alert. The other place I wouldn't want to be when the Lord returns would be just doing nothing just kind of watching oh he's coming oh i'm so excited that's another place i wouldn't want to be there and neither would you it says to watch that means be in the middle of the warfare until he comes be ready be ready the church of corinth wasn't they're a perfect example of a church that was in a stupor even in a physical stupor you remember in 1 Corinthians 11? When they were coming to the table, what was the problem? Everybody was drunk. Can you imagine that? Now, we would never go that low, right? I mean, we would never do that. We would deal with that pretty firmly. But these people were drunk when they went to serve communion. And you know the real problem with being drunk? Tying right in with what we're talking about here. It's that you're in a stupor. You're not, what? Alert. You're not aware. They weren't aware of Satan. They weren't aware of what God wanted them to do. They weren't aware of the needs. They weren't aware. They were in a stupor, physically. And so it dulled, what? It dulled their senses, didn't it? To what God wanted them to do, the worship he wanted them to have, they were just out of touch. There was a bigger problem than they had. Not only were they in a physical stupor, but they were in a spiritual stupor as well. They were spiritually dull, and that is deadly for a Christian, isn't it? There's no way you can fight the war. There's no way you're even going to know about the war if you're sleeping. It's just going to go by. And I will admit this, and again, I'm not going to make this some rosy tinted glasses type appeal. the warfare isn't easy the warfare is victorious and you're going to begin to experience the fullness of God but again it's not going to be light and skippy they were in a spiritual stupor as well and the biggest problem for the church in Corinth was this, you know what it was? they didn't know, they didn't know and over and over again one of the things that came to me again is this, I stumbled on this this week it was all by accident, I apologize I didn't mean it he kept saying over to them over and over again don't you know don't you know don't you know first corinthians 5 6 here's six here's some examples he says this don't you know believers in corinth because they were real well i got to backtrack here i'm interrupting myself but i've got to do this one of the things they were doing was tolerating sin in their church and they were really beginning to get a little bit proud of the fact that people who really weren't godly people were in positions of authority and having great influence on the church and they kind of threw it up on a banner and said, see, this means we understand grace and this means we understand love because we put up with all this. Isn't this wonderful? We've really got it. Paul comes and says, don't you know that a little leaven is going to leaven the whole lump? Don't you know that? Come on. Don't you realize that that kind of carnality is going to foul up the whole place? Wake up. Wake up. Verse 12, don't you know, again that word, Don't you know that we are supposed to judge and evaluate those who are in the church? The verse before that says you don't do that to ones outside, but when you are assessing who leadership is to be and the directions you want to go, you evaluate. You assess. Because you assess what is a plus and what is a minus. And you don't let yourself be influenced by that which is negative, by that which is carnal, by that which is not pressing on. don't you know that and the people in Corinth who didn't know the word when they heard things like that said really? really? I didn't know that chapter 6 verse 5 Paul rebuked them and said is there no one wise among you who can discern and assess and discern which direction you need to go and in order to to make sure that leaven doesn't influence and hold you back is there no one among you who is wise enough to do that? And then he says, I say this to your shame because there ought to be. Be alert. Be alert. In fact, he goes on saying this, don't you know, don't you know. Over and over again. And even in chapter 11, he warns them and says, every once in a while, there are going to be things in the church that come up and there will be upheavals and divisions will come. He says in 1 Corinthians 11, 18 and 19, I hear that there are divisions among you. and then he says the thing that I wasn't ready for at all and don't understand. And he says, but these things need must be. He doesn't say they're good. He says they're necessary. Why? So that those who are approved may become evident. So that those who are approved may become evident. When things blow up, the cream rises to the top. You're going to see it all the time. All the time. In the life of your family, in the life of our church, we're going to see that all the time. When things blow up, watch how people react. It's important. because not only will those who are approved become evident the other thing implied is that those who are not will also and we need to be alert to that it goes on again 1 Corinthians 6.9 don't you know that the unrighteous won't inherit the kingdom don't you know 6.15 that your bodies are members of Christ 6.16 don't you know that if you join your body to a harlot you're joining yourself to her in your one flesh don't you know chapter 6.19 that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. You know the problems with the Corinthians? They didn't know. They didn't know. They weren't alert. They knew their salvation. They were the kind of church that probably had the four spiritual laws, maybe, memorized backwards and forwards. Listen, there's nothing wrong with the four spiritual laws. The problem with this church, they understood salvation. They just didn't understand pressing on. They didn't understand working out their salvation in fear and trembling. Philippians 2.12. Has that verse ever plagued you? It has me. I used to look at that verse and go, what is this? Work out your salvation with fear and trembling. Is that some sort of kick back into works or something like that? You know, you'll work out your salvation. No, no. And again, this came to me this week. It's Ephesians. Work out your salvation in fear and trembling simply means this. Get what is on the inside worked out. to the outside. Work out your salvation. Get it from being just sitting in there. Move away from that beginning point and begin to run the race. Work it out. Work it out. Get it out here where people can see it. The church in Corinth didn't know. They didn't know. They didn't know. And so Paul came to them and began to tell them. Paul came to them and he began to tell them. And some of the people went, oh. And they began to grow. And some of the people hated them and some of the people fell away. That's a scary thing to me. Isn't that to you? But we need to be alert to that also. The parable of the sower in Mark 4 says this, verse 17, is not just the persecution that comes when we're obedient to the Word. When I'm obedient to the Word, we are told that we're going to suffer for that, right? Persecution of the Word here is simply that. It's the persecution that the Word itself will inflict on your life. The chastisement. You see, the word of God is what? Among all the other things it is, it's a sword, isn't it? It's a sword, and it pierces me, Hebrews 4, 12. It is living, it is active, and it is sharp. And sometimes it stabs me, doesn't it? And it doesn't feel good when it does. And it divides the soul and the spirit, the joints and the marrow, And it too, quoting, judges, judges the thoughts and intentions of the heart. Again, what's the problem? It's getting away from the external, judging the thoughts and intentions of the heart. That's what the Word of God does. That's the persecution of the Word. And in verse 13, it says the Word of God comes and exposes them. To God, when the Word comes into your life and into my life, it exposes me. And the terminology in verse 13 is everything is laid bare. You know, I can hide it from you, you can hide it from me, but in the eyes of God when the word comes, it's exposed. And there's a persecution in that. There's a painfulness that comes in that. And because of that, some will fall away. I think we need to realize and be alert to the fact, be aware of the fact that if as a church we are committed to preaching and teaching the word of God, with any kind of depth, if you're a teacher, if you're working in Awana, and you espouse to deal with the Word of God with any kind of depth, I think you need to be aware that it's going to do that. That at times it's going to pierce, and some could fall away because of the persecution of the Word. So what do you do? You keep pressing on. you see if our message got mushy and vague and if our message kind of just vacillated back and forth and didn't really ever take a stand there would be no problem would there we would never be confronted with our sin we would never be even confronted no one people could come here and not even know they needed to be saved people could come here and not even know that they needed to grow so what does paul say he says this first corinthians 8 9 take heed be alert 10 12 take heed be aware 12 1 i don't want you to be ignorant concerning spirituals concerning gifts their problem they were they were they were in a stupor the corinthians were a victim of every con that satan could employ mediocrity sleepiness sin bitterness anger strife why because they weren't alert because they weren't aware they didn't know they didn't know they didn't know if we are I don't know Christians we're in a lot of trouble we need to know we need to be alert we need to be aware of the fact that we are in a war that Satan will move against us and is moving against us and will move against you and is moving against you and will get you to stop and to slow down and to quit pressing on be alert satan's going to try to stop you be alert he's going to throw temptation in your way be alert he's going to want you to be apathetic be alert he's going to want you to not pray be alert he's going to want you to let that seed of bitterness not only get there but take root could I say something about that? bitterness anger strife I'm not real sure I'm not real sure that bitterness anger and strife that rises up in you and rises up in me is somehow wrong in and of itself now I'm going off on a tangent here and I oh boy I went the real problem with bitterness is when I allow that to take root when I allow it to take root. There are times, I've got to be honest, there are times that that creeps into my life and that anger creeps into my life and I'll play with it for a whole day but you know what's wrong, what's sinful and what turns that into a sin and a destructive element in our body among us is when I play with it all day long, you know, and I think of all my reasons and you think of all your reasons and you build your case and you build your case. We all do that. Don't allow it to take root. be alert Satan would love to get you that way we need to know we need to know the Lord's returning are you alert to that are you alert to the fact that he could come today are you fighting the fight so that when he comes you're ready I need to ask one more question as I end this and this is to those who don't even know the Lord are here and don't you're wondering what is this lunatic talking about anyway there is a way you can be less ready to meet the lord than a christian who is sleeping and that is to not know him and i just wonder if there are those here among us this morning who are really asleep who are more than sleepy they're spiritually dead and I want you to just bow your heads and your hearts just for a moment this has been a message of warning to all of us we need to be alert concerning the ways that Satan will come and the way he will move but I can't think of anything more important that is to believers and those kinds of warnings are brought with a tremendous amount of love because we want to keep growing. But there are some here who aren't even in the conflict at all. Don't know Christ as your Savior. Before you leave this morning, you need to know him. You need to receive him. You need to go from death to life. Are you ready for the Lord's return? If you're not, and if this morning you would say dave i want to be ready and i wanted and i want to know him and i want to know him this morning would you just raise your hand real quickly no one's looking around anyone at all Thank you.
