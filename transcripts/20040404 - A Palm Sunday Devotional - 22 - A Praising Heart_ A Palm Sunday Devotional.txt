Hosanna to the Son of David, they sang. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest, they cried. But underneath the celebration, behind this veil of praise, something was brewing. Something was stirring. Something was wrong. On the surface, it looked great. Matthew 21, verse 8 says, Most of the multitude spread their garments on the road in front of Jesus, and that meant something. It's drawn right out of 2 Kings 9, 13. It was the coronation of King Jehu, and it was a symbolic gesture as they threw their coats in Jehu's way as he came into the city, saying to him, We submit now to your sovereign right to rule. So when Jesus came into the city, they threw their coats. That's what it meant, a coronation of a king. Others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road as the whole multitude going before him and those who followed were crying out, saying, Hosanna to the son of David, Hosanna to the king. But underneath, something was brewing. Something was stirring. Something was wrong with this picture. Not sure what. But there were some clues. Some of them are actually even provided from Jesus as to what's just a little off in this picture. The cult of a donkey. What's that? What's that about? Verse 2 of Matthew 21, he sent two disciples with these instructions. You'll see two animals, a donkey and the colt of a donkey. Bring them to me. But he rode the colt of the donkey. It's just odd. Now, if you kind of just go with your picture from Sunday school that you got used to, you may not even see how odd it is. But if you just let this be what it is, a coronation, he's riding not a donkey, but the colt of a donkey. I think he looked goofy. I think it looked like a hat that didn't fit. I mean, the donkey should have been riding him. This is a weird picture. Something's off. This is his triumphal entry, what most scholars refer to as the coronation of a king. We don't know a lot about coronations. We live in a democracy, not a monarchy. We have a presidency, not a king or a queen. but history tells us a lot about coronations, these glorious events filled with rich people, rich clothing, rich food, feasts, banquets, jewels. If I were to update it and I would think of inauguration, I would think of majestic buildings, great halls, famous rich people coming in really cool cars. I'm into cars. Well, at this, there would be great big horses. Either way, you've got a lot of horsepower going on here. Everything about these events were designed to point to the glory of the event and the elevation of the person. Sometimes a king in biblical days was raised on a great shield, often riding a great horse, presented then with a spear, a sword, and a scepter. But most important and most often associated with a king or a queen would be a crown. 1838, the coronation of Queen Victoria. She was given a crown with rubies and sapphires all around with a 309-carat diamond in the middle. And then she was given a scepter with a 516-carat diamond on the top. Which means this triumphal entry of Jesus, this coronation of Jesus as king, is just a little odd. It's just a little off. I mean, some elements of what I would associate with a coronation are there and are fitting. The great crowd, the multitude is there. The celebration is there. That's fitting, and that's what I would expect of a coronation. And the adoration of the people, that's there. I would expect that in a coronation as well. But the colt of a donkey, it's just weird. A bunch of branches, some old clothes thrown in the road. It's kind of majestic. but not. Looks like a Kmart coronation, I think. Some other clues that something was off here. Something was odd, wrong. It's just the adoration of the people themselves. Something was off in that. Now, admittedly, we are looking at their adoration through the lens of history because we know what comes after. We know that this adoring crowd that is here crying, Hosanna, Hosanna, will in four days be crying, Crucify him, crucify him. We know that. So it makes this scene look odd to me. Something's off, something's brewing underneath the surface. I'm not real excited about the palm branches waving. Some of these people crying, Hosanna, will soon be crying, crucify him. We know that. I think Jesus knew it too. Actually, we know Jesus knew it. Matthew 20, just the previous chapter, verse 18, Jesus is preparing his disciples for what is to be when he says to them, I must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things. I will be delivered up to the chief priests and the scribes, then delivered up to the Gentiles, which was a reference to the Romans. I will by them be mocked and scourged and crucified. Get the picture. The city is stirred. The crowd is swelled. The adoration for Jesus is deafening with Jesus right in the middle of all of that praise, riding on the colt of a donkey, knowing that this journey he is on is leading to a cross. I wonder about the look on his face. I'm sure there are paintings of him close up in this event, but given what we know is really going on, not only on the surface, but underneath and where it's leading, I wonder about the look on his face. Do you think he was smiling? Do you think he was laughing? Do you think he looked like the homecoming queen? Do you think there were high fives all around? Yeah, isn't this great? Three things about Jesus here I want you to know and have it in your mind as he rode into Jerusalem on the colt of a donkey, surrounded with praise that would soon turn to Christ for his torturous death. Number one thing I want you to know is this, he knew. He knew. He knew that the crowd would soon turn, and he knew that the cross was looming. Second thing I want you to know about him as he entered into Jerusalem on the colt of a donkey, surrounded by this praise is this, that he wept. How do you know that? Interesting, in Luke 19, 41, Luke 19 is the Lucan account of this triumphal entry, and right up to verse 40, you have the people singing Hosanna, Hosanna. In verse 41, it says this, that Jesus, entering into Jerusalem, looked across the city, looked across this multitude, and he wept. And that really puts a spin on my expectation, and And what I've tried to think of this event, this triumphal entry, I had to be a happy day. And there weren't high fives all around. He knew he wept for himself. Well, that wouldn't be altogether inappropriate. In just a few days in Gethsemane, we will see him grieved to the point of death in his own personal soul for the anguish he was about to enter into. But in this scene, his weeping wasn't for him. It was for the multitude. because he knew of their blindness and he knew that in their blindness they didn't know they were blind and he knew of their deafness and he knew that in their deafness they didn'T know they were deaf and he knew of their lostness and he knew that in their lostness they didn't now that they were lost and he knew that they would turn on him. That leads to the third thing I want you to know about him. It's this. He went anyway. to the cross. Three things. He knew that the crowd would turn. He knew that the cross was looming. He wept for their lostness. He went anyway, which makes me want to cry in a different way than the multitude cried, Hosanna. Hosanna. Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord. Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so a child song if you went to Sunday school you sang it in Sunday school that child's song is brought to life for me almost on a daily basis by a picture I have on my desk It's a small picture, about this big. You know, wooden frame sits on my desk. It's a pencil sketch of the arm of a man. That's all you see. From the elbow to the hand, skewered with a spike through the wrist. Obviously the hand of Jesus. With these words written underneath the picture, Jesus loves me. This I know. yes, Jesus loves me which makes me want to cry Hosanna Hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord because as Jesus rode into Jerusalem that day on the colt of a donkey surrounded by an adoring crowd he knew that they would turn he knew the cross was looming he wept and he went anyway, which makes me want to cry Hosanna. The soldiers had fun that day, that crucifixion day, and it lasted all day. From the horrific beating to the bullying game of blind man's bluff, a number of the gospel accounts indicate that in the course of the mocking and scourging, Jesus was blindfolded and with a blindfold on punched. Come on, prophet man, tell us who hit you. Tell us who just spit on you. I, like many of you, in the last week or so, saw the movie The Passion. And when I saw the mocking and the scourging that was inflicted on Jesus, I honestly, my reaction as I left was, I think they overdid it a bit. Couldn't have been that bad. Since that time, I've done some research. I've done some reading. It was harder to read than it was to watch what they did to him. have you ever marveled at or some times even angrily questioned the restraint of god when it looks like evil is having its way because there are times in seasons of time when evil looks like it's winning and and we ask questions like this they they come from some primal places how could You allow that, God. I'm sure you've asked those questions, had that anger. Can you imagine, however? Can you conceive it in your mind, the restraint of God on this dark day, when evil had its way with the second person of the Trinity, even Jesus himself, with every lash of the whip, with every crunch of fist against the face and flesh of Jesus, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit knew that legions of angels awaited his command. One word from him, and this ordeal is over, and the world would get what the world deserved, but no such word was uttered. The lion became a lamb that day. Three things about Jesus I want you to know as he entered Jerusalem, riding on the colt of a donkey, surrounded by the adoring crowd, he knew that the crowd would turn, that the cross was looming. He knew, he wept, he went anyway, and it makes me want to cry, Hosanna, Hosanna, blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord. The Roman historian, philosopher Cicero, wrote this in his memoirs. The very idea of the cross should never come near the bodies or minds of Roman citizens. It should never pass through their thoughts, eyes, or ears. To Romans, crucifixion was the cruelest form of capital punishment, reserved for people who deserved it, never for a Roman, only for the lowest of the low, the scum of the earth, the murderers, the thieves, the leaders of slave revolts. Romans were beheaded, never crucified, which is very nice, isn't it? Actually, it was quite merciful compared to crucifixion. Jews shared this revulsion, preferring stoning when they had authority to kill. History records that it took many years, even for the church, to look upon a physical cross as a symbol of healing or hope or faith or love. church founders, actually, forbade the cross's depiction in art, grateful for its theological implications, but it was gruesome to see. I mean, it would be the equivalent of today us having jewelry with an electric chair around her neck. I mean, it was very tasteless. C.S. Lewis, in fact, points out that the crucifixion did not become common in art until all who had seen a real one had passed off the scene. Three things about Jesus I want you to know as he rode into Jerusalem on the colt of a donkey surrounded by an adoring crowd, he knew what was coming. He wept and he went anyway, which makes me want to sing, Hosanna, Hosanna, blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord. he spoke some things while dying there snatches of conversation are recorded among the things he said was this I thirst wasn't necessarily the most profound thing that he said but it is ironic isn't it that the one who provided gallons of wine at a wedding feast, that the one who spoke of living water that would quench the thirst of men and women forever would die with a swollen tongue and the sour smell of spilled vinegar in his beard. Three things about Jesus, I want you to know, as he rode into Jerusalem on the colt of a donkey, surrounded by an adoring crowd, he knew, he wept, and he went anyway, which makes me want to sing Hosanna. Hosanna. Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord, and it makes me want to worship the king. Oh, worship the king, all glorious above, and gratefully sing his power and his love. to tell of his might, to sing of his grace. It makes me want to cry, Hosanna. So let's do it together as we prepare our hearts for the table. Let's stand and sing to the king, Hosanna. And so we come, bringing who we are and what we have, here's my question for you this morning what do you have to bring to the cross to the table I suspect there's something Al Shucks spoke a sermon last week about fear I wonder how many of you have some fear that you need to bring to the table that you need to bring to the cross it's amazing isn't it the cross that I described just a moment ago in the talk that people would run from couldn't even look on has taken new significance for us because of the life that came from this death because some of you are just wanting me to be quiet so you can come so you can run to this cross and bring your fear and bring your sin and bring your guilt and bring your failure and bring your disappointment and your confusion and the Spirit and the Bride say, Come. We celebrate the bread and the wine. Hosanna. You know what it means? It means save us now. Save us now. save us now from our sin save us now from our fear and from our guilt we need a savior and so we sing Hosanna blessed is the king who has come in the name of the Lord so we can come blessed father son and holy spirit these elements that we now partake of symbolizing to us the very life of God the spiritual food we need to live bread and wine and thank you for the cross that makes it possible for us to partake of the life of God through Christ our Savior in Jesus name Amen
