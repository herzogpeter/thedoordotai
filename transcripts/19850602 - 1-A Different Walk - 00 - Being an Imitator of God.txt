Ephesians chapter 4 verse 17. This I say therefore and affirm together with the Lord, meaning that I'm not the only one who's saying this, God is saying this too, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk. And how do they walk? In the futility of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their hearts. And they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. But you did not learn Christ in this way, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him just as truth is in Jesus, that in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. Let's pray. Amen. Father, your word to me is precious. And as I even consider this text this morning, it weakens me. Because there is so much truth and it is so deep, the mind that I have doesn't seem to be able to even scratch the surface. And I pray, Lord Jesus, in Your name, for a special anointing of Your Spirit as we would hear from You this morning. Lord Jesus, open us up and open me up. I've been struggling with this this week in terms of the areas that You want to change in me. And Father, as we hear your word, may it take root. I pray this in your name. Amen. In this text, Paul is moving into a section that is intensely practical. We have spent three chapters, you know that already, talking a lot about theology and doctrine, the position of the believer, a lot of stuff way up there that tells us who we are in Christ and all that kind of thing. And now Paul is getting practical. Because of who you are, this is how you should live. And that practicality is getting more and more intense. It's getting more and more close to where I really live. The problem is, along with being intensely practical, this text is intensely theological. And the problem that leaves us with is this. In order for me to see the practical dimension of how this needs to be applied to my life and your life, I need to understand the theology that is here in order for me to make the application. By way of introduction, what I want us to do is kind of, instead of going verse to verse, back off this text a little bit and clarify three things that I think will help us lay a foundation for the understanding of the rest of this text. I want you to draw your attention to three imperatives that are in this text. The first imperative is in verse 17. It says this, that you no longer walk just as the Gentiles walk. Okay? That's the first imperative. You're going to live, you're going to walk a different walk than the Gentiles walk. The second imperative is in verse 22. That in reference to your former manner of life, your former walk, you lay aside the old self. Now laying aside the old self gives me the imagery of taking something off. Like I would take a coat off and lay it aside, okay? That's the imagery. Taking something that is on the outside off. And then in verse 24, the third imperative is this. And as you take off that old self, put on a new one. Take off the old coat, put on a new coat. We need to understand something here. Very basic. When you became a Christian, when you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, a wonderful and miraculous change took place in your life. It was simply this, that you became a new creature in Christ. You know that. 2 Corinthians 5.17 says, Therefore, if any man is in Christ, he is a what? He is a new creature. Old things have passed away, dead. Behold, new things, living things have come. Galatians 2.20 says something of the same thing. Paul says, I have been crucified with Christ. I died. I have been crucified with Christ, and yet something strange is happening here because nevertheless, I live. But it isn't I who live, it's Christ who lives in me. There's a new I. There's a new you. You are a new creation in Christ Jesus. The Bible calls it newness of life. Newness of life. New things have come. Now, the reason I'm laying this foundation is because of this reference to the old self taking it off and the new self putting it on. We hear a lot about, theologically and from pulpits, about the old nature and the new nature. And there's a lot of teaching going around that would teach that when you become a Christian, A new nature comes, but the old nature is still there. And what you have is these two natures vying for power all the time. I want to say something, and maybe the best way I can just approach this is by stating my position. I want to be very clear, and maybe even as I go through this, you're going to think, well, Johnson, you're really kind of dinking around with semantics. We all agree you're just saying it differently. I think it's important that we say what we mean, and we mean what we say, and that it be able to be verified in Scripture. This is the theology that we need to understand before we can ever make appropriate kinds of applications. You see, I do not believe that the Word of God teaches that there's an old nature and a new nature. I was crucified with Christ. That old nature died. I am a new creature in Christ. It wasn't an addition of a new nature along with my old nature. It was a transformation is what took place in my life. The question that I'm left with, however, is this. if I am a new creature, if the old nature is dead, then why in the world do I still mess up? Why in the world do I still sin? What is it that is continually pulling me into sin? If I'm a new nature, the old nature is dead. I've always had it explained to me that that old nature was the thing that kind of pulled me into sin. The explanation is this, that though I am a new creature, though I am solid gold and I am holy and blameless before God, the problem with me is that though I am a new creature, I have still got this coat of flesh wrapped around that new nature. You see, this flesh is still here. This body is still here. And it's still living in accordance to what has been trained in that body from the time I was born. The best way to illustrate this so you understand that this really is deeply biblical and deeply theological is to explain it this way. I think the best illustration is, see, I believe that what Paul is doing here when he talks about old self, new self, old nature, new nature, the old nature being dead, is what he's really talking about is positional and practical truth in just a whole different way. Now, we know all about positional truth, don't we? We've been in Ephesians for nine months. You better know something about positional truth, because either you're sleeping or I'm not doing a very good job at all. Positional truth is this, that I stand before God, what? Holy and blameless, accepted, redeemed, right? That's my position. Nothing can change it. That's a fact, right? It isn't halfway. I'm not standing before him kind of holy, and there's another unholy thing there. Before him, positionally, I'm holy, okay? Positional truth. That's the new nature. The problem is something else, isn't it? And that's what we talked about, practical truth. Practical truth is the fact that even though I'm holy and blameless before God, and I know that for a fact, and I'm forgiven and accepted, that practically I look at my life, and I see a lot of junk. I see a lot of garbage. And I think, man alive, why in the world, if I am holy, why don't I see that in my life? It's a different story, practically. We see positional truth, holy, blameless, undefiled. We see practical truth, my life, I see myself in sin. And in Ephesians 4, verse 1, we began to get into this exhortation from the Apostle Paul that said, Believer, make your practice equal to your position. Okay? Now what I want you to do, believer, is make the outside look like the inside. Okay? In chapter 4, verses 17 through 24, he's saying the same thing in a different way. He's saying this. Believer, you are a new creation. The old died. There is newness of life. Internally, you are solid gold. You are holy and blameless. And what I want you to do now, because of the fact that you are a new creation, what I want you to do is take off that lifestyle that doesn't fit who you are. I want you to put on a new coat. I want you to take off the old coat and put on a new coat. And that coat is talking about a lifestyle. A lifestyle that's external. Maybe I can picture it this way for you. I have in my mind as I was dealing with this text and trying to come up with images and pictures that I thought the Apostle Paul was trying to picture. I don't know if this is what he was trying to picture, but this is what I came up with, and I'll share it with you. I have pictured in my mind a great big solid hunk of gold. And that gold is pure and it is undefiled and there is nothing in it other than solidness and purity. And that's me. That's that new nature that is brand new. And the old things are passed away. The problem with that beautiful hunk of gold that's shaped a lot like me is that it's covered with a whole bunch of junk. And there's mud all over it. and there's dirt and lint and garbage hanging from it and seaweed and yuck, and it smells. And that is why in verse 22, the exhortation is this, believer, you are a new creation, strip off that old self. Strip off the mud, strip off the seaweed, strip off the junk, and put on a coat that is going to match on the outside who you are on the inside. That's why 1 Peter 2.1 says, strip off the old man, believer. Strip off the old man. Strip off that coat, that stinking, smelly, muddy coat of guile, of hypocrisy, of slander, of envy. Why should you strip it off? Because simply this. You've been made new. And that junky coat you're wearing doesn't look good at all with the gold that's underneath. It doesn't look good at all. It doesn't go with the furniture. On top of that, it stinks. You know that malice stinks. And slander stinks. And envy stinks. You've got a new life. And now, believer, what you need to do is get a new lifestyle to go with it. Take off the old. Let me give you a view of where we're going with this study very quickly. Ephesians 4, verses 17 through chapter 6, verse 9 is very interesting. It's going to be telling us over and over and over again how to take off the old coat. It's going to be telling us over and over again dimensions of our life. It's going to be pointing out to us the mud. Let's just go with that kind of analogy. It's going to be pointing out to your life the muddy parts in your life that need to be stripped off so that I can see the gold. So that people can see the gold. Strip off the old. And so we do that. Let's say for the next several weeks or several months, I don't know how long it's going to take us. We'll see. I never dreamed we'd still be in Ephesians after nine months, but we are, so it may take a while. But let's say we're doing that as a church And individually we're all kind of week by week The Lord is just convicting us And stripping off these things that are junk And they stink And they need to be put out of our lives And we're doing that And all of a sudden we get to Ephesians 6 verse 10 And we're standing there naked You know there's nothing on We've stripped off all the old stuff And we're just standing there We feel kind of embarrassed You know what's neat I like this It's going to tell us this all over and over again Take it off Take it off Take it off Strip it off It's garbage And when we're all done with that, in Ephesians 6, verse 10, Paul's going to say, now put on the whole armor of God. Put on. Take it off and then put it on. I like that. From smelly, tattered rags to the armor of God. You know what we're talking about? We're talking about maturing the saints, aren't we? That's what we're talking about. We dealt with that last Sunday. Okay, with that as a foundation, we need to dig into the text. Now, again, I think that this is a tough text, and it's intensely practical. But again, the only way we're going to get to the practical nature of this text is to understand the theology. So we've got to dig. I don't think there are any shortcuts. We're not going to be able to apply it unless we get our minds in gear and go with this thing. In order to catch the flow and for you to be able to follow with me, you know, there are a lot of texts. Last week was an example where I could start in a verse and just follow the flow, and Paul had it outlined beautifully, and it was just simple. one, two, three, you know, you go from verse 9 and 10 was one point, 11 and 12 was second point, 13 and 14 is the third point. Yeah, it's easy. It's not like that in this one. We've got to kind of put something together. So let me give you the three things that we need to understand if we're going to grasp what Paul is saying. First of all, I need to understand that as a believer, I am a new creation. I have a new nature. Okay? Write that down if you're taking notes. If you're not taking notes, feel real guilty. Okay? As a believer, I am a new creation. I have a new nature. The old is dead. The old nature is dead. The second thing I need to understand then is this, and this is where the exhortation begins to come. That new nature calls me to a new lifestyle. Okay? Very important. That is going to be found in verses 17, verse 22, and verse 24. I have a new nature. That new nature calls me to a new lifestyle. The third principle that we need to understand is this, that while we are getting all excited about a new lifestyle, a new coat that I'm going to put on, We need to understand that that new lifestyle is set in motion by one thing, very important, a new mind, a new will. We're going to get into that. Those are the three things I want you to understand. A new nature leads to a new lifestyle. A new lifestyle is engaged or set into motion by a new mind. First, let's hit these specifically. A new nature. I think we've already touched on that sufficiently so you understand it. I, as a believer, am a new creation. Okay, a new nature. The second thing, and this is where we want to get to digging, a new nature calls me to a new lifestyle. Believer, because you're a believer, there are going to be some things that you do differently than you did before. And that's all there is to it. Now listen, this whole thing started, you remember, in chapter 4, verse 1 of the book of Ephesians. And the exhortation was this. If you want to walk a worthy walk, if you want to make your practice, your outward self, equal to your position, that high, exalted, lofty position. If you want to do that, you're going to have to walk a worthy walk. And so the exhortation was to do that. Make your practice equal to your position. Okay? Make your practice equal to your position. Make your lifestyle equal to your nature. We're saying it a different way, right? Make your coat look like who you really are. The way to do that was what? Remember what he did? When he was talking about worthy walk, the first priority in dealing with making sure my practice is equal to my position is this. First and foremost, I have got to change my attitude. The first change that's going to take place in me, if I'm going to walk a worthy walk, is there's going to be a change in attitude. Instead of proud and arrogant and going my own way, there's going to be humility. How do I walk worthy? Remember that? I like that. Of that high, exalted, lofty position in Christ, I stick out my chest and say I'm a king's kid. No, I walk a humble walk, and I walk a gentle walk, and I walk a patient walk, and I walk a meek walk, and a forbearing walk. It's an attitude. And we kind of caught on phrases like this. There are a lot of people who can do the deed and not be the person. And we talked about the fact that what Paul was teaching us there was this, that who I am is more important than what I do. You got that? Remember that? Who I am on the inside. Humble, meek, gentle. Those kinds of internal qualities is a lot more important than what I'm doing. And we really got all over the case of the hypocritical believer, the Pharisee, if you will, who's doing the deed, who's wearing the right clothes, who's got their haircut right, saying all the right words, going to church all the time, and their hearts are just hard and they're bitter and they're angry. They don't know how to love people. And Paul says real strongly, who you are is more important than what you do. And when we have a bunch of people doing the deed and not being the person God calls it hypocrisy of the basest form. But now what is happening, and I want you to come with me here and catch this, what is happening now in verse 17, Paul is saying again. He's getting more and more practical and more and more specific. He steps back and says, listen, who I am is more important than what I do, but what I do is important too. What I do is important too. That's verse 17. This I say therefore and affirm together with the Lord. Again, it's not just me saying it, it's God saying it, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk. Really interesting to me the way he approaches this. In chapter 4, verse 1, he gave us positive things to do. Walk worthy. How? Do this and this and this and this. And this time he takes a negative approach and says, walk worthy. I want you to walk your manner of life. Let it be what? I'm not going to tell you what I want it to be. I'm going to tell you what I don't want it to be. I don't want it to be like the Gentiles walk. The word Gentile there is not referring to the Gentiles as a race. It's referring to the world. The world's lifestyle. The world's way of thinking. What I want you to do is not walk the way the world is walking. How is the believer supposed to walk? His answer, not like them. What kind of walk do we have? It's a different walk. Not very specific, is it? It's kind of vague. It kind of bothers me. I feel a little frustrated with that. It seems way too general. The problem I have, however, is as I begin to ponder that kind of exhortation, and he looks me in the face and says, Johnson, I'll tell you how I want you to walk. I want you to walk not like them. All of a sudden it gets real specific and it gets real personal. Because really what He's saying is this. Believer, what I want you to do is real simple. I want you to look at the world and I want you to look at what they think is important. And I want you to look at what they value and I want you to look at their priorities. And I want you to look at their goals and their motives. And I want you to look at their definition of joy. And I want you to look at their definition of fulfillment. And I want you to look at their definition of happiness. And then you know what I want you to do? I want you to take 180 degrees and go the other way. Because what they're calling joy is not what we call joy. And what they call fulfillment is not where you're going to find fulfillment. You take another, you look at them and do the other thing. If they're scratching their head, you scratch your belly. If they're walking straight, you walk crooked. Whatever they're doing, do the other thing. Now, that's kind of strong. It's kind of weird, but I think that's exactly what he's saying. He's using a lot of forceful language here. Whatever you see out there, do the other thing. Take a good look. Take a good look. The world exalts pride and you've been called to humility. The world is fragmented and you've been called to unity. The world is wrapped up in hate and you've been called to love. The world is out for number one and you've been called to serve. The world is grabbing it all for themselves and you've been called to give. The world is dead and you've been made alive. Even in eternity, folks, you're going in opposite directions. Because of all those things, we walk how? Different. Different. James says this, Friendship with the world is enmity with God. 1 Peter 4, verses 3 and 4 says, For the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the desires of the world, having followed a course or a lifestyle of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousals, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries. Believer, that's over for you. That time is already past for you to fulfill that desire. Why? You're going in a different direction. Verse 4 then says something that disturbs us. And it's one of the results of having a different lifestyle now. It's this. In all this, having been involved in that yourself, in all this, now you're going in a different direction. In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same excess of dissipation. Run is a real key word there. That's the picture of the world. running like crazy, just without thinking, without feeling, just moving and moving and moving towards fulfilling every passionate desire they would have. And they are surprised that you don't run with them into the same excess of dissipation, and because of that, they malign you. They really don't understand. This is where it can help us get a little more practical. One of the hardest problems for some new believers, and I run into this all the time because people come into the office and talk, and we don't know how to handle this. What do I do, Dave, about my old friends? How do I handle my old friends? There's something happened to me. You see, the problem is this. I've got a new nature and it's made of gold and I hear about it all the time. I'm holy and blameless before God. And that has begun to do something in my life. It's begun to pull me in a different direction. I haven't yielded to it all together, but it's begun to pull me in a different direction. And now my will and my outer man is beginning to not be real comfortable with this new nature I've got. and so I'm thinking about the old lifestyle I had and the things I used to do and it's beginning to bug me and now I'm really kind of ticked because all I hear about is different, different, different and I'm going to tell you Dave that I'm still going to go to those parties and I'm still going to do those things and I'm going to go and it's wonderful and so you do it's great, that's no problem I'm not going to tell you not to that's another thing I won't do I'll get to that a little bit more later but we go and we continue to to deal with it and one of the things that happens is the pressure's on then and i'm afraid that often one of the things we begin to realize is the new nature has come and it begins to pull my flesh in a different direction all of a sudden i really do see a dichotomy and if i begin to go in a different direction what happens is they malign me and i'm really in trouble but one of the things i begin to discover is that the pressure's on and it's this The pressure is, if I'm going to be accepted, I kind of need to participate. And, you know, we don't want to be all full of pride. You talked about humility. We don't want to be all full of pride and tell these people that, man alive, you know, I'm going to do what you do so we identify. Right? You ever say that? We're going to identify, so we'll kind of do the same junk together, and we'll just get blasted together and we'll identify. I just want to ask you something, and this is real close to me because I've said those things. yeah, yeah, and I've done those things. I wondered how honest I should be. You get into that, you know, you think, I want to identify, it's wonderful. The problem is, is if I don't do those things, one of the pressures that's being applied to me is I begin to realize that unless I do those things, I'm not being included. And all of a sudden it dawns on me, the only sense of commonality I have is that we share the same lack of control, we shared the same lust, we shared the same drunkenness, we shared the same direction, now I got a new direction, there's going to be a problem. There's going to be a problem. See, if those things that we were doing is what was holding us together, now I'm different. If I can't do that and there's no commonality, then we've got a real problem in the relationship. Another problem I hear a lot is when we're trying to share our faith with somebody. And again, I've gotten into the same kind of thing. We're trying to share our faith with someone and we're witnessing and witnessing and maybe it's over a period of time and I share and I share and they feel like they're real close and all of a sudden they throw this bombshell at me and they say this, you know, Dave, I would do it, but I don't know if I want to give up my booze and my drugs and getting blasted every night and I don't know if i want to give up my girlfriend and I don't know if i want to give up the adultery and I don't know if i want TO GIVE UP the fornication. They don't say that, but that's exactly what it is. I don't know if i want to give those things up. And one of the things we say right off the bat and I've said it before is, oh man, you don't understand. You don't have to change any of that stuff. You don't have to change. You just come just as you are the world you have to clean up your act before you come to the Lord. None. There isn't. Just as I am. We sing that song all the time. And I'm not going to sit there and tell you all these little things to do and all the things you need to get straightened up before you come. But I think we better know that a new nature is going to call you to a new lifestyle. And God is not going to condone sin in your life. God is not going to condone adultery in your life. He's not going to condone the lack of control, he's not gonna. And a new nature is going to call you to a new lifestyle. You know, sometimes I wonder if by the fact that some of these friends of ours ask us that question, they reveal to us that maybe in a real simple way, they see more of the radical nature of our faith than we even do. They see before they even get into it, that if I get into this, it's going to it's going to cause a change. It's going to cause pressure on me. A new nature is going to call me to different things. And I'm not sure I want to give up those different things. There's going to be a change. A new nature is going to call you to a new lifestyle. It's going to be going in a different direction. And then someone says, and again, this is something, you know, so many of these things are just out of my own mind and things that I've been involved in and I've said, and this is one of the things I've said. Why is it that we have to be so different? Why can't we just kind of, you know? I feel like one of the things that was hard for me in preparing this is I was feeling conviction about some of the things I'm involved in. And I kind of think, I want to be cool. I want people to like me. I want them to think, hey, he's really hip. Hey, he's okay. And all that kind of stuff. And so we kind of get sucked in real easy to just doing what they do. Talking like they talk. You know, you get around people and all of a sudden you talk different. And you act different. No, man. And I don't mean different like this. I mean different like them. But someone says, why do we have to be different? And the answer that hit me like a ton of bricks is this, because we are. Because we are. Again, I think sometimes we need to be bathed in the radical nature of what Christianity really is, and I think we don't know it. You know that this is the fact that as a believer, God has created in us a whole new race. That's radical. That's radical. There is no longer, what, Jew or Gentile, is there? There's a new race. There is no longer black or what? White. None. There's a new race. We've got a whole new thing. 1 Peter 2 and 9 says, You are a chosen race, a new race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession. And your purpose in life is to what? is to proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness and into His marvelous light. Come out from among them and be separate and touched, not the unclean thing. And I will call you sons and daughters. How do we walk? We walk a different walk. We walk different. We walk different. You know what? Invariably, if I preach a sermon like this, someone will come up to me, and I want you to listen real carefully, all of you. Someone will come up to me and say, You know, Dave, today you were talking about lifestyle, and you were talking, you know, you didn't say it, but now I'm going to say it. You were talking about those gray areas in our life, okay? Well, you know, I was wondering, what do you think about this? Dave, do you think it's okay for me to da-da-da-da? And you start listing all these little do's and don'ts that you feel a little bit guilty about or you're not really sure about, and you're just kind of wondering, and so you come to me, or you go to an elderly, or you go to a friend, and you say, do you think it's okay for me to da-da-da-da-da? you know what? I'm not going to tell you. You know why? Because I have this feeling that we've got this desire and it's something that I think has been fostered in the church for years to get somebody else to do my thinking for me. We get the pastor to tell me what to do. We get the elders to tell me what's right and wrong. And you know what's nice about that? What's nice about that is it gets me off the hook. See, I never have to think then. I never have to evaluate. I never have to come to the Lord and ask Him for direction for my life, I never have to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit and say, Spirit of God, I'm Yours and I'm gold and I want to know the things that need to be stripped off of my life. What do I want to do? I've got an if and I kind of like to hold it and if the pastor says, meh, then I'll hold on to it and feel free. Great. I'm not going to do that. See, when we give you all the answers and tell you what you can do and what you can't do, then you don't even have to be responsible anymore. You don't have to grow anymore. You don't have to fight with it. You know what? I have to fight with it. And I'm going to fight with it. And so do you. And you know what? You have to decide. We ask the pastor. We ask an elder. We ask a friend. And if he says okay, then it must be okay. And if he says no, then it must be no. And I just kind of deal with it that way. And nothing of maturity ever happens. What kind of spiritual zombies do we create when we do that kind of thing? Just a bunch of people non-thinking, non-feeling, non-sensitive to the spirit. You know what I'm convinced of? I'm confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it, will mature you. And you don't have to ask me. God's going to lead you into a lifestyle that's going to bring honor and glory to him if you're sensitive to him. And if you're not sensitive to him, all the rules in the world aren't going to bring you into line with a lifestyle that brings honor to him. You know how specific I'll be? I'll be only as specific as the Apostle Paul was. I'll say this. You see the world. You see their goals. You see their motives. You see their definition of fulfillment. Go the other way. That's what I'll say. Turn around and go the other way. Okay. I've got that in. A new nature calls me to a new lifestyle. Off with the old. On with the new. But still the question is this. How? How do I engage all that? I've got this thing that I'm supposed to do, but how do I do that? That is never going to happen. The new lifestyle is never going to come unless something extremely important happens in this. And that's this. that that new lifestyle is energized by a new mind. And by the way, by the word mind, what I mean is will. A new kind of will. It's an act of my will that allows that new nature to translate itself into my outside body, my body. It's all about the mind. Verse 17, we have the word mind, will. Verse 18, understanding, ignorance. Verse 20, learned. Verse 21, taught. Verse 23, mind again. The point is this. You live different when you think different. When you change your mind. When you have an act of the will that would change. And in verse 20 even, he says, you did not learn Christ in this way. You know that even your salvation is a change of mind, isn't it? You change your mind about God. You change your mind about sin. You change your mind about Christ. You change your mind about the way you're going to live, the direction you're going to take. The key is verse 23, and be renewed in the spirit of your what? Your mind. You need a new mind. I want you to notice verses 17 through 19. Graphic illustration of a mind without the control of the new nature. Incredibly ugly, really, is what Paul paints for us. And the thing that's scary about this is that he's talking to believers and he's warning believers to take this kind of thing out of their lives. Meaning this, that these kinds of characteristics sometimes could be cloaking a believer who's made of solid gold. That's something scary. The first thing it talks about, about a mind that is without control, is this, no longer walk just as the Gentiles walk in the futility of their mind. Futility of the mind means simply this, their thinking is useless. Useless thinking, that's what futility is. It's their thinking, it's their desires, their whims, their philosophies, it's human opinion is what it's all about. The picture I get is the Johnny Carson show. How many of you watch Johnny Carson? Don't put your hands on it. and they have everything on Johnny Carson from actors to athletes, from peanut vendors to pop psychologists, you know, and they ask every one of these guys the same question. It's basically this. What do you think the secret to life is? Okay? And we all sit on our TVs and go, oh, wow, yeah, this is really good. What he's saying really makes sense. And that's what happens. You know, you get 12 different opinions from 12 different guys, and they all agree on one thing. Even though their opinions are different and 12 different guys, they agree on one thing. They're all right. Right? You know, he said, oh, that's good. He said, something different. Oh, yeah, that's good. You know what that is? That's useless thinking. That's futile thinking. Their thinking is futile. Verse 18, being darkened. Their ignorance of the truth is the second characteristic of the mind without any control. Being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them because of the hardness of their hearts. This first word I want you to look at here is being darkened. In the Greek tense, It leads us to get the feeling this is an action, this being darkened, is an action that took place in the past, an action that took place and it has results coming into the future. So it's something that happened in the past. And as I studied that, what happens is there is a feeling in that word, those two words, being darkened, of the judicial act of God on someone. And that bothered me a little bit because what it sounds like and what it is, is this, that at some point there are times when God acts to darken the mind. happened in the past, and that darkening takes place into the future. Now, that bothers me. It sounds really unfair, doesn't it? I want you to watch the cycle here, being darkened in their understanding, unable to understand who God is all about, who, what Christianity is all about, excluded from the life of God. How did that happen? Tells you right here, because of the ignorance that is in them. Well, how did that happen? Here, it tells you right here, because of the hardness of their hearts. What happens is this. They harden their hearts. They say no, and they say no, and they say no, and what happens is the result of that is ignorance of the truth. Ignorance of the truth results in exclusion from the life of God, and after a while there comes a point where God just kind of affirms that and says, okay, you want to go that direction? You go that direction. Romans chapter 1, verse 21 says this, For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became what? they became futile in their speculations, useless thinking, I think this and I think that, who cares what you think? And their foolish heart was darkened. Okay? Professing to be wise, they became what? Fools. And exchanged the glory of an incorruptible God for an image in the form of a corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures. Listen to this, verse 24. Therefore, God gave them over in their lust. They decided and they decided and they decided and God said, Okay. Okay. Ignorance of the truth. Hardness of the heart. The word hardness there is poros. It has to do with a stone that is harder than marble. And medically it was used in situations where there was stiffening of the joints. Okay? And what would happen? The joint would get stiffer and stiffer and stiffer. And the stiffer it got, the harder it was to move. Okay? It wasn't workable anymore until finally it was just set right there. Did you get the picture? There was a hardness and a hardness and a rejection and a rejection and a rejection. And after a while, it was impossible to respond. The truth made no indentation at all. Scary verse, chapter 12 of John, the 37th verse. Jesus was performing signs and wonders and it says this, And they would not believe. And then you know what it says in verse 38 and 39? Then they could not believe. There was a hardening of the heart, and they were beyond response. Verse 19, and they having become callous, past feeling, past feeling. They don't feel anything anymore. A couple of weeks ago in our discipleship class, we were talking about guilt and how Christianity is really an answer to the problem of guilt. We get set free from guilt. The problem is that there are people who have become callous in their thinking, and they are beyond that. They don't feel it. They honestly don't. with psychological game playing and rationalization and transferring the blame to you and eliminating morality altogether, I don't feel a thing anymore. The Bible says this, their conscience has become seared as with a hot iron. Their conscience calloused beyond feeling. In verse 19, it ends up in this, and they, having become callous, have, remember when it said God gave them over? Listen to this, they have given themselves over to sensuality, For the practice, the word practice there is business. For the business, they've made a big business of what? Of every kind of impurity with greediness. Big business. Now I don't have to give you illustrations of that. You can think of pornography and my mind went blank. You think of it. Big business. All sorts of wonderful things that this kind of mind has taken, made big business out of. The word I could steal to describe verse 19 would be from the book of Romans. And it's they have a reprobate mind. And what that means is they have a mind that is no mind at all, beyond thinking, beyond thinking. The definition of this kind of person here is this. He has a disposition of the soul that is incapable of bearing the pain of discipline. I like that. I want to say that again. This person who has given himself over is this, a disposition of the soul that is incapable of bearing the pain of discipline. He is undisciplined. He is uncontrolled. This is unblushing obscenity. Let me give you an illustration. The bad guy, the bad man, is still going to try to hide what he did wrong, okay? The person who has given himself over, Asaligeia, couldn't care less. Couldn't care less. Doesn't try to hide it. Unblushing obscenity. I guess I don't want to get on this or anything because I go crazy when I hear people going crazy on rock music and all this kind of thing. But my, I'm sorry, that's exactly what I thought of. I thought of the whole rock, every once in a while I flip a channel on a TV and I see this rock group going bonkers on the TV and they can't understand me, they're going a little wild. And the same, that's exactly what came to my mind when I thought of this unblushing, just gushing obscenity going further and further and further and further and trying as hard as they can to shock and embarrass. And if they get arrested for what they're doing, that's a badge of honor. until they have no mind at all. And I think that's a graphic picture, and Paul meant it to be, because then in verse 20 of chapter 4, Paul stops dead and says, Believer, what have you to do with that? What have you to do with that? You're a new creation. You've been made alive. You've been made new. You've been redeemed. You're holy and blameless. You're made of solid gold. why are you imitating the dead did you get that why are you imitating the dead you walk around and you're clothed the outer man that what you look like is nothing different than the world but the key is this what's on the inside that new nature can only become real on the outside by an act of your will by a change of your mind you know what just to wrap this up very quickly and very simply there are people here this morning who need to change their mind and that's all there is to it and you know a lot of times we have a big emotional thing try to play you need to change your mind there are people here who need to hear this you don't know the lord at all you're an unbeliever jesus said this i am the way the truth and the life. No man comes to the Father but by me. And you can scoff at that if you want, but you know what you need to do? You need to change your mind about that. You need to change your mind that Jesus is irrelevant. You need to change your mind that he's some sort of obscure thing. The only way there can be peace, the only way there can be a reversal of the hardness, of the callousness, of a mind that is no mind at all, is to change your mind. But you know what? This text is really dealing with believers. It really is. And the call of God on your life is this. Believer, strip off the old. Strip off the old. Let me ask you, what is it for you? This is where you have to do this. You have to apply this. What is it for you? What is it in your life that needs to be stripped off? Bitterness? Strip it off. You know what? Bitterness in your life it's hanging right out there and it stinks and it doesn't look at all like what you are bitterness wrath strip it off anger take it off malice slander it stinks strip it off and maybe there's even some here who are in their minds kind of waltzing the world. Just kind of thinking. And maybe even in your mind, before I dealt with this, and I'll tell you this, be real honest with you, before I dealt with this, there were things in my life that, oh, it's the big deal. But I hear Paul say, you know how you should walk? Not like them. I'm not going to tell you what it is. I'm not going to tell you what it is for you, but you know what you need to do? If it stinks, you need to take it off. You need to strip it off. And you know what else you need to do? You need to do it today. Lest the hardness have an opportunity to set in. So that even for the believer, there would be a hardness to dimensions of a lifestyle that aren't, that are something less than honoring and glorifying to him. And you know what this is all about? It's about being humble. It's about letting the Lord break me because you know what? I've got all sorts of reasons and everybody does. I've just, I've just surrounded myself with, with, with reasons for being how I am and doing what I do. And you know what? It's times like this that I need to humble myself and examine those areas in my life that just don't match who I am. Put on a new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. Thank you.
