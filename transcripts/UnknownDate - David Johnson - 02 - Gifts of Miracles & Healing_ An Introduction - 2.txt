It's the kind of people God wants us to be. It's not just about us. It is about us, but it needs to go out. It needs to go out, and you're getting that. We're getting that. In the context of what we've been calling a journey with the Holy Spirit, we've been dealing of late with the gifts of the Spirit, particularly the supernatural gifts of the Spirit, as revealed to us by the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 12. He calls them there in verse 7 of chapter 12, manifestations of the Spirit given for the common good of the body. In other words, for the building up of the body so that by these manifestations of the Spirit at work among us, the body can be built up, strengthened to the point where we actually could become who God's called us to become so that we actually could begin authentically to do the things God's called us to do in the world, to make manifest. think about that word for a moment, is to simply make something visible. So a manifestation of the Spirit is a working of God's Spirit in and through His people in ways that are manifest. In other words, that are visible, discernible, knowable. Some examples of that are these. Verse 8, chapter 12, a word of wisdom and knowledge is a manifestation of the Spirit when it comes to people. It's the working of God's Spirit made visible among men. The gift of faith and prophecy is another example. The distinguishing of spirits in various kinds of tongues. Two weeks ago, we began to examine the gifts of healing as being part of these manifestations and the effecting of miracles, verses 9 and 10, gifts that for years I believed were not for today, particularly healing and the manifestation of power, for a number of reasons, I believe, that I shared with you two weeks ago. Chief among them were these, a strongly held perception that people who moved in this kind of ministry, who had what you might call a healing ministry, were shallow, superficial, and weird at best, dishonest, manipulative charlatans at worst, often using people's desperate need and hope for healing as a means for personal gain, creating in me a very strong aversion to anything that looked like a healing ministry. I didn't need any evidence beyond that to have an aversion to these kinds of things. But in addition to that, there was what I had and have, and so do you, a Western world view that is rooted in secularism and rationalism that not only has very little room for the power of God, it has no room for God at all. And then for me, there was this theology I grew up believing that clearly taught these gifts are not for today. All of that working to create in me, not only an aversion to these things, but I think a fairly well-developed spirit of unbelief. Now, two weeks ago, I shared how over time my view of this has changed. I shared with you my journey, and part of my journey was our journey as a church. And then to kind of give you what I gave you last week, it's like two weeks ago, rather. The sermon two weeks ago was kind of telling you where we're from. Now, where we're going on this journey is to venture into and examine the healing miracles of Jesus as found in the Gospels. That's where we're gonna go on this journey of examining the gifts of healing, believing that as we examine the miracles of Jesus, particularly his healing ministries, we might just learn something about this gift of healing and the operation of power. But before we go there, I want to make it a little more clear where we are now. Let me explain it this way. Two weeks ago, I talked about where we're from. The miracles of Jesus beginning next week is where we're going. Today, I want to talk a little bit more about where we are now. By we, I mean me. I don't want to presume, honestly, I don't want to presume that all of us are where I am, although many of you may resonate strongly with what I say this morning. Before we move into the miracles of Jesus, I kind of want to, it's like the picture I have in my mind is when you walk into a shopping mall and there's a big kiosk and you're trying to find out how to find Macy's or whatever store you're trying to go to, there's a big red dot and it says, you are here. The sermon this morning is, you are, I am here. As it relates to this journey with the Spirit, specifically around the gift of healing and the operation of power. Five things this morning about healing that I am starting with, that I am carrying with me as I go into these other things. And I even want you to be aware that as we move into an examination of the healing miracles of Jesus, these five things might change for me. They might change for you. But this is where you are here. Five things I start with this. It's in the bag I'm carrying on this journey. First is this, a deeply held belief that the ministry of healing is not only consistent with but central to, number one, the character of God, and number two, the mission of Christ. Let me say it this way. God's primary agenda since the fall, go back in your mind to the fall, the Garden of Eden, when all things by sin were made sick, when all things by sin were made sick, his agenda from that moment on has been to restore, to reclaim, and to reconcile all things to himself. In other words, to heal all things. That has been the agenda of God in the kingdom of God since the fall. By all things, I mean all things. When we think of physical healing, I mean when we think of healing, we almost always think of physical healing. But I'm not talking just about your body, your physical body. I'm talking about the healing of your mind and your heart and your spirit and your soul. It involves and expands your mind. When you say the word healing, It involves making something whole, something that has been torn apart, making it whole. It has to do with restoring, first of all, people, which would have an effect on relationships. If God brought healing to people, if people were made whole, it would affect their relationships. It would affect their marriages. It would affect their families. It would affect their children. It would affect generations of children. It would affect a faith community. It would affect a civic community. It would affect a city and a nation. God is all about this restoration and this reconciliation of people. But it's not just even for people. It's not just for you. Revelation 22 says that at the culmination of all things, there will be a healing of the nations. I guess in the big scheme of things, that is involving people. But widen your mind out. There will be a healing of the nations. do you know that there's going to be healing of the physical earth there's going to be a new heaven and a new earth and God is all about that and something in the earth has been spoiled and while we get glimpses of beauty sometimes long gazes of beauty in the world we live in that at times takes our breath away that doesn't take long to look at something else in the earth the physical earth that has grown very, very sick healing is about restoring there is a healing beloved for poverty there is a healing for hunger and despair and the hopelessness that often invades the human heart Matthew 12 verse 20 is a quote from the prophet Isaiah speaking of what it is that Jesus will do the Messiah and how it is he will operate in the world and one of the things it says is this you just need to know that a battered reed he will not discard, and a smoldering wick he will not put out. Why is that? Because he is all about healing, and he doesn't take battered reeds and throw them away. That battered reed analogy is very powerful, and just to say it, you may not get the whole picture, because in those days, biblical days, reeds would be taken hollowed out, and little holes would be made in it, and that would be how they would make a flute. They would make a flute, and so here's this person, here's this person who at a certain time in his life is just making music, but for whatever reason, this reed gets bruised. You ever been bruised? When you got bruised, did you feel like you were useless? Like you'd never make music again. Here's the kingdom of God. Here is the ministry of Jesus. Just want you to know one thing about him, because it's his entire agenda from the beginning of time. Since the fall, he will not take bruised reeds and say, I'm done with you. You're done. It's over. I will not do that. Smoldering wicks. He won't put out until he leads justice to victory, it says at the end of that verse. He's all about, everything he's doing from the beginning is about leading justice to victory, reclaiming bruised reeds, fanning back to flame people who've lost their fire, and all of that is about what? Healing. Indeed, all through redemptive history, get the big picture of this, All of redemptive history is moving inexorably toward this end of healing, reconciliation. Todd Hunter, when he was with us a few months ago, likened what I'm talking about right now to a train. He wasn't talking about redemptive history. He was talking about the kingdom of God. And the kingdom of God, he said, and this is kind of my paraphrase of what he said, my understanding of what he said, is like a train. A kingdom of God is like a train that began moving, picture it in your mind, before time. When Jesus said the kingdom of God is within your reach, he wasn't announcing the beginning of the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God had been moving and existing since the time before time. And this kingdom is like a train moving through history. And that train, here's the truth, will culminate at the end of all things, not with the destruction of all things, But that kingdom of God story, movement, this train from generation to generation will culminate with the restoration. It will culminate with the healing of all things. And every generation, this is exciting, every generation in the context of a 70 or 80 year physical lifespan that you and I may or may not have, but we have a lifespan. In the context of our generation, every generation has the opportunity to step into, to step onto that life, that kingdom, that train, if you will, and during our generation, be part of what God is doing in the world for that generation, and what God is doing in that generation, what he's about is healing, and in every generation, there seems to be sometimes more expressions of that, and less expressions of that, but I don't care the generation, I don't care if it's a dark age or a great age of awakening, what God's about is healing everywhere, culminating in the end, and see, one day as we enter into the big story of the kingdom of God and are partnering with God and doing the work of God in this generation, one day at the culmination, we'll be able to join that chorus and say, I was part of this whole thing back in Open Door Church. Luke 4, 18, Jesus is declaring the nature of his ministry, what it's about. And he says this, I love this phrase. He's quoting again the prophet Isaiah who is speaking prophetically of the Messiah to come, Jesus says of himself, the Spirit of the Lord is upon me. And one of the ways I can tell the Spirit of the Lord is on me is this, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. Good news to the poor. What would that be about? Don't wonder. It's about healing. And he has sent me to declare release the captives. What is that about? Well, for captives, that'd be healing. And he's sent me to announce recovery of sight to the blind, to set free those who are oppressed, all about healing and to proclaim the favorable year of our Lord, which doesn't mean anything to us. The favorable year of the Lord is the year of Jubilee. That was when physically all the debts were paid. Physically, spiritually, Jesus is saying, I've come to say this, the debt is paid. The debt is paid. You know what? It's about healing. It's all about healing. Point? Here's the point. It's the first thing I have in my bags as we begin to move into this examination of the healing miracles of Jesus. I'm starting in this place, and I want you to start with me here, that the ministry of healing, whenever we're gonna learn about it, the ministry of healing is not only consistent with, it is central to the character of God and the mission of Christ, which leads to the second thing I have in my bag as this journey begins. It's this, a deeply held belief that his mission is my mission. It's not just mine. That his mission, that's my personal feeling, that his mission is our mission. Because he has anointed us. He was the first anointed one. And then he said to the disciples, you too. He has anointed us to preach the gospel to the poor, declare release to the captives, recovery of sight to the blinds. Now, I touched on this a little two weeks ago when I talked about what I called the model of Jesus' ministry that turned into a mandate relative to that model. You might remember Matthew 4.23. Jesus' ministry is just beginning, and it had a pattern that involved two things. And I'm not going to go into all the exegesis or even read the verses. If you need kind of the exegesis where I got this, go back and get the tape from a couple of weeks ago. But in Matthew 4.23, he clearly did two things. Number one, he proclaimed the kingdom or the good news that the rule of God, the train, if you will, that began in history, that the train, this kingdom of God, is something that you can step into right here, right now. It is within your reach. He proclaimed that good news, but he didn't just preach sermons about it. He demonstrated the power of that kingdom at work right here and right now, and he demonstrated the power by healing the sick, by casting out demons, which is a kind of healing. we'll get into as, well, by ministering to the poor and by writing justice to victory. I mean, an incredible phrase, writing. I mean, I had to stop back and think, I see Jesus writing this thing. It involves involvement. It involves concern about justice winning. God's all about that. And every place in this generation, we are involved in those kinds of things. We are involved in the things that matter most to God. And you can count on empowerment from the Spirit of God, but sometimes we lose. sometimes we do this sometimes people get sawn in two but you are part of what's ultimately going to end in the end with absolute healing restoration and we can be part of that now the model for ministry was those two things proclaim the kingdom do the kingdom but then in Matthew 10 and here's where it becomes a mandate he looked at the 12 and I don't know what the 12 were doing but I think they might be doing what some of us do when we think of the miracles of Jesus and the work of Jesus we go thank you God you're so great And he's kind of this superstar. Way to go, you did it. Give me some healing. Heal me. And Jesus said, oh, yeah, I am doing it, but it's not just me, you. I want you to not just receive this. I want you to do this. And he gave the 12 apostles, disciples in Matthew 10, verse 1. It says he gave them authority over unclean spirits. And then he sent them out two by two saying, I want you to do two things. I want you to do what I did. It's two things. Proclaim the kingdom, the rule of God, the reign of God is within your reach. You can step into this train right here and right now, but I also want you to do that. I've given you authority to heal the sick and cast out demons and minister to the poor and ride justice to victory. And then in Luke 10, he said to the 70, to 70 others. And I don't know if he said it exactly this way, but I kind of feature him looking at 70 and then pointing over to the 12 and to the 70 saying, you guys, it's not just them. It's not just the apostles. It's you. Because in Luke chapter 10, verse 1 and following, he basically said, I want you to do two things. He gave them authority. Proclaim it. Do it. And then in Matthew 28, the risen Christ, just prior to his ascension, his final instructions to his followers, and it says in Matthew 28, just previous to verse 18, it says that the 11 were the ones Judas was gone obviously and the 11 were there listening to Jesus and it says this Jesus said all authority not as if he says all authority has been given to me I give it to you but it's not just you it's them go therefore into all the world and preach the gospel making what? disciples, what's a disciple? we've said it here a million times it's an apprentice of Jesus find people who are willing to step into the big story of the kingdom of God and become apprentices of Jesus which means people who are learning to say what Jesus said and do what Jesus did and what he did was he proclaimed the kingdom, you guys, it's within your reach. You can step into the big story of the kingdom of God right here and right now. Point, this mission of God for healing, reconciliation in a variety of ways, it's our mission. That's in my bag. Third thing I have as we start this journey is an awareness, a belief, that while physical healing may be the most sensational, visible, and even desirable kind of healing in terms of the one we'd want to see the most, it may also be the least significant of all the healings. That doesn't mean it's insignificant, but of all the kinds of healings that are part of the kingdom of God. Again, this might change as I go on, but it's kind of where I'm at. You are here right now. I see it as among the least significant, at least in part because even the most amazing physical healing, think about it, is temporary. Because sooner or later, even if you get healed today, you're going to get sick again someday and die. Lazarus was raised from the dead. Wouldn't be any more exciting thing than that kind of miracle. And there are reports of that today, from time to time, of somebody being raised from the dead. I've never seen it. I'd love to. can God do that? yes but here's the deal Lazarus raised from the dead we don't have this story in there he died pretty sure anyway doesn't mean that healing doesn't matter doesn't mean it has power I'm going to keep it in perspective the fact is the primary purpose of many of the healing miracles then and I think today the primary purpose isn't just to heal the person though obviously it is happening and they benefit greatly. The point very often was to point to and stir up faith for an even deeper, more necessary kind of healing than physical healing. Let me give you an example. Mark chapter two, verse five. This is one of the most obvious. We'll see others as we go through this journey with the healing miracles of Jesus. The paralytic, I made mention of this last week, lowered by the four friends to Jesus. through the roof. It says in Mark 2 verse 5 that Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, your sins are forgiven. Be the paralytic laying there. My sins are forgiven. Oh, good. Great. That's what I was hoping for here. Your sins are forgiven. Saying that ticked off to Pharisees. Now, the reason we're laughing and the reason I even brought it up was because we would all assume that what he would want the most is to be healed physically. And that's what I would want. But it's weird because in some ways, the scribes and Pharisees, who had very little spiritual insight, and we pick on them all the time, had some insight into what was going on right here and how outrageous it was that Jesus said, your sins are forgiven. Because they did have this view that to be able to forgive someone's sin that might heal their soul is the most ultimate miracle. In fact, what the scribes said was this, He blasphemes, saying this, because who can forgive sin but God alone? Who does he think he is? Jesus knew what they were thinking, and I don't think he needed a word of knowledge for that, though he might have had one. Just these guys are always thinking this, and they're always trying to undermine me. Knowing what they were thinking, Jesus said, which is easier to say, your sins are forgiven or rise, take up your bed and walk? And the fact is, they're both easy to say. I just said it, rise, take up your bed. I can say that. But here's the deal. If you say your sins are forgiven, who's to know? And then Jesus kind of calling their bluff, and I think with kind of a, in your, I don't know, maybe, this is me, in your face kind of, I'll show you, says this, in order that you might know I have authority on earth to do the most amazing miracle, to heal a human being's heart, to mend their soul, to reconcile them, to make them whole, in order that you know I have authority on earth to do that invisible, but ultimately the most incredible miracle, in order that you know I have authority to do that, I say to you, rise, take up your bed and walk. The guy stood up and walked, and when miracles happen, physical miracles happen that we want to pray for, and I want you to stir up your faith to believe in, even if they happen now, they're almost always not the ultimate healing they are pointing to, and designed by God to stir up faith for a deeper kind of healing. So while they're real and we want to ask for them, they are not the focus. They are not the ultimate healing. And that's where we can lose our balance from time to time making those things the things we focus on the most. When next week we begin studying the healing miracles of Jesus, one of the things we're going to see with almost all of them are subplots. In fact, it's one of the reasons I became interested in kind of, and we're not going to do every miracle of Jesus, but many of them. One of the reasons I became so interested in them is that with almost every one of them, there's the physical healing. And then if you read the whole story, you find out there's this subplot underneath that as you get the whole story, you realize that the subplot underneath the physical healing was actually more important and bigger, more vital than the healing itself. In some cases, the physical healing was this prop that got people's attention so Jesus could do the thing he really wanted to and confront the thing he really wanted to confront. Just a quick example of that is the man with the withered hand. He's talking to some scribes and chief priests and Pharisees and they're really religious and rigid in their religion and fighting and trying to nitpick everything Jesus was doing and there was no request on the part of the man with the withered hand. He wasn't there going, would you heal me? He didn't ask for that. In fact, if you read the text, it's very obvious that Jesus kind of picked them out of the crowd. I would expect him that he was a little embarrassed. He says, come here, reach out your hand. He didn't ask him if he had faith. He didn't ask him if he believed. There was nothing to do with that. He healed the withered hand. And there's the miracle. And let me show you how to do that. That's not even the point of the story. The point of the story is that what the Pharisees noticed was not that glory could be brought to God because he healed this guy's hand. What they noticed was that Jesus broke a rule and that became the whole story. He did it on the Sabbath. How dare you do that? And it's a whole confrontation on religion. there are many kinds of healing there is spiritual healing inner healing, healing for memories healing, deliverance is healing and again I said we will spend some time on that the demonic bondages that people are in and how to be delivered evangelism is healing you need to know that's a healing ministry you get that don't you for believers death is a kind of healing though when my best friend some years ago Dave Busby died I hated it when people said that oh he's well now don't say that to people when their best friend dies but it's true and part of what even helps people like me and you deal with those kinds of losses as they rip your soul apart sometimes they don't reach 47 years of age like Dave did is that we're living in a bigger story. We're living in a bigger story. I'm in that kingdom story, and so is Dave. And one day, one day, we'll see it all. Fourth thing in my bag is this, that you and I are not in control of this healing thing. There is no ultimate formula for healing, although we'll constantly be looking for one. You know, when I do the miracles of Jesus, he did it this way. You'll notice he did this first and this second, and he said something in his voice, in Jesus' name, although he didn't say in Jesus' name because Jesus was his name, but there were inflections of, no. No, no. You need to yell really loud. No, you don't. There is no formula for this. We're not in control of this. Particularly, there's no faith formula which I believe wrongly promises that if you have the right kind of faith and the right amount of faith, you'll always be healed, which kind of sets you up to the fact that if you're not healed, it's obviously because you didn't have faith, and you're constantly trying to crank up your faith. And then if one you prayed for isn't healed, you not only have to deal with the grief that they're dead or not well, you have to deal with the guilt that it's somehow your fault, you didn't have faith, something's wrong there. In fact, did you know, you know, we're not in control of this. Did you know, do you know that even Jesus, this is going to sound weird to some of you, like even upset you maybe, but even Jesus couldn't heal on demand. What? He couldn't heal on demand. Sometimes, and the reason that's a weird thing to say is it looked sometimes like he did heal on demand in Matthew 4 and other places. He healed them all. He healed them all. But in places like John 5, other places like this, as well as the pool of Bethesda, it says in verse 3, John 5, verse 3, there was a multitude at this pool. It says right there, a multitude who were sick, blind, lame, withered. They were all there around this pool. And Jesus, if you remember the story, singled out one and healed him. And once again, there was a subplot going because the Pharisees were trying to catch him and point to something he was doing wrong. And one of the questions that came was, why did you only heal one. Well, actually, in this case, Jesus provides the answer. While when there was a multitude there for healing, only one got healed, he provides the answer in verse 19 of John 5. He says this, might surprise you. He says, you don't get it. I don't do anything by my own initiative. I don't just, I mean, there are times when all of them are healed, but I'm not just walking around willy-nilly thinking I can heal anybody I want. You bang, bang, bang. It doesn't work like that. Even for me, says, I don't do anything by my own initiative. I only do what I see the Father do. And as I discern, as Jesus, I think, limited himself to the fullness of his deity, limited or lived his human life as an example of what it looks like to be directed by and filled with the Spirit. He operated in the gifts of the Spirit with sensitivity to the Father and words of knowledge and gifts of discernment and among the things Jesus did, I'm quite sure, is what we've been called to the Lord. What are you doing? What are you doing here? It says in Luke 5.17 Jesus was teaching and it said that on this day the power of the Lord was present to heal. It's a very interesting language. On this day the power of the Lord was present to heal. Which clearly implies that other times it wasn't time there was an ebb and a flow and even Jesus didn't just you you there was a cooperating with the Father and a learning to discern same thing was true of the apostles in Luke 19 a few weeks ago we talked about I mean I don't mean Luke 19 I mean Acts 19 Paul was at a time in his ministry where the pendulum of his ministry life had swung radically into positive things and it says extraordinary miracles were happening at the hands of Paul, such that people would come to him and take handkerchiefs that he had wiped his brow with from working and making tents and bring them to sick people, and the sick people were healed, and demons were cast out, and Paul didn't even, this was incredible demonstrations of power because that's what this father was doing, that's what this spirit was doing, but in places like 1 Timothy 5, 23, these things become very confusing if you have this idea, it's always like that, 1 Timothy 5.23, he's with Timothy, his mentee. Is that right? Mentee? I'm the mentor. Anyway. Timothy was sick. He had problems with his stomach and many ailments. He says, here's my advice. Take a little wine for your stomach's sake and for your frequent ailments. Here's my question. Why didn't he heal him? Just decide. Heal. I'm sure he prayed for him. 2 Timothy 4.10, Paul, the one through whom experience, Extraordinary miracles at one place were flowing through him where, again, people were, he wasn't even going there and they were healed. He had to leave Trophimus sick in Miletus. He had to leave him sick. Why didn't he heal him? Philippians 2.25, Epaphroditus was sick unto death. Now, eventually Epaphroditus survived that. But when he was with Paul, Paul didn't heal him, couldn't heal him. Why? I don't know. But I do know that we're not in control of this and neither was Paul. I'm not always sure what the Father's doing I'm always sure I'm always going to ask I'm always going to invite God in but here's the deal even when we don't see the healing happening even when we don't see the healing happening hear me it is still the primary mission of God in the world to heal now one day in the culmination everything, all things will be restored in this generation we have the opportunity to be part of what God is doing now and part of our ability to move in these kinds of gifts is to be real sensitive to gifts of discernment and words of knowledge and prophecies with the Lord. Lord, what are you saying to us today? What are you doing today? So we can cooperate with you. Not make something happen, cooperate with God in what he is making happening. Leads to the fifth thing in my bag and final thing I have. That's the most likely and most necessary place for this gift, healing, to be made manifest is not in the church. It's not here. Now, it happens here and it needs to happen here, but one of the things I have in me and I want in you, quite frankly, as we move into this examinates, this journey of Jesus' miracles, is that the primary place is not in massive healing services. And I'm not saying healing doesn't happen there. It's not the primary place. You know where the primary place where this gift needs to be manifested? It needs to be manifested where sick people are, and poor people are, and hungry, and blind, and desperately lost people who can't even lift their head. They're so sick, and I don't mean physically sick, just physically sick. I mean they're so sin sick. They're so lost. They're so disinterested because of their lostness, even in the kinds of things you're talking about this morning, that they, in a million years, would never even come here. the gift of healing that would help them see and hear and respond to the train that's going by that they can enter into and live in, needs to be out there. Needs to be brought out there, not by just the pastor guys who are preaching, but people like the 12 and then the 70 and then the church under the anointing of the Spirit beginning to get more and more a sense that my mission in life, while this is my job, My mission is to bring healing and reconciliation to the guy at my school who nobody will talk to. Do you know what kind of healing might come? If you sat with him and then intersected, God, in your mind, God, give some life to this. One of the things that gives this power is to look at Jesus' healing ministry. At the end of my Bible, I have a concordance in a number of things, And there's this one page that says at the top, the healing miracles, the miracles of Jesus, not just the healing, but the miracles of Jesus. And there's 35 of them in the Gospels or in the entire New Testament. And what's interesting is of all 35, two of those miracles happened in what we would call a church context. Two of them happened in a synagogue. You know where all the others, and what's weird about this is if you get this paradigm, because we're so not dialed into this, When you step back and look at the story, it's so obvious. It's one of those, well, duh, moments. It's like, where do we get the idea that it just happens here? Or at a big convention center? I'm not saying it doesn't happen there. But here's the deal. You know where Jesus did these things? Where the sick people were. He did them in a field. He did them in Peter's living room when he healed Peter's mother-in-law. He was over for dinner after church. She's sick. She's really sick. Well, I have an idea. Let's pray for her. What a thought. She was too sick to go to church. Get it? You get it. He did these things at a wedding. He did them on a street corner. One day he was walking down the street. He saw a little short guy up in a tree. He said, let's do dinner. And that little human interaction, because he was just dialed into a bigger story, that this guy needs maybe more than dinner. That interaction, that awareness that happens in the context of everyday life and something from this is going to flow, took that guy named Zacchaeus and it took this hard-hearted, selfish person and it miraculously changed him and became a giver. He became a miracle. He got healed. So here's my question and it's the question I was having as I was preparing this and praying over it. How do we close? Well, I'd ask myself, well, what's the Father doing? Lord, what are you doing this weekend? And the best sense I have of what the Father's doing today is to tell you this. On this particular Sunday, while almost every Sunday I invite you to come this way for prayer, for healing, for whatever it is you need. It's kind of this routine thing I say, and people always come. I think what the Father's saying today is, don't come this way this Sunday. Go that way. and as you go that way just notice who's in your living room and notice what the father may be doing at a wedding not maybe in the big party but that person right over there and notice the person again who is totally isolated at work just trying to give you some examples and start praying this way as you go through your ordinary life. Thy kingdom come. Lord, bring the life of your kingdom. And as you partner with him, one of the things you can know is that his primary agenda is to bring healing in a variety of ways. Some of you came today and we come to church because we need healing. We need something. would you settle for an anointing today not just a healing for yourself but an anointing to go I think that's what the Father's doing today I want you to stand I'm going to pray for you I'm going to pray a prayer and for you to receive this all I would just say is You don't have to do anything. Just open wide your heart. Some of you, this helps me, but you certainly don't have to do this to receive this, but it just helps me sometimes to physically do something, and it might help you to just hold out your hands like this as a child. I need a gift. And I want to pray for you. Would you notice I didn't ask those of you. This is for everybody. Picture Matthew 28. Twelve disciples, authority has been given to me, I give it to you. But it's not just for you, it's for them. And he meant us when he said them. Holy Spirit, I do have in my mind that scene in Matthew 28 where you told the twelve, it wasn't just them, it was us. And now I'm standing before some of the us. Some of the normal everyday people that you have chosen to fill with your spirit. Take residence inside of. Father, I pray that as we as a church in this auditorium from time to time we'll experience corporately visitations from your spirit where we see healing and restoration and all sorts of wonderful things that, Father, we would really begin to change our mind about how this thing works. Because it isn't just here. Oh, if it's going to catch fire, it needs to be us on fire walking out the doors. And so I pray in Jesus' name that the authority you have given that you have in heaven and on earth would be not just given because it has been given, but by us received, that we would say, yes, yes, Lord. we believe that there's something bigger that you've called us to than ourselves. And that in ways that look very ordinary sometimes, we can be agents of this healing agenda of your kingdom as some of us are teaching school and coaching sports and going to work and raising children. Lord make us dangerous in the most wonderful ways agents of healing and reconciliation this is so your heart this is so much your agenda I pray for your filling on each and every person here may we leave now with a deep awareness that we are inhabitants of the very spirit of God that you live in us, that authority has been given to us, and we can bless people. Give us that. Release that. In Jesus' name, I pray all this, And all God's people said, amen, amen.
