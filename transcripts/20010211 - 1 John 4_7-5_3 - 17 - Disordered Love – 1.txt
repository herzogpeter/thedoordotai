I'd like you to open your Bibles with me to 1 John chapter 4, where we have been for several weeks now affirming and examining the centrality, priority, and necessity of living a life of love. Chapter 4 verse 21 says it this way, and this is the commandment that we have from him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also. Verse 7, same chapter, beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and everyone one who loves is born of God and knows God. The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love. All the way back in chapter 3, verse 11, it affirms that this message is central, not only to the gospel, but to John's epistle, for this is the message which you have heard from the beginning. It's always been about this, that we should love one another. But what is love? Having been called to it, what is it? Now, I think at first blush, it sounds like a silly question possibly because there's something I think in all of us that assumes that we know what love is and how it feels. But the fact is this, as we've discussed for the last couple of weeks, there are different kinds of love. Maybe the kind we're most familiar with and desirous of is romantic love, the kind that we celebrated this last week with Valentine's Day. It's warm and wonderful, intoxicating and powerful, but there is also a committed love that sticks around when the blush of romance has faded. There is intimate love, sacrificial and courageous love. Last week, we began to consider a kind of love that doesn't, on the surface, look like love at all because it stands against something that is wrong, a kind of love that sometimes says no, that imposes a consequence. It's the kind of love that gives to evil what Dan Allender called the gift of defeat. And that's love too. When Jesus confronted the Pharisees in Matthew 23, he was demonstrating, in my opinion, what C.S. Lewis calls in his book, The Problem of Pain, a love more stern and splendid than mere kindness. He loved them enough to tell them the truth. He loved them enough to tell them the truth and then, by that, risk their wrath. the point we discovered last week was this, that love is not a one-size-fits-all proposition that uniformly expresses itself as a warm and gooey feeling for the whole wide world. Sometimes love is as pleasant as a walk on the beach. Sometimes it's as simple as a cup of cold water, the baking of a cake for a friend, but sometimes love is as difficult and confusing as bringing someone you really do love, kicking and screaming to a treatment center, to break an addiction that just might save their life. Sometimes love is as painful as a man on a cross. Last week I invited you to participate in the complexity and mystery of what love looks like and to struggle with how love looks different in different situations with different people at different times and that the reason this struggle is worth it is because when love is rightly ordered, It has the power to reveal the face of God. That's spoken of in chapter 4, verse 12. And it's kind of become the key verse for our whole study where John says this, No man has seen God at any time, but if we love one another rightly, rightly ordered love has the power to reveal the face of God to people who don't know him and cannot see him. But we've gone to some lengths these last weeks to also make clear that while rightly ordered love does have the power to reveal the face of God, few things on earth have more power to distort the face of God than what I'm calling today disordered love. And much like rightly ordered love, disordered love can look different in different situations with different people at different times. Sometimes disordered love looks like mean-spirited intolerance. That is certainly disordered love. It's not love at all. A few things have more power to distort the face of God than mean-spirited intolerance, and we've spent several weeks making that as clear as we can. But sometimes in our effort to avoid mean-spirited intolerance, our love begins to look like something else that isn't love, sentimental mush. That's disordered as well, with just as much power as mean-spirited intolerance to distort the face of God. touched on this last week. Marilyn McIntyre in Christianity Today article I referenced last week entitled, Nice is Not to Point, said this, that as Christians we might strive less for niceness and more for loving rightly. Paul Jones in an article he wrote for Weaving's magazine said it this way, since the heart of the gospel has to do with love, subverting Christianity is quite simple. subvert love. My words, disorder it. Encourage everyone to fall in love with love. Surround them with fluffy bunnies and cute chickies for Easter and cuddly big-eyed children for Christmas. Make love a household word for everything. I love chocolate or my Cadillac or pickles or God. And when all kinds of love begin sounding the same, then we can make love without loving. Church and society will become so indistinguishable that folks won't be able to tell the difference between God is love and love is God. Stop right there. I mean, that's one of those things you read and go, yeah, that'd be terrible if they couldn't tell. And I'm going, well, what is the difference? Is there a difference between saying God is love and love? A huge difference. Let me just give it to you quick. When you say that God is love, you are going to God to figure out what love means. When you say that love is God, you're going to your understanding of love, and usually it's a disordered understanding of love, to figure out what God is like. And if you do that, you are doing what we've always done, and that is making God in our imagination. In the end, says Jones, love will have taken on the taste of a Valentine's Day candy and the smell of Mother's Day flowers, joining mother and apple pie as America's triune sentimentality. The person who's affected my thinking the most over these last few weeks as I've kind of anticipated talking about this and kind of working through my understanding of what a disordered love really looks like is a woman named Jean Holt who gave a talk last fall at the Leanne Payne Healing Prayer Conference that many of you attended. In it, she talked about what she calls incarnational and anti-incarnational relationships. That's just another way to say what I'm saying. There's rightly ordered love and disordered love. Definition, just my understanding of what she calls incarnational relationships would be basically this. An incarnational relationship means being in a relationship with this understanding. That Christ is in me and Christ is in you. And while I may be very intimately involved in your life in sacramental ways. Meaning where you experience through me the life of God and I experience the life of God through you. Kind of what we call around here Jesus with skin on. I'm very, very careful in this incarnational relationship that she's describing to not cross a line. I love you. I'm involved with you. I give it to you, Jesus, but I am not your healer. I'm not your fixer, your rescuer. I am not your salvation. There's always this awareness that Christ is that for you. He is the healer. He is your fixer. He is your rescuer. He is your salvation. My job, you want to call it a job, in an intimate relationship of authentic kingdom love, is to love you. To speak the truth to you. Sometimes even when the truth is hard to speak. And it's to always give to you Jesus, bring to you Jesus as your only hope. And never present myself to you as your only hope. In an incarnational relationship, I want to be there for you. but I want to give to you Jesus, not just me. And that's where your help will be in Jesus. He's the healer. He's the fixer, not me. Now that's kind of my attempt to define what she says. Let's let her use her own words. Here's what she says. We live in an age of sentimentality, steeped in relational and emotional subjectivism. In our world, the unforgivable sin is to be perceived as being unkind or not nice. So you just avoid that at all costs. When, however, that is embraced as truth, all measure of objectivity is lost, so that now the biblical injunction to carry one another's burdens, which we are to do, means that we take into our souls and into our bodies someone else's pain and sin and darkness, which we are not supposed to do. Let me just ask you this, clarify this thing. Who is supposed to take on the pain and sin and darkness of people? You? No, that's why we have a what? Savior. That's Jesus' job. I don't do that. Not only is doing this evidence, she says, of spiritual pride. Stop right there. Why would over-identification with people be an evidence of spiritual pride? Here's why. Because instead of giving you Jesus, I'm giving you me. See, I think I'm the one who, no. Spiritual pride, and it also speaks loudly to the confusion we have about the nature of love and what it means to be in relationships that are rooted in incarnational reality. She goes on to say this, often as Christians, pastors, caregivers, we see ourselves as the one whose job it is to alleviate all suffering in the soul of the needy people we are trying to help. This inevitably leads to misplaced empathy and an over-identification with people suffering on one hand. Stop right there. If you've ever seen anybody who over-identifies with someone's suffering, you might have a tendency to look at that over-identification as, boy, they really are a loving person. So it looks on the front end to be a real act of love. But this over-identification with a person's suffering often brings with it an under-identification with the power of Christ to be the one who does the healing and the saving and the rescuing. And if I come to you or you come to me with that kind of dynamic, an over-identification with your situation, and an under-identification with the power of Christ. I may not want to do this. I may despise it that I do this, but if I have an under-identification of Christ's power, an over-identification of empathy with your problem, I will enter your life as a fixer. I will enter your life as a controller, a manipulator. I will begin to coerce, and I will call it love. Dietrich Bonhoeffer in his book little book on community life together as believers I highly recommend it called Life Together identified this dynamic that I'm talking about that Gene Holt talks about as counterfeit love here's what he says though it might look at first blush to be supreme love because of its intensity so involved in your life it isn't love at all and it doesn't help at all except at making people dependent on and hooked into you. Further, he says, in the modern church and everywhere the gospel is preached, we have come to embrace a counterfeit love, a love that we believe as Christian simply because it is intensely felt. Surely a love that is impassioned and sacrificial cannot be anything but a spiritual love, but it can, in fact, he says, be a disordered love. Disordered love is often capable of prodigious sacrifice. Often it even seems to surpass genuine Christian love and fervent devotion and visible activity. But it is in fact what the apostle Paul was describing in 1 Corinthians 13, verse 3, when he said that it is possible to make great sacrifices, to give all your possessions to the poor, to offer your body to be burned without the motive being authentic love. For there is a kind of love, says Bonhoeffer, that does not love you as a free person, but seeks to bind you to itself. And if I am loving you that way, my function in your life will be to fix you. In fact, there will be in me a need to fix you, and in the process, I'll manipulate you, seek to control you, creating in you a dependence not on God, but on me. What I'm describing is disordered love. What I'm describing is counterfeit love. What I'm describing is anti-incarnational ways of relating. Now, many of you know this dynamic, not as disordered, anti-incarnational, but many of you know the dynamic I'm describing as what is referred to in popular culture, particularly in therapeutic circles, as codependency. Codependency is a term that many of you will be able to connect with better than the ones I've been using so far. It's also a term that many of you hear from this pulpit, and the eyes roll up in the back of your head, codependency. I'm so sick of hearing about codependency. Codependency is a term that came into vogue out of the recovery movement in the early to mid-1980s, and we got really sick of it in about the mid to late 1990s. It kind of emerged at a time that alcoholism was beginning to be seen as more than an individual problem, but there was family dynamics as well. And by the way, as I get into this now, I want you to know that this is not about alcoholism. It's about Dietrich Bonhoeffer seeing this dynamic in the context of Christian community. It's about being able to see it in alcoholic systems. And I would just invite you to set your mind free to see it in all sorts of systems that are disordered related to love and relationship. Here's how it plays out here. Melody Beatty wrote what some consider to be a landmark book on this issue called Codependent No More. It indicates that the way this dynamic that they call codependency, just get rid of the word and understand the dynamic. The way it got noticed was this, and I'm quoting her now. As treatment centers were getting real help for alcoholics, professional caregivers were finding that spouses and other family members were not always responding well to the fact that the alcoholic was getting better. And what they discovered, almost by accident, was that in many cases, these people close to the alcoholic, though they complained strongly about the alcoholic's behavior and incessantly badgered them to change, They got a profound sense of meaning and purpose from being the one who rescued them, from being the one who covered for them, from being the one who tried to fix the alcoholic. They would be the one sobering up to drunk. They would be the one hiding the bottle, responsible to make sure he didn't drink or she didn't drink. They would be the one going to the bars and bringing them home, making excuses and covering for the alcoholic. So they never fully had to feel the consequences for their behavior. Rarely were they aware of this role that they played. And they looked in many ways from outsiders, and they even thought themselves to be the embodiment of long-suffering, authentic love until the alcoholic got better. And then this is where the problem arose. This is where the dynamic got noticed. See, if the alcoholic was no longer acting out, this person no longer had anybody to fix now what do i do no they no longer had anybody to rescue or work on and the pattern that emerged was a very strange one and unanticipated by the people who were trying to bring this help families were falling apart marriages were disintegrating but this time it wasn't because of the alcoholism i mean a lot of marriages disintegrated because of alcoholism but this time they were disintegrating because the alcoholic had gotten better and the fixer, the rescuer, the so-called lover, didn't have anyone to fix, rescue, work on, or love. You see, fixing, rescuing, working on people was what love looked like to them. How do I love this person now if they don't need to be rescued? In fact, they resent the fact greatly that I'm always trying to fix them. How do I love them now? The only love they knew was disordered love. In fact, this kind of person wasn't even drawn to somebody who didn't need to be fixed. It's in strange patterns. It wouldn't even be drawn to somebody who would be a healthy person. It would be drawn to somebody who needed to be fixed. And that's, you know, this is not a wonderful paradigm. Now, what I want us to see is that the kind of dynamic I'm describing can happen in all sorts of contexts where alcoholism is not in view at all. I think I've made that clear. Bonhoeffer saw it and called it counterfeit love, but he didn't see it in the context of alcoholism, and he never knew the word codependence. He saw it in the context of Christian community, and what he called it was this, a love that loves you, not as a responsible free person, but as one to whom it binds to itself. This is not a love that loves as one who can authentically relate to God. In other words, this love doesn't love you assuming of you that you are capable of authentically relating to and responding to God. It's a love that does not respond to you in a way that believes that you can be held accountable and that you could survive the consequences of wrong choices. So in some sense, while I love you, I'm going to let you go and experience some consequences. I'm not going to rescue you anymore. No, no. This disordered love is driven. I'm going to fix you, rescue you, work on you. And while this person would never connect this up and would never mean to do this, in all the rescuing, fixing, and working, what they're in fact doing is taking the place of God for you and calling it love. well Gene Holt calls that anti-incarnational Bonhoeffer calls that counterfeit love I am calling it disordered love and it has at least three characteristics that I would like to share with you in order to get free from these things in order to begin our journey into rightly ordered love I've talked to many of you, I've already spoken this word twice, and I've talked to many of you who struggle with this and have come out of this, who even admit going back and forth into this and out of this, and that is true. But just let me give you the characteristics and just kind of notice that we probably all stumble through this a little bit. The first characteristic is this, a need to be needed. The second is this, a need to control. Third characteristic is this, a need to fix. The operative word in all three, there is need. you see none of this behavior is coming from a place of fullness and quite frankly minimally when i said just a minute ago there was some people who have kind of spoken to me i go in and out of this well well there are times when i'm when i really am centered in christ and in the love he has for me and these things don't flow from you out of a place of fullness they flow from you this need to control and fix is always flowing from you and it went from a place of emptiness and You're using other people and your control of them and ability to fix them to fix you. None of it comes from a place of fullness. Authentically, rightly ordered kingdom love always comes from a place of fullness. That's why John spent so much time in this epistle. That's why we spent so much time on the front end of this series on love, affirming that we are now the children of God, chapter 3, verse 1. That he loved us first, chapter 4, verse 19. and fully resting in that, being full of that, is where rightly ordered love comes from. It's why I prayed at the beginning of this sermon that I would be able to preach this secure in the embrace of my Father's love and that you would be able to hear this word that in some ways might disturb you a little bit, that you would be able to hear this secure in the embrace of your Father's love. John's testimony, chapter 4, verse 16, is this, And we have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. It all starts there. And if you are not believing that, if you are not resting in that, the stuff I am describing will infect your soul and ooze from your spirit into relationships in disordered ways. Now, a good example of this that's real easy to spot, and I hope kind of disarming because it's fun, is illustrated well in a scene from one of my all-time favorite movies, What About Bob? Now, I mean, I just can't imagine anybody not having seen that movie, but, you know, maybe there's two of you who have not seen that movie. I'm going to show a clip in just a minute from the movie. Okay, thank you. Whatever. Yeah, it'll be your favorite part of the whole sermon, I know. That's very true. But I want to set it up quickly, just so you know what to look for here and connect it up to the sermon because I don't want to just show you a clip. Okay. Bob in the movie is Bob Wiley, played hysterically by Bill Murray. Dr. Marvin is a psychiatrist that Bob is going to. He's played by Richard Dreyfuss. And he's going to him for a variety of rather bizarre but, quite frankly, very funny emotional problems. Not that emotional problems are funny, but I'm telling you, the way he plays them, they're funny. In the clip you're about to see, it is the initial interview. I mean, Richard Dreyfuss has just met Bill Murray. You've got the names of the characters. And what I want you to notice in the scene is that Dr. Marvin is entirely, at the beginning, entirely disinterested in Bob. In fact, if we had more time to show you more of the clip, you would see at the very beginning, he's absolutely no interest whatsoever in Bob. Dr. Marvin is absolutely full of himself. He has just written a best-selling book entitled Baby Steps. He's about to go on vacation, and up at his summer home, Good Morning America is going to come and interview him, and he is absolutely at the top of his game. So what possible interest do I have in this weird guy? He has no interest in Bob until, in the interview, Bob taps into Dr. Marvin's need to be needed. See if you can see it when we show the clip. Dr. Marvin will physically change. He will grow. He will become larger than life, suddenly interested, kind of animated. He was just going to look. All of a sudden he'll stand up and become very animated and interested in Bob. But please note this. His interest now in Bob has nothing to do with love. He doesn't love Bob. He hates Bob. Something that becomes more and more apparent as the movie goes on. But he loves fixing people. He loves controlling and manipulating, feeling like the source of all knowledge and power. Let's look at the clip. If I fake it, then I don't have it. You know, it's the same with the cardiac arrest. Are you married? I'm divorced. Would you like to talk about that? There are two types of people in this world. Those who like Neil Diamond and those who don't. My ex-wife loves him. I see. so what you're saying is that even though you are an almost paralyzed multi-phobic personality and is in a constant state of panic your wife did not leave you you left her because she liked neil diamond no you're saying that maybe maybe i didn't leave her because she likes neil diamond but maybe maybe she left me? Yes. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Dr. Marvin, you can help me. For the first time in my life, I feel like there's hope. I feel like I can be somebody. Bob, there's an old saying that the best psychiatrist in the world is the one right inside of you. Yeah. I can help you, yes. Thank you. Now, the real reason we showed you that clip was just in case the sermon stinks, at least you got to, you know, you got to watch a little bit of that. now here's the later on in this movie one of the more hysterical scenes and if you've seen it you remember this is where bob is imploring um dr marvin to stay involved in his life and his his word to dr marvin on this bus is this i need i need it's just hysterical i need go get the video now now here's the deal if when you connect i need i need i need to someone's need to be needed. You put those two people together, you have what Dave Busby used to call two ticks, no dog. But some people call it marriage. You don't know anybody who's gotten married that way, do you? Out of I need, I need, I need, and somebody else has a need to be needed. anybody here ever enter into a marriage because they thought they could save somebody you ever hear of anybody entering into the marriage because they thought that who they were going to marry was going to save them and it just felt like love it wasn't love, it's disordered love it has incredible damage to people you think anybody ever you know it's just marriages people enter the ministry this way you think anybody ever entered the ministry thinking that they would save everybody that they were the, that they were, well, no, it was always out of a call from God. I think there was probably a part of a call from God, and there's also this need to be needed. And you hook up a need to be needed with I need, I need, I need, and you have a match made in hell. And somebody will call it love, and somebody will even call it kingdom community life. It isn't kingdom community life. It's disordered love. It's anti-incarnational. It's counterfeit. C.S. Lewis in his novel Till We Have Faces provides another example of this. Aureole, the queen of gloom, is complaining to the gods that they took her sister from her. Her sister's name is Psyche. Here's what she says. We want to be our own. I was my own. And Psyche was mine and no one else had any right to her. Oh, you'll say that you took her away to joy and bliss such as I could never have given her. and I ought to be glad of it for her sake. But why should I care for some horrible new happiness which I hadn't given her and which separated her from me? Do you hear what's going on there? Did you think I wanted her to be happy in that way? No, I wanted her to be happy out of her need for me so I could fill myself with this. I'll thank you, says Oriel, to let me feed my own. We needed no tidbits from your table, God. Did you even remember whose girl she was? She was mine. Mine. Mine. This need to be central in someone else's life won't often get played out as intensely as with Aureole and Psyche or as ridiculously and obviously as with Dr. Marvin and Bob Wiley. But as I've already made clear, it happens in marriages. It happens in ministry. It happens in relationships. And you don't have to seek it out. I mean, it will come to you. Whether you're a person who needs to be needed or not, there are numbers of people who want to find people who will fix them. Remember I said a minute ago there are some marriages where people went into it believing the person could save them, and I'm going to look to you to do that for me. One of the more poignant parts of Jean Holt's talk is when she gets, like one of these parts in a talk, you want to just stop it, stop the tape and just sit and think about this. But she asks this question, does anything get tapped in you? When someone says to you, you're the only one who understands. Now, you know, picture yourself in a relationship. Maybe it's a romantic one, and you're just kind of feeling the first blush of romance, and maybe you're coming from some difficult situation at home or with another relationship, and now you're just feeling this incredibly wonderful human connection, and you're sitting in the front seat late at night and talking wonderful, intimate things, and you hear him or her say, you're the only one who understands. Now, there's part of you that might feel the hook of that. Just part of you. Just might just go, what is that? I'm the only one. But there's another part of you that just, hmm, yeah, that feels really good, and something grows inside of you, and you think it's love. Happens in relationships. Happens in ministry. You might hear something like this. You know, you're the only one who could pray for me. And, you know, on the front end, you might feel the hook in that. Whoa, the only one. Careful here. You might feel the hook, but there's something else in you that just kind of, just kind of gets big, just grows inside of you. The only one. Yeah, probably nobody else here probably can pray. Prayer doesn't know God quite well. I'm sure we're all God's people, but they don't have that. And they probably need my hands, and they need my words, and they need my voice, and they don't need your voice. They don't need your voice. They don't need your words. They need God's words. You understand that? Do you see the line that gets crossed here? It's anti-incarnational. It isn't love. It's incredibly damaging. It's rampant in the church. It's how people do this. People who need to be needed, and this is the scary part. If you come and you want to be fixed, people who need to be needed will offer you their hands and their words. But the problem is they will eventually offer you more than their hands or their words. They will impose their hands. and they will impose their words but not because they love you but because they need to be central to you and eventually out of this there will come a need to control you and fix you I've been in the church a long time grew up in the church and I don't think you need to think real long or creatively this is not a great mystery but whole ministries are built on men or women who come and kind of present themselves this way it's my hands you need It's my words you need. You need it from me. Again, it is not my hands you need. Will my hands be available to you? Yeah, I'll pray for you, the people who God leads me to, just like everybody else. But my hands are not the healing hands. My words are not the God words. You need God's words. You need his hands. You need his touch. And healthy love, rightly ordered love, is intimately involved in people, but it is giving to people God. Here's what he is. Don't love me, but don't look at me or someone else as if they're healed. By the way, there's a paradox here. Need to see the paradox of this kind of disordered love, and the reason it doesn't nourish people is because even though on the front end it looks to be loving. Why does it look to be loving? Because this person's very involved in your life. Oh, y'all be there. I'm here. The problem is it's coming from an empty place, and they're using you for themselves. Later on in Lewis's novel, Till We Have Faces, Ariel becomes aware of what she's doing to her sister psyche. And wonderfully in repentance, says this, profound words. This is Aureole speaking. She had no more dangerous enemy than me, did my sister, for I kept her soul from being united to the divine nature by being united with and dependent on me instead and by calling what I did for her love, she couldn't get away. This, says Jean Holt, is what relationships rooted in the need to be needed do. They keep people from being fully united to Christ. Because what the needs to be needed person says, without knowing it, is this. You need me to be whole. More, I need you to need me to be whole. Anti-incarnational, counterfeit, disordered love. Bonhoeffer, again, in his book Life Together, exhorts, always put Christ between you and those you love. Because the nature of human love is at the heart, self-centered. Human love is directed to the other person for how it will benefit me. Therefore, human love seeks direct contact with the other person. Loving him, here's that quote again, not as a free person, but as one to whom it binds to itself. It desires to be irresistible. It desires to rule. This book, Life Together, I highly commit. It's not very big, but he's got some amazing insights into this dynamic. In fact, he does this one section, I think it's on page 33 of his book, where he talks about disordered conversions, where people look like they're coming to Christ in this great movement, but it's not. Here's what he says. Just listen. Just food for thought here. There is such a thing, he says, as human consumption. It appears in some forms of spiritual conversion. Wherever the superior power of one person is consciously or unconsciously misused to influence profoundly and draw into his or her spell another individual or whole community. The weak have been overcome by the strong. The resistance of the weak has been broken down under the influence of another person. This person has not been won to Christ. They've been overpowered. And we will call it love. He goes on. Only Christ can speak to me in such a way that I may be saved. So others too can only be saved by Christ himself. This means I must release other people from my attempts to regulate, coerce and dominate them with what I'm calling love. This kind of spiritual love will therefore speak to Christ about a brother more than to a brother about Christ. Let's say that again. They will speak to Christ about a brother. Dallas Willard talked about this when he came in the power of prayer for people more than to a brother about Christ. When I speak to a brother about Christ incessantly, I'm kind of thinking I can talk him into this. It doesn't say, by the way, I won't talk to a brother about Christ. Of course I will. More to Christ about the brother, though. It knows that the most direct way to others is always through prayer to Christ and that love of others is wholly dependent upon the truth in Christ. That's why Bonhoeffer says Jesus needs to stand between you and those you love. The heart of disordered love is a need to be needed. Secondly, it's a need to control. And this dynamic, by the way, of control is in the hearts and in the ways of relating of spiritual leaders. It can absolutely destroy people. It is at the heart of spiritual abuse, of manipulation and coercion, using and controlling people to fill the spiritual leader, to validate them, to feed them. Well, then what is the role of spiritual leader and how do you lead with strength? Here, here, it's very simple. This is very simple. It's not necessarily easy to do. I think it's easy to understand. What leaders need to do in the kingdom of God is call people. We need to challenge people and then we need to point people to Jesus. We need to bring people to Jesus. Dare not usurp the role of Christ. Usurp the role of the Holy Spirit. You dare not coerce, manipulate, or control. Why? Because while it might look like love, because you're overly involved in their life, controlling people usurps the role of Christ as Messiah, and it usurps the role of the Holy Spirit as the agent of transformational change in the life of people. in C.S. Lewis' book The Great Divorce there's an account of one of the visitors who was taken by spiritual guides the spiritual guide in heaven and she's just come to heaven and in her kind of tour as it were she meets her husband who's already arrived in heaven before her and she says this to her guide about her husband but if I'm given a free hand she says I'll take charge of him I'll take up my burden once more tells you a little bit about what their marriage was on earth but I must have free hand with all the time we will have here in heaven I believe I could make something of him wouldn't that be a good thing wouldn't that be a loving thing a giving thing he's not fit to be on his own put me in charge of him he needs firm handling I know him better than you do God give him to me don't consult him he doesn't know just give him to me I'm his wife aren't I C.S. Lewis has this little paradigm of heaven that heaven can be that you can have heaven and hell in the same place? Like mosquito heaven would be your hell? Well, this woman's heaven, if she got her husband to control again, would be her heaven and his hell. But he's in heaven now. I was only beginning on earth, she says. There's lots, lots, lots of things I still want to do with him. No, listen, please, please, I'm miserable. I must have someone to do things to. don't call it love it is disordered anti-incarnational counterfeit well Dallas Willard in his book Divine Conspiracy has a whole section on this dynamic I'm talking about I highly recommend it it's the 7th chapter called the community of prayer for love he says this what we're actually doing with all of our proper condemnations coercions and wonderful solutions for people more often than not is taking others out of their own responsibility and out of god's hands trying to bring them under our own control this was never meant to be and usually we ourselves do not consciously know we do it we must always respect other people as spiritual beings who are responsible before god alone for the course that they choose to take of their own free will. Now that's called love, that kind of respect. We must always speak the truth in love, but we must never try to manipulate or harass people into righteousness and goodness with our condemnings, our pearls, or our holy things. Third characteristic and final, we just wrap it up with this, is this need to fix, manifested by becoming on one hand very parental and judgmental, on the other hand, by becoming rescuers. And they happen at the same kind of in the same, they'll seem like opposite things, but you actually do both. You're always, you know, complaining about the behavior, but you're constantly rescuing them. Melody Beatty, again, in her book, Codependent No More, says, we give into our impulse to save the person from suffering, thinking that it's love. We call the boss and tell them our spouse or child is sick when they're really drunk. We lend more money than we should. We lend a little money when we shouldn't give anything at all. Rescuers believe that by once again bailing out the out-of-control person, they are helping them, and they will reap a responsible, loving, grateful person. No, you won't. Rescuing people is not loving them. God's love lets people experience consequences. Best illustration of that or words around that are from Dallas Willard again. Again, out of that same section in his book, Divine Conspiracy, says this. what we're actually doing with all of our proper condemnations, coercions. I'm sorry, I got the wrong quote. Here we are. I already read that one. Here. It is deeply instructive of the nature of human life and its redemption that when Jesus knew that Peter would deny him, he didn't just fix him so that he wouldn't do that terrible thing of denial. Surely he could have done that, but it would not have advanced Peter toward becoming the person he needed to be. So Jesus said to Peter, with sadness perhaps, but also with great confidence in the Father. And by the way, to do this, you have to believe in God. With great confidence in the Father, he said, I have requested concerning you, Peter, that your faith may not die. And when you have straightened up, you will uphold your brothers. I think, says Dallas Willard, there is perhaps no other scene in all of Scripture that so forcefully illustrates the community of prayerful love as this response to Peter. How earnestly Jesus longed for Peter to come outright on this time of testing. But he left him free to succeed or fail before God and man. And as it turned out, before all of subsequent human history. He used no condemnation. He used no shame. No pearls of wisdom on him. And he didn't even use supernatural power to rewire his soul or rewire his brain. It is Jesus' beautiful pattern for us to practice in our relationships to those we authentically love. Now, let me just close this. To some of you, as I'm giving all this, it may feel like a huge confrontation on how you relate to people in your family, in the body of Christ. And to some of you, it is a huge confrontation, and it needs to be. But if you can hear this, even in the confrontation, there is some really good news. You know what it is? Here's the good news. You don't have to fix people. You don't have to control. You don't have to work on anybody as your pet project. And if you can hear that, what that is, hopefully, is for you a relief. Because you know another characteristic of people who are living this way? They're very tired. It's tiring, you know, being God for everybody. And they're also usually very frustrated and often very angry. Why would they be angry? Here's why. Because an awful lot of the people you're trying to fix don't really want you trying to fix them. They resent it, and so they resist it, and you are a frustrated God. Very angry people. I got some good news for you. You don't have to fix anybody. You don't have to control. You don't have to work on. Instead, here's the word of the Lord for you today. Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. And don't even try to get your love ordered right yet. Do this first. Just rewind the tape. And let God first love you. Come back, come back. Chapter 3, verse 1. Beloved, now we are the children of God. Go back there. Go back there to that place where you know and believe the love that God has for you and out of that restful place. As I prayed at the beginning of this sermon, secure in the embrace of your Abba, in that settled place, you know what you will find beginning to flow from you? You will find beginning to flow from you an ability to love God and an ability to just love people, to really love them, to trust God who is at work in them, free from the need to always fix them and control them. God is the one who can do that, speak the truth and love to them, but not without the hooks of control and fixing. You will find that in ways that stun you, and it's like your dream come true, you will actually begin to be sacramental channels of the life and the love of God to them. But you will not be God to them. Beloved, says John, Let us love one another. Not disordered love. Not counterfeit love. Not anti-incarnational love, but let us love one another this way. We have more to say on this in weeks to come. I'd like you to stand as we're dismissed. Father, I thank you for your amazing love that when we receive it and sit down in it and come back to it is what sets your people free to rightly love one another. I pray, God, that you would use the working of your spirit through the word to call us to the fullness of our identity as a new community of people who are learning to love one another. I pray these things in Jesus' name, amen.
