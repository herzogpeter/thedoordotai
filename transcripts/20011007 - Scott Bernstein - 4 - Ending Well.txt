as you know we've kind of hit the pause button on our topics that we were dealing with here on sex money and power because of september 11th that has been at work in all of us the flames of violence have really burned away those things that we have trusted and put our security in and They've exposed those avoided and unanswered questions that reside deep within our hearts. We've looked into, as it were, the rubble and been forced to face the reality of our own mortality, our destiny, our eternity, and that there is no sure promise of tomorrow. It's very interesting because very early on in our growing up years, as small, small children, And almost invariably, we ask two questions. And as parents, you've encountered these two questions. The first has to do with who or where is God? And the second is where am I going to go when I die? And it's interesting that I would submit that those two questions are surfaced out of a place that's embedded within us, actually, that it's a prompting that God has put within us. Those two questions will actually be the questions that follow us for the remainder of our lives. And as we go through the natural process of aging, they will be the questions that at the end are knocking on our heart's door when we take that final step of faith. Where is God? And where am I going to go when I die? These are great questions. They're important questions. They're life-shaping, eternal questions. And parents, I would strongly encourage you to deal with those questions wisely and to help you. Kids Ministry has developed a little sheet called Talking to Your Children About Death. And I would really encourage you, parents, grandparents, to pick this up and read this over. Be aware of it. This is an amazing opportunity that is before us, and they have provided a wonderful piece to help us answer those questions for children. Now, as a child, I attended several funerals growing up. Actually, I was a part of a small church. My mother sang, so you know the combination. You just do funerals. It's the way it is. And some of my earliest recollections are of funerals. You know, you go to a little funeral home or funeral parlor, and at that time the pianist or organist was behind this little type of screen, and I would be behind there with my mother looking out at these people who were weeping. And I remember very early on being carried by her looking at someone, and that evoked a whole lot of questions for me afterwards. Why was that person sleeping in that kind of box with all those fancy pillows? And why were they sleeping with their glasses on? That's kind of one of the mysteries, you know? where am I going to go when I die? What happens to people when they die? Why do they put people in the ground? And probably of most crucial importance to me is, do they always have cupcakes at funerals? Now, my mother answered my questions, and I was very happy to learn that cupcakes and cake usually are part of every funeral, so that was a relief for me, actually. But I was learning a very important thing about life and death, and that is that death was normative. People died. Parents, can I give you a little tidbit of advice? I really think it's important and very significant that you protect your child from senseless violence and entertainment death, the ludicrousness of our culture. But find ways to bring a healthy reality of the life and death rhythm that is a part of our existence. you have to overcome your own discomfort to do that but find ways see it's interesting because of the small church that I was in the very first deaths that I was exposed to were not within my familial circle there were people I was acquainted with but they weren't directly associated with me and I'm fortunate today many children face their first reality of death with someone that's within the family circle and it becomes very difficult As a pastor, I've stood in rooms where grandchildren were screaming at a dying grandparent. You can't go. Try harder. You can make it. Hang on. You'll get better. You can't die. You got to live. And my heart absolutely aches for them. Their panic, fear, their sense that death means theft, their sense of being robbed gives me a very clear picture on how their parents didn't prepare them for a normative reality. Prepare your children. I was about nine or ten years old and it was a Sunday morning and the pastor walked up as he would on any Sunday morning and give that general call to worship just as we experienced here, read the scripture. And he said, by the way, on the way to church this morning I stopped by the hospital to see Grandma Hanson. Now, Grandma Hanson was very significant. She was a spiritual matriarch in our congregation, and I mean that in the most healthy way. She prayed childless couples into children's, missionaries out of the hands of communist people back from the edge of death. When she stood up on a Sunday morning periodically to give the congregational prayer, I mean, my eyes were wide open. I'd look around because I thought God was really there. She prayed like he showed up and that he would really answer prayer. Grandma had been sick before, and we had sent an anointed hanky. We anointed it with oil. We sent that handkerchief to the hospital. They laid it on her, and boom, I mean, she was snatched from the jaws of death. I love this dear old lady because my mom, as I said, and dad were so deeply involved in the service. Many times she was the one who was the custodial care over me. I would sit next to her, rummaging through her purse, finding all sorts of things to play with. So she was someone I knew quite well. And now the pastor was telling us that he had stopped off to visit her, and so I was all ears. What was that about? He said, Grandma Hanson gave me a little message. She said, I was supposed to deliver to you this morning. Tell the people to stop praying for my healing. Their prayers are keeping me here, and I want to go home. Whoa. So the pastor said it was time. Her mansion must be ready. And so he led us in prayer, simply asking that God would send his angels to usher Grandma Hanson to her new home where she would hear these amazing words, well done, good and faithful servant. Well, we went into the song service. We didn't worship like we worship now. We had a song service. That meant some guy stood up front and waved his arms like this, back and forth, back and forth. Depend upon the rhythm of the song, sometimes it was like this. But we were singing. About 15 minutes into that, an usher walked forward, gave a note to the pastor. He came over, he tapped the guy on the shoulder, and he leaned into the microphone, and he said, a member of the Hanson family just called, and only moments ago, Grandma Hanson left her earthly tent behind to live forever with Christ. Women reached for their purses to pull out these little hankies. Men leaned forward, reaching for their hip pockets to find their handkerchiefs. Tears began to flow. I'll never forget it was so quiet. And then that silence was broken by the pianist's Pentecostal flourish arpeggio that starts at one end of the piano and races all the way up to the top with great gusto. Nobody had to be cued without a song leader. We all joined right in on when we all get to heaven. What a day of rejoicing it will be. When we all see Jesus, we'll sing. We'll shout the victory. Onward to the prize before us. Soon his beauty will behold. Soon the pearly gates will open. Soon we'll tread the streets of gold. When we all get to heaven. What a day of rejoicing it will be. when we all see Jesus. We'll sing, we'll shout, and then we'd go back, we'll sing, we'll shout. We did that about 17 times in a row. The victory. And we rolled right into without pausing, it will be worth it all when we see Jesus. Life's trials will seem so small when we see Christ. One glimpse of his dear face all sorrow will erase. So bravely run the race till we see Christ. We sang and we sang and we sang of heaven. The pastor put his message away and he just unpacked before us this amazing message about heaven and eternity. What man can live and not see death or save himself from the power of the grave? Psalm 89. As for man, his days are like grass. He flourishes like a flower of the field. The wind blows over it and it is gone and its place remembers it no more. Psalm 103. Death has been swallowed up in victory. Oh, death, where is your victory? Where, oh, death is your sting? 1 Corinthians 15. And then I go to prepare a place for you. John 14. Oh, that message was a barn burner, I'll tell you. The call was for those who had never given their life to Christ to come to the way, the truth, and the life. He encouraged them to receive the eternal destiny that God had prepared for them. I would encourage you, if you haven't come to the way, the truth, and the life, to come. To receive the eternal destiny that God has prepared for you. The call is still alive and well. And then his call was to us as believers to fix our eyes on things above, to live each day with eternity in view. Grief has a way of opening our eyes and our hearts to see past the rubble of our loss and to glimpse eternity. That morning, in the place of felt grief, I added to my knowledge about death. Not only was death normative and it would touch those that I loved, but I was also getting the distinct impression that I was going to live somewhere else a lot longer than I was going to live here. There was a home prepared for me. These two learnings have served me very well in pastoral ministry. And as a pastor, I've had to do many funerals. And I've experienced loss within my own family circle. So I'm very aware that death is normative. And in my place of pastoral responsibility and facing my own grief, I've had to draw again from the fact that there is an eternal home, that we offer a blessed hope. This isn't all there is. There is more to come. In fact, in almost 25 years of pastoral ministry, I think I've developed kind of a friendship with death. I actually like to be around dying people. For a while, I seemed to make several hospital calls that converged with the death of the person that I went to visit. So much so that some of my friends were quite concerned and they said if they were ever in the hospital, they just wanted me to call on the phone, not pay a visit. It's an amazing privilege, truly, To be a part of the community that says goodbye and releases a saint is a wonderful privilege. Not long ago, I was called to the bedside of a man. His body just kept struggling to live. God has wired us in such a way that we don't easily give up physical life. He was just there gasping. As we sat around that bed, it became really obvious to me that the family was prepared to pray their goodbyes. So, we did. And as we were finished, I leaned over and I placed my hand on that dear saint's forehead, gasping. And I said, as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be forevermore. Our times are in your hands. You give life and you call us back to yourself. We love you. We love you, but we release you into the loving arms of Jesus who gave himself for you. In that moment, I just sense what I've sensed so many times before. I truly think that if I squint hard enough, someday I'm gonna be able to see what's happening in a room, you know? The veil gets so thin in that moment There was one large breath exhaled, and the room was quiet. And then the silence was broken by a family member who simply said, he's gone. No truer words were ever spoken. The inhabitant of that frail, mortal body was gone, and when he left, The body was no longer needed and ceased to live. The scripture says, Meanwhile, we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. 2 Corinthians 5. Interesting, we think mortal is life. That's not how Paul saw it. And then he tells us that for those who believe in Jesus Christ, to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord because that's where life really is. The psalmist wrote, Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints from Psalm 116. Really precious. Paul and the psalmist seem to have a little different view here than most of us. we see where we are now as life and death as loss. Over the last several months, my attention has shifted. I assume my parents will die, and I assume that there are going to be others who are close to me who will die, and that tragedies happen. There is sudden death, there is young death, and all of the need for closure, and I've been doing the work for years around that. And I think I've worked those things well into my heart and mind. And then one morning, I woke up and I thought, I'm going to die. And it left me rather perplexed, actually. I didn't think it was a foreshadowing of an imminent reality. At least I was hoping that it wasn't. However, I have to admit that there were some irrational fears, a little bit of paranoia that I sensed in my life. And I noticed that in some small but very real way, I still feared death. And that in even a greater, more significant way, I feared the way that I would die. I just want to lay down, fall asleep, and not get up kind of a thing. Something over which I have absolutely no control. I became concerned again about those I loved, how would I cope with the loss of Sandy, the boys, my parents. Boo, all sorts of stuff became real and alive for me again. And I became very, very aware that the circle of people who have known me since birth is dramatically diminishing every year. And I got this overwhelming sense that life was feeling terribly short. I even thought about my own funeral. Ever thought about your own funeral? I would actually recommend it. It's interesting because how my funeral played out in my mind's eye had an awful lot to do with how the day was going. It's interesting. If I was having a day where I felt like I love Sandy well, that in ways that were compassionate and good, I was loving other people, that I was experiencing, as it were, some measure of success. Well, the scene for my funeral that would play out in my mind was quite amazing, actually. I would see someone standing there going, welcome to the memorial service for Scott Bernstein. Wow. We knew he had friends, but we never thought we were gonna have to hold this in the Metrodome. This is amazing. Start a wave there on the upper deck. Woo! That's so exciting. Yeah. Oh, by the way, Keith Meyer has said that all of the parking will be covered by Church of the Open Door. Go get your tickets validated. And boy, I tell you, Sandy wants to meet every one of you personally. Okay? It's tremendous. She'll be down on the 50-yard line, and they will be serving cupcakes down there. So come and get your cupcakes. Powerful. Minnesota Orchestra would strike up. Worship team would strike up. Whew, it's great. Then there were those days where, you know, I'd been a little catty to Sandy, and my attitude had turned south, and yuck, you know, and I thought, whoa, if I were to die today, they'd probably find a rent-a-pastor to do this. And on top of that, I don't know, Sandy might not even show up. She'd probably show up if she wasn't too busy at work or something. It just was not good. Regardless of those goofy moments, I've given some time about thinking about death. So this past summer, I went to the lake where I've gone for years. My dad's gone to this lake since 1936, Clithera Lake. It's near Ashby, Minnesota, which is the stomping ground of the Bell Guards. You know, it's got to be good. And I went to Mount Pleasant Cemetery, and I walked among the stones that mark those who are now within the community of my heart. Kate, Eunice, Ben, Paul, Frank, Art, Isla, wow, George. George and I were swimming only last year. Now he's gone. I looked out at that lake and I saw my grandpa standing in the boat. Not really, but in my mind's eye. He was standing in the boat fishing. No life preserver. Didn't matter what the DNR rules were. He pre-existed DNR so he could do whatever he wanted. And I walked over to a low marker and it read, Private First Class, December 7th, 1941, Pearl Harbor. Thought about life cut short, what it must have been like for that family the day the courier brought the telegram to their door. Sacrifice, loss, grief, trying to get on with life, not wanting to forget or let go. And there was a stone that was laying next to that little marker and it was just sparkling in the sun. It seemed like it had been put there just for me, so I picked it up and I've carried it every day since in my pocket. And I reach in several times a day, keep it next to my wallet, and when I rub it, I remind myself that I am mortal and eternal. Quite frankly, I thought I was done thinking about this death stuff, and then September 11th came around. I saw it as another invitation to stay in the process, to uncover the things of my heart. So what have I learned? Actually, I've learned a lot more than I can possibly unpack here this morning. I've kind of kept a list of what I need to know to end well. And these are not profound truths. They're simple truths that have simply gone from my head to a much deeper place within my heart. I have no choice about when death will come to me or how, but I do have a choice of how I will face death. Will it be with fear, avoidance, or will I see it as theft? Or will I begin to see it through eternal eyes? As I said, there's more than I could unpack here. so this week if you go to www.thedoor.org and click on the homepage, there's going to be a section called Service Reflections. They're actually going to post some of my other meandering thoughts there that you can read. Oh, the wonder of the web. So what do I need to know to end well? Poke some of these truths into your heart. The first. I need to see life as gift. In a day when we tend to view ourselves as the masters of our procreative capacity, we forget that life is truly gift. I don't own anyone. They don't own me. I didn't create them. I didn't even create me. I can't dictate anyone's destiny and I can only appropriate by faith my eternal destiny. We are all on loan and God has created us to enjoy all of eternity together. We carry such a sense of entitlement that when someone dies or we think even of our own death, we frame it in terms of being ripped off. We'll get angry at God like he's some sort of a cosmic robber who somehow steals those we love or takes away our life. Life is gift. Everyone is on loan. I need to grow in gratitude not for the absence that exists when one leaves, but for the very fact that I was able to enjoy them, for the presence that we enjoyed. Now we get this little rubbling here every once in a while. Am I supposed to pick this one up? Okay, see you in a moment, folks. Be grateful. Enjoy another's presence. Be grateful that you are even alive. Job had to wrestle through this when he started out he gave these lofty lofty answers Job 19 oh I know that my redeemer lives and that he will stand upon the earth whoa good answer Job chapter 25 he's in a completely different place he's saying that the dead are in deep anguish and finally in chapter 38 God knocks on his door and says where were you Job when I laid the foundations of the earth Where were you? Where were you? Where were you? And Job's eyes start to open up to the reality that everything he sees, everyone that he knows, his very life is gift from God. I had the privilege of doing my Grandpa Bernstein's funeral, W.E. And as I unpacked his life that day at the funeral, I started to tell stories about his driving and his hunting, his ability to hold a car together with twine, his habits of flashing the outdoor light every time a train went by, and we began to laugh. Waves of laughter just rolled across us. We celebrated the gracious gift of God, who was W.E. Bernstein. His life was a gift to us, and we're going to have all of eternity to hang out together. If I'm going to end well, I need to see that life is gift, not an entitlement. I also need to remember that we are, and I am, the created masterpiece of a personal God. We are the crown of all creation. Genesis makes this abundantly clear. However, if you believe that you evolved, then every day you're moving toward extinction. That's about it. And we see this in the people that are around us every day. And if you believe that, it puts an amazing pressure into your daily life. You have to figure out how to maximize your happiness now because there is nothing more. The only thing that matters is what directly or indirectly affects your life now. Self-centeredness, self-absorption, selfishness becomes the regular pattern of life. Life is boiled down to my job, my house, my car, my future, my security, me, me, me. After all, this is all there is. The sad part is, as I've looked at my own life, there are days when I live and would seem to indicate the way I lived my life that I believe I evolved. I scramble for security. I try to prop up my waning esteem. I've come to a conclusion that there is a virus that kind of wipes off my mental hard drive this whole concept of being the created masterpiece of a personal God. And that virus is sin. The only remedy is to repent and move from my independence and striving to dependence and trust. We're the created masterpiece of a personal God, bearing God's image, and we are created with eternity in our hearts. Ecclesiastes 3.11. He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men, yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end. We have an eternal destiny. We have been redeemed so we could be with God forever. Forever. This is the blessed hope. For us, to live is Christ, to die is gain. That's what Philippians 1.21 tells us. It's this eternity that's in us, this inner orientation that is already embedded in us that causes us to ask those early questions and those questions that we push way to the back as adults. So if eternity is bound up in my heart, then I must be heading for an eternal home. the scripture refers to us as aliens and strangers and sojourners and pilgrims the old gospel song says this world is not my home I'm just a passing through we become so earthbound especially in this country most days I don't desire heaven I think I'm living in it what could be better than this September 11th tells us something probably could be better than this. I think that many of us have lost our eternal perspective. We've lost sight of our destination, heaven. Jesus in John 6 is talking about being the bread of life, and he was hitting a major obstacle with his disciples. They just weren't getting it. The essential part about them coming into a deeper understanding of being in touch with life wasn't getting through their thick, thick, thick, I'll get it here, thick coraniums. And so finally Jesus, I think just in frustration, was probably shaking his head and said, no, you just don't get it because I am from above and you are from below. And they went, ooh, wow, you look like a humanoid to us. I mean, what's this above stuff, below stuff? What Jesus was saying is to be true of every believer. We are from above. Eternity is in our hearts. We are destined for an eternal home. Do you have a sense of that other world? Colossians 3, 1 and 2. Since you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above. Where Christ is seated at the right hand of God, set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. We're not to be preoccupied with earthly realities. I didn't say we don't care, not aware, work with them. We're just not to be consumed and preoccupied. We are not of this earth. We don't have an earthly origin, and we don't have an earthly destiny. Our view of dying and our destiny should change our view of living. we live on earth, but our heart and mind are fixed on heaven, and in particular Jesus, who is the author and finisher of our faith. You know, you can believe this. You can believe you're heaven-bound and still have very earth-bound values and affections. It's become more and more apparent to me that since I'm going to be living a lot longer somewhere else than I am going to be living here, I need to be building a heavenly treasure. Heaven-bound people put on eternal lenses, and they begin to see the world as Christ saw it. We see ourselves differently, which is our sexuality. We see our possessions differently, which is our money. And we see other people differently, which means we are motivated by the power of love and not the love of power. Sounds like a series we're going to be getting back into, actually. Final thought for you this morning is this. It took me a while to finally realize this, but I'm better off dead. Obviously, all the days ordained for me are within God's hands and control. But there is a better place for me. Yes, death will separate me from loved ones, and I felt the waves of grief, just as you have, that come when I send someone off to live on the other side. But you know what? It also makes me desire heaven more. However, more significantly, death separates us from the sin and the curse of death and frees me to be fully alive in the love of God. This old body is going to die, but my spirit is going to live on. And scripture says nothing can ever separate me from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus. Romans 8. When this mortal body finally dies, I will be set free to see the world as it really is. I'm going to join and you are going to join that great cloud of witnesses that Paul talks about in Hebrews 12 that really know things as they really are that are fully alive. Our own fear of death has really influenced our view of the gospel. We have a very short-sighted view of why Jesus came. We think that Jesus came so that we could be forgiven and we could be set free from the darkness that's in our heart. That is what he did accomplish. But do you know, Jesus did not need to come so we could be forgiven? And you're like, whoa, here comes the heresy this morning. Write this one down. God had already provided a way for sins to be forgiven. All throughout the Old Testament, people were offering sacrifices to cover and atone for their sins. And God looked down and said, you are forgiven. We tend to think that these sins were handled differently by God. Somehow that he somehow collected them over here and it was temporary forgiveness and that when Jesus came, those sins would really be covered once and for all. Isn't that true? Those people were really forgiven. It was a complex process that they had to live with, but they were truly forgiven. Those sacrifices forgave and covered sin. What it could not do was break the power of death. that's what it could not do for since death came through a man the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man for as in Adam all die so in Christ shall all be made alive 1 Corinthians 15 the ultimate power of sin was death while our sins were forgiven. Death kept chasing us down. And because we have this short view that Jesus came to forgive us, we don't really hear the full power and potential of the good news of the gospel. We still live in fear of a conquered enemy. Start reading some of those familiar scriptures again. The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord, Romans 6. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him should, what, be forgiven? Well, obviously, he was the final sacrifice but that's not what the scripture says. That whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life, John 3, 16. we're so preoccupied with our sin condition and our physical body and the world and our own fear of death that we fail to see the long view of what God has done for us we're to find strength in our daily lives from knowing where we will spend eternity knowing our end puts our present context in an eternal view It begins to shape our daily lives by shaping them into kingdom, eternal perspectives. All throughout the ministry of Jesus, he taught that he was establishing a kingdom where death had been abolished. He who the Son sets free is free indeed. For Jesus and the New Testament writers, physical death wasn't a big deal, actually. Paul said, we do not grieve like the rest who have no hope. It doesn't mean that we don't grieve, but we know the end. We know the future. We're to draw the direction for our life. We're to draw the strength we need, as Dave talked about last week, to persevere from the everlasting kingdom of God and from the knowledge that we're heading home. I love what Dallas Willard said when he was here. pointed out to us that aging was a gift. Now, for the first time, I was okay with everything that's starting to feel the gravitational pull. It's like, whoa, that's okay. It's a gift. It weans us from our physical bodies and this earth and prepares us to receive our new body to live in our new home. I've come to agree with Paul that I'm torn. I desire to depart and be with Christ. which is better by far, he says. But it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body. Philippians 1.23. Paul said it. The truth is, I'm better off dead. I'm going to ask the servers to start to come up here in the prayer team worship. In a moment, we're going to come to the table. And it's here at this table that we are reminded that the final enemy, death, has been conquered. Forgiveness is here. The final sacrifice has taken the sin issue away. But death has been conquered. I have received the gift of eternal life. And one day, Scott Bernstein is going to move. He's going to move from this temporary home And on that day, I'm going to celebrate my birthday into God's full world, life abundant. Dwight Moody, when he was in his final years, said, One day, you will hear that I am dead. Do not believe it. I will then be alive as never before. And I love it. When the two guards came to take Dietrich Bonhoeffer to be a martyr on the gallows for his faith, he briefly took a friend aside and said, this is the end, but for me, it's the beginning of life. Wow. Now that's ending well. Let's come to the table. Thank you.
