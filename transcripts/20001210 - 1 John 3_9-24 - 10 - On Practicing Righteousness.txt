Open your Bibles to 1 John chapter 3. 1 John chapter 3, where we're picking our study up in the 6th verse. We're going to be dealing with a pretty large section today, to the end of the chapter, all the way to verse 24. But before I even read the text, I want to just kind of put you in touch with the fact that we are going to be dealing in this section with some issues that John raises that are quite problematic. Indeed, this is a section where When people who go to 1 John struggle with certain parts of 1 John, this is the struggle, this section right here. In fact, some people would avoid 1 John altogether because of some of the things John says here. For instance, opening line, verse 6. Quite matter-of-factly, he says this, that no one who abides in him sins. Indeed, no one who sins has seen him or knows him. I don't know how that strikes you, but that sounds like if you sin, you're not redeemed. Verse 9 takes it a step further. I think verse 9 is going to be on the screen here. It says this, that if you're born of God, you cannot sin. You cannot sin. Look at verse 9. No one who is born of God practices sin because his seed abides in him, and he cannot sin. Are you kidding me? It's a little scary, I think. Very confusing and quite problematic for a number of reasons. But as I was studying this, among the reasons that this section is problematic, the chief would be this for me, that this appears to be a direct contradiction to things John himself has said earlier in this very epistle. You may remember chapter 1, verse 8, John said, If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. In chapter 1, verse 10, John says the same thing. If we say we have no sin, we make God a liar, and his word is not in us. the exhortation of chapter 1 in response to that truth of admitting our sin was this that we are to live as children of light continually bringing into the light what we hide in the dark and what we hide in the dark we spent I think three weeks talking about this is the sin that we have but if we confess our sin he is faithful and just to forgive us our sin and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness the strong message from chapter 1 was this, that we are to be a confessing people, open and honest with God and with each other about the sin, key here, that we have. So when he comes in chapter 3 and seems to be saying the opposite thing, it's problematic. The message of chapter 1, confess your sin. The message of chapter 3 seems to be that if you confess your sin, in other words, if you do what chapter 1 says to do, you will be confessing that you don't know the Father. that you're not born of God because verse 6 of chapter 3 says no one who since has seen him or knows him. Verse 9 says no one who is born of God since. Very confusing. And again, one of the reasons people who often struggle with their study of 1 John. Now, there are a number of explanations for this. A seeming contradiction offered by a variety of scholars with various theological perspectives. I was able in my study to identify I six strongly held explanations or different views of this seeming contradiction, including that John was a little loopy in his old age, and he was kind of losing it here. And if you think he was goofy here, you should read the Revelation. But after I kind of dealt with all of the explanations and read through them all and studied them and tried to bring them to their logical conclusion, My conclusion was this, that I believe the most likely explanation for what's going on here is also the most simple. It comes from a basic understanding of the Greek text and the use of the present tense verb when referring to sin, which speaks to, the present tense verb always speaks to, continuous, ongoing, practiced action. The word practice there is significant, and some of your translations even use the word practice several times in the rendering there. And the word practice simply means to work hard in order to get good at something. That understanding, the text is then rendered this way and what we're going to do is put the text on the screen just as it reads in the New American Standard and we're going to go through the text but I'm going to basically, using the present tense verb where it's appropriate, kind of interpret it as we go. So you follow the text and I'll interpret it. Verse 6, No one who abides in him. Stop right there. it's going to take a while abides is also a present tense verb so it would read this way no one who in a continual practiced way is abiding in him can at the same time in a continual practiced way sin you just can't do both people who are in a continual practiced way sinning working hard to get better and better at sin are not the people who have seen him or come to know him. Let no one deceive you. Verse 7, stop right there. Who was doing the deceiving? Well, if you've been with us the last several weeks, even months, we have found out that one of the reasons John wrote this epistle was to speak to his dearly beloved children of God who were being deceived by a group of false teachers, heretics. They even had names. Among them were the docetists and the Gnostics who out of their philosophical dualism thought that they could claim a superior knowledge to God without obedience to God. Let no one deceive you about that, says John. Here is the just plain truth. The one who practices righteousness or is working hard to get good at what is right is righteous. Verse 8, the one who is in a continual practiced way working hard to get good at sin is of the devil. It's just that simple. Why? Because the devil has sinned from the beginning. It's what he does. It's what he's good at. And if that is what you are practicing, then that is who you are following. That is whose child indeed you are. In fact, verse 10 says it just that plainly. By this, the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious. Back to verse 9. No one who is born of God works hard to get good at sin. Why? Because the seed of God abides in him. That's why. The seed gave you a couple of weeks ago is not just a little seed we'd see for a plant. The seed there in the Greek is the Greek word sperma. And it brings with it the analogy of a physical reproduction. The seed of God inside of you reproducing you. You see, the true offspring of God are incapable of continually practicing sin. They just can't do it, at least not for long. You might stumble. In fact, you probably will stumble. You might even wander away. You might even pull what I would call a prodigal. We're in some maybe stage of development in your spiritual, possibly, adolescence. You kind of get mad at God or you think you know better than God and you wander away and you end up eating with the pigs. But here is the truth. Whether it's a stumble or a wander or a prodigal, if the seed of God authentically abides in you, Somewhere along the line, you will remember who you are, and you will remember whose you are, and often in weeping repentance, you return to the Father. And as I say these things, some of you are in your own mind going, I know that's happened to me. I know that's happened to me. There are even maybe times when you wanted to wander away, and you decided you would, and you couldn't get away. Do you know why? Well, I'm telling you today why, because you belong to God, and you couldn't get away, Because the seed of God abides in you. Some of you sometimes struggle with friends who walked with God and now they're going through a patch in their life where it seems like they have no regard for God and they're wandering or they're stumbling or they're really angry and you wonder, were they ever saved? Well, the truth is when they're not living in any way for God, it's hard to tell. But I can tell you this, if the seed of God is in them, they will, I promise, they will come back. You know why? Because they belong to God. The seed of God abides in them and they can't keep it up for long. Verse 10, by this, the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious. It comes down to what you practice, to what you're working hard to get good at. Anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother. Stop right there. You need to notice this shift here from practicing righteousness to loving your brother. I called it a shift, as if practicing your righteousness is one thing and loving your brother is another thing. I do not think this is a shift. Indeed, I think when he speaks of loving your brother or your sister, he is actually giving an explanation of what practicing righteousness actually is. Because what it means to practice righteousness in practical terms is simply this, to love your brother. That's what practicing righteousness is. Verse 11, for this is the message which we have heard from the beginning. This has never changed. This is the bottom line that we should love one another, not as Cain, who was of the evil one and slew his brother. For what reason did he slay him? Because his deeds were evil and his brothers were righteous, which means simply this, that he slew him because Cain was jealous. But we've been called to love. Well, how do you know what love is? Verse 16, we know love by this. He laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for each other. Whoever has the world's goods, verse 17, and beholds his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him? Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and in truth. We shall know by this that we are of the truth and shall assure our heart before him and whatever our heart condemns us. For God is greater than our heart and knows all things, verse 23. And this is the commandment, actually just to, number one, that we believe in the name of his son Jesus Christ, and number two, that we love one another just as he commanded us. Well, that's a lot of stuff I just gave you, quite a mouthful. And so to simplify this, but still deal effectively and deeply with this text, I have boiled this whole thing down to one simple question, around which we will walk for the rest of our time this morning. The question is this. What does it mean to practice righteousness? What does it look like? How does it feel? How do I know if I'm actually doing it? Well, to answer that, I'm going to share with you five things. Five things that are at the core of understanding what it means to practice righteousness. So what I want to talk about, first of all, is the heart of it. Number two, I want to talk about the danger of it. Number three, the look of it. Number four, the way of it. And number five, the benefit of it, of practicing righteousness. So let's look at what's at the heart of it, what's at the heart of practicing righteousness. And when I talk about the heart of it, what I'm talking about is the motivation. Why would anybody even care about a right kind of walk? Well, to find the answer to that, we have to go back to what we dealt with two weeks ago, to the metaphor that John himself chose to carry this entire teaching. He says this, See how great a love the Father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the children of God. I want you to stop right there. Everything you understand about 1 John 3 needs to be held in this metaphor of parent and child. Child adoring the parent, parent loving the child, And in that relationship, whatever is happening is happening. We should be called the children of God and such we are. Beloved, now we are the children of God and it has not yet appeared what we shall be, but we know that when he appears we shall be like him. And everyone who has this hope fixed on him purifies himself. Beloved, at the very center of practicing righteousness is the heart of a child. Secure in the love of the Father, desiring because of that love to be just like their father, They follow their father or their mother. Let it be a parent figure, male or female, it doesn't matter. It's a parental figure in whose love you are secure. Two weeks ago I said it this way, that the most motivating, sanctifying power in your life is resting in the love of God, your Abba, is embracing your identity as his treasured child. And the promise of verse 3 of chapter 3 is that as you, being a child, desire to be like your father, your mother, this parent's figure, and you learn to follow him, the promise is that one day it will pay off. Even in your stumbling right now and not being able to keep up very well, as you desire to be like him, learn to follow him, one day you will be fully formed in him. Chapter 3, verse 3 says all of that this way, and everyone who has this hope fixed on him. What hope? that their father loves them, and that one day they will be like them. Everyone who has that hope purifies himself. That's what they do, just as he is pure. Now, when you consider the motivation for practicing righteousness, it's very important that the picture you have is not that of a child desperately trying to be good enough to win the affection of a cold, hard-hearted parent. The picture is that of a child secure in the love of the father, doing what children do when they know their father or their mother loves them. What children naturally do when they have a healthy relationship like that is they naturally follow them. I want to go where you go. I want to do what you do. And when I grow up, I want to be just like you. Not all of you have had that in your family. And so some of this father-God, mother-adult-parent relationship that would desire to be like a mom or a dad is really hard to work with. but it's also something you need to deal with in terms of coming up with an authentic picture of God and how this works. I've told you this story before, but I was about four or five years old. The reason I know I was that age is because this memory I have happened in a house that we lived in that we moved out of when I was five. So whenever this happened in my life, it was before I was six years old, so I was four or five years old. and my father, who I adored, who I knew loved me, and I just thought he walked on water at the time. Come to find out he was kind of a goofy guy just like me later on. But when I was that age, I just wanted to do whatever he did. And he was walking out the door and down the stairs of this two-flat, and as fast as my four or five-year-old legs could carry me, I was running for that door, screaming these words, Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going? Got to the top of the stairs, looked down. He looked up, twinkling his eye, and he said, I'm going crazy. Want to come? well guess what i said yeah i didn't even hear what why what is that about that's about a child wanting to be like their father i just want to go where you go i just want to do what you do here's the deal at the core of practicing righteousness at the core of following the father is a heart of the child where are you going what are you doing i just want to be like you at the very and if you lose that core, you lose it all. And we need to continually come back to that. That's at the core of practicing righteousness. But now a question, how do children practice anything, let alone righteousness? How do they practice anything? Well, I have this most vivid picture. I hope it works for you because it's so powerful to me. I touched on it a couple weeks ago. I'll give it to you again. Feature a child. Because we live in Minnesota, I think it's easy to do. We'll picture them in the know. And this child is following their father or their mother, this parental figure. And because the relationship is what it ought to be, they're just wanting to be like them and just keep up with them. And because of that, this little toddler is trying to put their feet where their parent puts their feet. But because they're a kid, not because they're bad or rebellious, just because they're a kid, they can't do it. Keep falling down. They keep falling short. They're not doing well. They're not always keeping up. But the picture that's amazing to me is this, even though this little toddler continually falls down, continually falls short, falling short is interesting. One of the Greek words for sin is hamartia. You know what it means? To fall short. Here you are continually falling short, not being able to put your feet where he put his feet or she put his feet. At times even failing miserably. Let me ask you a question. Just step back and look at the picture of this child falling but trying to keep up with their parents. What is this child practicing? What are they practicing? Is this little kid who's falling down practicing sin? Is this little kid working really hard to get good at doing what is wrong? Are they doing what is wrong? Sometimes. They're not making it. They're falling down. But is that what they're working at? No. As you get back and watch this picture of this child, heart of love, want to be like their dad, following following after, but not always doing well, this little child is practicing what? Righteousness. And as he does that in love with the Father, he is going to grow. The promise of the previous text, he is going to grow. And one day you will be like him. So keep on practicing and keep on putting your feet, and you will grow and you will strengthen. And one day you will walk and one day you will run and one day you will soar. Question, why is this little kid? Watch the picture again. I mean, he's just kind of sitting there stuck in the snow when his dad's up here. Why is he bothering to do this? Why is he practicing righteousness, following the Father? Easy, because he loves the Father. Another question, why does he love the Father? That's easy too, because his seed abides in him, verse 9, because he's born of him, beloved. This is absolutely central to the gospel that we preach. You see, we are not just sinners who needed forgiveness. We were dead people who needed resurrection, who needed regeneration and recreation. Jesus to Nicodemus in a conversation said to Nicodemus these words, Marvel not when I say to you, you must be born again. Too late, he marveled. What are you talking about? Am I supposed to go back into my mother's womb? I don't get your nuts. And Jesus went on to explain, I'm speaking here in spiritual terms, in metaphor. I am not speaking of a physical seed or a physical womb I am speaking of a spiritual eternal seed that is provided by the Holy Spirit of God and it's given to everyone who asks for it and the result is a new birth and the result of the new birth is a new heart and the result of a new heart is a new desire and the new desire is simply this I want to be like the father who gave me life it is not that complicated the result of the new heart is a new desire and the new desire is simply this to practice righteousness and that is how you can tell who's born of God Ezekiel 36, 26 says it this way God is prophetically speaking through the prophet Ezekiel of the covenant that is one day going to come he says of it this in that day will give to you a new heart and put within you a new spirit. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give to you a new heart. And I will put my spirit within you. And by my spirit in you, I will cause you to walk in my statutes and you will be careful to observe my ordinances. So here's the deal. No one who is truly born of God works hard to get good at sin. He simply cannot do it. You know why? Because the seed of God is in him. And the instinct he has is to follow his dad, the parent. So that's the heart of it. At the heart of practicing righteousness is the heart of the child who simply and naturally simply wants to be like their parent. The danger of practicing righteousness. That might even strike you. What possible danger could there be in this? Well, there is possible danger in this, and that is when the practice of righteousness becomes external religious pharisaic legalism. You see, void of this child's heart as being the authentic motivation for true righteousness, if that is not there, our practice of righteousness will invariably crawl to the outside, becoming a performance, not designed to please God or pursue God, but designed to impress people. There have always been people like this. We refer to them here as just simply religious people. Jesus had to deal with them in fact they were the greatest adversaries that he had and he described them this way as those who polish the outside of the cup and of the bowl but inwardly they have no life they do not have the heart of the child desiring to be like the father even stumbling along the way but they do look good on the outside they might not even be stumbling but they don't love God he was speaking of the Pharisees when he said that in Matthew 23. You see, the danger of practicing righteousness, the way the Pharisees practiced righteousness, is that they were able to produce some righteous-looking behaviors without life. They prayed, they gave, they read the Bible, they memorized the Bible, they went to the equivalent of what we would call church. Indeed, they did all of that more than most. And when I realized that, and I also realized that Jesus is confronting people like that, I get confused because all those things I just mentioned are really good things. Indeed, there are things that people born of God will surely do. People born of God will surely pray, will surely give, be interested in and desiring the word of God and desiring the community of faith. But some people who are doing those things don't have any life. So how do I sort all that out? How can I tell? How do I discern? Well, that leads to the third thing I want you to know about practicing righteousness. I want you to know the look of it. I want you to be able to discern. And this is just one, what a gift John's giving us, because this is a way to tell. You know what practicing righteousness looks like? Practicing righteousness, the way you can tell you're really doing it, is that it looks like love. Verse 11. This is the message you've heard from the beginning. I'm not telling you a new thing, that we should love one another. Verse 23, and this is the commandment, that we believe in the name of his son Jesus Christ and that we love one another just as he commanded us. And just in case you're still confused, John says in verse 12, I want you to love each other, love one another, not as Cain who killed his brother. Now, I don't know about you, but when I first read that verse, Not as Cain. Love each other, not as Cain. I went, well, duh. You know, hello. I kind of figured that out, that Cain wasn't exactly the greatest example of love. John, as you know, we've been in this for a while, really speaks in contrasting ways. To try to make a point and paint a picture. What he's saying here is obviously that the antithesis of loving your brother is killing your brother. But I want you to know and notice, because these are verses I didn't read in the introduction, But even when he is talking about this contrast, John, even when he's talking about murder and hatred, he moves to the heart of it. Just like when he was talking about love, he moves to the heart of it. Now when he's talking about hatred, he wants it to move to the heart of it and the motive for it. Cain murdered his brother. Here's why. Because of jealousy, verse 12. Verse 15, he speaks of hatred. Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer. So far I'm listening to this and I may be thinking, well, I've never murdered anybody and I really don't hate anybody, so I'm still pretty clear here. And that's why in verse 17, John says, or just simply closes their heart to people, apathetic indifference. This is somebody who doesn't hate anybody. They just don't care about anybody. By the way, when I read this and I saw what John was doing, it just kind of makes a smile come to my face because I'm wondering, where did he get that? Well, where do you think he got that? Who did John spend an awful lot of time with? On whose breast did he lean his head? Jesus. He's just saying what Jesus said. He's just saying what he heard Jesus say. John, or Matthew chapter 5, verse 21. Jesus said the same kind of thing. These exact words. You've heard that the ancients were told, don't commit murder. And anyone who does commit murder shall be liable to the court. And everybody listening says, yeah, it's terrible. All those murders, I've never committed murder. Feeling pretty good about me. And then Jesus, like John, moved deeper. I want to talk about not just murder and how you feel good because you don't commit murder. I want to talk about where murder comes from. And he spoke to them about anger and contempt and withering ridicule and calling people fool. But in speaking of those things, past murder to anger, contempt, and withering ridicule, what we need to understand is that Jesus was not simply telling them that they needed to avoid those behaviors. or avoid like certain words. Don't ever say fool, but you can maybe say another word that is full of withering contempt. No. He was telling them that they needed to become different kinds of people on the inside, where the heart is, where the motives are. See, it wouldn't be enough to simply quit saying the word fool. And some legalists clearly would hear a teaching by Jesus, don't call anybody fool. And they say, okay, I'll scratch that word off. Can I call him a jerk? How about idiot? missing entirely the point. No. They needed to become the kind of people, back to John's focus on jealousy and hatred and opening their heart. You know, you see this one verse in here about you need to, you see somebody who has the world's goods and you close your heart. The issue there is to keep your heart open and somebody here would just go, I guess I have to meet everybody in the world's needs. No, you have to keep your heart open. you need to become a different kind of person you need to become the kind of person who is not driven by jealousy and dominated by hate and concerned only for yourself so that your heart closes to other people because you're so absorbed with yourself why is it important? here's why because this is the message we've heard from the beginning that we're called to love each other well what does love look like? it doesn't look like Cain it doesn't look like that and it doesn't look like loving acts from time to time but still you're filled with jealousy here's what it looks like it looks like God who laid down his life for us that's what it looks like Cain took Abel's life Cain was a taker Christ gave his life Christ was a lover I have another picture it's a picture of the kind of love that's spoken of in verse 16 when it says Christ laid down his life it's a picture that makes this real to me I picture Jesus coming to the cross I'm appreciative and we're supposed to have that same so I'm supposed to be willing to go to the cross or die for you I get it but I don't get it I get it but I don't here's the picture I got sticking with this metaphor of parent and child that John is here using a picture of family at a lake and I want you to do the same thing and in this picture I want you to be the parent even if you're a kid here today I want you to, in this picture of being at the lake, I want you to be the dad, I want you to be the mom in this picture. We're having a wonderful time. It's July 4th. The weather is wonderful. The food is good when in horror you realize that the object of your love, your son, your little daughter, has disappeared in the water. What do you do at a time like this? I mean, do you go searching for your parenting rule book that tells you how to respond at a time like this? I'm not sure what to do, but page 34, section 5, paragraph 2 says, if your child disappears in the water, go in after them. And so I will. I am obedient. I'm doing the thing I'm supposed to. I don't think so. You've got a different instinct. You wouldn't need a rule book here because there's something inside of you instinctively. You've become the kind of person, because you're now a parent, that instinctively does this kind of thing. You see, every instinct you have when your child goes into the water will be engaged. It will engage every muscle in your body to hurl yourself into the water to seek and save this child who is lost. It's instinctive. It's not because there's a rule to do it. Beloved, the love of God for us is not just the right behavior for God. I don't want to be sacrilegious in terms of how I'm kind of framing God here. But God does not look in his God behavior book and go, I'm supposed to love them, so I will. It's born out of who he is. God is what? God is love. It's born out of who he is. The kind of God, as it were, that he is. So that when he saw his creation drowning in sin, he did not stand or sit even on his throne in heaven and love us in word only. He saw his creation drowning in sin and he did not stand on the shore of the July 4th picnic and say, boy, I love my child. Gonna miss him. No, he does not love in word. He loved in deed. And the God of the universe, what a picture. the God of the universe on his throne, seeing his creation, his children drowning in sin, instinctively, because it's who he is, dove, left his throne, dove from his heaven into the waters of death, seeking to save those who are lost. Beloved, this call to love is not just about learning to do some loving things. Pharisees could do loving acts from time to time, especially if someone would notice them. it's not about that anybody can do a loving act from time to time the call here is about becoming a different kind of person a loving person who instinctively does loving things who consistently lives with an open heart well the million dollar question out of all of this is how do you become that kind of person how do we develop these kinds of instincts well that's answered by the fourth element involved in practicing righteousness see the way of righteousness is to abide. Chapter 2, verse 28, and now little children abide in him. Chapter 3, verse 6, no one who abides in him sins. Chapter 3, verse 24, the one who keeps his commandments abides in him. And what are his commandments? Just two. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and love one another. How do you do that? Abide in him. How do you do that? Try hard to love? Well, no. Abide in him. And as you abide in him, out of that will come a change in you to love. What does it mean to abide? Well, I defined it for you a couple weeks ago. What it literally means is simply to remain, just to remain in him, to remain in us. Creates some nice imagery for me. It's helpful. It means to follow him, to participate with him in the doing of your life. How do you do that? How do you remain in him? Well, actually, there are a lot of tools for this that are very practical. All the disciplines for the spiritual life are designed for this purpose. Worship is one of the things that helps us abide in him. In fact, as we were worshiping today, some of you, and not intentionally, but maybe by neglect, kind of wandered away. And as we worshiped and entered into the presence of God, you wouldn't have used this word, but you found yourself abiding in him. You were just kind of in him again. And your heart was changing. Prayer is one of those things. Study of the word of God is one of those things. Solitude and silence is one of those things that helps us kind of push out the noise of the world and help us center again on the seed of God that's in us. All of those things are designed to help me and to help you continually practice the presence of God. In other words, to abide. And as I abide in him and as you do the same, he doesn't just tell us the behaviors he expects of us. He changes us. That's the good news. changes us so we can do the behaviors he expects of us that's transformation several months ago Dallas Willard was with us in our church did a Sunday and also a series of teaching during the week as well among the things he did he gave us a definition of prayer that just captured my imagination and I think yours too in fact I mentioned it I think the week after that or a couple weeks after that the definition was this that prayer is simply talking to God about what we're doing together prayer is simply inviting God on a daily basis on a continually all day long basis inviting God into everything I'm doing so if I'm running exercising I'm inviting God into my workout if I'm working I'm inviting God into my work if I'm relating to people going to a meeting talking to my wife I'm inviting God God be in me and moving and help me be conscious of you as I'm talking to this person or even dealing with this conflict. It's inviting God into everywhere I'm going, whatever it is I'm thinking or feeling, even if what I'm feeling right now is not a particularly good thing. Maybe I'm really angry right now, really frustrated right now, and the last thing I want to do is talk to God, but it's inviting God even into my anger or whatever it is I'm feeling right now. A lot of that simple definition of prayer, I began to pray this simple prayer, and it was almost kind of like this experiment. I'm going to just try this, and then I'm going to see, not only I'm going to pray the prayer, but I want to, I want to kind of, God help me bring this to my mind, but I want to kind of pray it all day long. I just want to pray it all day long. Lord be in my hands and in my working. I write a lot, so Lord be in my hands and in my writing. It's a simple prayer. You just kind of cover your whole body. Lord be in my feet and in my walking. Lord be in my feet and in my running. I don't know if you care about my running, but do that anyway. Lord be in my mind and in my thinking. Lord, be in my eyes and in my seeing, in my ears and in my hearing. And when I say that, I wasn't saying, God, don'T help me look at anything bad or hear anything bad. No, I don't want to see or hear anything bad. It was bigger than that. God%, there are things about your kingdom life that I don't understand and I don't see and things in your word that just don't make sense to me at times. Lord, be in my eyes and help me see what don't see. Help me hear what I don't hear. I'm going To pray it all day long. I'm going to pray that all day long. I'm going to, God, help me see. And you know what? I'm looking at you. Help me see people. Help me see people the way you see people because I don't see people the way you see people. Help me see what I don't see. They're incredible worth to you. Partner with me as I do my day. I got a dreaded meeting at 4 o'clock. Be in that meeting with me. Be in my heart and in my desiring. Be in my heart and in my loving. You know what I found? I found that it was really hard to ask honestly, to ask God to be in my feet and in there walking and walk in places that didn't honor him. It's really, you know, now I'm beginning to understand the verse that you can't abide in him and sin. It's really hard for me to invite God be in my mind, be in my mind and in my thinking and then to just get lost and Lord be in my hands and in my working of the computer and then log into some pornography. It's really, really difficult to invite God into where your hands go and log on to that. as I even say that I realize that some of you may be struggling horribly with those kinds of things be in my feet and in there walking as I walk into a pornography store you know it's really hard to invite God into where my feet go and walk into a place like that what do you say it's so simple just say that prayer and your feet will not be able to go there no I'm saying I'm saying that if you do invite God into where your hands go and where your feet go it might make you incredibly aware that you desperately need some help for your feet not to go there. But it is very, very hard to authentically invite God into the movings of your life and continue to move in those directions as well. So you continually invite God into helping you see better and you're going to start seeing better. Help me hear what I don't hear. You're going to start hearing better. Help me walk and you're going to start walking straighter. Lord be in my heart and in my loving and you're going to start loving better you know one of the things that Dallas left with us was this prayer we're going to put it up on the screen and I'm just going to read right through it in fact it was this prayer that kind of I couldn't remember this whole prayer and so I just made it simple for me my hands my eyes my ears my mind my heart my feet but it all came from this prayer I just want to read it and let the spirit of God do what he will in your hearts hallowed be thy name in industry god be in my hands and in my making holy holy holy lord god of hosts heaven and earth are full of thy glory hallowed be thy name in the arts god be in my sense and in my creating holy holy holy lord god of hosts heaven and earth are full of thy glory hallowed be thy name in commerce god be at my desk and in my trading holy holy holy Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of Thy glory, hallowed be Thy name in government, in all administration. God, be in my plans and in my deciding. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of Thy glory. Hallowed be Thy name in education. God, be in my mind and in my growing. Holy, holy, holy Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of Thy glory. Hallowed be Thy name in my home. God be in my heart and in my loving. Verse 6. No one who continually practices abiding, no one who is continually inviting God into every aspect of their life continually practices sin. You just can't do both at the same time. You just can't do it. So what does it mean to practice righteousness? well we've talked about the heart of it the danger of it the look of it the way of it finally the benefit of it you know what the benefit of practicing righteousness is assurance verse 19 we shall know by this that we are of the truth and shall assure our heart before him i love that the word assure patho means to tranquilize to calm to settle you down you know what settles me down? Abiding with the Father, inviting him into every aspect of my life. You know what settles me down? Walking in love, practicing righteousness like a child who just wants to be like his dad. Stumbling, sure. Not keeping up sometimes, yep. But what lets me know that I'm a child of his is that this is what I want, like a child who wants to be like his dad. See, I may not know a lot, and you may not know a lot, but I know this, and I hope you know this. Here's what I know. I know that I am born of God, and I know that my life is hidden with God in Christ, and he will never let me go. Because one of the, and it's not because I signed a card when I was seven. One of the ways I know is because even though I stumble here and there, I know I want to be like him. I know that. The heart or motivation for practicing righteousness is the heart of the child. The danger of practicing righteousness is that it becomes Pharisaic legalism. The look of practicing righteousness is love. The way of practicing righteousness is abiding. In other words, inviting him into our hands and our feet and our eyes and our ears, every aspect of our life. And the benefit of living this way is confidence that we belong to him. That he hears us and that he knows us. What a way to live. It's called kingdom life. Let's pray. Let's stand and be dismissed in prayer. Father, we thank you for your word. We thank you for the pictures. Oh, God, the pictures that are so simple of children and parents and love and desire. It's all about relationship and walking with you and inviting you in and partnering. And out of that comes transformation and authentic holiness. Continue, Father, to ignite and grow these things among us in Jesus' name. And all God's people said, Amen. Amen.
