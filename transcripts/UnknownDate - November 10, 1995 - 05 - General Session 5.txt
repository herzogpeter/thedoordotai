My topic is church discipline and spiritual abuse. Whenever I speak on the topic of spiritual abuse, do conferences or whatever, and there's a question and answer time, I can be pretty much assured that someone will ask one of two, on the face of a fairly difficult question. The first is, usually asked by an insecure Christian leader, and it goes something like this, If Christian leadership is to be really concerned about being gracious and non-abusive, and we are not to apply social pressure to people to get them to cooperate with us, then how can we get anything done? I mean, how can we be strong leaders and at the same time be really concerned that people are not violated and that everything is completely and totally voluntary? Anyway, it goes something like that. How can you be a visionary, strong leader, and then at the same time be a do-it guy and get it done? How can we be gracious and yet fulfill our mandate? My answer to that question is in the book Healing Spiritual Abuse, so I'll just direct you in that direction. The second question that I get asked repeatedly is if church leadership is to be judiciously non-abusive, as we have defined it here, and as we've been listening to Jeff and Dave, then we have a pretty clear idea of what spiritual abuse is and isn't. And if we're supposed to judiciously avoid it, how do we reconcile church discipline with this concern to be non-forcing? I mean, after all, church discipline involves some standards. Showing X-rated relief for the teenage boys in the church by a leader is a standard that, in this case, as we saw earlier, was violated. So doesn't church discipline involve at least somebody making a judgment on someone else? And doesn't this imply coercion? So, how can Jesus condemn the standards of the Pharisees and the religious tradition found in Matthew 23, when at the same time, standards and judgment are inherent in his teaching in Matthew 18? So the problem is just so much the difference or the apparent conflict in the church practice. The real part of the conflict is in the fact that in the same gospel, Jesus seems to be heading in two different directions. Now, in responding to this question over the next half hour, we'll get us to the heart of the historical conflict between law and grace in the past 2,000 years of church history. It will flesh out exactly how we define Christian community as a top-down or an egalitarian fellowship. And if we do it right, we will also sharpen our focus on what the gospel actually is. I was asked to tackle this thankless task, partly because I'm a soft touch, and partly because I wrote a book on church discipline, which is available out there, by the way, as well as a book on spiritual views. So the thought that I might actually have something to say about combining these two subjects was a fairly obvious conclusion to draw. So I'm hoisted on my own patard, as it were. I wouldn't certainly choose this topic. I am somewhat anxious about it. I'm not concerned about making sense of the biblical material. I'm not concerned about harmonizing Jesus' teaching in Matthew 23 with Jesus' teaching in Matthew 18. I understand it as being self-consistent. My concern arises from the fact that our thinking on these two subjects has been so skewed and over the years has given us a lot of confusion. I have a feeling, a very strong sense, that when I get done defining what real church discipline is according to Jesus in the Magna Carta, the church is from Matthew 18. But once I get done doing that, you're going to think, gosh, I didn't know that. That's not bad. I've never seen it that way. I've never thought of it that way. But I hope that if you look at the actual words of the text, you'll also say, oh, yeah, there it is. It's there all the time. Someone asked, how are you going to try to uphold the idea of non-coercive church leadership with the idea of encouraging every congregation to be judicious about practicing church discipline? How are you going to combine these two? I answered the same way porcupines can grow up very carefully. So now that we have in our minds and in the way we kind of feel through the dramas and the presentations that we've seen, we have some idea of what spiritual abuse is. Many of us were up to speed on that even before we came. But now it's much clearer. I think now all I have to do is to say what Jesus actually said and our problem is solved. But before I do that, I need to take seriously the fact that there are many people here, I've already talked to some of you, there are many people here who have been emotionally punished and spiritually manipulated under the heading of biblical church discipline. So if we want to establish sensitive, pastorally responsible discipline, we have to first understand what has gone wrong in the past. That is to say, we first have to pull out some weeds before we can plant the good seed of the Word of God. Years ago, I did a comprehensive study of the theory and practice of church discipline over the past 2,000 years. I did a master's thesis on it, which then formed the foundation for the book Church Discipline and Heal. And I read everything that several theological libraries had on the subject of church discipline. And in this comprehensive study, I discovered that what passed the church discipline was usually an instrument of spiritual abuse. Church discipline was an instrument, was one of the ways that the leadership of churches and denominations and parachurch groups abused, controlled, and manipulated the people under them. Which, incidentally, is why church discipline has fallen out of favor, by and large. You don't see it much, certainly in mainstream churches. You don't see church discipline happening much. It's not that it's not important. It's very important. It's not biblical. It's very biblical. But it is that it was so painful, so often, that everybody just kind of decided, let's just not do it anymore. Let's just find some other way. Let's just find some other way of doing church, which has ushered in a perversion at the other end. Here we've got spiritual abuse at one end, heavy hand and manipulative spiritual abuse at the other end. And then, way over here, you've got the doctrine of it's nice to be nice, which is the creed, which is more authoritative than the Bible in many churches. When I looked more closely to discover in this huge body of work that the history of church discipline for the past few thousand years, when I looked at this body of literature, I discovered that discipline was used as a means of coercion and a means of control and a means of repression, not just because church leaders are bad, although they often are, but because of a misreading, or at least an incomplete reading of the New Testament text regarding discipline. Traditionally, the primary motive for church discipline was to cleanse the church, to cleanse the church of impurities, you know, the pure, spotless bride and all that kind of stuff. To make the church secure was the motive, this is very important, this is Roman numeral number one in your thinking. Church discipline was used to cleanse the church and to purify it and the institutes of the Christian religion. John Calvin spoke for many before and since when he stated, The purpose of church discipline is so that, and I quote, Those who lead filthy lives should not be called Christians and profane the Lord's Supper. Notice the concern for purity. They must not profane the Lord's Supper, which means that there's something that people do. There's a performance. There's something that they act out that makes the church impure. Nothing is said about what's in people's hearts. The Pharisees would have been entirely pure, and yet Jesus called them white-washed supplicers and snakes. But so if they leave filthy lives, if there's bad social behavior, they should not be called Christians. They should be booted out of the church and not proclaim the Lord's Supper. And that the good people in the church not be corrupted by the bad. This idea that evil is catching and it can overcome good. And so we need to get evil out because it's more powerful than good. So evil is stronger than good is part of the theory here that is in back of it, which is understood. It would have just been axiomatic. Nobody questioned it. One rotten apple swirls the whole barrel, et cetera, et cetera. And the second concern is that in order to protect the good people, the bad people have to be picked up. Now, if you've read the New Testament, you know that neither Jesus nor Paul, and I could cite several other New Testament fighters to the same effect, neither Jesus nor Paul lost a whole lot of sleep over moral impurity in the church. That was not their primary concern. It's not that they were totally insensitive to the issue. It's just that it wasn't the sort of thing that kept them awake at night. But because rooting out dirt has traditionally been the preoccupation of the church, The practice of church discipline has been used for the purifying process. Now that ought to tell you a lot right there. Because the motive for doing something determines not only what happens, but how you do it. It's easy to see then how church discipline usually was abusive. If your only concern is to keep the body clean, then once the leaders define what is unclean, once they define impurity, then any means to get the evil out is right. If there's any resistance to getting the evil out, if the person will not cooperate, repent, or do whatever, jump through whatever hook is required, then everything from criticism to exclusion to shunning, even in the case of the Inquisition, being burned at the stake, being burned at the stake was a form of church discipline, was the final stage. So, and needless to say, it was a form of abuse. So with the purpose of church discipline too narrowly defined as a means of church purification, we can see why it has traditionally been abusive. Again, if your only concern is to get the evil out, then you can treat people any way you want, because people aren't the problem. the evil behavior is a problem. So whatever it takes to stop the evil behavior or the bad theology, even if it requires torture or burning of the state, then that's what we'll do. John Calvin authorized the torture of heretics under this rubric. Now, in my research, the question was, if church discipline habitually proves to be hurtful, by and large at least, And that is why the church gave it up. Why was Jesus so insistent that we institute and practice church discipline? So the task became, turn to Matthew 18 and see what Jesus actually said, and see, see if Jesus instituted something that inevitably turned out to be abusive, or the other possibility that the church has missed his point for the past 2,000 years. Guess which one is the case? Historically, discipline is a top-down function. And as it turns out, according to Matthew 18, discipline is to be a paternal form of pastoral church. Now, I would be skeptical about anybody who says, you know, I saw something that the church has missed in 2000 years. I'd be skeptical about anybody who says that. But that is what I'm saying. And so you can go ahead and be skeptical about it. But I want to, if you accept what I've said up until now, I want to simply read to you Matthew 18, 15 and following. And just make some logical observations and I think that you will follow. So let me first of all read it to you. Matthew 18, starting in verse number 15. If your brother sins, go and show him his fault. We could obviously say today, if your brother or sister sins, go show him or her his or her fault. But that's obviously awkward, so we won't. If your brother sins, go and show him his fault. Just between the two of you. If he listens to you, then you have won your brother. I have to underline. You have won your brother. But if he will not listen to you, take it to two or three others, and have them go along so that every matter can be established in the testimony of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. If he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector. I tell you the truth. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Again, I tell you that if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven. For where two or three come together in my name for the purpose of church discipline, there I am in the midst. Again, historically, church discipline has been a top-down affair. Where the leadership looks down and decides what needs to get out for the sake of the purity of the church, and then goes about doing that by whatever confrontation, review, coercion, and finally even execution, whatever it takes to get it out. Now notice what Jesus says. First of all, folks, church discipline, and this will solve almost everybody's problem right here, church discipline is the responsibility of the leadership. Church discipline is not the responsibility or the prerogative or the right or the necessity of the church leadership exclusively. Church discipline is paternal. Who initiates the first step in church discipline? The one who sees the sin. The one who sees the sin. Whether it's a 12-year-old girl or a 65-year-old pastor, it doesn't matter. Whoever sees it is the person who makes the first confrontation in private. So discipline can be pastor to people, but more likely, or just as likely, it can be people to pastor. Discipline occurs not from superiors to inferiors. Like I said, this one insight will solve almost everybody's problem. It does not come from superiors to inferiors unless the superiors or the people that we were defining as that just happen to spot it, which is unlikely. It is much more likely, since there's many more followers than there are leaders, it's much more likely that church discipline would be instituted, would be begun, the process would be begun, would be begun by a follower. It is paternal, not administrative. And I didn't want to answer the lady in red during the panel discussion because everybody else was giving a good answer, but let me ask you a question now. What do you do to confront spiritual abuse? is it a sin? if it's a sin, you go to the person in private that's your first attempt so contrary to what may appear to be good advice you don't talk to all your friends and decide whether you're right or not and then go to the person with your friends you do not get a power base before you make the approach you make the approach privately at the same time, you do not allow the other person to have his or her support group there either. You know, there are times when even this, see, this isn't a law, this is just how it works. This is not a rule that you have to pass. This is just how it works. If you want to confront evil, if you want to confront sin, this is how you do it. You go privately, and you go just between the two of you. And if the issue happens to be spiritual abuse, then it's a sin. It's no different. There's no difference in lying, stealing, whatever. Whatever it is, you go and you talk to them. And you try to resolve it privately. And you do this to avoid escalating the thing so that the church gets involved and people, of course, who take sides and a church split or something is inevitable. You do it just between the two of you. And if it's done right and at the best of all possible things happen at the very beginning, There's only two people that ever know about it. That ever know about it. Punishment is not the goal. Punishing the evildoer is not the goal. Let me just stop right there and give you a personal story. In a church that I was at some years ago, just in the course of preaching through Matthew, I preached this Matthew 18, and one of the guys in the church took it to heart. And he was walking to church one day right past my office. So I had an office at a bookstore, And then there was a window into my office. I would sit in the office and see what was going on in the bookstore. And there was a woman who came from a television station to do a report on our work. We were doing street work, the street gig at the time. And she wanted to bring her cameras in, and we were negotiating it. Well, she was just a knockout beauty. She was really pretty. And you could see it from half a block away from where my friend was standing. So he walks right past my office in the morning to go to church, and he sees this woman in me across my desk. Our face is fairly close together, talking sort of intently because she wanted to do some things with her family that I didn't want her to do. So we were talking really intently, and we were sort of a stalemate. And he's coming home, and she decides to come back, just coincidentally. She decides to come back to try to talk me into letting her do what she wanted to do, and there she is again. So this guy goes to work watching me alone in my office, although the window's out to the street, with this beautiful woman. And then he comes back, and she's still there, as far as he knows, right? So he decides that maybe, it looked bad anyway to him, maybe I was into some kind of sin. So he came and talked to me about it. Well, I was eager to explain what went on. But my opinion of him skyrocketed. That he would confront me about that. I didn't even take any notice of him before. But he was my man after he did that. That just encouraged me. And I thought, my gosh, is it possible that I'm in a church where if I do something wrong, I'm the first to find out about it? Wouldn't that be great? And wouldn't that create a wonderful atmosphere that if you're doing something wrong and you're absurd, you're the first one to get the report about your behavior? Okay, now what is the goal of church discipline? If it's not punishment, what is it? It's to win your brother. Another big insight. To win your brother or to win your sister. The goal of church discipline is not first to purify the church. But you know something? The church gets purified as a consequence. The church gets purified as an inevitable result. But that's not the motive. That's not the purpose. The purpose is to win your brother or your sister. Because your brother or sister has been lost to you, because sin, this is deep theology, folks, sin violates relationship. This is where the church has gotten the whole thing wrong for 2,000 years. Another thing that they've gotten wrong for 2,000 years, which is in the process of being corrected. Bad behavior was seen as a violation of the law, God's law. Folks, read the New Testament. Sin is a violation of a relationship. Not some Ten Commandments as important as helpful they are and as good as they are in training up your children and getting society to act right. But that isn't the problem. The problem isn't that you have broken God's law. The problem is that sin violates a relationship with a holy God. And if you are identified with that holy God, then people's sins violate your relationship with the person who's doing it. Now notice, he doesn't say, go and tell the person their fault so that they can become your brother again. No! They don't stop being your brother because they sin. Sin doesn't break fellowship with God. Sin doesn't break the brother-brother-brother-sister relationship in the church. what it does is put strain on the relationship. Our fellowship is with God and His Christ and it is in the light, according to John. I don't have this sort of relationship with God over here to decide and I treat the people any way I want. No, our relationship is one. If you don't love your brother, how can you say that you love God? These are not verses that are to be used for coercion, although they often have been, these are verses that are used to snap us out of denial and let us know what reality is. And that is when we violate, when we sin, we violate relationship. We put stress and strain. We are lost to our brother or sister. So you confront them about their behavior, not because behavior makes you okay with God, because it doesn't. Jesus makes you okay with God. Your behavior is irrelevant to the question of whether you're okay with God or whether you're a brother or sister. Jesus' performance determines that. Your day-to-day sin determines the quality of life that you live in the body of Christ. Just like it determines the quality of life you live anywhere else. You commit sexual sin, you're no less a Christian. Understand that. You're no less loved. God doesn't like you or love you any less or any more because of your behavior, no matter what it is. But you bring home gonorrhea or AIDS, and it's going to seriously affect the quality of your life. And it will have repercussions on your relationships. You understand? And so what church discipline is, is not to decide who's in and out of the kingdom of God. Jesus has already decided that. And by faith, you participate in that, or you don't. Your behavior is on the side. But our behavior determines the quality of our life, and discipline is to confront people with their behavior in a responsible, caring way. But how do you do it? You don't do it to purify them. You do it to win your brother. Let me illustrate this. For Paul, when he's talking to the Corinthians, and he talks about men going to prostitutes, what a perfect time, and he corrects their behavior. Paul has standards, he corrects their behavior. But notice how he does it. He doesn't say, which is exactly what you'd expect, it's a perfect opportunity to whip out the Ten Commandments and say, thou shalt not commit adultery. Perfect chance to use that law. Open and shut, God said it, don't do it. He doesn't even breathe a hint of the law. He doesn't bring the law into the discussion because the law is irrelevant to this discussion. You know why? Because everything in Christ is removed to a much higher level. What does he say? He says, you can't take your body and unite it to a prostitute because how can you unite Christ to a prostitute? You are in relationship with Christ. You are one with him. How can you take that and violate that by uniting it to a prostitute? You have to understand. and this rips, I mean this rips 90% of spiritual abuse, these weapons right out of their hands. The law is now irrelevant as to whether you're okay or not. The law is now irrelevant as to whether you're okay with God or not. You can't hold some standard over somebody and say, you know, God will, you know, if you really want to, if you want to really be part of God's end times army or qualify for his highest purposes, then there's some things you don't have to do. You laugh, and you laugh and you do it. It's so stupid. It has nothing to do with anything. However, it is quite true that your behavior has everything to do with the quality of your life. My question would be, don't you want a life? And if you do, you want to be in a church that takes serious hate for a visit. If you want the quality of your life to be improved, and you want to be a part in a loving way of improving the quality of other people's lives. And I believe that all these years, the future's life, we miss this. Church discipline was brought to bear because of some object. It couldn't just be my opinion. It couldn't be what I feel. It couldn't be something abstract. No, the law has been violated. Now I have the means and the permission to go after something. But since the relationship between Christ and his people, and between Christ's people and each other, since this was not the number one agenda, That means that people can be treated any way you want. And that is why church discipline has been, by and large, an instrument of use, and that is why it has largely gone out of style. On the other hand, if when you get done with the discipline process, you want a good, close, intimate relationship with the person that you've gone to, then you're going to be very careful how you transact them. You're going to be very careful how you approach them. You're going to be careful, and you're going to be gracious. You're going to be courageous. You're going to want to do the truth. But you will treat them as if a relationship with them at the end of this process is what really matters. If he listens to you, you have won your brother. Now, when you go and make the first approach, generally, there's lots of things that can happen, but I'm going to break them down into one of three categories. You go to the person, like my friend, who saw me alone in my office with a beautiful woman in very intense conversation. He goes to me and confronts me with what he thinks looks really fishy. And I say, oh, no, no, no, Kevin. I can understand why you thought that. But here's exactly what was going on. And he said, won the relationship. He was nervous about it. But now, we've won the relationship because I talked about it. I told them nothing, it looked bad, but nothing was good. See, this is why you don't want it to become a big explosive thing in the church. You don't want it to become a church-wide issue because what if nothing's wrong? There's always that chance that nothing's wrong. And if you do it privately, then no possibility. What happened for us is that he liked me better because he found the freedom to confront me. He found that I wasn't offended but actually liked him for having the courage to speak into my life about something that might have been a real question. He risked a relationship with me, and what he got was a much better relationship with me. So much so that ten years later, I'm still telling the story. That's how much it impressed me. Now wouldn't it be great if you lived in a church where that was going on just naturally? Everybody was real desensitized. They weren't worried about defending or looking good or anything else because if anything was going wrong, somebody else was going to come and tell you. You wouldn't even have to wonder about what you're doing and how it looks and everything because somebody's going to get up beside you if you're doing anything that's suspicious and they're just going to whisper it in your ear. And so you have somebody else right and hurt on your life. You don't have to be so erotic and preoccupied and narcissistic. You could be always looking at your own life. Wouldn't that be great? Wouldn't that be great freedom if you actually had communities like that? This is what, this is the community that Jesus had in mind. One of three things happens. You go, and it's confused. No, no, it really wasn't sin. The second thing that could happen is you go, and it really was sin. It really was sin. And you repent. Then, also, you've won your brother, and nobody else knows about it except you and him. And you're watching for her, and their behavior changes, and everything's fine. The third thing that is much less likely to happen than the first two, it does happen, much less likely to happen than the first two, is you're not talked out of it, and he doesn't or she doesn't, you can. Then, you don't just throw up your hands or have an impasse or whatever, and I know that this is very difficult in some churches the way they're set up it's very difficult to confront the pastor and then get two or three people to go with you but that is what it is that is what you deserve and let me just tell you something that we need to put psychology and what we know about human reactions and the laws of human nature on the back burner when it starts with the clear teaching of scripture I want everybody to just say that psychology. I've learned a lot from it. My closest friends happen to be psychologists. And so I have a high regard for it. But I want to say that when we talk about protecting the things and all this kind of stuff, when it just violates the scripture, I think we better go with scripture. I'll tell you partly why. It's at the end of this section. Jesus says, where two or three are gathered in my name. To do church ministry, there I am in their midst. I have gone in fear and trembling to the closest thing to a pope I know and confronted him, got right up in his face, and said, You are wrong. And something miraculous happened that I didn't ever expect to happen because Christ was with me. It was a, knowing this guy's psychology, dumb move. Knowing my vulnerability and what could happen to me if I didn't win the day, dumb move. Knowing the fact that I had a tremendous amount of respect for this man and that his rejection would have caused me emotional trauma. Dumb move. Any psychologist's workist or herself could have and should have talked me out of it, but I decided to just do the Bible. And something miraculous happened because Christ honored his word when it was done. And so, as tough as it is, even if it involves a spiritual abuser, Take two or three others and just say, gee, this is dangerous. This is really risky. We could really be slapped around for this. But this is what the Bible says. Let's just see if God is going to be with us if we need to be sleep to obey. Go and do it. And then if those two or three, but what's the point? To punish them? No. The point is to get them to change their behavior. Get them to win his heart. To win back the relationship. The sin, whether it's spiritual abuse or pornography, doesn't matter. Whatever it is, it's violated the relationship. And we go to win that relationship. And in the semi-private group, the small group, we're still keeping it. It's very likely to get out. But we're still keeping it semi-private. And the possibility of it getting to be a big issue out there is alleviated. Again, I'm not talking about the path that is fired and there's rumors that it's because of sexual indistruction but nobody ever talks about it? No. That's a public thing that happened and a public disclosure is needed. But if it can be done semi-privately, if it's the kind of thing that can be done semi-privately, then it ought to be done semi-privately. And again, the purpose is not punishment to get, but to get the person back in relationship. And again, purity occurs as a byproduct of a relationship renewed. Think about it this way. In our relationship to Christ, Paul says, now the law is of no effect. Now we've just lost over that for all these years. But what he's saying is that the law is not to guide our relationship to God anymore. The relationship is to guide the relationship. Let me put it this way. I'm married. I have eight kids. I'll be happy to show you pictures. My wife and I have been married almost a quarter of a century, and I love my wife. I've never even come close to cheating on her, although I really do like women. I've never come close to cheating on her. And at this point, it would be offensive and even worse than that, totally irrelevant, for somebody to come up to me and say, Ken, the Word of God says to you, you shall not commit adultery. I just want you to have that law before you all the time because you are a married man. And I say, first of all, sure, that's true. But it is a primitive level of truth. And I'll guarantee you that if I had nothing other than a law to keep me faithful to my wife, I would have never been faithful to my wife. It's not that the law isn't very effective in restraining behavior. It's that it's useless in restraining behavior. Paul says in Colossians, Why are you doing all this rules and regulations and all that kind of stuff? Don't you know that while it looks good, it looks pious, the law is absolutely useless in restraining bad behavior. My faithfulness, my not committing adultery, is simply a byproduct of my love and respect and esteem for my wife, and that I won't allow anything to violate that relationship. Period. And just as a byproduct, I don't commit adultery. Do you all follow that? Now, if my relationship with you is of vital importance, then the rules and regulations aren't important. It's the relationship that matters. And that's what I want to win. And that happens at every level of church discipline. That's the motive. If you had gotten that 2,000 years ago, church discipline would be healthy, worked out, and largely practiced. because it is so efficacious, so helpful, so powerful in building community. But if the second approach, and it doesn't have to be the second approach, you can go back to it if you can. That's the reason. But if the second, third, or fourth, semi-private approach doesn't work, If it doesn't work, then you take it to the church. Again, the lights should go on. Take it to the church, that's right. You don't take it to the leaders, you take it to the church. That is to say that the decision about discipline is not a leader's decision. The church as a body discerns. See, nothing in the church is a top-down affair. Everybody's accountable to everybody else. Everybody makes the final decision. If your brother will not hear you, if he can't talk you out of it, or if you can't convince him to change his heart and change his behavior, then tell it to the church. If he won't listen to the church, then, after he's gone through this whole rigmarole, then the church agrees to treat him as a tax collector and a sinner. And everybody says, now we're getting down to the shunning and kicking the nuts and the rough stuff, right? Wrong. The question I have for you is, how did Jesus treat tax collectors and sinners? He did not disassociate himself from tax collectors and sinners, but he made real clear that they understood that they're not in the kingdom of God. You can go on. I mean, there's lots of traditions, Mennonite and other traditions, that are big on Jehovah's Witnesses. There's lots of groups, Christian and Christian cult groups, that practice this wrong, abusive kind of church discipline. And they have this thing called shunning. It's kind of like the person who's there completely rejecting this is not what Jesus said. Treat them like tax collectors and like sinners, that is, go on evangelizing. Do you understand that there's only one message? There's only one message that we tell non-Christians, and it's the same exact message we tell Christians, and that is follow Jesus. There's only one message for tax collectors and sinners and good church people. It's follow Jesus. When we kick them out, we're not abusing them. We're forcing them to face the reality that they themselves have brought about. Very important, very important distinction. We're not kicking them out. is saying you're no longer a part of this fellowship. Socially, you're fine. We'll go out for a drink. We'll talk. But I want you to understand that you cannot consider yourself a part of this body because you have already defined yourself outside of it. We are simply making you face that reality. Your behavior has defined yourself outside of the fellowship of Christ and is followers. You're not following Christ. We have demonstrated that to you. Since you are not following Jesus, don't follow Jesus. In other words, if you're not following him, don't be in denial or under the delusion that you actually are. So we're treating you as if you aren't because you aren't. But I still like you and love you. So church discipline is a confronting of reality. in the most gracious, non-abusive, pastorally responsible way possible. So, we don't have to choose between heavy-handed legalism or it's nice to be nice, don't offend anybody, whatever you do is okay. We don't have to make those terrible choices. A lot of people just assume that those are the choices that we have for now. We don't have to make those terrible choices. And we don't have to take a little bit of one or a little bit of the other. We can simply ignore both and just do scripture. Let me pray for us and then it's time to go to the church. Father, I pray now in the strong name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you would intensify your healing by the revelation of truth in our lives. I pray, Lord, that you would get us to think straight so that our hearts can line up with you and that finally our actions can follow our minds and our hearts. I pray in the strong name of the Lord Jesus Christ that everybody be strengthened and fortified with the word of God and take courage to live a life of authenticity and to take responsibility for our own lives as well. Thank you.
