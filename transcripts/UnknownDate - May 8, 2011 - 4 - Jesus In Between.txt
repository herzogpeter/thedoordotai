My name is Mary Martin Weans, and I'd like to offer a blessing for Mother's Day. What I offer today comes out of what I'm experiencing as a mother, but also as a person. You see, as I listen to my life, which includes the long, arduous experience of infertility and the glorious, maddening upheaval of raising three little boys, I am coming to believe that to mother is not just the privilege of married, fertile women, or just married women, or just fertile women, or even just women. But to mother is the honor and struggle given to all who have the courage to say yes to God. Let me explain. Mothering, among other things, is about becoming. over and over again as I mother I get the chance to welcome the life I have been given say goodbye to who I thought I was and what I thought I needed and engage in the labor of birthing the freer more whole more loving me that God is making but that sounds like being human doesn't it so today if your life is being forever changed in ways that bring both grief and gratitude because of something that has been planted in you, that you have been called to carry and nurture and deliver to the world, then this blessing is for you. So receive this blessing. Despite the risks, you say yes. You open yourself. You receive what God has for you. And what is planted begins to grow. But soon, you see this means sharing the space that once belonged to only you. Love is required of you. That is not the love you are gifted at giving. To make room, you lay aside your preferences, your comforts, your strategies, the necessary excesses you use to prop up your life, and you move toward what you fear. It is not how you thought it would be. You are not who you hoped you'd be. All seems stripped away. But you remain. Expanding, widening, getting larger. You wonder in one breath, can I hold any more? And in another, what is left? Will I stretch until I break? How can I live this way? Can there be any birth without death? but do not be afraid for the cave of your undoing will become for you the very womb of God you will dwell in a place deep within where the mighty tender heart sends nourishment to your every cell and the one who mothers you attends to the renewing of every part In this womb the waters wash you clean You shed every name on which you have hung your worth And behind which you have hidden Lost one Left one Last one First one Best one Only one In their absence you begin to hear the sound of your true name being spoken you exist you are seen you cannot be erased then like Jesus rising from Gethsemane to meet what will come you emerge into the light of God's face breathing and moving scarred and soft with fresh eyes and firm feet for this you were built to bring forth life you were made to stretch and made to mend made to die and live again now no one takes your life from you you lay it down of your own accord you are becoming a space through which love moves because love at all times holds you, remembers you, searches for you, stands with you, gathers you, inhabits you, and delights in you. From this, your courage comes. Amen. If God is breathing life into you, God will birth it out of you. That's my wife. And you will not hear a more substantive message than that today. So I hope it washes over you, and I hope you can receive it in whatever way that you need to. Also, you need to know that we're going to include that blessing written out on the message tool this week. So that will be available to you if you just go online and click on the message tool so that the 900 of you that want it don't have to go ask her right away afterwards. She's graciously agreed to put it on there. So let's pray as we move to the rest of the word. Jesus we declare to you that we need you and we also declare together that you're with us here so we ask you to show up with your manifest presence in a powerful way to meet us in those places that are secret that no one knows about the place in which you are growing something in us meet us there. Amen. Well, around here we are moving through the book of Colossians, the letter to the Colossians. We're taking our time doing it. We're about a year and a half in. We're in chapter 3. So turn in your Bibles to Colossians 3, verse 12. If you don't have your Bibles, you can look up on the screens. If you have a phone or some other device that has a Bible on it, you may feel free to use that. Sometimes people feel guilty, I know. Like, can I really do that, really? I mean, honestly. Yes. Please do it. So Colossians 3, verse 12, let me read it to you. Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, we should have this thing memorized by now, right? I should have this thing memorized by now. Clothe yourselves with compassion, with kindness, with humility, with gentleness and patience. And this is the phrase we've been camped on for some weeks now. Bear with each other and forgive one another. If any of you has a grievance against someone. And forgive as the Lord forgave you. Over all these virtues, put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. And I told you several weeks ago, as I got to that phrase, bear with each other, in the quietness of my own office, my response was no, thank you. I don't want to bear with the person or the people that I'm struggling with. You don't have to bear with someone that you like love being around. You have to bear with someone that's troubling you. Think of that person in your mind. Get their face in your mind. If it's the person next to you, don't do an elbow shove or something like that. Just do a little demure nod. To bear with means to stand up straight into the person that God made you to be and hold the other up. It means to delay punishing that person. Now, maybe the hope in that word is it means to delay. to delay punishing them, to bear with each other, requires something of you that I think, if we're honest, and the reason why I said no to that invitation is because it requires something of you that you're not sure you can give. Bearing with someone that's very difficult requires something of you that you're not sure you can give. And so we've been camped on this phrase that Jesus meets us at the intersection of empty and full with an invitation. And we've looked at three different invitations. The first one was to hold in our hands whatever little bread crumb of faith that you have, as small as it may be, and move toward that thing which is hard, believing that in the moving toward it as we present our gift to God, God will multiply it in our hands. He will multiply our resources in our hands, as we saw in the feeding of the 5,000. And then the second invitation was that we are to sit in the struggle. And remember this picture that we got of the disciples straining at the oars in the middle of a storm, and that Jesus saw them when it was evening, but didn't move out to them until it was morning. And so there they were, struggling, getting pulverized. all night long. So the invitation is to sit in the struggle because the struggle has something to teach you. And then at just the right moment, Jesus really does move in with a word and an action. He moves into your boat with you when you've gone through that struggle. And then the third invitation was this, that each of us needs to let go of that comfortable thing in order to move into what God is calling us to move towards so that we can be fully enlarged, that we can have God moving through us instead of the thing that we have put our comfort in. It's a great picture. At some point, this little one is going to have to let go of his mother's hands and move into life. And we'll have to trust that God will bring him what God needs to bring him. And so the fourth invitation, the one that we're going to camp on today, is simply this. Will you allow Jesus himself to be in between you and the person that you're struggling with? Will you allow Jesus to be in between you and the person that you're struggling with? Now again, I think it's important to get the face in your mind of the person that you're struggling to bear with. and then to envision allowing Jesus to come in between. Now, I know that this sounds very churchy, very ethereal, and it's something that in church you kind of, hmm. But then that's where you get in the car and go, what was he talking about? Right, Jesus in between? I don't even get that. I don't know what that means. So let's talk a little bit about what it looks like to not allow Jesus to be in between because Jesus must be invited in between. We've all had many experiences in relationships where Jesus was not in between us and the person that we were then struggling to bear with. If you think about many marriages, and this really is the autobiographical chapter of the first 10 years of my marriage, where I found it that it was my job to tell my wife in many creative ways how she needed to change. Yeah, that was like some laughs and some... No, I saw it as my job to show her how she needed to change so that I would get what I needed. In that picture, I was trying to get in her instead of revealing Christ in her. I was trying to put myself inside of her and cast my image onto her of what I thought she should be. And we do this. Marriages do this. Friendships do this. I think fathers do this to sons and mothers do it to daughters and vice versa. That we come in between the person and Jesus. and we demand that that person be what we need them to be. And it becomes all about us and all about what we decide. Dietrich Bonhoeffer has an amazing quote about this and it's found in a little book he wrote called Life Together. Stephan talked about Bonhoeffer last week and this comes from one of the books that he referenced. But Bonhoeffer writes this, human love, that is love that exists without Jesus in between, constructs its own image of the other person, of what he is and what he should become. It takes the life of the other person into its own hands. It loves him not as a free person, but as one whom it binds to itself or shackles to itself. it wants to gain, to capture by any means, it uses force, and it desires to be irresistible or to rule. It desires to be irresistible, to rule. Now chances are, on your wedding day if you're married, those were not part of your vows. chances are on the day that you became the best friend with the person that you became the best friend with you didn't look at them lovingly and said i promise to rule you i promise to do all that i can to be irresistible to you so that you'll be shackled to me forever Ha ha ha! But, that was my wife laughing as loudly as anyone else in the room. But if we're honest, we've had relationships that go this way, that end up this way. Maybe many. And when we get to that place where we're then struggling to bear with this person, where we're struggling not to, we're struggling to delay punishing them, and we don't want to stand up straight into who we are and hold them up. We end up praying, and we pray prayers like this, Jesus, I'm struggling with this person. Do something about it, right? Please do something. But what we really mean when we pray that way is, Jesus, please change that person into who I want them to be so that I don't have to struggle with them anymore. Amen? Oh, snap. We would never pray that out loud, that second one. Well, maybe some of us would, apparently. But this is, when we do not have Jesus in between, this is what we end up wanting from God. God, please change them into the image that I've created for them. And please let them see that it really is in their best interest that I control them. Please help them submit to my will so that my will can be done in our relationship. And so, when Jesus is not between, we seek to define who the other person should and shouldn't be. And then we try to change them. And if we can't change them, we try to escape from them. And we all have a history of failed relationships in our rearview mirror that would say that that is really true. And when you get to that point and that moment where you realize, oh my goodness, I have tried to change this person. and to becoming who I want them to be, not who God wants them to be. It's a terrifying but liberating moment. That's a gift. The danger is that you'd never get there. The danger is that you would think that the only thing you can hope for in relationships is two people who meet each other halfway. And sometimes you get to say, and sometimes you get to say. So what would Jesus really and truly in between a relationship look like? Bonhoeffer writes this. Jesus Christ stands between the lover and the one he loves. And as only Christ can speak to me in such a way that I may be saved, so others too can be saved only by Christ himself. It is a critical and fundamental understanding to realize that at the deepest parts of our fallenness, what we need is Jesus to come in and create life where there was death and raise it up. Not someone else telling us who we should be. Bonhoeffer also writes this really, I think, compelling statement when he says, Christian community is not an ideal that we have to live up to. I think so many of us think that, right? You've been in a small group, and then after six months, you hate that person who talks way too much. And you also wonder why that person hasn't shown up for a while. So you stop showing up for a while, and after a while, after six months or so, it just disintegrates because we couldn't live up to this wonderful ideal. No, Bonhoeffer writes, Christian community is a reality in God in which we may participate. And the reality, I think, exists within the community that is God, Father, Son, and Spirit. The Father breathes life into every single human being. We see this in Genesis chapter 2, verse 7, when God creates humans. And we read this, when Yahweh, God, formed the human of dust from the soil. But that wasn't enough. Dust from the soil wasn't going to give life to a person. And so God blew into this human's nostrils the breath of life, the ruach of life, and the human being became a living being. And I think just beneath the surface of every single human being that you lock eyes with. There is a potential. Sometimes it's hidden way down deep, but there is a potential for the life of God that will grow and sprout because it's a seed buried underneath their heart. And God is the one that put it there. But that seed needs to sprout. And that's what I think the son, Jesus, does. If you've been at Open Door for a few years, you remember Dave teaching about the little girl who was dead and this house filled with grief that Jesus entered and then he takes her by the hand we read in Mark 5 41 and he took this little girl by the hand and he said talitha kum which means little girl I say to you get up and I believe there are just many people men and women here today that would say the life in me has not sprouted up yet. In fact, maybe there was a time that it had sprouted up and it was flourishing, but now it's a withered plant. It is dying. It is dead. And you need to hear the word from Jesus himself says to you this, little girl, little boy, old man, old woman, I say to you, arise. The power of Jesus that rose him from the dead is available to you to arise. And that is why the fundamental Christian message is tomorrow does not have to be a repeat of today. Resurrection is real. Jesus calls it forth. And then the Holy Spirit, the third member of the Trinity, in John 16, 13, Jesus teaches us this, but when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will what? Guide you into all truth. Like a seasoned traveler on a road that you might be on, a seasoned guide knows where to tell you to put your feet and knows how to empower you to do that which you don't think you can do. That's what the role of the Holy Spirit is in your life. Helping you to bear with, transforming your heart so that what you thought you couldn't do, in fact, you can do through the power of the Spirit. And that community, Father, Son, and Spirit, full of life, teeming with life, calling out life, and then empowering you to live that life is the community into which you are invited to participate. And that matters a lot when you're struggling to bear with someone when it's very difficult. Bonhoeffer writes this, spiritual love, this is the love that exists with Jesus in between you and the person you love. We'll meet the other person with the clear word of God and be ready to leave him alone with this word for a long time. Willing to release him again in order that Christ may deal with him. I gotta deal with you, no. In order that Christ may deal with him. And then this last line, it will respect the line that has been drawn between him and Christ. Now the codependency in us looks at that paragraph and screams, Oh! I can't leave him alone with Jesus. Now listen to that statement. if you have to be the one to save that person that person is in grave danger yes more amens people rather if you can have the courage to come with a clear word and what that means is not thus saith the lord i'm just leaving you to deal with god now i'm bailing that's not what that means. What it means is I have borne in my heart a painful word that I feel like I need to bring to you. And so I bring it to you as a gift and leave it with you. And I will walk with you if you want me to as Christ deals with you. It's not leaving. It's bearing with in a way in which you can, and a way in which doesn't put the saving of the other person on you. It's the only way you will deal with the person with whom you're struggling with compassion or patience or kindness. If Jesus stands in between you and the other person, then those dangerous words, which maybe you've noticed we've been delaying for week after week after week, forgive one another as the Lord forgave you. Only with Jesus in between is that possible because all the violence that you would have to forgive the other person putting on you can be absorbed into Jesus if Jesus is in between. And then you can actually forgive. Jesus in between you and the one you love is a picture of a relationship that would be filled with life and hope and resurrection and that it would free each of you to grow up into the beautiful person that God wants you to be. Well, I think two people that wanted to take this seriously. Jesus in between them would have to have the picture of the Lord as shepherd right in front of them. Would have to say to each other, the Lord is my shepherd and the Lord is your shepherd. The Lord has everything I need and the Lord has everything you need. So we can stop clawing at each other's empty wells to get what we need. We can instead move toward the one who says, I am eternal life. I put eternal life within you that will spring up from within. I will do that to you. Two people that are serious about this would have to ask each other for forgiveness. I am so sorry that I have put on you an image of you that I wanted you to be. They would have to say, Please, I invite you to bring the clear word of God to me when you see it. And then leave it as a gift with me. So that you can walk with me in my journey toward Jesus. Bonhoeffer also writes, Spiritual love means that a person will talk to Christ about his brother more than to his brother about Christ. Christ in between means that I bring this relationship to Jesus quite often to say, oh Jesus, breathe life into them, call life out of them, and guide them in their journey. Now, for some of you, the thought of bearing with another person in this way has the anxiety meter like at red line right now. So it's a very good thing that we are now going to move to the table where you will get a tangible picture of Jesus in between. As you approach the communion steward, they will be holding the body and the blood of Jesus, offering it to you. And we're going to do what we did about a month ago where I'm going to ask you to, as you approach the communion stewards, to come with a question. And the question is, just like it was last time, that you would ask the communion steward, you would say, do you have what I need? And then they will offer Jesus in between you and them, offering Jesus as what you need to bear with whatever it is that you're trying to bear with. Because Jesus really can be with you in your struggle. invite you into what you need to be invited into so that the life that's in you can be born into the world. Amen.
