Fear not. We hear the words every Christmas season at church pageants where children dress up in bathrobes and act out the story of Jesus' birth. Fear not, lists the six-year-old angel, his bedsheet costume dragging on the ground, his coat hanger frame wings flapping ever so slightly from the trembling of his body. He sneaks a glance at the script hidden in the fold of his sleeve. fear not for I bring you good tidings of great joy already he has appeared to Zechariah who is his older brother with a taped on cotton beard and to Mary the freckled blonde of the second grade he used the same greeting for both fear not these were also God's first words to Abraham and to Hagar and to Isaac Fear not, the angel said in greeting Gideon and the prophet Daniel. Little wonder, by the time the supernatural being spoke those words, the human was usually laying face down in a catalytic state. When God made contact with planet Earth, sometimes the supernatural encounter sounded like thunder, sometimes it stirred the air like whirlwind, and sometimes it lit up the scene like a flash of phosphorus. Nearly always it caused fear. But the angel who visited Zechariah and Mary and Joseph heralded that God was to appear in a form that would not frighten anyone. What could be less scary than a newborn baby with jerky limbs and eyes that do not quite focus? In Jesus, born in a barn or a cave and laid in a feeding trough, God finally found a mode of approach that humanity didn't need to fear. The king had cast off his robes. Thank you. John Donne said it this way it was much that man was made like God before man being made in the image of God but that God should be made like man much more Hebrews 1 says it this way God after he spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways in these last days has spoken to us in his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the world. And he, that is Jesus, is the radiance of his glory, the radiance of his glory, the exact representation of his nature. The Gospel of John, the first chapter, the 14th verse says it this way. And the word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory. Glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth, we beheld his glory. But it wasn't always glory that people saw. Sometimes all they could see was a baby. Herod saw just that, a threatening baby at that, because he knew that little babies grow up to be men. And with this strange prophecy of a child who was born to be a king coming to his ears, he saw this baby as a threat. But that's all, he saw the baby as a baby. Chief priests and scribes actually saw the baby Jesus as nothing more than the answer to a theological riddle. When Herod came and asked the chief priests and scribes about this troubling prophecy, again, of a child who would be a king, they got the answer right. It says in Matthew chapter 2, verse 5, And they, that is the chief priests and scribes, said to Herod, In Bethlehem of Judea, for it has been written by the prophet, and they went on and quoted the Bible. Micah chapter 5, verse 2. Well, that's a lot of what religious people are able to do relative to God. They kind of get the right answer about God, but they don't know God. The Magi saw more than a baby or just the answer to a question of theology. For more than gifts of respect, the Magi fell down and worshipped him. But sometimes all people could see was a man. An ordinary man from Nazareth, no less, and nothing of significance comes from there. Others hearing that would rise in protest and say, far more than a man, a miracle worker. How could you miss that fact? But others, even in seeing the miracles, would declare him a fraud. A blind man given sight? Bring him to us, said the Pharisees and the chief priests in John chapter 9, When they brought the man who had allegedly been healed by Jesus of his blindness, they came with the questions, What is your name? Where are you from? Who are your parents? How did this happen? Were you really blind? Who did this to you? What do you mean he put clay in your eyes? Do you know this Jesus, who you name, doesn't keep this Sabbath? He's a sinner. No, I didn't know that, said the man. Here's all I know. Once I was blind, now I can see. others would rise often in anger and say he's he's not a fraud it's far worse than that he's a devil he does what he does by the power of the devil and another would stand back and laugh and just say lighten up you guys he's not a devil he's not a miracle worker look at him now, hanging defeated on a cross, he's not a devil. He's a victim. He's a loser. So what do you see? If you were there when the Word became flesh, what would you see? Now, I don't know about you, but I think we tend to think that we would see more. We'd like to think that anyway, that we would see God and we would believe. Just think, to have been there. When God became a man, how could you not believe? To see him, to hear him, to touch him. And when I think of the possibility of having been there when all this happened, I tend to think that it would have been much easier to believe. Surely all of my nagging doubts would vanish. Think how much easier it would even be to witness. You want proof that Jesus is God? There he is. There's God right over there. Sitting in the third row. Lord, Lord, would you mind even doing a little something? A little water to wine. A little walking on water. Just to prove who you are. Do a trick. In Jesus, the Bible says God actually took shape. It's what we celebrate at Christmas. It's called the incarnation. In Jesus, God, for the first time, had a face we could look at, had a voice we could hear, had a name we could speak. He was now a God you could see and smell and hear and touch. This is great. Now we'll believe. Surely this will silence the critics who say that God is silent or that God is distant. Distant? He's right there. But now in the incarnation, there was a whole new problem. For now in his humanity, in God's visibility, he had somehow become ordinary. Isaiah 53 says that very thing. He had no stately form or majesty that we should notice him as being anything other than ordinary. Veiled in flesh the Godhead see. It's a song we sing often at Christmas. Veiled incarnate deity. He was God, but it was veiled. You couldn't see it. Christian arts often portrays Jesus in the pictures as being kind of otherworldly with some sort of glow about him and surely a halo. But Isaiah 53 says, He had no stately form or majesty that we should notice him. He didn't walk around with the glow. Oh, there he is. See the glow? There's God right there. Not like that at all. Keep in mind that Jesus came to people who had been raised on stories of the Exodus, Mount Sinai, Mount Carmel, bolts of lightning and pillars of smoke. But Jesus' voice, this one who is now to be God incarnate, didn't bless the treetops. Jesus' anger didn't shake the ground. His presence didn't make you cower in fear. In the year the king Uzziah died, says the prophet Isaiah, I saw God. And when Isaiah saw God, among his responses were these. Woe is me, for I am undone. The presence of God was overwhelming. The presence of God, quite frankly, was frightening. On the Day of Atonement, the high priests would go into what was known as the Holy of Holies, where there was in that place the very presence of God, a powerful place to go. Only the high priest could go there, only once a year. So scary was it to go into that place to bring atonement for the sins of the people that this high priest would tie a rope around his waist in case something happened to him while he was in there. Sometimes they would die and they would pull them out rather than go in where the presence of God. I ain't going in there. Not where God is. That's a scary thing. So God turned down the volume. A way to see, a way to hear, A way to talk without getting blown away. And now we see a baby born in a barn. Isn't that sweet? It makes you feel all warm and gooey, doesn't it? Very nice and sentimental. And I like those kinds of feelings, especially in church, because they require nothing of me. Sentiment is what we want. A little baby, but God? He was an ordinary man, for goodness sake. Anyone who saw him would have thought that from a no-account town called Nazareth, Joseph and Mary's boy, now they were nice enough people, but come on. Neighbors who watched Jesus grow up with their children never did believe he was Messiah. His own family at one point, Mary included, Mary included, who heard the angel's voice, thought Jesus was mad at the beginning of his ministry and tried to pull him from his task. If you were there, when the word became flesh, what would you think? What would you see? Let me ask this. What would you want to see? Well, in truth, for me, it wouldn't be the baby. Now, from this side of history, I would want to see the baby because I know the whole story of how the baby grew and took on the cross and the resurrection. I know the whole story. But if I were there, if I was there and didn't know the whole story and where was I, I would not be interested in the baby. Not even the man. Show me some miracles. That's what I would want to see. And that would do it too. If I saw some of that kind of stuff, I would believe with ease. All of my nagging doubts would vanish. I mean, think about it. No one, at least this is what I think, no one who saw him feed 5,000, no one who saw him shut down a storm, call Lazarus out of a tomb ever doubted. Did they? If only I had been there. When the Word became flesh, we could have seen it. We could have heard it. We could have held it in our hands. Never doubt again. Believing, always believing. Seeing, always seeing. What a tool for witnessing. I mean, why doesn't he do that now? Why doesn't he do more miracles now? And the answer is, well, he does do miracles now. That's not what I mean. I want more. See, if he did more, if he did miracles here, if he did one now, before the end of the service. I would believe. And I would always believe, and I would never doubt again. Among the beliefs devout Jews of Jesus' day had relative to Messiah was this, that Messiah would set right all that was wrong in the world. The Hebrew term was tekunalom, to make right the world. Had not the prophets promised that the Lord would swallow up death forever and wipe away every tear? Every tear. So Jesus came one day to a pool in Jerusalem. They called it Bethesda. This was a place where the blind and the lame would gather, believing that when the water would ripple, it was an indication of the presence of the angel of the Lord. And people would run into that water believing that if they got into the water soon enough, they would be healed. And evidently, some people got healed because there were blind and lame people all around. And Jesus spotted one man who was so infirmed he couldn't possibly move and becoming, therefore, the symbol of hopelessness. I mean, the healing could be right there, but he couldn't get to it, so Jesus came to him that day and made him a happy man, healed him. Then the storyteller, John, in his gospel, adds this, with all those other people still there, that Jesus slipped away. Now, if you're preoccupied with and all excited about the guy who got healed, because that's so amazing and so unusual, you probably aren't bothered by the fact that he slipped away. But if you kind of have the whole story, you have your whole picture, and you know what he could do, you might find this fact a bit troubling. The theologian Augustine found it troubling, and he asked why. Here's the quote from Augustine. There lay so many there by the pool, yet only one was healed that day. While he could by a word have raised them all, why did he not? End quote. I mean, what he did was great. He healed this guy. But why didn't he do more? Why didn't he do him? Why didn't he do her? Why didn't he do me? We had a funeral this last week. Why didn't he do him? Because if he did, him or her or me, I would believe and never doubt again. Believing, always believing. Seeing, always seeing. One day, the story is well-known. Jesus came to visit some friends, but he was too late. His friend, their friend, Lazarus, had already passed on, and now he stood before the grave where he had been placed and said the most amazing words, Lazarus, come forth. Truth is, it's not hard to say those words. I just said them. It's hard to have anything happen when you say those words. Well, when Jesus said those words, a dead man rose. And if I saw that, I promise, I would never doubt again. Believing, always believing. Seeing, always seeing. But didn't the prophets say every tear? I mean, what about his tears? What about hers? What about mine? If only he would do more. Then. You know, a very curious, interesting reality revealed to us in Scripture about Jesus relative to his own miracles was that he was strangely ambivalent toward them. And yes, he used them, even pointed to them as proof of who he was. In one of the Gospels, at least, he said, Believe me when I say I and the Father are one. And if you don't believe the words I say, believe the miracles themselves. He pointed to the miracles as verification of his authority and his power. But here's the troubling piece. He didn't heal everyone. And he often downplayed it when he did. Not always, but often he would say to someone he had just healed, tell no one. Why? Well, we don't know for certain. And actually, I think there are a number of reasons. But maybe part of it is because Jesus knew the shallow effect that miracles have had all through redemptive history to foster deep and abiding faith. Think about it. This is very troubling actually to think about it because I think if I saw, I would believe. At least maybe see a little bit more than I have. But think with me. Who saw more historically than the Israelites in the Exodus? The parting of the Red Sea. Boy, if I saw that. The pillar of smoke, the manna from heaven yielding in their lives what? Misbelief, discontent, disobedience, grumbling and complaining. It was never enough. Who saw more than Peter, James, and John? I mean, along with the other disciples, they spent all this time with Jesus, hearing his teachings about the kingdom of God, seeing the power of God flow through him on what seemed to be a fairly regular basis. But Peter, James, and John actually had an experience that no one else in the face of the earth has ever had. In Matthew 17, it's recorded that they went up onto a mountain one day alone to pray. And in the context of their praying, Jesus gave to them a gift. It was designed to encourage them and confirm some things in them they needed to have confirmed. And it was this. He pulled back the veil of his flesh and revealed to them his glory. It's called the transfiguration, where who he really was was revealed in full glory. And if I saw that, I would never doubt again. Two weeks after they saw that, all of the disciples deserted Jesus. Peter, in particular, who saw the unveiled glory of God, denied he ever knew him. I never knew him. See, this stuff troubles me. If he would have just done more, he should have revealed more. He should have wiped away every tear. I mean, if he's really God and we're really his creation, he should just overwhelm us. I mean, that'd be okay with me. Release all the tension that I feel. He should just make us believe him. I mean, isn't that what an all-powerful God would do? Powerful being the operative word there? I mean, flex your muscles, God. Be God, for crying out loud. Here. Picture with me another curious scene that, once again, if you look at it, the way I'm looking at it this morning could maybe actually disturb you a little. It's Jesus standing on a hill overlooking Jerusalem, weeping. It says this, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing. looked at a certain direction that's not troubling at all looked at the direction we're looking at it I think it's a little troubling because the thing that bugs me is this not willing what do you mean not willing if he is God if he's in charge why doesn't he make them willing overwhelm them again flex your muscles God why don't you just be God instead he weeps I mean I see the compassion there I would just like to see more power fix them why does he weep why doesn't he fix it again we don't know for sure and I think there's more than one answer to this but Soren Kierkegaard begins I think to answer this question I'm asking with the story of a king who loved a humble maid. Let me read you the story. The king was like no other king. Every statesman trembled before his power. No one dared breathe a word against him for he had the strength to crush all opponents. And yet this mighty king was melted by the love for a humble maiden. How could he declare his love for her? In an odd sort of way, his very kingliness tied his hands. If he brought her to the palace and crowned her head with jewels and clothed her body in royal robes, she would surely not resist. Nobody resisted him. But would she love him? And how would he know if she loved him? She would say she loved him, of course, but would she? Would she live with him in fear, nursing a private grief for the life she had left behind? Would she be happy at his side? If he rode to her forest cottage in his royal carriage with an armed escort waving bright banners, that too would overwhelm her. But he didn't want a cringing subject. He wanted a lover, an equal. He wanted her to forget that he was a king and she a humble maiden and to let shared love cross over the gulf between them. For it is only in love that the unequal can be made equal, concluded Kierkegaard. The king, convinced he could not elevate the maiden without crushing her freedom, resolved to descend. He clothed himself as a beggar and approached her cottage incognito with a worn cloak fluttering loosely behind him. It was no mere disguise, but a new identity he took on. He renounced the throne to win her hand. You see, our God, whose name in flesh is Jesus, desires what power can never win. He is a king who wants not just subservience, but love. Thus, rather than overwhelming or mowing down Jerusalem or Rome or any other worldly power, he chose the slow, hard way of incarnation, love, and death. A conquest from within. I want to win your heart. I want to woo you to myself. But to do that, he not only became ordinary, he actually became vulnerable to us. It's interesting, we hear the words every Christmas season at church pageants when children dress up in bathrooms and act out the story of Jesus' birth. They're the two words that Jan read in the reading before I brought this word. The two words are these, fear not. And when those words were originally spoken, they had a purpose. For whenever God made contact with planet earth, it sounded like thunder. It cracked like lightning. People were afraid. Fear not, therefore. Needed to be spoken. Fear not. were the first words of God to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. Fear not, the angel said in greeting Gideon and the prophet Daniel. But the angel who visited Mary and Joseph was this time announcing that God was about to appear in a form that wouldn't scare anyone. For what could be less scary than a newborn baby with jerky limbs and eyes that don't quite focus? In Jesus, born in a barn or a cave and laid in a feeding trough, God had finally found a way to approach humanity that he didn't need to fear. The king had indeed cast off his robes. Philip Yancey in his book, Disappointment with God, speaks of all, responds to all of that with these words. Those who believe in God can never in a way be sure of him again. For once you have seen God in a stable, you can never be sure where he might appear, or to what lengths he might go, or to what depths of self-humiliation he might descend in his wild pursuit of you. For those who believe in God, it means this birth, that God himself is never safe from us. He comes in such a way that we can always turn him down, just as we could crack the baby's skull, like an eggshell, or when he gets too big for that, just nail him to a cross. Yancey further observes this. Today, the major events of Jesus' life are marked on calendars around the world, all over the world, Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter. Of the three, however, only the middle one, the crucifixion, took place in the open for all the world to see. At the moment when God seemed downright helpless, the cameras of history were rolling, recording every minute. Large crowds watched every excruciating detail. And when four men wrote up accounts of Jesus' life, they collectively devoted one-third of their Gospels to that time of apparent failure. The spectacle of the cross, the most public event in Jesus' life, reveals the vast difference between a God who proves himself through power and one who proves himself through love. Other gods, Roman gods for example, enforced worship and people knew how to respond to that. In Jesus' own lifetime, some Jews were slaughtered for not bowing down to Caesar but Jesus never forced anyone to believe him. He preferred to act by appeal, drawing people out of themselves and into himself. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory. Glory is of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth. And we beheld his glory. But it wasn't always glory that people saw. So what do you see? God, after he spoke long ago to the prophets, to the fathers, in the prophets, in many portions and in many ways in these last days, he has spoken to us in his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the world. And he, that is Jesus, is the radiance of his glory, the exact representation of his nature. He's the radiance of his glory. But it wasn't always glory, people saw. So what do you see? Well, I'll tell you what I see and what the angels saw, what the shepherds and the magi, what the prophets, apostles, and writers of Scripture saw. They saw the Christ, the anointed one of God, Emmanuel, God with us. His name, he has a name. His name is Jesus. Although he existed in the form of God, regarded equality with God, not a thing to be grasped, But he emptied himself, taking on the form of a bond slave, and being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on the cross. Therefore, God highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father. So who do you see? Who do you see? Who do you see? Let's stand and sing together. you
