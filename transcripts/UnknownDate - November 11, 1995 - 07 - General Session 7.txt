Several people asked me if there was an expansion on what I said this morning and what I'm going to say this afternoon. And the answer is yes. There's a couple of, I'd say thousands left on the table. One is entitled Foundations in Grace. The other is Entitled Foundations in Love. And they are a broader development of what I said this morning and what I'll be saying now. and kind of build itself again. Some of the questions, what I usually do is let the last thought respond to questions that I get throughout the day after things have been sort of turned up. And so what I'm going to do is cobble together some ideas that I hope will hit where at least most of the questions have been coming from me. It's been very stimulating hearing some of the queries and questions and testimonies. There were many wonderful things that you reported about what the Lord did for you this morning in hearing His Word and the ministry time that followed. And so I'm confident that there are good things happening. And so I want to take your questions seriously. So in that spirit, let me bring together some ideas that will do justice to our topic, but also answer the questions that have been asked of me. One of the questions that has been asked is, okay, if the Father awaits us with uncritical love, or as it's pointed out, we could say as to if the Heavenly Mother is waiting for us of uncritical love for her daughters and sons, his daughters and sons, to return home. If that is the case, is that simply because God is terminally sentimental? What about his holiness? What about the demands of righteousness? What about what the law was for in the first place? And so nobody put a point like that, but a lot of the questions were, I'm still a little bit uneasy with the freedom and the liberality of the grace that is apparently there in the parable of the prodigal son. So with that in mind, let me read to you Paul's take on this subject. This was his response to the same sorts of questions. Let me turn to Colossians chapter 2, and I'll start reading in verse number 13. Read for a while, then stop and comment, and then read the rest of the chapter, and then stop and comment. Colossians chapter 2, verse number 13. Now remember, the issue is, if God is holy, if God is not just the waiting Father, but the lawgiver, how do we get to come home without a changed life, without works, and without repentance? Here's Paul's answer. Here's God's answer. When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the written code with its regulations that was against us and stood opposed to us. He took it away, nailing it to the cross, and therefore, having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross. When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. The good news starts off with a full force here. When we were dead, when we were yet sinners, when we were hopelessly lost, God unilaterally made us alive in Christ. He made us alive in Christ. We were dead, and He did a work that made us alive in Christ. And that's without doing anything good. He made us alive in Christ. And let me just say, when I said this caused some people a lot of problems, there's a really, one of my favorite sermons is one that I call the good news of repentance. Jesus says, repent and believe the good news. That's two things, saying one thing. You know what repentance was for the sun off in the car country? Leave the car country and come home. You know what repentance was for the good son that was at home working in the fields? Come out of the fields and come in to party. Not beating your breast. Death is too good for me. I am the worthless worm. How much longer do I have to feel bad before I can be okay with God? That's kind of repentance. Now, if God should ever give you the gift of a high snot factor period of repentance with lots of tears and lots of wrenching and groaning, Go for it. These are salutary, wonderful times. Just understand that He is repenting you. It's a gift of the Holy Spirit, and it's not a work that you have to do to get His favor, His goodness, or any of His gifts. They come to you free, and you get them by just going in. So, yes, repent and believe, of course. But repentance isn't feeling bad. Repentance is getting out of the far country or coming in out of the fields where you're working for your righteousness. Turn away from both of those orientations and come home to the Father. Just show up. That's what repentance means. I mean, if the New Testament is anything to go on, that's what repentance means. When we were dead in our sins and in the uncircumcision of our sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave all our sins. He forgave all our sins. He forgave all our sins. He forgave all our sins, past, present, future. All of our sins are forgiven. Now, I'd have been satisfied with that. I'd have been satisfied with all sins, past, present, and future. So God is a holy God that demands perfection. Jesus gave him perfection. And on the basis of Jesus' performance, on the basis of his record being transferred to ours, on the basis of his A's, all the A's that he scored being transferred to our report card, on the basis of His perfect life, His sacrificial death, God has forgiven all of our sins, everything that stood in the way. Now, I'd have been satisfied with that. Having been buried with Him in baptism, and raised with Him when you were dead in your sins, and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all of our sins. Now, here's the second part. having canceled the written code with its regulations that was against us and stood opposed to us, he took it away, nailing it to the cross. And here's the second. So he made you alive. I'd have been satisfied. He forgave all your sins, past, present, and the sins that you're going to commit before you leave this room tonight. They're all forgiven. And then he took away the written code. He took away the law of God. the holy law of God, that the law keeper, the law giver, he took away the written code and nailed it to the cross. So now, not only are our sins forgiven, but the code that even defined our sins is taken away, nailed to the cross. So now there isn't even any means to define your sins. It gets better, if you can imagine. He took it away because it was in the way. He took it away because it stood opposed to us. What does the law do? The law doesn't encourage you. The law doesn't do anything but show up when you have violated it. The law is a cold statute hanging there, not a person to relate to. If you don't get anything else, you've got to get this. The Christian life is relating to a person, not trying to line up to a standard. it's relating to a person it stood opposed to us it was always on our case and so Jesus took it away nailing it to the cross having disarmed the principalities and powers and authorities he made a public spectacle of them triumphing over them by the cross the principalities and powers used the way that Jesus disarmed the principalities and powers when he was nailed to the cross is that he fulfilled the law for us, making it as a means of accusation against us irrelevant. He obeyed God perfectly, and he died our death and our place perfectly, and so now the law has been fulfilled for us, and therefore it is no longer held against us, and that disarms the principalities and powers, the accuser. Now how does that work? It works like this. The accuser who accuses the brethren day and night, the sister and everybody, day and night, takes us into the courtroom and says, Brother Ken has sinned, O mighty judge. And the mighty judge looks down at me and says, have you sinned? And I have to say, before the one that nothing is hidden from, I have to say, you know. You know that I am. You know that I do. So you've sinned. Yes, I've sinned. And then the judge turns to the accuser, the prosecuting attorney, and says, and what law has my son Ken broken? And the accuser, now being disarmed at the cross, has to say something like this. Well, I mean, strictly speaking, well, as it were, per se, in a manner of speaking, well, what I'm trying to get at is there isn't exactly a law that he has broken because the law has been taken away or something like that. And the judge says, so my son has committed a sin, but there's no law that defines his law breaking. Well, yes, I think that's the way it is. He says, well, what are we doing? It makes the judgment irrelevant. That's why there's no folks. That's why Romans 8, there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ. There just is none. The possibility of condemnation has been taken away. When you feel condemnation, it's not coming from the Holy Spirit. Condemnation comes from the accuser. And the accuser is simply lying to you because there's no basis for the accusation anymore. now what is so tragic is that most evangelical preaching and I'm sure most Catholic and most Orthodox preaching as well Sunday morning after Sunday morning is all about rearming the devil think about it you've got to do more you've got to try harder let's get those ties up let's have a longer quiet time all these things are necessary for your walk with God and to please God this is what pleases God you've got to do these things it's all done with the best of intention most of the time. There isn't a conscience. I mean, spiritual abusers don't wake up in the morning and say, how can I make my people's lives miserable today? They don't do that. They wake up in a cold sweat, fearing the judgment of God on them unless they lift their people into lying for God. Unless they perform, they feel judged. They haven't heard the good news yet either. And they've read this passage thousands of times, and they just gloss over. They just blaze over. They don't see what it says. There's now no condemnation for you. You can fail as a pastor, and there's no condemnation for you. Your people can run amok, and there's now no condemnation for you. So why don't you just go out and love them and tell them the truth and just see what happens? What a novel thought. Just take care of them. Make them glad they came to church. Try that for about a year. Just see what happens. Well, they could do that if they read this and believed what it said. The law has been taken away, nailed to the cross, disarming the accuser. And the only way that the accuser can be rearmed is if pastors and Bible teachers and theologians rearm him. Because Jesus has already taken away his weapon. And unless we give him back to him, he doesn't have it. Now, in light of that, therefore, do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink regarding religious festivals, new moons, celebrations, or the Sabbath day. These are a shadow of things that were to come. The reality, however, is found in Christ. And then he tells potential victims of spiritual abuse, look, folks, you take responsibility for your life, all right? Everybody in here, snap out of it. Take responsibility for your life. And start it right now. Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize. We're all about, you know, we're near, let's hear your story. I do this all the time. let's let people talk let's give them a safe place to unburden themselves and then at the end of the day we have to say listen from now on don't you let anybody kick you around you take responsibility for your own life starting now this is the apostle Paul under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit do not let anyone jerk you around anymore verse 20 since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world see that's what the sketch was all about. The woman finally taking responsibility for her life. Saying, you're not doing this to me anymore. Since you died with Christ to the basic principalities of this world. What are the basic principalities of this world? Demonic entities. Legalistic religion, do more try harder religion is demonic. It's not just fundamentalist. It's not just extreme conservatism. It's demonic. Anything that undermines the radical message of the cross and the exchanged life and death of Jesus Christ for us, anything that undermines that is not just kind of missing the point. It's demonic. It's occult. And elements of that are preached in most pulpits across the United States and Canada. They say, do not handle, do not taste, do not touch. These are all destined to perish with use because they are based on human commands and teachings. The cross is the revelation of God. The rest of the stuff is human commands and teachings. Such regulations indeed have the appearance of wisdom, don't they? Really sincere disciples, really sincere prophetic and apostolic types, living with their souls, not just their noses, but their souls to the grindstone, having the appearance of wisdom with their self-imposed worship, their false humility, and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value for restraining sensual indulgence. It's not just that rules don't whip you into shape, or they're not particularly good at controlling your behavior. It says right here, they're absolutely useless. So the very thing that is used, oh, you can if you do a call and use a say and take the law completely away, from riding herd on people, if you establish it just in a relationship and a revelation of God's love, and if you live your life in relationship to Him, as pleasing to Him, and not in light of the laws, if you do that, then the people know that they're forgiven. They might run amok. Oh, brother, there ain't no might to it. They will. Many people who hear this message and finally and finally get it are going to be irresponsible. Many of them will be. Once you take the load, the religious load of do's and don'ts off of them and liberate them, many of them will be irresponsible. And my question is, and so what? Now you know who you've got. Those people were never born again. And isn't it, those people do not have the new nature in them. They were operating through social pressure, keeping up appearances for whatever reasons, and they never had the love of God in them. I had a guy in my church who listened to me preach and then went home and told his wife. He phoned her up. She phoned me immediately, of course. He went home and phoned her up. They were not living together. He was paying child support. Kendall told me that I'm not under the law, but I'm under grace, so I'm going to stop paying child support. And she quickly phoned me and told me what he said. And then I killed him. And solved that problem. there are people no I'll tell you what I did do I said I said John you need to be converted you need a revelation of Christ in your heart you need to be regenerated you think you're a Christian but anybody who talks like that does not have the Holy Spirit in it and I just want to confront you with that straight up you need to get that taken care of well this sounds like one of those preachers could it actually happen A couple of months later, he said, yeah, I see it. I see it. Will you pray for him? He did it. He's now back with his wife. I have to tell you, some of these stories really are true. There can't be any stories. They really are true. But what the church wants to do, more often than not, is control people's behavior. Modify their behavior. Go and become a Mormon. They're so much better at it. Go and become part of the worldwide church of God, or go and become a Jehovah's Witness. they have got this behavior modification down the path. If that's what you're in it for, if you want to be good, you can't get any better than a good Mormon. I mean, you just can't. I mean, don't you? But, I mean, if you want to be a Christian, then that's a different issue. I mean, it's not a variation of that issue. It's a different issue. Christianity is not behavior modification. It's not about being good. It's about being related to God. And if you're related to God, you'll be good as a consequence. You'll grow in goodness. You'll grow in holiness. because the Holy One is in you. And if He isn't in you, we won't see it. And if we don't see it, we know He's not in you, and then we can confront that and take care of that, and it's helpful to do that this side of death. So spiritual abuse is not just a problem, but it also reveals a problem. And the problem is that we don't understand the basic gospel. Because if you really know that all the rules that can ever be laid on you have been nailed to the cross and you can no longer be intimidated by rules, you're very unlikely to perpetrate spiritual abuse. And you're sure not going to let anybody do abuse. And then you can hear the words of Paul saying, you take responsibility for your own life and don't let anybody do your thing in that word. I mean, the gospel, the only reason that we're such confused, strange, agent, little caricatures of Christians is because we haven't yet heard the gospel. I'm not kidding you. Full of joy, the glory of God, the abundant life, it's there, and it all flows out of the gospel. It all flows out of the gospel. And I would say that if it's not there yet, it's because of the misunderstanding of the gospel. And I have to say that I'm talking to myself because, like I said earlier, I believe it with all my head. My behavior indicates that I don't believe it yet with all my heart. So I'm patient with anybody here if they don't believe it. Spiritual abuse is not only a problem, but it reveals a problem that neither the victim or the perpetrator fully understands the gospel or are rightly yet related to the Father. So let's begin with leaders. What do you look for in leaders? What do we want a leader to be or to do? What ought we to expect from a pastor, a priest, an elder? What's the minimum that we should demand of elders? Do they have to know the Bible? Do they have to be warm and affectionate? Do they have to be spiritual? Do they have to be able to get words of knowledge? Do they have to be moral? What do you want and what do you look for in a leader? And I would agree with many thoughtful Christians who say the very least that we should expect from a leader is that he or she knows God. or as A.W. Tozer said it, regarding your spiritual health, do not listen to someone who has not first listened to God. Do not take seriously someone who does not know God. So the next question would be, all right, if this is kind of the minimum that we expect, how do we know just by observing that somebody knows God? Do we know that they know God because they know the Bible or because they can prophesy accurately and give us good information, accurate information, or somebody who prays regularly and long and tells us about it, or somebody who has lots of followers, meaning isn't numbers as a sign of success. There's Jesus at the point of his ultimate success, and he's lost all of his numbers. So in theory, we know that that's not the case, but we know that numbers aren't the whole story. But I mean, is it a big crowd? Does that indicate favor with God? Is it somebody who is a good manager? Somebody who operates in spiritual power? Someone who is moral and disciplined? Well, these are all good theories, but just as you might expect, The Bible just tells us in absolute, spiritual pure language how we know who does and doesn't know God. And the answer is found in 1 John. Once I said 1 John, you knew the answer. 1 John, chapter 4, 7-8. Here's God's answer to the question I've been posing. Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God because God is love. This is how God showed his love among us. He sent his one and only son into the world that we might live through him. This is love, not that we love God, but that he loved us and sent his son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins, dear friends, since God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. This is a commentary on the parable that I did for you this morning. It's because God has loved the younger brother, we ought also to love him. Because God has loved, we're not looking for the older brother, we ought also to love him. so there it was all along everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God everyone who loves knows God so the person who loves is the person who demonstrates that he knows God and folks that is the person who looks for Paul said if I do all that pastoral stuff right, if I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, if I have wisdom and knowledge, and I'm a great preacher and I'm a great administrator and I have terrific wisdom and even I am sacrificial to the point of giving my body to be burned and have not love, I'm a big fact to do it. So Paul says, finally, the only thing that matters is love. Paul even said, there's only one law, and that's the law of love. Jesus was asked, Jesus, what matters most? And he said, love God, love people. That's the whole law right there. That was the intent right from the beginning. Love God, love people. And then this is love. Not that we love God, but that he loved us. Herein is love. Not that we had a good idea. Not that we decided to be loving. Not that we went to a seminar and we were exhorted to love, but that we first experienced the love of God. It changed us, and that's what enables us to love. So, following the logic, if you're looking for a leader, you want the person to know God. How do you know that they know God? Because they love. How do they love? Because they first had an experience in God's love. And I submit to you, you can find out as this is going on. All you have to do is listen to somebody preach, interact with them for a little while, and the dullest of people can discern. Unsophisticated children can discern, has this guy's heart been touched by the love of God? Is that where this is coming from? Or is this a pastor's brother? Is this a church brother? I just submit to you that you can tell the difference. So, to bring it back to its essence, who is a spiritual leader that you can trust? Somebody who's experienced the love of God to the point where he's changed. And that lifestyle has become there. God's lifestyle of love has become there. Okay, now with that in mind, turn to Ephesians chapter 3. Ephesians chapter 3, verses 14 to 19. For this reason I kneel before the Father, from whom the whole family in heaven and earth derives his name, I pray that out of his gracious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And how does Christ dwell in your hearts through faith? So that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power together with all the saints to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know his love that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with the fullest measure of the fullness of God. In other words, if you want the most intense possible experience of life, if you want the biggest life imaginable, if you want to be filled up with all the fullness of God, the first thing you do is not pray harder, is not go to more seminars. The first thing that you do is get loved by God. You being rooted and established in love, listen to this, I mean, he just runs out of rhetoric. He just runs out of, he just runs out of scurlatives. He just runs out of things to say. You being rooted and established in love may have power. What's the power? Is it some abstract spiritual gifts power? No. You may have power together with all the saints. We're in this together. The younger brother and the older brother. To grasp. And how wide, how narrow it is for the younger brothers. And I've seen this in street ministry. I've been involved in a lot of street ministry. Here it is in street ministry. The street kids come in off the street. They find the love of God and they despise those high-wearing, tight-lipped, tight everything else. I'm getting better. I'm getting better. Religious prigs. Okay? They haven't grasped how wide and how broad that God can love the religious bigots as well as the wasted kids off the street. We have to be in this together. The younger brother and the older brother together have to see how huge this grace is. And not deny this grace to anybody. because if you deny it to anybody, you don't go into the party yourself and you never grasp how wide and how high and how extensive. You being rooted in establishing love, they have power together with all the saints to grasp, to perceive, have it revealed to you how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ. If we accept each other, I mean, I know God can accept me and my sins. I've gotten over that, but how about somebody else over here? How about that subgroup? How about those religious things? How about, does God's love and grace encompass all of those? Absolutely. Does God's love and grace encompass the spiritual abusers? Let's answer that question. Yes. God loves those people no less than he loves the people who were victims. He treats them differently. He treats them differently in terms of pedagogy, in terms of what he teaches them. and trains them and heads them in the direction of head them. But that's how wide. I mean, one of the things that we have to get here is not to say the perpetrator is out there and us victims in here. That's not the way it is. God's grace encompasses all. Way beyond where they are. You being rooted and grounded in love will have power together with all the saints to grasp how wide and long and deep is the love of Christ. And to know this love that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with the fullest measure of the fullness of God. I mean, the fullest measure of the fullness of God. How can you say this is being totally human and completely alive? This is the most explicit expression of human aliveness there is. In the human body, being filled with the fullness of God. And you get that by being rooted and grounded in love. When I was converted, I was not told before you do anything else to get rooted and grounded in love. Were you? I read a lot of books. And I kept them. And I went over them two years ago. And, you know, they're books that you get when you're converted. And then at the back of the book, it tells you all about salvation, plan of salvation, a little chair, and a little, you know, on the bridges and all that kind of stuff. And then at the back, it says, now, here are some things you do. Read your Bible. witness all good things tithe good thing attend services good thing do good works all good good good good stuff stop sinning all good stuff to do nowhere in any of the lists in any of the books that I collected when I was first converted not one place would be rooted and grounded in love and yes folks that's the very first thing we have to do here in his love not that we disciplined ourselves to love God, but we had an experience of His love in us. And Paul was on to say, now you can't just experience it. You've got to be rooted and grounded in love. The rest of your life cannot be built on your own efforts. It's got to be built on the rock-solid bomb-proof security of God's love for you. I mean, wouldn't that change our preaching and teaching of that? You know, we really believed that that was the foundation. It would just shift. It would just shift the whole emphasis from what we do to what God's done. And then what we are supposed to do would happen just like that. You get people stampeding for the nearest ministry operation. Oh, God, I'm just inundated with what you have done for me in the words of the great ex-Christian poet, Bob Dylan. You've done everything good. You've done everything for me. Now, what can I do for you? That would be our song. Give me somebody to love. Give me some way to serve. Give me some place to give to. I'm rooted and grounded in love. Now, there is your abundant life. But struggling through doing your Christian disciplines in order to assuage your guilt and get through the day and hope that nobody notices that you're really a spiritual cripple, that's not the abundant life. And that's where most people live. Those people are just wearing a big badge. Come and manipulate and control me. These are my issues. Show me how to get right with God by things that I do. I'm yours. When it looked like my worst fears were going to be realized and I was going to go into the ministry, I decided, well, I better seek out some counsel and some guidance and find out how I prepare properly for this. So I went to pastors and seminary professors and theologians. and I said, what do I do to get ready to be a helpful minister or missionary, whatever I'm going to be? And I was given another group of books and another long list of things. You've got to learn how to preach. You've got to learn how to administer. Look at the menu in any seminar. You've got to learn how to lead small groups. You've got to learn how to solve problems. You've got to learn how to counsel. Folks, all of these things are good. But not once was it mentioned. Listen, before you start tampering with people's spiritual life, we've got to get rooted and grounded in love. That's what works. That's what works. Do you understand that this is the message that we've got? Do you understand that this is the first time that almost every one of you has ever heard this? No wonder we've missed some basic things. I mean, I'm surprised we didn't get out of the parking lot. We just missed, we just missed like basic, basic things. we have to absorb God's love to the point that it changes us before we ever flog ourselves or do anything a friend of mine told me this story he's a pastor now in northern California but he was a building contractor in Pennsylvania and he and his crew had been out of work for a couple of months and it was the middle of winter it was the middle of January and it was very cold in Pennsylvania where he was located, and all the crews had basically shut down for a couple of months until the wintertime passed. And a contract came through, and he decided that he had to bid on it because he and his crew were running short of funds. And so they bid on it. They got the job. And it was a big three-story custom home overlooking a golf course somewhere in Pennsylvania. and they took it and how they build, I have to explain this to people in California, probably not here, but how they build houses there is that they dig out a hole. They make a basement. They make a place for a basement and they put in concrete footers and then they pour a concrete into a mold and that's the foundation and then on top of that concrete, cinder block and footer foundation, they then build the house And so this is what my friend did. Dug out a hole, put in the concrete footers, laid the concrete in the molds, and then started building this big three-story building on top. And it was bitter cold, but they were happy to have the work. And they had put on the third story, and they were now putting on the roof, and they were hoisting up the last of the half-inch plywood that was to form the roof. And it was early one morning, and everybody was on top, and they were getting the plywood up. And all of a sudden, the whole house just shifted to one side and ended up slanted off to one side. And the hammers and anything that was loose on the roof went flying. The guys themselves hung on. Nobody got hurt. But there was the house sitting at an angle. And my friend ripped up one of the pieces that had the ladders went flying, so they couldn't get down the way they got up. So they pulled out a sheet of plywood, and my friend led the way, and he dropped down to the first level. And there was a bunch of windows on the east side popped out. And he said to himself, I've got to be fixed, but that's not the problem. Dropped down to the second level, and there were all the door jams all twisted and bent, and the windows popped up. And he said to himself, that's got to be fixed, but that's not the problem. And then he dropped down to the first floor, and there was all the tile that was all buckled, and the front door was askew, and he looked and he said, yeah, that's got to be fixed too. This is not what the people had in mind. He gave me the contract to build this house. That's got to be fixed, but finally that's not a problem. So then he went to the spiral staircase that led down into the basement, and it was torn away. And so he grabbed hold of the sill and dropped down into the basement, and he looked over in the corner, and he said, Oh, there it is. That's got to be fixed, and that is the problem. What had happened was that they poured the cement footers, and the cement foundation, but because it was so cold, the cement foundation had not cured. It was still green. It had not dried sufficiently or hardened sufficiently. So before the foundation was hard, they had built this huge three-story luxury house on top of the faulty foundation. Where am I going with this? Rooted and grounded in love is what we have to put at the core, at the very foundational level of our Christian life, or else all of our efforts, all of our disciplines, all of our do more, try harder, all of the things that please the church, please our family, and we think please God, all of that will add up to a great big weight that will one day come tumbling down in the trash. The last two years have been extremely humiliating and painful times. I developed, partly because of compulsive work habits and partly because I don't know what, I developed some physical problems. One of them was an infection in the front of my face, in the upper jaw, that caused all kinds of problems. I was desperately sick. I was tired. I thought I was going to die. I was exhausted. and they said chronic fatigue syndrome and I don't know what else. But we can't do anything about it. You know that story. There I was. And my church, I didn't know what the problem was at that point, hadn't discerned it. And the church leadership said, look, Ken, just go away and either get better or die. But, you know, this is not working. And up until then, I guess you would have looked and seen, yeah, I've planted a lot of churches. We've all been successful. This church, just in a couple of years, grew to several hundred people, and we're going. We've got money in the bank. We've got paid off sound system. We're reaching people nobody else is reaching. I get sick, crash and burn like the insect hitting the windshield at 200 miles an hour. I come to a speaking hall, go away, lick my wounds, figure out what's wrong, get it taken care of, limp back, just barely in the recovery process, which I'm still going through two years later physically, just barely get back and half the church is gone. All the money is gone. I'm starting over again. In the past few years, I have been exhausted. I have not had the kind of health and energy that I used to have. We've had two more kids. I wasn't that tired. we had two more kids in that period of time and and just so many things that I had expected to be doing and wanted to be doing simply did not have the physical ability to do and this created all kinds of very productive spiritual there's some good things about suffering I just have to get my testimony back there having I've been preaching this for 20 years but I never stopped performing and you can tell somebody I can't tell you about this listen to somebody's hottest sermon that's very Jimmy Swagger the hottest sermon was against sexual sin because of his issue my hottest My hottest sermons are on the unmerited grace of God, despite our performance. And guess what? My issue is. Listen to somebody's hottest sermons. That's her issue. And so I just had to face the fact. And when my friend told me this story, I said, yeah, Lord, that's me. And he took me to the top level of my life. the visible level, the level that everybody sees. And I saw pride in my skills, pride in notoriety, pride in my reputation of being intelligent and courageous. And God said to me, I've got to be fixed. But that's not a problem. And I dropped down to the second pillar of my life, the second pillar. and looked around. And there I saw some of the reasons for that cry. Compensating for not feeling okay about it. Having to overcompensate in order to prove that I'm worthy, that I'm significant. And God said, It's got to be fixed, but that's still not the problem. It dropped down to the first layer of my life, And there I saw fear, fear of rejection, fear of being abandoned. I don't perform. If I don't look as good as I do, people won't like me. And the Lord said, that's got to be good too. But that's still not the problem. And then he took me to the basement of my life. And I looked over there in the corner. And I was like, I've never been able to do it. And so I build this edifice. I build this ministry. I build this notoriety. I build big characters, big accomplishments. All good, all good, all good. And when the most intense pressure came, I just moved over to one side and crashed physically. to a significant degree to a significant degree in my life. I believe in God in life. So part of the reason for me telling you this is that if you don't you don't go in your life life. Most of you are younger than me so you can turn back on your system. The love, it's not the years, it's the mileage. Now, the love that we're talking about is not some abstract, sentimental love. If you look closely at the costly love of the father, receiving home the prodigal, prodigal, then you get a glimpse of it. But you get other glimpses. In the Old Testament, you have Hosea, Standing in for God, loving a whore. Damaging her up, going out looking for her, buying her back. God the Father speaks in terms of passion. Speaks in terms of energy, loving energetically and passionately. James Martineau, good example of a father's love. James Martineau, great scholar, great Oxford scholar years ago, went through Oxford. became an instructor at Oxford, got married, and he and his wife had a baby girl who died after six months. They buried her in the schoolyard, they buried her in the churchyard cemetery. And James Martin O'Shaughnessy stayed for another few months, and then he and his wife moved on to other teaching assignments. And at age 60, James Martin O'Shaughnessy died, And he went on alone to write books and to pioneer philosophical ideas to become a great don in the Western education system. And then, at age 80, Oxford brought him back home to one of these appreciation groups, James Martin O'Appreciation Group. And they were going to have meals, and they were going to have testimonial dinners, and they were going to read his words, and they were going to give him honorary degrees, and all this kind of stuff. And it was all nice. It was all good. And about two or three days into the celebration, he snuck away by himself to go to that little graveyard by the side of the church, by the side of the little chapel, and there, bareheaded, knelt in the rain to remember a little girl who died 60 years ago. There wasn't anybody else in all of that country, let alone that town, who remembered that whole world. But James Martin knows it because a father's love never again. A gratitude boy. He's trying. And this love, this passionate, faithful love, has an effect on us. here in his love, not that we loved, but that he first loved us and changed us to being a Wurmbrand. Some of you will recognize the name Richard Wurmbrand. It was mentioned earlier that I did work as a Bible player in Eastern Europe back in the time. I'm sure you're going to be there in Congress. I'm sure you're going to put Christians in jail and stuff like that. Well, I was in prison for a while. And because of that, I got to know a lot of the other people that are sort of in that ministry. One of them was Richard Wurmbrand. Well, Richard was another interesting guy, but the person who really knocked me out was Sabine. She was about four foot nothing, a little Jewish mama. She was converted Jew, both of them. And she was just feisty and brilliant and sharp and full of love. She was just one of the most extreme personalities I had ever met. She and Mother Teresa were saying that she would have been really tight. And Richard told me a story about it. He said, years ago, I was in Bucharest, and I was coming home from the office, and I stopped by a coffee shop, and there was one other man in the coffee shop. And being sort of a compulsive evangelist, I engaged him in a conversation. And I said, what about God in your life? And he said, well, I could never be accepted by God. Why is that? Well, because I participated in the Holocaust. I didn't mean to participate in the Holocaust. He said, well, I was invited to Blinken. I was in charge of the extermination. and I can't, I'm condemned to hell, I felt terrible about it at the time, I feel terrible about it now, but I did it. And I don't deserve God's love. And Richard pulled out all the texts, you know, God so loved you, what would you do to God's son, baby's prep, Jesus' sacrifices enough for you, et cetera, et cetera. And the blood of Christ and Christ of Christ, et cetera. It was all just bouncing off his back. He'd heard it before. And then Richard had an idea. He said, come on home. Now, as they're walking home, let me show you the story. Sabina Wurmbrand's Jewish family were all exterminated at Kablinson. Richard is bringing home a man who participated in the overseeing of the destruction of her mother, her father, her brothers, her sisters, all her aunts, uncles, and cousins. They were all exterminated at Kablinson. Sabina Wurmbrand had been rooted and grounded in God's love. She'd experienced God's love. That's the other part of the story. So Richard comes to the door, brings this guy home, doesn't tell him what's going on. Comes to the door, stands at the door. Sabina is 20 feet across the living room in the kitchen preparing a meal. And Richard says, Sabina, I brought home somebody to have dinner with us, to meet you. And she comes to the door, and she's on her way across the living room to kiss her husband and welcome him home like she always did. And he put up his hand and said, stop, I have to tell you. This is my new friend, Klaus. He was a guard in charge of the extermination detail at Treblinka. He was one of the men that killed the family. And he says, because of that, God could never forgive him. He could never accept him. As the story goes, she immediately started clipping her little, tiny little legs, briskly clipping across the linoleum floor, walked right up to the guy, and the guy's here, he doesn't know. And she reaches up, he's tall, she's short, she reaches up and she grabs his hair, and she pulls his head down to her, and she kisses him passionately on the lips, and wraps her arms around his neck, and holds him, and says, I love you, I love you. and the guy comes on blue he launches he's a bastard converted because somebody out there was rooted and grounded in love and could get the gospel through the hardness and condemnation of the other chain that he's carried around with folks I hold it open to you as a real possibility we have to be responsible we have to be accountable and we can't be soft or sentimental about our love but there is a power in God's love for you that can get you finally free on the other side and have totally forgiven anybody who has abused you or whatever you want that is a possibility I want to hold over to you as all the parts of the richness of the God's love and it all starts by being rooted and grounded in love now what does this all produce? I'll tell you in a word what it produces it produces joy if you ever get to the place where you're rooted and grounded in love and you're regularly giving it out in your words, in your actions you are participating in the love of God there is one response that your whole being has and that is to be bristling with joy let me read you Hebrews chapter 1 1 to 3 in the past God spoke to our forefathers through prophets at many times and in various ways But in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir over all things, and through whom he made all things. The Son is the radiance of God's glory, the exact representation of his being. Talk about healing your view of God. Look at Jesus long enough, and you'll see who God really is, and your view of God is going to be healed. Verse 8. But about the Son, he says, Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated evilness, hated wickedness. Therefore, God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy. When you get in touch with God, when you know God, one of the things that happens to you is joy. Christianity is not keeping laws, it's knowing Christ. Knowing Christ is to know the one anointed with joy. Knowing Christ is to experience his joy. Now I think that it's very interesting that Paul himself is sensitive. Let's turn to Ephesians chapter 1. Sorry, Philippians chapter 1. Let me start reading this. For me to live is Christ and to die is gain. If I am to go on living in this body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know. I am torn between two desires. I desire to be part and be with Christ, which is better. But it is more necessary for me that I remain in the body. And convinced of this, I know that I will remain and will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith. so that through my being with you, your joy in Christ Jesus will overflow on account of me. Now imagine some pastor defining his ministry as producing joy in people. Wouldn't that kind of settle a lot of issues? Before I do anything else, at the end of my ministry, when I get done preaching, when I get done praying, when I get done with my administration, the net result is to produce joy. Paul said elsewhere, I can't remember the passage right now, but some of you will recognize it, I'm pretty tired of it. Paul says, not that we lord it over you, but that we work with you for your joy. Not that we lord it over you, but that we work with you for your joy. I think it's interesting that he is sensitive to the whole issue of spiritual grief. We don't lord it over you. That's not how we get things done. We work for your joy. That's how we get things done. And then here, I mean, imagine the greatest missionary in the history of the world, the greatest genius, the greatest theologian. Humanly speaking, the greatest theologian. I mean, there's a thing that you can hear. And he defines his mission not as planning churches, not as writing theology that then determines the direction of Western culture, not as the exponent of the gospel of God. Not all these big things that you would think. He says, my number one agenda is to produce joy in people. Imagine the greatest genius, the greatest Christian worker ever, defining his ministry as that. I just, you know, I find this interesting. I'd like to die, be far better, but it's more necessary for you that I remain because I have to go to the farthest ends of the earth to plant more churches because you're still screwed up and I've got to write more letters. Because of some theological reflection I yet have to pioneer. No. I'd love to go with Jesus. He's far better. But I'm going to stick around because I have a really high calling. That is to increase your joy. Would you please just read what the text says? That's what it says. That's how he defines his ministry. And he's going to stick around. Although he'd much rather die and depart and be with the Lord, he's going to stick around. He knows. Because there's something lacking in our joy. And I'll tell you what's lacking in the joy of Christian people. You can find it in Galatians. Paul asks, what happened to your joy? He didn't say, what happened to your quiet time? He didn't say, what's happened to your tithing? He didn't say, what's happened to your worship? He says, what has happened to your joy? Something wrong. We know what's wrong, but they've commented on Galatians a lot in the last couple of talks. We know what was wrong. Religion had replaced the relationship with God, and a relationship with God brings joy. If you don't have joy, then there's nothing wrong. And it's not at his end. So, finally, how do we spot a true leader? 1 Peter 1, 29. Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. In his great mercy, he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil, or fade, kept in heaven for you through faith. You are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. In this you greatly rejoice. In this you greatly rejoice. Though now, for a little time, you may have to suffer. Suffering is a part of our Christian life. And you have all kinds of trials. Leaves have come so that your faith is of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire, may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory, and honor when Jesus is revealed. Though you have not seen him, you love him. And even though you do not see him, you believe in him and are filled with inexpressible, glorious joy. For you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your soul. Let me just say this as clearly and unambiguously as I can. The goal of Christian life is not the discipline. It's the joy of the Lord. It's not being happy, although being happy is consumed in joy. It is knowing God and knowing the Son of joy, knowing the joyous Son makes you joyous. And when you have proximity to Jesus, you have that joy. And that is the goal of all ministry. And it cannot possibly ever be abusive. And that's the goal of your Christian life. You can't ever allow yourself to settle for anything less. Okay. There is part of it now, and I'm going to start with that. Thank you.
