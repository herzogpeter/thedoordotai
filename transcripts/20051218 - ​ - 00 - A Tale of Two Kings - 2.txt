Last week I introduced the first of two Advent sermons with what I called the Tale of Two Kings. The Tale of Two Kings was actually the answer to a question. The question being this, what was the world like when Jesus was born? The hopes and fears of all the years is one of the lines of that Christmas carol we sing. So here's the question, what were the hopes and fears that first Christmas mourned? the answer to those questions are revealed at least in part by these two kings who represent and embody the kingdoms of this world who were in power when Jesus was born that first Christmas morn. Two kings who represent and embody actually the best that the kingdoms of this world can produce, particularly as it relates to power, which is what the kingdoms of this world are into, absolute God-like power, as embodied in Caesar Augustus, who we met last week in Luke chapter 2, verse 1. He was the first king. And wealth, mind-boggling wealth, as embodied in Herod, who we are going to meet this week in Matthew chapter 2, verse 1. He is the second king. It says in Matthew 2 verse 1 that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Judea In the days of Herod the king So what was the world like when Jesus was born? What were people afraid of that first Christmas morn? The answer to that question is embodied in these two people Here's what it was like, it was like Caesar Augustus Here's what people were afraid of, they were afraid of Herod the king Last week I said it this way If Caesar Augustus is the historic symbol of an embodiment of people and systems who use their power to crush and control, then Herod, who we're meeting this week, is the historic symbol and embodiment of people and systems who use wealth to exploit, not only making people poor, but keeping them poor. All of which makes this Christmas story much more than sleigh bells ring. Are you listening? For the fact is this. That this, the Christmas story, is the invasion of a rival kingdom with a different kind of king. It is a different kind of kingdom which presses, therefore, this question. The Christmas story presses this question. Whether you know it or not, it does. Which king and which kingdom will you serve? Better question, which king and which kingdom do you serve? Last week we met the Caesars. This week, Herod, considered by some historians, not only the wealthiest man in Jesus' day, but the wealthiest man who ever lives. He was a good politician. He was a master builder. He was also a ruthless killer driven by paranoid jealousy. He was responsible for, among other things, the slaughter of the innocents. You're probably familiar with that story when Herod the king heard that a king of the Jews, he was told that by the Magi, was just born in Israel. He had all of the infant children slaughtered, all the male infant children. That was his paranoia, his jealousy. He killed even his own sons when he heard that there was some sort of plot by them to take over his throne, a plot that, by the way, wasn't true. He had several wives. I think he had 11 wives. He had one of them killed. And what's odd is that the one he had killed, who he also thought was in some sort of plot against him, was the one that most historians thought he actually had some kind of relationship with. When he came close to his death, he did the strangest thing, but again it speaks to his ruthlessness and his paranoia. He had all of the best loved dignitaries of Jerusalem gathered and put in prison with these orders, that upon my death all of them will be slaughtered because he was determined that when he died there would be weeping, in Jerusalem, and he knew that no one would shed a tear over his death, so he made sure people would be sad when he died. This was one sick dude. He was appointed by Caesar, Augustus, to rule as his man in Israel at about 40 BC. To honor Caesar, Herod built statues that looked like him, built altars with inscriptions on the altar saying, Jesus is Lord, and you don't have to do a lot of work to connect the dots in the land of the Jews where graven images were an abomination. You didn't make a graven image even of God, let alone of a man. This was beyond offensive. The point is this. In Israel, the land where Herod ruled, the world that Jesus was born into, Herod was not only feared, he was hated. He came into his wealth the same way Caesar did that we talked about last week through a crippling taxation of the people that he conquered, which made for a very small group of very wealthy people and a very large group of very poor people. Under Herod's rule, the people of Israel lived under the burden of several taxes. There was, for instance, the Roman tribute tax, the Herod tax, the transit trade tax, market exchange tax, and the temple tax. There was a fish and grain tax. The fish and grain tax was particularly burdensome. It was a 50% tax of all the grain and all the fish, and that was burdensome in and of itself. But it's particularly burdensome when you consider that Israel was an agricultural society. People, in other words, lived off of the land, their grain and their fish. So let's say you're a peasant fisherman in the time when Jesus was born. You've been out all day or all night. You come back with your catch waiting for you on the dock would be one of Herod's men called the teloni, which is just a different word for a tax gatherer. He was empowered to take 50% of your tax and give it to Herod. He was also empowered to take whatever he wanted for himself. As long as Herod got his peace, Herod didn't care much what the tax gatherer did. And whatever was left, the fishermen, you, the peasant, you got. So there'd be three fish for Herod, two for me, and maybe one for you. Ten fish for Herod, seven for me, maybe three for you. A hundred for Herod, ninety for me, maybe ten for you. People were starving under the tax burden of Herod. Josephus records that it got so bad that at one point, a delegation from Jerusalem went to Augustus to complain, saying, and this is Josephus writing this, Herod has reduced the entire city to helpless poverty while he's building hot tubs on Masada. So that was the anger. While he's building hot tubs on Masada, the way he's building hot tubs on Masada is by overtaxing us. So there's the picture right there. a very small group of people getting extremely wealthy and a very large group of people having less and less and less. Let me tell you about Masada. There was a legend, actually, that King David, when he was in that season of his life where he was fleeing from King Saul, had spent some time hiding in caves in Masada. That's not much of a stretch. And Gedi, which is where we know David did some of his hiding, is not far from Masada. But whether that's true or not, Herod believed that and said, therefore, in almost a way to kind of spite the Jews and make them even more angry, he said this, if your greatest king hid out like an animal on Masada, then I, the king that you hate, I will live in luxury on Masada. So he built a three-story palace. Here's a picture of it, actually. We can see it on the top of a mountain. It's an amazing thing. Some of you have actually been there. So have I. It's just an incredible thing how he got all that. Here's another picture. I think that's a picture of some storage places. What they did in there was they stored things. This is a picture of the temple, what's left of it, the columns. I'll tell you about those in a minute. And here's a bathhouse where they took baths. It was incredible. It had marble inlaid designs with individual tiles all over this place. Italian columns of solid marble were brought in from Rome. hot and cold water for cold baths and hot tubs on the roof of this palace that I just showed you, he built a pool. There was only one problem with the pool and the hot tubs and all that other stuff. There was no water. In fact, in the first picture, you could see that this was a desert region. There was absolutely no rain. So what he did was rebuild the desert, like you do. That was funny. coming from Jerusalem, 17 miles away. Jerusalem is 17 miles away. And some of you have been to Masada, have taken a bus ride from Jerusalem to Masada. Down the mountain were channels called wadis. He redirected those wadis in such a way that when it did rain, all of the water, as far away as from Masada, as from Jerusalem, was channeled all the way to find its way to huge cisterns that were dug in enormous rocks at the bottom of Masada, thus supplying the water supply and ability to heat them and heat the water and keep it cool. He found a way to store and preserve dates and figs. In the mid-1960s, archaeologists exploring Masada got into one of these storehouses and found some of these figs and these dates that were stored 2,000 years ago. They unwrapped them and they ate them. And then they went looking for Herod's bathroom, which was apparently still working. something was still working at one point he wanted to build a city along the coastline because he knew that he'd make a lot of money if he could redirect the shipping lanes through this particular section of land it was a problem, a minor problem the land there was unbuildable it was too swampy so he rebuilt the coastline like you do he drained the marshes built a 520 acre harbor with concrete he brought in from Italy. He poured it, this is 2,000 years ago, he poured this concrete 80 feet down under the ocean surface, 100 feet wide 2,000 years ago. He built an underground sewage system that would drain with the tides. The nearest water source, again, that water thing is a problem, was 19 miles away in this case, so he built aqueducts 19 miles long that descended, get this, that descended one centimeter every meter for 19 miles. Those aqueducts, there are still some ruins of those, and you can still see them, and they still have some of these same measurements. The name of that city, a familiar name to many of us, Caesarea, which he, again, named after Caesar to keep him happy. He was interested in two things, himself and himself. That's why he was always being nice to Caesar, because he didn't care about Caesar, he cared about himself. one day he saw Caesarea after it had been completed from the perspective of a ship out in the water and he didn't like how the city looked so he had it covered with marble, the whole thing to this day if you walk the beach in Caesarea shards of marble are there from when the city was destroyed in 70 AD but my favorite thing relative to what he did and obviously he was a master builder everything he did he did big was a palace that he built called the Herodian. The Herodian named after himself on this occasion. He wanted to build a palace between Jerusalem and his hometown in Edom. So he picked a spot between Jerusalem and Edom right in the middle, but there was a problem. He wanted to build this temple or this palace on top of a mountain. The problem was this. There was no mountain. So he built a mountain. Like you do. In fact, there's a picture of it here. That's the mountain that Herod built from nothing. Now, I don't know how you build a mountain. Maybe there's a place where there used to be a mountain and there isn't one anymore. Or there's a great big hole right next to this. I don't know. But there's a mountain. Can you see the palace on top of the hill? Me neither. I can't see it. It's up there somewhere. He called it the Herodian, as I said already. It had a pool nine feet deep with a gazebo in the middle. You could only get to by boat. Everything he did, he did big, which is why he really does represent and embody the best that kingdoms of this world can produce relative to power and wealth. Unquestioned power, he's the man. Unquestioned wealth, he's the man. One day, Jesus was with his disciples at a spot on the Mount of Olives. The story is found in Mark chapter 11. A spot on the Mount of Olives where you could actually see this Herodian palace with the Dead Sea kind of in the background. And in that scene from the Mount of Olives, looking at the Herodian palace with the Dead Sea in the background, Jesus said to his disciples, who didn't, it was a lot like you and me, we don't always dial into what Jesus is actually saying until you have time to think about it. He said to them a most amazing thing. In Mark 11, he said this, If you have faith, you could say to this mountain, Be cast into the sea. And it will. To which, I'm quite sure those disciples said, or at least might have said, Yeah, right. Because the mountain Jesus was talking about, they would have known, wasn't just any mountain. He wasn't just giving this principle about walking up to random mountains and going, I commend you, be gone. It didn't leave. He wasn't talking about doing tricks. He was talking, and they would have known, he was talking about Herod's Mountain. He was talking about Herod's Mountain. He was talking about a system. Kingdoms of this world. What he was saying is, these kingdoms that look so big and insurmountable, and as if they will never end, those kingdoms are going down. If you believe. If you enter into this different kind of kingdom, disciples, that you still don't understand. Because it's so confusing. Because the kingdom I'm bringing, when it comes, it comes like a mustard seed. It looks like a baby. It looks like the least significant. But if you believe, and you enter into this kingdom, you're entering into a much, much bigger kingdom than this puny mountain. Because that mountain, into the sea, promise. beloved this is the Christmas story not Santa Claus and sleigh bells not idyllic scenes of winter wonderland though there's nothing wrong with that I shouldn't enjoy it no go ahead but the Christmas story to not be confused is the invasion of a rival kingdom it is a different kind of kingdom with a different kind of king you know it's really interesting to me anyway how Jesus was never intimidated by the Herods or the Caesars or what they represented like you and I would be and are and it wasn't because he was such a tough guy but because he saw a different kingdom he really lived in a different story and he lived in it at a time when no one else could always you couldn't always see the bigger kingdom. You couldn't always see the bigger story, but Jesus lived in it. And so Herod and Caesar, as big and scary as they were, and even did have the potential and ended up nailing him to a cross and killing him, it was still, that is still a smaller story than the story he was living in. His story was longer, Jesus. His story was bigger, and he knew it. That's why he was rarely intimidated. Let me give you an example. Jesus, in his ministry years, Didn't have to deal directly with Herod, because Herod ended up dying by the time Jesus grew up and began his ministry. But he had to deal with his sons. When Herod died, he had three sons who all wanted a piece of their father's empire, and Caesar actually did kind of divide it up between them. So in wanting to get their little piece, when their father died, they went to Rome to have Caesar sorted out. Unbeknownst to them, when they were all going to Rome to have Caesar sort this out, a delegation of 50 dignitaries from Jerusalem also went to Rome to basically say and plead with Caesar Augustus, please don't let the sons of Herod rule this thing. They despised them and they feared them, particularly one of the sons named Archelaus. Well, Caesar ignores this appeal and almost again, despite the Jews in Jerusalem, picks the one they fear the most, Archelaus, and makes him ruler of Judea. The first thing Archelaus does when he gets back to Jerusalem is call the 50 dignitaries that ultimately he found out about, called them into his palace, and executed all 50 of them on the spot. The point is this, and he's making a point that, you know, big kingdom of this world type of people need to make. I'm the king. I'm in charge. I am a king. I have a kingdom. Don't mess with me. I am the one with the power. I am the one with the wealth. I am the one who wins. And that was his message when he killed the 50 dignitaries. Now, with that in mind, that actual, real-life, historic story in mind, look with me at Luke 19, beginning in verse 11. This is a parable of the kingdom that Jesus is bringing. But again, he's talking about a different kind of kingdom with a different kind of king. It starts in verse 11. It says this. You can read it on the screen. There it is. And while they were listening to these things, he went to tell a parable because he was near Jerusalem. And he told it this way because he was near Jerusalem. And they supposed that the kingdom of God was going to appear remedial. And he said, therefore, a certain nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself and then return. And he called ten of his slaves and gave them ten minas and said to them, Do business with this until I come back. But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, We do not want this man to reign over us. And it came about that when he returned after receiving the kingdom, he ordered that these slaves to whom he had given the money be called to him in order that he might know what business they had done. Verse 27, But these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them in my presence. Does that sound familiar at all? What's going on here? Now, he goes on in this text to tell the parable of the talents. A parable that he has told in different places and in other gospels and in different scenarios. It was like a good parable. so it preached. But here in Jerusalem, and that's why the thing in, he was near Jerusalem. This time, when he told that parable he told before, when he did it in Jerusalem, where Herod's son is ruling the same way Herod did, with fear and intimidation and power over, he tells it this way, as if to say, I don't know if there was a twinkle in his eye, but I kind of see a twinkle in his eye. It's as if to say, hey, you guys, here's a good one. Let me tell you a story. Did you hear the one about the guy who goes, off to be king. But the people hate his guts so much that they send a delegation to vote him off the island. But it doesn't work. And he kills them all. Now, if you're listening to Jesus tell this story near Jerusalem, it doesn't take a rocket science to connect the dots. You know this story. You know exactly what he's saying. You know exactly who he's talking about. And here's the deal. You just don't talk that way about rulers crowned by Rome. And anyone listening to Jesus tell this parable, I don't even, I bet you the people listening wouldn't have even heard the parable because they would have just said, he is in so much trouble. But see, Jesus had the strangest way of acting as if someone really was in a whole lot of trouble, but it wasn't him. I think Herod's in a whole lot of trouble. why? because he was big and brash no, no here's why he saw a whole different kingdom he was living in an entirely different story much bigger than the puny little story of the Caesars and the Herods of this world but in the little slice of life that we have and it was real in Jesus' day too It's the Herods and the Caesars who look to be the kings. Got the bigger story? Got the bigger kingdom? It's not the truth. See, Herod's mountain, the kingdoms of this world, will be cast into the sea. But part of the Christmas story's punch is that it will be brought down in most unusual ways. It's not just that the kingdoms of this world are not eternal and they will not last. But the irony or the subtlety, if you will, of the Christmas story is the way these kingdoms will be brought down in the most unusual, unassuming, subversive ways. Like through a 14-year-old peasant girl named Mary who simply said when she heard of the possibility of this kind of kingdom, two words. I believe. Jesus said to the disciples, if you believe, these kingdoms are going down. Mary said, I believe, be it done unto me, just as you said. Let me illustrate this whole subversive dynamic of the kingdom of God as it relates to the Christmas story with another story. Luke chapter 3. Luke chapter 3, verse 1, says this. Now in the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar. Now this is speaking, this is past the birth of Jesus, but it's still in his lifetime obviously, and it's just as his ministry is about to begin. It's in the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was Tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was Tetrarch of the region of Iteria and Trachonitis, and Lysanias, whatever it was, Tetrarch of Abilene, in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John. Here's my question. Why all those names? Pontius Pilate, Tiberius Caesar, Herod the Tetrarch, Philip the Tetrarch. Why all those names? Before he says that the word of the Lord came to John. Well, you know, maybe he gets paid by the word. I don't know. the fact is this I think those names are in there on purpose it is entirely intentional that he names those names we're in verses 1 and 2 he has identified, dial into this he has intentionally, Luke the writer he has identified all the powers of all the kingdoms of this world he's named them by name but the word of the Lord did not come to them significant. This is the kingdom message. This is the Christmas message. It didn't come to Caesar. It didn't come to Herod, Herod's son, the chief priests, or Pilate. It did not come to all the people who have all the power and all the money and all the status in the kingdoms of this world. Instead, it came to an untitled, unwashed, rag-wearing, locust-eating hermit in the desert, Which means, among other things, this. That the kingdom of God, when the kingdom of God comes, everything gets turned upside down. Because now who counts and who doesn't? Who makes a difference and who doesn't? Who has power and who doesn't? Who is truly wealthy and who isn't? Who's in a whole lot of trouble and who isn't? Gets all mixed up. It's what Dallas Willard calls the great inversion. of the kingdom of God where those who exalt themselves will be brought low eventually. Trust me, the mountain's going into the sea. Where those who have been humbled and humbled themselves will be exalted. It's where a young peasant girl named Mary from a tiny town of Nazareth is told that she will bear a son by the power of the Holy Spirit and you can call his name Jesus which caused her to erupt with a song of astonished praise. My soul doth magnify the Lord. Why? Because he has exalted the humble and the poor, but the mighty and the rich go away empty-handed. What is going on here? It is the subversive story of the kingdom of God. Merry Christmas. This is the Christmas story. Where all of our ideas, again, of who counts and who doesn't, who makes a difference and who doesn't, who has real power and real wealth is turned upside down so that now you just never know where God might show up. You just never know who God might use. Because he might use a 14-year-old peasant girl named Mary. He might use a locust-eating camel hair wearing hermit like John. He might even use somebody like you. So Merry Christmas. Let me wrap this up with one more contrast of kingdoms that Christmas speaks to. Embodied not in the tale of two kings, but in the tale of two cities. First city, Sepphoris. The second city, not actually a city at all. It's a little town called Nazareth. Sepphoris. A city built by Herod, called by the historian Josephus the Ornament of Galilee, with a palace much like the others that he built in Masada and Caesarea. It had a huge gymnasium, did Sepphoris, the palace in Sepphoris. Public baths with pools lined with marble. It had archives. It had a bank, a large temple. a theater that seated 5,000 people like his other projects. Herod funded the city of Sepphoris, this incredibly wealthy city, with a system of taxation that left a very small group of people very, very rich and a very large group of people very, very poor. The second city or town is Nazareth, as I tell the tale of two cities. Most of us know Nazareth and are familiar with that as being the town where Jesus grew up. What many of us don't know is that Nazareth was only three to four miles from Sepphoris. To call Nazareth insignificant is an understatement. The entire town fit on about 10 acres of land. our church, to give you some perspective, this church building that you're sitting in right now is on about 50 acres of land. The population of Nazareth at the time of Jesus' birth was around 200 people. In the memoirs of Josephus, the historian, he mentions 45 cities in Galilee. He never mentions Nazareth once. Why? It was insignificant. Who cares about Nazareth? In the ancient rabbinic writings, all the writings of the mission in the Talmud, 63 towns in Galilee are mentioned. Nazareth is never mentioned once. There were no public buildings in Nazareth. No paved roads or sewage system. No gold or silver coins were ever excavated from Nazareth. No tiled roofs, marbled floors, frescoed walls. There was no massive pool with a gazebo in the middle that you could only reach by boat. Their food consisted of bread, olives, some vegetables, and fish. skeletal remains of that time reveal regular deficiencies in iron and protein of the people who lived in Nazareth in Jesus' day. So a case of the flu, an infected tooth, a very bad cold could be fatal if you grew up there. Half the population died at childbirth. So whatever romantic idea you had of Jesus being born in the barn, isn't that cute? Wasn't cute to marry. half the people half the population in Nazareth died at childbirth the average life expectancy was mid-30s N.T. Wright says that you do not have an accurate picture of Jesus if you don't understand this about him he was a Jewish peasant that was his life end quote and the fact that that was his life shaped him the fact that he grew up in that town Just like wherever it was that you grew up, it shaped you, for better or for worse. So if you picture Jesus and his family in contemporary American terms of maybe being a small business, upward mobility and financial security, you have the wrong idea. People in Nazareth weren't hoping their kids would go to college. They were hoping that they could somehow pay the Herod tax so they would have enough to eat, that their babies would be born alive, and that maybe their husbands or wives would live to maybe 35. That shaped Jesus, living in Nazareth. What dawns on me about that, and when I let that in, that that's what shaped his view of the world and other things as well, what dawns on me about that is that I've been shaped by Sepphorus. So have you. Because we grew up in Sepphoris. That's where we live right now. We don't live in Nazareth. Remember last week I asked you, where are you in the story? Where are you in the story? Well, where are you in this one? You're in Sepphoris. That's where you are. It's an incredible room. This is a Sepphoris room. That's what shaped us. And then, you know, feel bad about it. No, don't feel bad about it. It's where you grew up. But you need to dial into that. You need to understand that. Because that's where you and I have developed our understanding of wants and needs. By what Sepphoris tells us are our wants and needs. That's where all of that was formed in you and me. About what we have to have to be content. Particularly at Christmas when we're all, you know, have the pastor, I hope you talk about consumerism. We live in Sepphoris. And Sepphoris has shaped. Why are my kids? Because they live in Sepphoris. Why is it never enough? Because they live in Sepphoris. that Decephoros is where we were formed and developed our ideas about what we think God owes us and should provide Jesus taught his disciples to pray this way give us this day our daily bread but knowing that Jesus grew up in Nazareth I have this weird feeling he prayed that differently like he felt different things in his spirit when he prayed it I mean, see, that prayer, knowing where Jesus lived and how where he lived shaped how he thought, it makes me wonder who among us would be satisfied with bread. Give us this day our daily bread. It better be really good bread. Maybe it makes me wonder if Jesus grew up with different expectations and demands of God. God will provide this. than the expectations and demands I have. Makes me wonder if the Jesus who grew up in Nazareth heard me pray for what I want and expect and demand and get all pouty when God, I think, doesn't give me what I want. I wonder if the Jesus who grew up in Nazareth would hear some of us pray for what we expect God to give us. I wonder if he would even get it. Wouldn't even be necessarily mad at you. He'd just go, what? And see, I think Jesus knew God. Sepphoris was built on a hill. Richard Beatty, in his book called New Light on Sepphoris in the Urban World of Jesus, says, Just ten minutes walking distance north of Nazareth brings you to the top of a ridge, overlooking the Bet-Netophe Valley. From there, you could see the hill of Sepphoris, three miles north, rising 400 feet from the valley floor, end quote. Josephus, as I told you already, called Sepphoris the ornament of Galilee. You know what they called Sepphoris in Nazareth? A city set on a hill that can't be hid. Jesus, you know, remember that in Matthew 5, speaking of how you come into the kingdom and what the kingdom people live like. Blessed are the broken, blessed are the poor in spirit. And when he got done with that message, he was speaking to people who were coming into the kingdom broken and dependent on God and mourning over their sin and coming to God desperately for their very life. And then he looked at them and says, you are the light of the world. And I got news for you. A city set on a hill can't be hid. And I ain't talking about sufferers. But that's where the phrase came from. It came from where Jesus grew up. And with that information, you can almost picture Jesus as a little boy playing with his friends, wandering to the top of that ridge and just noticing Sepphorus. Some speculate that as a carpenter, Jesus probably worked in Sepphorus with his father. I think that's a pretty good guess. Actually, historians tell us that Herod routinely conscripted craftsmen, tekton is what their word technically was called, to build his buildings. In Matthew 6, 3, we're told that Jesus was a carpenter. Interesting because the Greek word for carpenter is tekton, Which means he was a carpenter, craftsman. I have no doubt in my mind that at some point in Jesus' life, he probably spent some time working in Sepphoris. It was three miles from his house. He could see it from where he lived. And when he was in Sepphoris, I'm sure he noticed the gap between the rich and the poor, and that shaped him too. The Spirit of the Lord has anointed me. He has given me a gospel to preach the gospel to the poor. Pull it together. He grew up as a peasant boy, three miles away from luxury and wealth, and being around it, being able to see it, undoubtedly made him think, you know, that's just about as good as it gets, that city over there. The kings and kingdoms of this world, they just don't do it much better than what Herod's done right there. But here's the deal you really need to dial into. While he would have acknowledged that, I'm quite sure, I don't think he envied them. And you know what else? He didn't hate them either. Oh, rich guy. He didn't hate them either. Or aspired to be like them. Or preach a gospel that said, if you follow me, everything that Seppurus has to offer, you can have. He didn't preach that gospel. Why? Because he was bringing a different kingdom. He was living in a different story. Much, much bigger. That's why he didn't envy Sepphoris. Didn't hate Sepphoris. It was just such a different story he was living in. Much bigger kingdom than what Herod could conceive or Sepphoris could contain. Odd, isn't it? Dial into this. That in Jesus' day, everybody knew about Sepphoris. It was the ornament of Galilee. A city set on a hill that can't be hid. Hardly anybody knew about Nazareth. Today, everybody knows about Nazareth. Hardly anybody knows about Sepphorus. Well, except for you. Why? Here's why. Because something was going on in that poor, tiny, insignificant town that was part of a much bigger story than what Herod could conceive or Sepphorus could contain. Something that raises the question again. about who is really safe and secure and who isn't, about who is really wealthy and who is really poor, about who's in a whole lot of trouble and who is in no trouble at all. Because 2,000 years ago, beloved, Caesar and Herod looked to be the safe ones. 2,000 years ago, Caesar and Herod looked to be the secure ones, the rich and powerful ones. But as it turned out, they were temporary kings of a temporary kingdom. It was a Jewish peasant from Nazareth who was a different kind of king, bringing a different kind of kingdom, all of which is why Mary sang, My soul doth magnify the Lord. Herod, Caesar, scary and big and bold kings, But you, would say Mary, are the Lord, the famous one.
