I'm worried about this fasting stuff. I had to make a decision here about what was going to win. Image your honesty, and I chose honesty. That, on the one hand, will give encouragement. When you're honest like this, it's like in some ways it feels like you're in an A group and someone says, well, I fell this last week or something. But it gives permission for other people to accept themselves in the midst of their failings. Because my experience of spiritual discipline has been that it is an up and down kind of thing. And you've got to be okay with the fact that sometimes you blow it and you don't do okay. The other thing, though, is I know from past experience that one of the things that will happen to me next week, this always happens, is that there will be a voice in my head that says, Oh, it's not that big of a deal. Look at last week you went ahead and ate. Do you remember how good that felt when you ate? And there's that voice there. and so now you've got to anticipate that in fact in any kind of thing that you're trying to get out of any kind of addiction you're trying to get out of whether it's food addiction or nicotine addiction or whatever when you fall when you go back there will always be that voice there calling you back in fact even before then there's a voice there calling you back you know I'm a hamburger or I'm a cigarette and come on it's not that big of a deal that's the main thought, it's not that big of a deal it's no big deal but when you fall I'm making it sound so cataclysmic there's that thing you've gone one step in programming yourself for failure and you've got to understand that's going to happen that oh yeah, we know about this you tried this last week and it didn't work and that's true of all the disciplines there's always going to be that voice there we talked last week about centering prayer let's just review this I want to see if there's any questions about it the process of calming oneself down the breathing exercises speaking the name of God reciting spiritual truths as ways of clearing the mind so that we can have a clear reception of the Lord focusing on the cross or focusing on a picture of Jesus or something like that sometimes helps and I conclude by talking about that some who have the gift of speaking in tongues and for some of those individuals they find that speaking in tongues is a way of having more focused prayer are there any questions about any of that before we move on I want to take 30 seconds to see if there's any questions about it yes the other thing you said is also kind of revealing and that's that I used to do this but for some reason forgot I found that to be true of anything beneficial ever in my life with regard to spiritual things there's something about spiritual things uh it's the constant influence of the the carnal realm that you forget this stuff it's like you you know you've had maybe times in prayer where it's just like this is so great this is so wonderful you you it's so refreshing and i want to do this all the time but the next morning it's like starting from scratch you forget it it's like the reality of god is something and the things pertaining to it it's a reality that it's not like physical reality it's always there whether you want to be there or not, you forget this. And that's why you find in Scripture a reoccurring theme is that God tells the Israelites, especially to remind yourself of, remind yourself of this, remind yourself of my truth, my statutes and my commands, remind yourself of the wondrous works, call to your memory, et cetera, et cetera. That's why I encourage you taking notes and going over this stuff, because it's so, you forget it. You know, you get into it, you do it well, you benefit from it, and then somehow it slips. And all of a sudden you realize it's not there anymore. Hopefully you realize it's not there anymore. We're going to talk about resting in Christ. And this, again, is the result of pulling together a lot of different sources on this discipline. I spoke with a young lady just the other day who was telling me over and over again how unworthy she was, how worthless she was, how stupid her life was. And she was going on and on about this whole thing, and it was the result of being raised in her parents who didn't want her and a lot of other kind of ugly, ugly stuff. But she knew she was a Christian, and she knew where she was at before the Lord. We reviewed all this stuff, and she knew that she was loved by God and worthwhile by God, and that it didn't matter what her parents thought or whatever. And yet, she didn't feel any of that. She never experienced any of it. It was all in her head. It was head knowledge. It was cerebral material, but it never got down to the heart. And that's the case with all of us to some degree, that we know a lot more than we ever experience. What resting in Christ is, what I'm calling resting in Christ, is a way that I have found and many have found to take some of this head stuff and bring it down to the heart. This isn't the only way. It happens a lot of different ways. When you enter into worship fully and you're just praising God and singing songs, maybe then all of a sudden you begin to feel some of the stuff you're singing about. You're singing about God's mercy. all of a sudden you feel his mercy, singing about his love or singing about his power, and you begin to experience it. That's the head stuff getting down to the heart stuff. Well, resting in Christ is another way that this can occur, and it's, I think, a real vital aspect of the Christian life. To kind of set it up, all you need to have is some time that you set aside to do just one thing, and that is to rest in the Lord. A time that you set aside once a week, maybe once a night, however much you feel you need it, but I would make the point of, and this is true of all devotional stuff, commit yourself to the time, because if you don't commit yourself to it, if you leave it to happen whenever you get a chance, you'll never get a chance. Or you'll get a chance for one week and then two weeks, but then by the third and fourth weeks, all of a sudden it's not really there anymore. This is the aspect of discipline, committing yourself to some time. I like to think about it as a date, my date with Jesus, my time to be with the Lord. And I especially think about resting in Christ as that time, where I'm going to just have a romantic kind of relationship with the Lord. This isn't a time where I'm going to talk about prayer, petitions, and needs in my life, and things of that sort. This is my time just to relax in His presence, to let Him be Him, and to let me be me. And I see it as kind of a date, and I wouldn't want to break a date with my wife. And so how much more should I not want to break a date with Jesus? You've got to commit yourself to it. Because our lives being what they are and being as busy as they are, you know how it is. If you don't make it a high priority, it just goes, it's gone. On this kind of stuff, you can't wait around until you get time to do it. If your project is to see how close you can get to God, then this has to take a high priority. To start off with, what I recommend is this, to have this time. And to begin with, just to tell yourself the truth. The truth about who you are and who Christ is. I take sometimes biblical affirmations, what the Bible says about me, what God thinks about me, and I just say things like, I'm loved by God. That's the true thing. I'm loved by God. God rejoices over me with great rejoicing. God cares about me. I'm God's little kid. I'm precious in God's sight. God loves me so much, He died for me. God's arms embrace me right now. And just know that that is true about you, whatever else is true about you. However far along in the Christian walk you are, or however far back you are in the Christian walk, if you believe in Jesus Christ, these things are true about you. Whether you can experience them or not. This is what I told this young lady. She said, I never feel loved by God, I never feel worthwhile, I never feel valuable or whatever. My response to her was to say this, the truth of these things, the truth of the scriptural material doesn't hang upon whether you can feel it or not. it's good to feel it and eventually i think you will but the reason you're not feeling it is because you've been wounded and your your emotional nervous system has been severed and the way that they'll start to get those nerves connected is by being transformed by the renewing of your mind by telling yourself the truth so don't worry about the fact that you don't feel it right now don't try hard to feel it don't try to work up some kind of emotional experience just enjoy the fact that it's true about you whether or not you ever felt it whether or not you ever got healthy even if the rest of your life is miserable in all respects at least there's this one happy point and that's that jesus loves you and if nothing else it can be the bright part of your day to remind yourself of that fact forget about the emotion or whatever just remind yourself of the fact that you're valuable in the lord so i just tell myself i just enjoy that time i'm loved by God. A second step in this, and I'm not giving something that's chronological when you sit down every time you rest with the Lord. Actually, I see these more as sort of stages you go through in the exercise of resting with the Lord. When you get good at this, when you can tell yourself this and believe it, then try to hear the Lord say the truth to you. Here it becomes to be more personal and see the more personal something is the more concrete something is the more transforming something is abstract truths do not transform us it's just abstract truths are wonderful but they don't have the power to impact our life and to transform our life so i can know that god this young lady can know that god loves the world jesus died for sinners such as as as her she can know that truth but it's abstract what's concrete to her what's real in her her in her mind is the voice of her father saying you're a worthless person or the voice of her mother saying you know you're no good nothing or what have you that's concrete and unless you have something equally concrete to counteract it you're never going to be transformed out of it so here becomes a little bit more personalized hear the lord say and and and and ask the holy spirit to help begin to make this a reality hear the lord say greg i love you with an everlasting love greg you are my child and just just just hear that say it in your mind because it's true greg you are my child my arms are around you greg i give perfect peace to those whose eyes are stayed upon him and lord greg your your eyes are stayed on me greg i see you holy and spotless in my sight i've perfected you once and for all nothing anyone else ever says about you really matters if that's what i say about you and have and just let the holy spirit personalize it for you one of the central jobs of the holy spirit is to point us to jesus christ john 16 tells us that he points us to the person of jesus christ by pointing us he makes jesus christ real to us concrete to us so just just hear those words again don't worry about what you feel about it or or what other emotions there might be just know that it's true and hear the Lord say it to you. In truth, the Lord is saying it to you all the time. The problem is that we, under the deception of the flesh, don't readily hear it. We're not open to it. A third step might be to do this, to see yourself in the truth. See yourself as you truly are. You do see yourself some way or other. I mean, you have a self-image. You have a way of thinking about yourself, a way of talking to yourself, and a way of picturing yourself. We'll talk more about this when we get to the next discipline when we talk about mind control but what you're doing here is allowing the lord to give you a different picture of yourself can you begin to picture yourself as loved i don't know what that might look like for you but picture yourself as love picture yourself as valuable picture yourself as being filled with the spirit of god picture yourself as being filled with the love of god picture yourself as being filled with the peace of god can you get a picture of yourself doing that sometimes people have trouble picturing themselves I mean, I do. I have trouble picturing my face for some reason. I have trouble picturing that. And so what I sometimes use is a photo. Get a photograph, look at myself, and then get a picture of myself. What do I look like when I'm really in line with what is true about me in Jesus Christ? What do I look like? And what kind of demeanor do I have? What kind of activity do I do? What kind of love do I show forth? What kind of peace do I have? Picture yourself as you are in the truth. It may be that you have a real poor self-image, a real kind of failure complex, a real inferiority complex. Maybe you're a real anxious person. You're worried all the time. Maybe you totally lack self-confidence. Maybe you've got stage fright. Maybe you fear rejection. I don't know all the things that characterize you. But what do you look like in Jesus Christ? What do you look like if the new person that's on the inner self were to completely manifest himself to the outer man? if the if the butterfly were to break out of the cocoon what would you look like because until you can see yourself a certain way you can never become yourself a certain way the mind's the rudder of the ship the final the final stage and i'm kind of working up to this because this is the one that that is most difficult for people but i also think it's one that's most important and that is to see christ telling you to see christ telling to you or maybe just expressing to you with his eyes or with a hug what is true. See, it's good to know it. It's good to know it, and you first have to make sure that you know it. Know the truth. In fact, if you can just be who you are honestly and know what is true, then you can be healed of anything. It comes down to that. And if you know who you are and you're honest with yourself where you're at and know what is true, all growth comes out of those two things here it's it's it's a matter of of seeing as concretely as possible jesus come to you and tell you what is true about you first you know it then you hear it and now try to see it and here's what i recommend and and this is just something that works well for me and um i i i would have tried in this class except that i've done it before in other classes and in the interest of time, I thought maybe it would be better just to leave that to you to do on your own. But I like to have, in these times of wrestling, I like to have music in the background, especially when I'm doing this one, to have music in the background. I like a certain kind of music. You might like a different kind of music, but the kind of music I like is usually soundtracks from sappy movies. Like the soundtrack from Fried Green Tomatoes. Has anybody seen that show? Oh, that is just a wonderful show. That's a great show. And the soundtrack is just like, ugh, it just melts me. Or the soundtrack from Somewhere in Time, or the soundtrack from Kevin Costner's movie, The Wilderness, what's that called? Dances with Wolves. See, that kind of stuff just, ugh. And that's a good thing, because that melts some of the calluses of my heart. I think the reason why God gave us music, part of the thing that music does is it melts us. It makes us more palpable. we're moldable. And that's the kind of position we want to be in. I don't think that's any kind of manipulation or anything. It's just a fact. That's why it's good sometimes for married couples. I'm speaking to married couples now. Don't just be with each other watching the news. Put on some romantic music. Put on some nice Dvorak or something. If you want to get the flames rekindled, music really helps. And that's not manipulation. That's just fact. I think that's the reason why God gave it to us. So I like to have some nice music in the background. Other people like it quiet, but music helps melt me. What I do, and this is kind of something that you brought up a little bit ago, is I usually, not always, but usually have a private place that I go to. What I sometimes recommend to individuals who are just starting this is because as adults, we lose the ability of our mind to image. As little kids, we have an imagination, which is simply the mind's ability to make images. But we kind of lose that because we're such an abstract culture, a theoretical culture. And so sometimes you need to rekindle some of this. Well, memory is a part of your image-making ability. When you remember things, you're imagining. You're recalling an image. And so one way to help this is to think of a place, maybe as a little child, that was a safe place to you or a nice place to you, where there's some fond memories. and try to recall that place as vividly as possible try out different places in your memory i i a lot of times go to this little clearing i grew up in lansing michigan and there's a little clearing in the forest we had woods all around us and in this in this woods there's a little clearing in the forest at one time i used to go there a lot as a little kid um whenever i was really sad i'd go there it was kind of my secret spot i think it was only about you know a quarter of mile from my house, but it was like my secret spot. No one else in the world knew about it. I even buried a treasure there one time. I think it's still there. I went to, I remember falling asleep. I was playing army by myself in the woods and I came to my opening and I fell asleep in this opening, or actually right by the side of it. And then when I woke up, there's this lead, the sound of the evergreens and the wind blowing through the evergreens was all around me. I think that's kind of what woke me up, this, and I remember just laying there kind of being enchanted. In fact, to this day, whenever I hear the sound of wind whistling through evergreens, I get this kind of, you know, ethereal feeling about me. It's like, oh, you know, a space connect time or something, and I remember waking up there, I just was so peaceful. I remember just being so peaceful. In fact, I thought I could hear. I was a little Catholic kid, so I had a lot of stuff in my head. I always took religion very seriously though i never could live by it but i i i thought i thought i heard angels whispering in the trees i thought i didn't really move i was kind of half asleep but i thought there's angels whispering all around it was just like one of those magic moments that you always remember and uh now i can look back and i can see the role that that little space played in my life because i had i had looking back i didn't realize at the time but looking back and i can see that i had a pretty pretty troubled childhood and this was kind of a retreat for me i always would go there when i was sad or whatever and i would just be and now i go there i i very oftentimes will picture this scene in this woods with the sound of the trees and it's my private sanctuary and now it's gotten to the point and this is what will happen if you if you make a habit out of this is that when i when i sit down i immediately can picture that scene and i'm immediately in the mode where i can really have a fruitful encounter with the lord i associate that place like like with a cathedral or something I associate that place with meeting God. And so just to recall that place puts me in that whole atmosphere where now I can really meet God and have some fruitful things happen. I encourage you to have a private place. A lot of spiritual writers talk about this. St. Teresa of Avia called it her interior castle, a place where you can go. I don't know if you know what I'm talking about, but it's a retreat within. It's your inner space where you can just leave the world temporarily and go and retreat there. Richard Foster just wrote a book. I haven't read the book, but I read a review of it, and he talks a lot about this. It's called Prayer as Coming Home or something like that. He talks about when we pray, we are most at home with ourselves. Our true home is in prayer. And that's the kind of feeling I get is when I pray, I have my own space here, my own little private place to meet Jesus. And that's where I'm most at home in the world, right here in this place. I'm immediately focused when I go there. Because of associations, I'm not as distracted. Not that I always have a real clear, perfect picture of the place, but it helps me get focused by imaging this place. So I encourage you to have this private place. It could be a place in your memory. It doesn't have to be, but it sometimes works best to go to a place that you've actually experienced because that helps you to get a concrete image of it. Sometimes, though, I go to a mountaintop. Other times I picture myself coming up to Jesus after the Sermon on the Mount. And it's kind of this thing where all these people are leaving, and they're talking about his sermon. And I worm my way against the crowd, and then when all the crowd is gone, and we're on this hill, and I can feel the wind blowing, and there's that whistling sound still, and the wheat or the grass is just kind of flowing. And there I meet Jesus. We start talking. When you have your private place, when you're set up there, try to picture Jesus. What he looks like is not important. We don't know what Jesus looked like. We've got a lot of pictures of him. But what he looked like physically is not important. The color of his eyes or the length of his beard or the shape of his nose. Those are things that are utterly irrelevant. What is vitally important is the divinity that shines through those characteristics. The love that shines through those characteristics. What do his eyes say to you? What do his arms say to you? You know, the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the image of God, the form of God, the expression of God. To see him is to see the Father. And so what is vital is that you see the character of Jesus and the love of Jesus, God embodied in flesh, shine through that flesh. That's what's crucial. And if you have the biblical Jesus, if you're thinking about the biblical Jesus, and that's the only kind of Jesus we ever want to deal with, that love will shine through at this time. I picture Jesus, when I'm in this opening in the forest, I picture Jesus coming to me, walking across this opening. The sun used to always shine through the trees, and it used to create this kind of circle there in this opening. And I see Jesus walk through there. And we begin our encounter. I say, see, feel, and hear, etc., vividly. what I'm getting at is try to picture all of this imagine all of it as vividly as possible Saint Ignatius of Loyola and Francis of DeSalle they recommend they're 16th century authors they recommend using all five of your senses try to employ all your senses in your encounter with the Lord bring it all to recollection try to see things as detailed as possible, smell things, hear things touch things as vividly as possible, and then try to see Jesus in this encounter. When I initially meet Jesus, I at least frequently have a kind of feeling of unworthiness. When you see his love and you see his holiness, I immediately, a lot of my stuff kind of comes to the surface. And I know that it's safe to do that because I know whom I'm dealing with. I know that this is the one who saves me by his grace, so I can say out loud the things that are really there. And that's what I recommend you to do. Be exactly who you are and know what is true. Say what is on your heart. The fears that are there, the anxieties that are there, the worries that are there. Just be real. Just be real and let him love you as you really are in the midst of all that you are. What all this is doing is it's taking biblical truth, which is otherwise abstract, and making it very concrete. And as I said a number of times throughout this summer, I really believe that this is largely what 2 Corinthians 3.18 is getting at. When Paul says that as we behold the Lord, as through a reflection in our mind, we are transformed from one degree of glory to another. You see, it's as I see Jesus' love towards me. I give him all the reasons why he shouldn't love me. How can you love me like this? And I give him all the reasons why he shouldn't love me. I lay out all my stuff, and yet he keeps coming back at me. He keeps loving me. And as he does that, I'm more and more convinced in a concrete experiential way that I'm worth something. I'm worthwhile. And I see more and more clearly how beautiful he is, how glorious he is. I fall more in love with him. The very same time that I fall more in love with myself. The more concrete that is, the more power it has to impact and to erase the other concrete memories and messages that I have in my mind. But it takes something concrete and powerful to do that, because those messages are powerful and they've been there for 35 years. But through this means the Holy Spirit does that. And we're transformed by the renewing of our minds. Seeing Jesus and talking with him, and then just having an ongoing conversation. Just let him tell you what he thinks about you. Just relax. This isn't a time to do anything. You don't have to prove anything. Just be who you are and let him love you in the midst of that. Don't be discouraged if, when you do this, especially when you first start off, but it's true even after you've done it for 10 years, if sometimes it seems more difficult to do, you can't get a clear picture of it or whatever, don't be discouraged by that. Just whatever is there. It's true about you whether you can do this or not. okay, all this is true about you, nothing hangs upon it, it's beneficial to have this, but don't get uptight if it doesn't happen. Just seem as clearly as you can see them and be content with that. Don't be surprised if you have a voice in your mind saying, this is a gimmick, this isn't real, this is just make-believe. Because we have been conditioned in our culture, especially through 20th century psychology, to believe that everything that occurs in the mind is the mind's own doing. We've been conditioned to believe, through our scientific enlightenment culture, that the imagination is simply the land of make-believe. It's child's play. That's why adults lose it. We've been conditioned that way. Other cultures don't share that assumption, but that's our belief. And so those indoctrinated truths, or supposed truths, are going to be rebelling this whole time. But just be there to meet Jesus. Come against that and ask the Holy Spirit to make it as concrete and as real as possible. Do you have any experiences you want to share or questions that you have or comments about this? Yes. Good. That's exactly what I'm talking about. Be free. Be free here to allow the Holy Spirit to do whatever he wants to do. Jesus splashing in water. That wouldn't work for me, but it's what you needed. And sometimes it gets a little bizarre. The criteria here, see, here's the criteria. Is this biblical? Is this Jesus compatible with the Jesus that's revealed in Scripture? If you ever get something that's incompatible with that, then it is just your own mind. And then just stop it and say, no, Lord, lead me to the real Jesus. But that's the criteria. And within that, the Holy Spirit can do some incredible transforming work. We'll talk a little bit shortly about healing of memories that you mentioned. I'm just going to go through a brief thing about that. But some of the stuff the Lord comes up with is just positively... Sometimes, I mean, this is where I think sometimes you get words of knowledge and words of wisdom and prophecy and stuff, because now you're open to the Lord actually talking to you, which normally we're not. But other times the Lord just gives incredibly beautiful and transforming pictures. I mean, I'll share one that I had just fairly recently this last spring. I shared it with this class that I was doing on spiritual discipleship. But the Lord and I, I was a little kid, I was by this river in Lansing that I always used to play by. We're in the backyard. I'm just making a long story short here. And the Lord was showing off to me. And he does that sometimes. Just showing off his love and his power. And he was spinning all these worlds into existence. Just bringing it in there. And he was kind of like, not splashing water, but he was just delighting in this creation. He was just spinning out. It was magnificent. It was like surrealistic. It was really incredible. it's beautiful awesome and then then he kind of encouraged me to join in and i was this little kid in lansing but but i i began to kind of just go like this or whatever and i couldn't create stuff but i could make like a little swirl with it i have trouble communicating the picture here but what he was doing was empowering me saying greg i've given you creativity i've given you a share of my creativity you don't bring things into existence out of nothing but given the fact given what i've created here you've got a lot of creative potential and and in me you can use some of that. It was really a freeing kind of a thing that when we create either with sermons or with art or with music or with our own lives, we are sharing in God's creativity. He's imparted some of that to us. Let the Holy Spirit lead wherever he wants to lead. The criteria will always be scripture, but if it's compatible with scripture, just let the Lord do his work. And it can just really be powerful. Another thing I want to say about this, we're not going to have separate time to talk about this, so this is the place to interject it. I don't know if you ever noticed it or not. It kind of came to my mind when I was watching this play, Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat, but dreams play a real profound role in scripture. Sometimes do a little study on the role of dreams. It's one of the primary ways that God talks to people. What is dreaming? Dreaming is your mind making images while you're asleep. And the Lord, it's clear from scripture sets a precedent that the Lord communicates to us by using that capacity of our mind to communicate truth to us. I found that doing this also opens me up to be receptive to a divine interpretation of dreams. I find that my dreams sometimes become more vivid and more point in my life and begin to take on a role there. The two kind of begin to fuse together. So be open to that. Okay, other comments and questions? Yes. Good. It's right there in print. And just go down that. Especially if you have trouble believing that. I'm going to sneeze here. Thank you. Especially if you have trouble believing that, it's good to have it in print. I know one girl who wrote up a marriage contract where she took all these verses that I had given her to think about and she put it in the form of a marriage contract. And it said, whenever in doubt, read this and be assured that you are married to Jesus Christ. And it had all these verses here, but you put it in the voice of the Lord. I love you. You are a sweet-smelling fragrance unto me and all these other sorts of things. Another suggestion here. Again, if you have trouble, and I know this sounds pretty untraditional, but just take it for what it's worth. It's actually very traditional, although it's not very Protestant. Okay? But if you have trouble seeing Jesus, I have trouble seeing me sometimes and I have trouble seeing Jesus sometimes. I get a picture of Jesus, and I look at it. In fact, this is an exercise I recommended to my class at Bethel, and some have found it to be very useful. Sometimes I get a picture of myself as a little kid and a picture of Jesus, and then I close my eyes and say, Lord, do something with this. Show me what you feel about this little kid. And the Lord brings it to life. Use all the helps you can get. In time, you probably won't need them. But as the waves are getting off the ground, it's good. Yes? That's a very good point. Sometimes when people first start this, it's an incredible experience. And then they think it's always going to be an incredible experience. And it usually isn't. It's usually just a very healthy, enjoyable experience. And sometimes it's just sort of a struggle. I think that's usually more about us. I think God's always got at least a lot to say to us. God's always got at least a lot to say to us. Namely, I love you, Dylan. Do you know which I love you? I love you much more than this or this. He's got a ton of that to tell us. I think he loves to heap it on. Sometimes we're just too tired or too distracted. But don't beat yourself up for it. If this can't happen, and sometimes it can't with me, I'm just not in the mood or whatever, I just go back to this. Okay, well, look, I set aside this 45 minutes, and I've got to do something with it, so I might as well just tell myself the truth. You know, I'm loved. And what I find is sometimes when I start here, I'll end up here. Just be honest with the Lord. Lord, I don't even feel like really talking to you right now. There's a lot of other things I'd rather be doing. But I know you love me. Thank you for loving me. And sometimes it all of a sudden begins to evolve into this. Yes. That's the difference between knowing abstract truth and experience. Because you knew that God loved you. You knew that. But to experience it in a concrete form where it's personalized, that's what does the transforming work. And see, I really think that we are just so acclimated, probably because it's safer, but also because it's part of our culture, to keep a nice distance of abstraction there. We know that, that God's love, that Jesus died, that, that, that, that. We know about a lot of things. But that doesn't transform us, because the stuff we're against is concrete. But when it becomes concrete and real and vivid and experiential and personalized, That's when it just begins to transform your life. That's what really does it. Well, thanks a lot for sharing that. I appreciate that. What I found is that, in fact, I'm writing a book on this very thing right now because I found that at least a great many, many, many people that have begun this exercise, this discipline, and kind of made it at the core of their spirituality have been incredibly transformed by it. you know i i a number of people just come right to mind some of them were in our class together where we talked a lot about this who had never felt not only anything from god not much of anything for god and not much of anything for anyone else because of stuff in their background but by just being patient and letting the lord talk as much as possible you know saying it to yourself and then hearing it and gradually seeing yourself being in that way and then letting the or personally tell it to you, that's when it becomes increasingly concrete and powerful and transforming. There's a real need to do that. Yes. A couple, two words of caution on it. Not caution, but just advice. When you hear a call like this, sometimes, if you haven't done this before, you'll sit down and try to see the Lord or whatever. Maybe you can picture the Lord or whatever, and you say to yourself, Well, man, this isn't as real as what it would sound like when Laurie talked or when so-and-so saw it. And you end up trying to compare things. The real quality of it is the same quality a memory has. It always looks kind of like the way a memory looks. Examine your memory, and it will be that vivid, as vivid as your most vivid memory. And that's when it's at its best. The other thing is that you'll always have this impossible question that isn't worth even considering unless what you're seeing is getting outside the realms of biblical teaching. But the question is, how much of this is me and how much of this is the Holy Spirit's doing? Because we are, again, conditioned in our culture to think that everything that goes on in our mind is our own doing. Freud told us that, Jung told us that, they all told us that what goes on in the mind is our own doing. So now that something's happening here, you may say, well, this is just me. Or how much of this is me, how much of this is of God? Relax. Relax in the Holy Spirit. The question is, is this true? That's the question. Is what's going on here true? Let the Lord figure out the rest of it. But the issue is, is this biblical or not? Don't try to decipher that impossible question. Many people, and this goes to other areas as well, many people don't ever operate in the gifts of the Spirit because they're obsessed with that question. I know one lady who, for a number of months, when she would go to pray, or at least sometimes when she would go to pray, she'd all of a sudden have this some foreign syllables start coming out but she'd immediately think oh that's just me because I think I want the gift to tell him so that was just me and she'd just kind of stop herself and she'd go to pray again and she'd have like in her mind and coming out in her language would be these foreign syllables and she'd come on stopping oh it's just me how do I know for sure that it's God well you know you can put God in the picture all the time if you think that way I've had instances in my life where the Lord's given me a word of knowledge where I just have wrestled with it like for five minutes. I don't know if you've ever been in those agonizing moments, but God gives you something and it's burning. But you think, oh, is it me? Is it God? Is it me? Is it God? I'm not really sure, you know. And when you go ahead and say it, what I found more often than not that is clearly what was from God. But because it's in your head, you can always ask that question. Is it me or is it God? You can ask that about salvation itself, about believing in truth itself. I wouldn't worry too much about those kind of questions. those aren't the kind of questions that people in the ancient world ever worried about. In fact, before the advent of psychology, people just weren't that introspective about stuff. We're the ones who are obsessed with our heads. Relax, see truth, let the Holy Spirit have his way, keep to the biblical criteria, and I wouldn't worry about much of anything else. If you get impulses from the Lord, words of knowledge, words of wisdom, and this goes on when you're praying in small groups or whatever, be aware that it could just be you. and so you know i wouldn't come out and say this is exactly what god says for sure you are an adulterer or something like that be cautious about it i i always preface what i say by by saying i feel the lord is saying boom because that's true i feel the lord is saying boom and once you say it you see whether the lord was saying it or not or maybe you won't but but it's good to preface that uh but on the hand don't uh don't be so paranoid about it that you withdraw from from everything okay let's move on to something that's closely related and i want to kind of go through this fast because it's been dealt with before um and i i don't want to spend the you know all of our time doing stuff that some of you are familiar with but some of you aren't familiar with this um so i'm just going to give some words of uh advice that i found helpful in the healing of memories a lot of the deception of the flesh a lot of the messages that we believe in our mind a lot of the lies we believe are rooted in concrete memories that we have and until the memory is dealt with the message of the memory is very difficult to deal with it can be done it can be done i i don't think that you know this is the sine qua non for psychological health um i i on that train i i i think that psychotherapy and in-depth counseling and that can be very beneficial, and I'm not saying anything against that, but a person can become addicted to that, where you think that you always have to, on every issue, explore your entire history before you can ever work on something. I have found that very frequently the Lord heals you of something before he ever realizes how you got wounded in the first place. In fact, understanding how you got wounded is a byproduct of the healing, not the cause of the healing. Still, having said that, so I don't want us to become preoccupied with our past and thinking that we can't live victoriously until we understand every detail of our past. I really don't think it's necessary. God's not bound by that. Still, it is sometimes in the Lord's will. Okay, but sometimes it is helpful and sometimes it's necessary to go to the root of the source of deception in your life and deal with it because it's lodged in a concrete picture that you have that at some point damaged you. for the healing of memories i i repeat all the steps of resting in christ i go to meet with the lord i go to a private place i'm there with the lord we talk i i get all the stuff that's true okay i know who i'm dealing with and then sometimes the lord says greg it's time for us to go somewhere when this first happened i didn't know what he was dealing i didn't know what was going on now i'm now i'm real used to it but he says we need to go somewhere and a lot of times he'll take me by the hand and then we'll be someplace else and where we'll be is someplace in my childhood and and sometimes sometimes we we just sit and enjoy watching me as a child and I'll be playing in the field or sometimes I'll just be sleeping we watch me sleeping and as we watch this little kid it's me the adult and Jesus watching me the little kid and Jesus will just say wonderful things about the kid. Isn't that a great kid? Look at that kid. Or I'll be playing and he'll just remark about the energy that that kid had. Isn't that great, the life that that kid had? And what he's doing is he's just counteracting in a real gentle way a lot of the other crap that I got at that age because my energy wasn't appreciated when I was a little kid. For me it was a bad thing to have going to the school I went to to have my energy. Nuns didn't ever appreciate it. But Jesus did. And he would remark, you know, look how creative the kid is. You know, I was really creative. I was always playing by myself. I never was any friends around. And the few friends that were around were older and got me in a lot of trouble. And that's how come I had that confessional I had last week. But most of the time, I was by myself. And he just loves the little kid. For some of us, anyways, coming to love ourselves as little kids is crucial to coming to love ourselves as adults. Because what we learned to not love ourselves was when we were little kids. And so go back and start just loving, you know, let Jesus love this little kid. Do you see how creative he is? See how good he is? Sometimes, you know, I do things that weren't right and he goes, oh, it's too bad that, you know, he did that little mischievous guy. But overall, he was a good kid. And what a good job I made with him. I think I did something real special there, counteracting that. Other times, though, we go to, to difficult memories, damaging memories that I had. And he begins to redo these. And he heals me in the process. And he shows me a little bit more of his glory, a little bit more of his love, his unconditional love for me in the process. I've broken these down into stages, four stages that I've found to be a pattern in my life. And it's not unique with me. Others have discussed them. But they're not necessarily chronological. Don't think that you have to go through these. Don't plan to go through these. But this will make you kind of aware of them. What I find very frequently is that there's a grieving stage when you're dealing with difficult memories. I've shared this before, and maybe I've shared it with all of you, but it's the example that comes most readily to mind because it happened early on in my Christian walk, and it was very, very transforming for me. But a damaging memory that I lived with, actually it was so painful that I didn't remember it until I was about 30 years old. But the memory was of me as a little child. My mom had just died. This was my first Christmas without my mom. And I was really attached to my mom. I never accepted her death very well. They tell me that I would every day ask, when's mommy coming home? And they would say, no, the angels took her. And I would just get mad at the angels and I'd say, no, mommy's going to come home. I refused to accept that she died. And so it was really tough for me. Well, this is our first Christmas without mom. And I was going I was two and a half at the time, I guess. And my grandmother was raising us. My grandmother was an old lady, my mom's mom, a real stern Catholic lady who didn't have very much patience at all. And me, I was a hyperactive kid, and so we didn't get along very well. I never liked her, frankly. I never did, but she never liked me either. Around Christmas time, she came home from wherever she was at. She came and walked in the door, and she said, I got presents for everybody. My dad was away because he was away most of the time at this point. He lost his job right when my mom died, and he had to get another job, which required him to travel like two weeks at a time. So my grandmother was the one who gave us, was the primary caregiver for us. She came in with a sack of presents. She came in the house, and she said, I got presents. Got presents. It was kind of a pre-Christmas party. And we all were excited. You know, there's four of us kids. We ran downstairs to get our presents, and she pulled out a doll for my older sister, who was about 9 or 10 at the time, and gave my younger sister this porcelain pony, or I think it was some kind of a toy pony, because my sister loved ponies, and gave my brother this really cool tugboat. And I was so excited about the whole thing. Being hyperactive, I used to just flop my arms. Whenever I got excited, I'd flop my arms and jump up and down like this. My son does the same thing. whenever they're in line they're going to go off the diving board there's always kids just waiting to turn here's my son going like this I was doing that and after she gave out those three presents I hopped my way up to the bag and I looked inside the bag and there was nothing there my eldest sister said to my grandma doesn't Greggy get a present and my grandmother looked at me with this really stern look on her face She goes, "No, Greggie is a bad boy, and bad boys don't get presents."
