So, obedient, responsive, got right back after the break. We're shifting into the church as redemptive community, and let me give you an idea of the three pieces that we're going to cover in our time together. In the next slide, this concept needs to be defined. So we're going to be talking about what does it mean to be a redemptive community or to build redemptive communities. Then I'm going to give you an idea about our church's revolution in becoming more of a redemptive community. And then thirdly, I'm going to describe our efforts in more detail, tell you some of the stories about how does this building process look. Just as a memory jog, even though we just had it this morning, The next slide is, again, the Genesis 1, 27 to 31 passage, which is a reminder that God created one human race. But I want to segue from that to 2 Corinthians 5, starting in verse 17 through verse 20, and seeing the world, seeing our place in the world and everybody else in the world through this new creation lens, which comes when we become followers of Jesus. So from now on, Paul writes, we regard no one from a worldly point of view. It's funny, since getting into all this material, I read that one verse so differently now. It's not just the typical way of thinking of that. It's seeing one family, right? That God created one race of human people. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, that person is a new creation, the old is gone, the new has come. All this is from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people's sins against them. And one of the big sins is just how much of a difference we keep making from these physical things that we see. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. We are therefore Christ's ambassadors as though God were making his appeal through us. One of the stories I shared when I was here last time a couple years ago was a conversation that I had with an L.A. Times reporter whose beat is the demographics of L.A. County. And so I've gotten to know him a little bit over the years because when he wants a quote to misquote me, you know how that goes, in the favor on some of these issues, he gives me a call. So I happened to be on jury duty in downtown L.A., and he called my office and said, hey, is Ken going to be near the L.A. Times office? because I'd love to just grab lunch with him. So we went out for lunch, and this guy is half black, half Jewish. Kind of interesting combination. Not practicing Jew, but he was working on a piece for the Sunday magazine. Does your paper have kind of a slightly glossy insert on Sundays? They call it the Los Angeles Times Sunday magazine. And the whole point of the article was it was a 10-year anniversary of the post-Rodney King trial riots. And so he and a bunch of reporters were assigned to go around the city and talk to the groups that immediately after the riots, especially the faith groups, that had made promises to actually be less isolated and to do more in terms of bringing the racial reconciliation, the whole culture reconciliation in the city. So we're sitting there eating noodles in J-Town, and he says, you know, Ken, this is going to come out in about three weeks, but I already know the conclusion of our study, and it's really sad. He says, 10 years after this whole city erupted in race riots, nothing has been done on those promises. Our city is just as divided. And then he said the most unexpected thing to me. He said, Ken, it's churches like yours that I'm now convinced hold the key to the healing of this city. And this is a secular LA Times reporter. I said, I was feeling very nervous because I know how far we have to go. I said, explain that comment. He says, even if we pass laws in Los Angeles County, in the state of California, that make it illegal not to have friends who are different than you, right? He says, even if we force people to actually hang out with people they normally wouldn't choose to hang out with, it wouldn't change anything. Because I'm now convinced this is a heart issue, and it's therefore a spiritual issue. And so it's churches like yours that actually hold the key to any hope for this city. And I went back to our church and I said, isn't that exciting? Here we have this guy who has no reason to say this, who barely knows anything that we're doing, but he knows what we're trying to be. And he's saying, that's it. And I said, in our parlance from the Christian paradigm, we would say, it's the gospel, stupid. I mean, he doesn't have that language, but that's what we would understand. And then I got, the next moment, depressed because I thought of all, especially the Asian American churches that I know in Los Angeles, because I actually went to a gathering of their pastors. I said, isn't that exciting? Here's this reporter saying, here's the key to the city. Go heal it. I think most of our churches that aren't trying to do what we're doing, they're saying, wow, that's awesome that you're saying that, because that is so right on. It is a spiritual matter. But we're not going to be part of that because we're into our homogeneous unit. And for all these different reasons, some of them more understandable than others. And I said, you know, this is the problem because we have been handed by Jesus as new creations in Christ the role of being ambassadors. Okay? To actually declare to a world that lives so divided that in Jesus the dividing walls of us still have been destroyed. And he is a reconciling force that can truly bring people together and to love one another. and so when we don't do that, I think it really weakens our witness. All these other things can be true. We can do all these wonderful ministries, but if that's not true about who we are, it speaks volumes in the other direction. So kind of breaking down the 2 Corinthians 5 passage, which lens do you use? Do you use the old creation lens or the new creation lens? The old creation is a shattered lens, and so based on what the Apostle Paul was saying, as long as you keep looking at people through the shattered lens of the fall, it's a fragmented picture people are scattered and they are hopelessly divided right and that's that's the most common tendency is to look out on the world and just say it's we're never going to be able to come together there's just too many differences but he also says if you use the old creation shattered lens that we'll look at Jesus in an incorrect way as well in a very hopeless way Jesus is a nobody a nobody's carpenter's son from nowhere who did nothing special right and he says And that's how you looked at Jesus before you were born again. But with the new creation's redemptive lens, you look at Jesus now as a sinless son of God who is our Savior and Lord. Now he's a symbol of hope. He's a source of hope. But it doesn't stop with Jesus. The next place that it happens is you look at the human race now as one diverse human race, divinely created and equally loved, brought together by and through Jesus in his body, the church. And now you look at everybody coming together in a way that the rest of the world using the old lens simply doesn't do. Now let me offer to you a working definition of what I'm calling redemptive community. If you go to the next slide. And I'll break it down by the phrases. First of all, it's divinely inspired. Redemptive community is nothing that sinful human beings would think of themselves. When left to our own devices, we formed clubs and denominations. and I think clubs and denomination is kind of like the same thing I mean I was raised in an American Baptist home and it was like you know United Methodists really aren't Christians right and it was like I'm sure you were raised with a similar kind of thing and people who speak in tongues they're really not Christians right it was all that kind of things and I grew up kind of stupidly thinking that there's this Baptist section in heaven right and you know obviously all of these labels that we take so seriously are all concocted by human beings. And so for us to come up with this picture of a redemptive community where every nation, every tongue, every tribe is gathered around the throne lifting up the name of Jesus, that's divinely inspired. That does not come from a human source. That's divinely inspired. Second of all, it's unexpected. you want to make headlines it's man bites dog not dog bites man and i think one of the reasons why our little church we only have about 700 people on a sunday right now um our little church i mean we compare to mega churches here in the twin cities right um it's funny the attention that we're getting and i i can only think it's because it's man bites dog is we're a historically asian church who's trying to do something that many historically asian churches aren't doing right we're actually trying to be this redemptive community people don't expect that if anything they put it on those of you who come from historically white churches and they go well you guys have the history of being racist and so you guys have to change but we can be off the hook whether we're a black church an asian church whatever we can just go on being homogeneously defined see and so i think when it's unexpected god gets all the credit and the glory right when you do exactly what people expect you to do it doesn't draw headlines it doesn't draw attention okay and it's not just this whole intercultural thing it's it's socioeconomic it's circumstance it's class fusion okay divinely inspired unexpected fusion uh you'll learn a little bit more about this this term um i'm sure here even in the twin cities you have fusion restaurants right do you know what that is anyone eating at a fusion restaurant this is where they take foods, ethnic foods, cultural food types that historically were separate and distinct, and they bring them together. So it'd be like Thai-Italian, okay, or French-Japanese, right? That sort of thing. In Southern California, you can have wasabi mashed potatoes, right? And wasabi is that horseradish that they put on sushi. And it's like, that's kind of been the trend for the last 15, 20 years, the restaurants are leading the way, is they're fusing all these different things. I try to tell people at our church who are not Japanese or Chinese, and we have now 15 different Pacific Rim people coming to our church, Middle Easterners, white, black, Hispanic, multiracial, or the term again, multi-ethnic, multicultural, and they, some of the people who aren't Chinese or Japanese, they say, well, you know, it still feels kind of Chinese or Japanese here, and I said, well, it's kind of like we start off as a Japanese restaurant, and we were that way for many years. If you ever came to our church, people would speak Japanese, not English, and if this was a restaurant, you'd only eat Japanese food. That's how we served. And then in the 70s, Chinese people started coming, and they started eating the Japanese food, but then we started adding chow mein and egg roll and wonton soup and stuff like that, but the head chef was still Japanese. So everything still kind of tastes, even though it was Chinese, it's like my wife's Japanese-American. She tries to make stuff with my mother's recipes, but it tastes Japanese. because she uses Japanese soy sauce. She uses Kikoman soy sauce versus Chinese, and then there's Hawaiian soy sauce. I mean, there's all these different things. It adds different nuances, and if you grow up knowing what it's supposed to taste like, you can tell it tastes different. I said, now we have roast beef sandwiches, collard greens, tacos, menudo. We've added all these things to the menu. It's fusion, but it still tastes Japanese a little bit. So you look in your burrito, and there's red beans. There's azuki beans. It's not refried meat. So I said, we don't apologize. There's always going to be, probably for still some time to come, this overarching sense of our origins. But at the same time, we're not demanding that everybody just learn to eat Japanese. We're saying because you're here, we're adding to the menu daily. And we're learning how to not just keep these items separate, but we're learning to fuse these things in new ways. And we're ending up with dishes and tastes and flavors that never before existed. okay i think that's what's exciting about redemptive community is the it defies previous definition and it is always in the it's like our country it's always in the process of of taking new shape right and that's what's really tough because people like to just kind of freeze things in time and say well that's what we are and i would say well this sunny some other people came and we if we're really going to love them and and become a community and a family then we have to to take in their influence and impact. So divinely inspired, unexpected fusion of cultures, classes, and circumstances. When we started our church, restarted about eight years ago, I had it differently. It was like, we're going to be a multi-ethnic, multi-generational, multi-social, it was like multivitamin. Well, yeah, it was like this whole crazy thing. And God just kind of had me back away from all of that and say it's cultures, classes, and circumstances. Now, that's not perfect. It doesn't encompass everything. But I think the culture part there, it's saying we want to see different cultures here. Classes, I think, again, I said earlier, that's huge. It's much tougher to get the lower class and the middle class and the upper class all together. And then circumstances. One of the first challenges that I had as a senior pastor in 97 was I was introduced to this unwed couple that had gotten into huge credit card debt and decided to be drug mules to make $15,000 really fast. So they never saw the drugs, never touched the drugs. It was a hidden panel, and they went down to Texas, and they drove the drugs to this other location, $15,000 cash from the Mexican mafia, then got a little greedy and said, well, gee, that brings us back to zero, but man, if we do one more trip, now we're $15,000 ahead. And they were totally set up. It was a sting. And they got busted, and that's how I met them. Now, this defied my understanding of Asian American good people. You know, it's like, hey, it's in everybody's community. And she was also seven months pregnant with this child. And they were already mad at each other, breaking up. And so he accepted Christ when we met in the coffee shop. She had grown up in a church and walked away from it. So we bring them into our church. Here I am, new senior pastor, got this unwed couple, right? And she wants to get baptized now. And she's eight months pregnant. She can't climb the ladder into the tank. And so we said, okay, even though we're Baptists, we'll sprinkle you. And in her testimony, she shares the whole story of the path that she has taken to get to this point and just how grateful she is to be received by this church. But now she's got a problem because she can't go back to her job at the law office because she can't afford to pay a babysitter and work full time. And so even though I couldn't afford it, I said, you know what? You made a good choice in not aborting this child. But now the child is here and you need to support the child. Okay, you can join my staff, even though I'm overstaffed already, and we'll watch your child. And so she brought Justin to work every day with her for the first two years. And then all the stories start getting out there. You know, gee, you know, once Ken takes over, he's okay on premarital sex. Right? I was like, wow. I was like, you know, that comment doesn't even deserve a defense. If that's what you think is going on, then you completely missed the point. Okay? But because we reached out in grace to this young couple, then some more unwed mothers started showing up. And it's really challenging when you have a typical mothers of young toddlers group, and everyone's very suburban and got their little expensive strollers, and you bring in unwed moms who very much need the same kind of teaching and help, but you can't make the assumptions that you did about everybody. So that's what I'm saying. Even circumstantially, we tend to push out people who have obvious sin issues, even though everybody's a sinner. Divinely inspired, unexpected fusion of cultures, classes, and circumstances brought together by God's Spirit. The only way we're going to come together is because the Holy Spirit is moving us in this direction, and that cannot be understated. You can't just do this because you think it's the right thing to do. You have to be inspired to do this because it's hard and it's costly. To mirror and bring. So we want to both reflect and also make more real for people the next and last phrase, God's coming future to the world. And we're going to spend a lot more time on the afternoon session talking about what it's like to create the future that God has already described, to create it now. So divinely inspired, unexpected fusion of cultures, classes, and circumstances brought together by God's Spirit to mirror and bring God's coming future to the world. And that's just my working definition of what that is all about. Ephesians 2, 19, in the message translation, talks about God building a new home. And this new home to me is the redemptive community. He's using us all, irrespective of how we got here in what he is building. He used the apostles and prophets for the foundation. Now he's using you, fitting you in brick by brick, stone by stone, with Christ Jesus as the cornerstone that holds all parts together. We see it taking shape day after day, a holy temple built by God, all of us built into it, a temple in which God is quite at home. Okay, now let's break that down. How does God build redemptive community? Even if this isn't necessarily meant to be prescriptive, I think there's some very helpful things here. First of all, in Ephesians, Paul is saying that to build a redemptive community, it requires every kind of person. And what we were saying in the question and answer period after the first session was, If you're not convinced that your church is lacking and is actually lost in some ways because it's too homogeneous, then you're not going to start with this first piece. That in order to build redemptive community, it requires diverse parts. Second of all, it requires God's word for hearing the beat of God's redemptive heart and learning his mission. This is not PC, I tell people. It's JC. I said if nobody in secular society was concerned about bringing people together, people who follow Jesus should be passionate about this. Societal trends tend to change. This should never be different in us because this is what the church is all about. This is what we learn through the Word of God. It also involves fitting each unique person into this new community with Jesus as a reference point, the cornerstone and bonding agent. So again, this whole piece, the cornerstone sets the dimensions for all the rest of the building, but every brick needs to be fitted in carefully, and it's all held together with Jesus as the bonding agent. Progress, though incremental, is expected. There is this sense that we can't be satisfied with nothing changing, because God expects this home to be taking shape, right? Brick by brick, it may take a long time, but it's becoming obvious more and more what's going on. We're going through a huge remodel of our house back in Southern California. And in the beginning, you can't see what that new house is going to look like. It's just holes tearing things apart. I happened to be doing a wedding in San Jose the weekend they came in with pickaxes and destroyed our house. And emotionally, that was rough for my wife. And I'm realizing, you talk about gender difference, I think for many women, the house is really this nest. And for me, I experienced it completely different emotionally. She said, someone just destroyed our nest. Like, we're homeless now. My wife's also a banker. She said, we've also just destroyed our only asset. Right? And whereas I walked in there, because I'm a visionary too, I'm like, yeah, but even in all these holes and mess, I see the future. Right? But now that all the framing's done and they've put up some of the drywall and all the foundations are poured, it's more and more obvious, even to my wife who's visually challenged, what all of this is going to lead to. And one of the things is I think God had to pull me back and say, for you to build redemptive community, even through Evergreen Baptist Church of Los Angeles, more than likely it's going to take more than your lifetime. That's how I feel about that. I was like, not real good. I mean, if I'm going to work this hard, I want to see the fruit of it. I want to see it all come together. And it's like, no, you just have to be faithful to laying that foundation with Jesus as a cornerstone, right? With the clear theology that this is coming from God's word and God's heart and God's mind, that this has got, and that whatever progress can occur in your time, in your tenure, you need to be faithful to that, right? And I started thinking about Moses taking him all the way through the desert, and then he doesn't get to go in. And God really dealt with me, man. I almost died two years ago. I came down with bacterial pneumonia around Christmas time, and I thought I had the flu. I started off as the flu, and then I had terrible chills and fever, 105 fever for like four days, and I was treating myself with Theraflu. Like, okay, you know, I'm just taking the... And finally, I thought, okay, this is so bad. I must be passing kidney stones. So I dragged myself out of bed after five days of this. I went on the internet and I looked up kidney stones. And I found something that seemed to match all my symptoms. So like a doom cough, I printed up the thing. And I told my wife, take me to the ER. So I'm passing kidney stones. So we go there and they were so gracious to me. I was so just a doom cough, right? And they go, hi, what are you here? I said, well, I highlighted in yellow all the things, so you can kind of skip the diagnosis part because I was pre-med many years ago. And they're like, okay, we'll just put this over here for right now, and we're going to do blood pressure and blood. And they go, I don't know about the kidney stone thing, but you have pneumonia and you have septicemia. You're like two days from organ shutdown. And so you're not leaving the hospital. you're here for the next five days, right? And if you cough on that old lady, you'll kill her. I'm like, okay, I'm sorry, sorry. Yeah, I mean, cough in a towel, yeah. So the prayer ministry of our church came to visit me, and as they were just spending time over me, I felt like it welled up within me, my need to see all of this happen in my lifetime, and yet I might be dead in a day, right? And I just started weeping. I just thought, like, God, that's just not fair. I mean, I'm putting so much into this. And it's like what I felt happened in that moment when I was being prayed over is, like, God, he took that from me. I was able to release my need to see it all happen so that I get credit for it. I get to experience it. And, again, it was just like he gave it back to me. And it's just like just be faithful in continuing to lay the right foundation. Okay? And I hope that speaks a word of encouragement to you. Because this is for the long haul, baby. I mean, we're going up against principalities and powers, and some of them is the institution of the church. Some of it is Pharisee University. I mean, it's all this kind of stuff, and if you think, and I think that this is going to be solved in a week, in a year, in a lifetime, no, but we have to start somewhere, and God is speaking to us. So anyway, progress, though incremental, is expected. And one last word on that. I have a friend named Dolphus Weary who works on racial reconciliation in Jackson, Mississippi. And he was on the board with me in InterVarsity. And we would get so down on ourselves that this was taking so long. And there's hardly any evidence of real movement. And he would always say, he says, you know what, folks? We've still got a long way to go, but at least we're not on zero anymore. He says, some of us, we spend most of our life stuck on zero. And so we can celebrate the fact that we moved a quarter of an inch, even though we've got 100 million miles to go. He says, don't forget you've still got ways to go. You know, you get to kind of make a home there a quarter of an inch, but don't forget to thank God for that quarter of an inch because that's improvement. Finally, this place of home. I like what this translation says. We see it taking shape day after day, a holy temple built by God, all of us built into it, a temple in which God is quite at home. And I think what is meant there is this redemptive community, where God is quite comfortable because this is what heaven's going to be like. This is home to God. And so we need to learn to rehearse heaven and to learn to celebrate this and be comfortable in this place too. And I think everybody in this room has had some experience where you've gone from the same almost exact situation where in the beginning you were very uncomfortable, very self-conscious, to more a place where you're less self-conscious. I think one of the signs is you're less worried about offending people, saying the wrong thing. When you're really becoming a family, you have thicker skin about a lot of this stuff. And I think you can breathe. I think at the beginning, it doesn't feel like home, and that's why people don't want to be there. We'll get into that when we get into some of our efforts. When you do a word study on the word redemption, you see under the sowing seeds of heaven on earth, you see these four words emerge, and I think they're very powerful words. A redemptive community will restore, release, repair, and refresh. It's not just save. It's like restore what God has always intended to be, and yet sinful people have gone off into these corners. It's to release people to really live as one family in Christ. It's to repair the brokenness that has happened, both because being purveyors of racism and at the same time victims of it, and it's refreshment. I think the world at this point in the early 21st century, I think the world, just like the secular LA Times reporter, is waiting for this kind of refreshment that they've discovered that they can't deliver. And I think it's part of the outcome of the church. Now, we've got some problems, though, because more and more people are dismissive of this whole effort to build a redemptive community, or they're super discouraged. And that's why I think we need to reframe our efforts into this redemptive community language and paradigm because of what we're up against. First of all, the attempts to diversify the body are faltering. Have you seen that in your situations, that you feel like we're losing traction, that some of the people that used to be interested just aren't interested anymore? like I said earlier many white Christians are saying I'm tired of feeling guilty there's a great new book by the way by Paula Harris and Doug Schaup his last name is S-C-H-A-U-P both are Caucasians Doug married a Korean American Paula married a grad student from Africa they're now divorced they're both on InterVarsity staff and this is the first book I've ever seen came out last year by InterVarsity Press first book on the white Christians experience in racial reconciliation or biblical reconciliation. And they said just the things that they had to learn. There's a lot of their stories in there. I think this would be a very, very helpful book for those of you who come from historically and predominantly white situations because I think a lot of white folks, including Christian ones, are just tired of feeling guilty. And so they're just like, who likes to feel guilty all the time? So I'm done with that. Or it's just a PC thing. It's not even a Christian thing. It's political correctness and it's that secular liberalism. okay humanism non-whites part of the problem there is still too many of us non-whites are saying well you know it's a white problem it's not our problem and we hide our own racism and everyone's a racist at some level and then generally it's that averse of racism thing nice moral for folks like us just simply can't be racist so because this forces us to look at ourself in in less a good light many people just don't like to do that. So that's just some ideas about why I think attempts to diversify the body are faltering. Also, most privileged Christians are clueless, and this is where I reference divided by faith. Again, people are saying there are no such thing as racist systems, just isolated racist people, and if they can become born again, then everyone will be fine. And a lot of this comes from deliberate isolation and insulation from unfamiliar people, and it's not, again just white folks that do this. Everybody does this. When you have enough numbers where you can just hang out with people like you that you're comfortable with, then that's what you choose to do most of the time. It's only when you're the only one, you know, you're kind of thrown into a different pool that you learn by, just because you're forced to, how to swim in that pool. Therefore, I'm saying we need to reframe this whole mission, this whole approach because of the dismissiveness and the discouragement into becoming more and more of what I call redemptive community. And this is saying it's not percentages, it's not ratios, even though that is some evidence that can be encouraging to us. It's more, do we understand the heart and soul of the gospel, how God wants us to feel about other human beings, okay? And what progress or not are any of us making towards really being able to love our neighbors as ourselves, right? To really see and to even start praying about, God, how are you going to even take me out of my geographic situation, even if it's not just my church. So I start having friends, making friends of people who are very in different circumstance, culture, or class than myself and really begin to learn their stories. One of the things, simple thing that you can do that I've started doing as God's beginning to diversify our congregation more and more, I tend to read things in the newspaper that normally I would never read. There's like maybe 15 or 20 Filipino Americans coming to our church now. There are some articles there about veterans of World War II from the Philippines who fought on the side of the Americans against the Japanese, and they were promised American veterans benefits, and the government has never given them a penny. That would probably be the first time our government ever did something like that. And so they're protesting, and they're demanding. We're old people now. We have war wounds. We never got a penny. Before, I would care less about that. I wouldn't even read it. But God's drawing my attention to those things because I'm thinking, there's someone in our church that maybe their father, maybe their uncle, and I need to feel the pain. I need to know more about this and maybe go beyond the article and sit down with people and say, tell me about this. You need to be much more curious because I think it's really important. All right, the Northwestern people are here. Hello, hello. All right, let's move on. Let me tell you a little bit, explain about our church's revolutions. okay um the first uh graphic there you can hit the there we go j stands for japanese okay so from 1925 to 1945 our church was basically a church for japanese immigrants who were living in east los angeles which was a very poor part of la which is now predominantly hispanic that's where the church was located. As far as the class, we were lower class, very poor. Everyone was a laborer working really hard. And, you know, obviously as they stuck around, they started having kids. And now you start having the typical tension of an immigrant church that has bilingual, bicultural kids. Okay. But that was true for 21 years. Now, what was unusual is Pearl Harbor, World War II. Japanese American churches on the West Coast got shut down and everybody got shipped off to these different concentration camps. So when we come back after the war, 1945 to 1976, you go to the next one, we're now much more of a Japanese American church. One of the things that the concentration camp did to the Japanese American community, which is unlike, I think, any other Asian Pacific Islander community, is it took out the older generation. All the fathers were picked up by the FBI, and they weren't put in those camps. And so the people in a hierarchical paternalistic society, which is very much Asian, where the adult men were typically the leaders of the family and the community, they're all gone, right? All gone. And so now you have elementary school age, junior high age, high school age, next generation young men being handed the mantle of leadership. And so it doesn't surprise me that most of the Asian Americans in politics are Japanese-American, right? Because they had this kind of supercharge because of this injustice. And then when they came back from the camps, they had to kind of put themselves back on the map. Now, this is kind of interesting because as I did a study on this for my doctoral dissertation, almost every Japanese-American church in Los Angeles in the 1950s had Sunday school programs that were bursting at the seams. There could be, I mean, 60 people in worship and 400 kids in Sunday school, okay? And our church experienced the same thing, and we ended up building this whole new Sunday school wing, but no one bothered to ask the question, why is this happening? Okay? Geez, is it that gospel light material we're using? I mean, wow, you know, we've found some great curriculum. Sociologically, what do you think was true if you were a Buddhist church-going family before World War II, and then you come back and you've lost everything, right? And there's still a lot of anti-Japanese sentiment. What do you think is going on sociologically that would cause you to send your kids to a Christian church? What do you think? Right? It's fear. It's prejudice. And so we don't necessarily buy into the Christian thing. We just don't want to look unpatriotic. Right? And so, heck, we're sending our kids. You know, even though I don't believe this, to this day, so after about five or six years and the anti-Japanese sentiment died down, most of those kids quit going to church because they didn't need the church to provide this cover for them, right? So to this day, I meet people, because I've been in L.A. now for over half of my life, I meet people who are in their 50s and their 60s that don't go to church, that almost all of them said they used to go to our church as kids, right? So I just think sometimes history gives the church an opportunity, and you don't understand it and how to steward that well. So that was our church. Now it was run by second-generation people. Now this is where something highly unusual happened, because in the 1950s, the church decided to split off the Japanese-speaking immigrant population. And this was their parents. It's like sending your parents across the street. And they started the Japanese Baptist Church. And this is so unusual. Most historically Japanese churches have never done this. They still have a Japanese-speaking congregation. And they can't imagine that this would be taking place. I can't get a straight answer from anyone who was around at that time about what was the inspiration for that. It wasn't about, oh, so that way non-Japanese will be able to come and we can be a redemptive community. It's like, no, you're going across the street. So that's what happened. And from 1945 to 1976, it was still basically a Japanese-American church now, all English-speaking, though. And that's what's really different compared to other Asian immigrant churches. Then in 1977 to 1976, we became a Japanese ABC church. ABC is American-born Chinese, so it's Japanese-American and American-born Chinese. And let me explain something since I'm married to Japanese. The difference between Chinese and Japanese culturally. Chinese have this giant mass of land, right? And so we have all these resources. And if you talk to real into China thinkers, China is the middle kingdom, right? That's what it means. And it's like China is the center of the universe. And so you can think we're backwards, but we don't care what you think because we're a quarter of the world's population and we built a big wall around and you just keep out, okay? Japan, I think, was set up to think the same way, but they, on this little island, only 10% is farmable. And so they want to be just as arrogant, but they'll die. Okay? And so Japanese culture developed into this begrudging acceptance. It's called shikata ganai. Right? And the literal definition is it can't be helped. The closest thing I can find in Italian is kei sara sara. Remember that song? Kei sara, whatever will be, will be. And so you have, it's like the Japanese did not invite the American-born Chinese to come to the church. The American-born Chinese, like myself, were going to bilingual, trilingual Chinese churches and finding ourselves increasingly disenfranchised because our pastors and the leadership was first generation or Chinatown raised. And so we got, gee, you know, there's this Japanese American church and they've got this third generation Japanese American pastor now who doesn't speak a word of Japanese, went to UCLA, was quarterback in high school. And I can relate more to him, even though he's not Chinese, than this Chinese pastor that's at my church. So Chinese did what Chinese people do. We came uninvited, okay? And as we started outnumbering the Japanese, the Japanese said shikate-ganai, shikate-ganai, shikate-ganai, shikate-ganai, right? And sometimes versions of shikate-ganai, yeah, right? And in the beginning, I came in 1978, right when this was all happening. In the beginning, I would say that it was still, it felt like a Japanese church that was nice to Chinese people, okay? And so we reached this crisis point in 80, 81, where now there are so many Chinese Americans coming uninvited. You didn't say we couldn't come. So they had to say, so are we going to be officially a Chinese-Japanese church? Not just a Japanese church that's nice to Chinese people and make virtual Japanese people out of these people. I speak more Japanese now than Chinese because I've just learned so much Japanese stuff. And so one of the ways we said, let's make this official. It's like we need to hire a staff person who's an American-born Chinese person. And lo and behold, there I was. I was doing my internship there, and that was the official invitation to all the Chinese-Americans that this church is now really going in this direction. So from 1977 to 1976, we became a second and third generation Japanese and Chinese-American church, and now it's middle to upper middle class. And for the next 19 years, especially with my work at Fuller in the doctoral program, and it wasn't in adoption theology, it was in church growth stuff, okay? And so I was all into, well, this is our new homogeneous unit. It's English-speaking Chinese and Japanese Americans. And if you aren't that, and if you don't like that, too bad. Right? And I helped write the book on that. And God got a hold of me later on. Okay? So we were leading the way in establishing this new niche of English-speaking Chinese and Japanese Americans. And then in 1996, well, actually 1990, I personally went to Urbana Student Missions Conference when I joined the Board of InterVarsity. And God got a hold of me in his heart for the world and the poor and issues of justice and all this stuff. And it just ruined me, I like to say, for middle-class suburban ministry. And I came home and it's like, even though I literally wrote the book on English-speaking, Chinese and Japanese, Asian-American ministry, I'm rewriting the book and we're actually moving this whole redemptive community direction. And it caught a lot of people off guard. And so for the last eight years, from 1996 until now, it's not been that long, we're seeing lower, middle, and upper class, first through fourth generation. This has been shocking to me because as we did this, I only speak English. The only time my parents spoke Chinese is to talk about the kids in front of us. So my brother and I took German, and we talked about my parents. Mutter und Vater. It's like, we too can play at this game. What has absolutely shocked me is that one of the fastest growing groups in our church are immigrants from the Pacific Rim who are bilingual. And one of the reasons why it also shocks me is I grew up in my family absolutely with a prejudice, not against black people so much or Latinos or white people, I had a prejudice against immigrants from China. Because they looked like me, but they made me look bad. And the problem is my grandmother was an immigrant from China. And I remember the few times she would come to my school, I was embarrassed to have my grandmother there because she couldn't speak anything but broken English. She made all her own clothes. She smelled like winter melon and dried mushrooms. Right? You know what I mean? It's just like... And so it was like two different worlds. And so I thought, okay, God, I'll make you a deal. I never wanted to be a pastor, but here's two parts to the deal. If I'm going to be a pastor, I'll never be in Southern California, especially Los Angeles. And I've been there over half my life. And don't make me pastor FOBs, fresh off the boat, Chinese, because, yeah, they know what I'm talking about, right? I was like, I'm completely uncomfortable with that. And now I've been, you know, God never listens to those things. He lets you think he listens, okay? So now I can't imagine being anyplace other. And when we hived, when you split the church in 1996-97, we started with six weeks of cash, one-third of the people, 30% of the givers. And let me tell you, when those immigrants started coming in, I was desperate. And I found a way to love everybody. I was just like, I don't care what your accent is, man. If you're putting more than a dollar in the plate, God bless you. Welcome to the church, you know. Oh, my goodness. We were in such desperate straits. And God used that on my heart. It's just like, guess what? People have value, don't they? Right? Not just their pocketbooks. You've got to learn their stories. You've got to learn to love them. And I thank God for those desperate years. As I said before, it's amazing now. We have 15 different Pacific Rim people there. And everybody, it's not been easy, but it's been intentional. And we just took a survey. 400 people in our church responded to this survey, which is pretty good. And we said, so how are you feeling about this whole biblical reconciliation thing? And over 85% of our people said, we believe it's right. It's right. Even though it's going to be hard, we think it's great. Then there's some people, why are we even talking about this? There's all those people. But that's so encouraging to us because this would not have been the survey result eight years ago. When I first started this, people thought about, you wrote the book on the homogeneous sheet of English-speaking Asian American, leave well enough alone. And it's just like, my own family doesn't match that anymore. Let alone what I think what God wants to see happen. Now, notice here, the timeline underneath is 80 years. Our church is 80 years old today. I purposely put that up there because I think some of our churches are trying to jump to light speed right away on this and we don't have an appreciation again for how long this might take now I I say that and to tell you to be patient and at the same time I offer this observation I think it's going to take shorter than it took before and one of the reasons is I think there's such a pervasive global youth culture, this is just one observation, that kids who are like first generation to America or their second generation who would normally be those nerdy little kids that didn't look like they fit into the whole teenage thing, they're fast forwarding. And many of those kids are now hipper, right? And they're all part of this bigger thing. They're acculturating and assimilating faster, I think, than ever before. And so those of us who pastor in ethnic immigrant situations, I think one of the things you have to appreciate is you don't have as much time to deal with this issue. That's just my observation. I don't know if you see that, you know, true here. But the parents, the first generation parents are, I mean, they were always at pulling the hair out. Now they're pulling it out faster because they never anticipated this happening to their children, right? I like to meet with immigrant Chinese pastors now and I say, I am your grandchildren. I'm not married to a Chinese, and I have all these different people, and they're horrified. And I had this one pastor, he stood up, and he started yelling at me in Chinese, which was lost on me because I can't speak Chinese. It's kind of good. And the translator said, do you want me to tell you everything he said, or you just let me get to the point? I said, no, get to the point. He says, how dare you say you know the future because you're not a prophet? I said, I'm not claiming to be a prophet. I'm just saying it's just obvious what happens when you come to America. And so if you just came here to get the gold and have nothing affect you and your children and your grandchildren and your great-grandchildren, then you're just hugely naive. Because that's what America does to people. Now, how do you deal with that in our churches? Now, here's the vision statement from our church. This is how we've kind of interpreted this whole redemptive community. We call it Sadaka community. When I first became the senior pastor, I had to come up with a new, fresh way to say something old. and we didn't have a redemptive community in those days. So we call it Sadaka community. Sadaka is a Hebrew word, Sadaka. We have these seminary students all the time. That's not the right way to say it. I go, get a life. That's like the average person in this church is never going to take Hebrew. They know Neil Sadaka, okay? Laughter in the rain, calendar girl. We can deal with that. So we're just going to popularize this. They go, well, it's not even an English word. People are never going to go. I said, my daughter is three years old. She says Hakuna Matata. What is that, Swahili? Right, I said, if you say it enough times, people will catch on to it. So this is what we call, we call them Sadaka communities. Every Green Baptist Church of Los Angeles will demonstrate Jesus' passion for reconciled relationships through our building Sadaka communities, redemptive fusions of cultures, classes, and circumstances, united by God's Spirit to bring God's coming future to everyone in the world. And what we came up with is, I really believe Leonard Sweet, where he says, whatever your vision is, you have to capture it in a metaphor. Because Jesus used parable as metaphor. People cannot hold on to this whole piece. They need something simpler with an image that really grabs them. And so we redid the logo of our church based on Revelations 22, 1 and 2. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. And I said, man, where are those leaves? Now, for the longest time, we're evergreen. We're named after the street that we used to be on in East L.A. And we just took the name with us. And so guess what our logo was? It was an evergreen tree with a cross. And I go, well, okay, but it's not a metaphor for what our vision is, so we're going to change it. And I found out there's a Emmy Award winning graphic designer in our church. She did the commercial with her team of 102 Dalmatians where it was raining puppies in all the spots. Bow, wow, wow, yippee, yay, yippee. That was her old deal. And I said, hey, we have this whole idea to rethink our metaphor. And so we came up with this leaf with the cross as the vein, and it's just lightly touching down on the water. So it kind of hints at our Japanese history. And at the same time, if you read that passage, it's the river of the water of life flowing down through the main street of the city with a tree of life growing on either bank, producing fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree for the healing of the nations. I mean, I was like, that's it, that's it. My wife gave me so much grief. Like, why do you always have to mess with stuff? Right? I mean, it's just like the logo's flying the way it is. You're going to get criticized. You know, I'm criticizing you. I was just like, you don't understand everything. We have to give people help to grab hold of this. And so I finally, I talked to some of the young kids in our church, and they said, you know, we don't go to any websites that don't have flash animation on it. Right? And so I thought, man, what is flash animation? So I talked to some graphic designers. I said, take our new logo and make it flash animation. If you ever go to our website, ebcla.org, It's this one-minute piece that we showed to our congregation finally of this simple animation of a leaf coming off this tree and then being carried by the wind of the Spirit, blowing down through this river valley into this city where on the one side you see tenements and razor wire and cars on blocks. On the other side you see suburbia. And as the tree sits down in the city, there's more and more leaves in the background showering into the city. And then the water hits like this, and it's our logo. And I showed this to the church, and this music was composed by the graphic designer. He played it himself. And the whole church was silent. It was like this holy moment when everybody got what this was all about. And the moment of satisfaction was coming home from church that afternoon, my wife goes, okay, you were right. She's like, how do you live with people like me when you see what needs to be changed before anybody sees it and then we just beat on you? And I go, you know what that's like, Dave, right? And I said, it's okay, it's been my whole life. So as long as you get it now, okay? And so I think it's very helpful to have those kind of tools. So I encourage you to have that. We're at the time for lunch. Let me just quickly tell you four things about how you build redemptive community. This is describing our efforts. Can I have five minutes, Jen? Is that okay? Okay. Hard lessons that we're still learning. Okay, number one is I think the first stage in building redemptive community is pseudo-community. Pseudo means fake, artificial, okay? It's like being at a cocktail party. All the conversation is light and polite. We're not racist. No one's being left out. We're all fine. And there's all kinds of hidden and obvious walls. That's where people normally are. That's where people want to stay. It's like going to a party, and that's the kind of conversation you have. Don't talk about politics. Don't talk about religion. Certainly don't talk about racial issues and all this difference. Then if it's a party, someone breaks the rule and says, hey, so how'd you vote in the last election? Or, hey, what'd you think about, right? And it's like, usually the host of the party goes, Ken, we don't talk about those things at this party because we're all trying to have a good time, okay? Well, in order to build redemptive community, you have to be the person that takes everybody into chaos. And understand that it's really uncomfortable. I mean, you're uncomfortable doing it and you can't be in chaos all the time. People just can't live like this. We gravitate towards pseudo-community, okay? But chaos is when honest sharing really starts to happen. We had this young man who was going to UCLA at the time. He was half Taiwanese, half Mexican. His grandfather was the ambassador to Mexico from Taiwan. That's how his parents met. But he looked Mexican. And he came to me after months coming to our church, and he says, You know what? I speak Mandarin. I use chopsticks. But everyone assumes by looking at me that I'm just Mexican. And no one comes up to talk to me after the service. And, man, I just can't hang with this anymore. I didn't want to hear that. I want to believe there's this wonderful redemptive community. It's just like, well, that's not true. You can't be having that experience because I see it isn't so. And then I'm being the host. I'm like, let's go back to everything's nice. And it's like I had to live with that. And I started praying with it. I said, you know, so if you have to leave our church, I understand. I need Jackie Robinson's right now. And if that's too costly, if it's too painful, then I can't ask you to stay. And so he left. And he came back after about three years, and he had made peace in his own self, and things are much better now. He's now one of the leaders in this whole biblical reconciliation movement, especially because of his own experience. So he goes, pseudo-community, chaos. You can't stay in chaos. How do you move forward, not backwards? The tendency is to go back into pseudo-community. I think it's through emptying. And this is the Jesus piece, big time. Emptying is where you do empathic listening and learning to love each other more deeply. You seek first to understand, then to be understood. Emptying is where you lay down your agenda to be heard and to be right or to be nice, to be thought of as nice, and to say, okay, I'm going to shut up here, and I want you to really honestly, as best as you can, tell me the truth. What is it like being here? What is it like being in relationship with me? How have I stepped on your toes? And that is only Jesus can lead the way in that. Amen? I mean, only Jesus is that selfless. The rest of us, we just want you to understand why I'm not racist. And when you seek first to understand, that is the greatest gift that we can give to somebody else, is to understand them first rather than make them understand us first. And when people feel understood, Stephen Covey is the one that talked about this. When people really, honestly, truly begin to start feeling understood by you, then they start to want to understand you. I've even found in evangelism, this is an amazing tool, is where I just don't start off like, you need to understand why you need Jesus. It's like, help me understand why you're not a Christian. Why do you think churches are so horrible and Christians are such intolerant beasts? It's like, wow, you're the first Christian to ever let me talk. You really want to know? It's like, unfortunately, yeah. And what kind of Christian are you that actually let me go first? It's like, well, it's one who's learning to be humble. So I think the emptying piece is huge. If you ever want to build redemptive community, you've got to teach the laying down of agenda, okay? The laying down of the need to be right. And then fourth is the experience of redemptive community, being slow to speak, quick to listen, to have thicker skin when it comes to me and thinner skin when it comes to somebody else, okay? I need, each one of us needs to develop thicker skin so that we aren't so easily offended, but we should be more quickly offended when we see somebody else who doesn't have a voice, who doesn't have any power, and they get run over. I think we do it in the reverse. We have thin skin towards ourselves and thick skin towards everybody else. Now, the one piece I want you to understand and appreciate about redemptive community, well, two things. Number one, this is like you walk in and hearing a symphony orchestra getting ready, and it sounds like chaos. Everyone's tuning up. And then the conductor comes in, tap, tap, tap, and there's this amazing thing when everyone empties himself of what they were personally doing and begins to follow one lead, right? That's the Holy Spirit. And he says, okay, now a little bit more violas over here. Now you be quiet, right? And while everybody's playing together, there's this sense of we're all working on the same thing. So that's the first thing is it's kind of like the symphony under the conducting of the Holy Spirit. But the second thing that I really want you to appreciate is this is a very ephemeral experience. Just because you experience redemptive community, you can't never go back to pseudo-community, okay? And you can get so discouraged, right? You can go, oh man, we're there, man! You know, we are so redemptive now, we receive everybody the same. I mean, celebrate the moment when it comes as a gift of the gracious presence of God's Holy Spirit, okay? But don't think that you can then stay there as a permanent place because human tendency, simple tendency is we always go back to pseudo-community. And don't think that when you go back to pseudo-community that that means the other thing was fake, okay? It just means that it's a gift, okay? It's a gift we can't possess, but you have more and more taste of it. You want more. You get that, right? So this whole model comes with a caution that you and I think that once we even touch that home plate, that we never have to go to first base again. And it's so easy to get discouraged because you feel like you're redoing everything all over, all over, all over again. And it's just simply part of the process. Truly celebrate redemptive community when it comes as a gift of this process of being willing to leave pseudo community, enter into chaos, emptying of agendas, and waiting for the conductor to bless. And then don't be surprised and discouraged when you go right back to pseudo-community. Okay, we're going to break for lunch, right? Yeah.
