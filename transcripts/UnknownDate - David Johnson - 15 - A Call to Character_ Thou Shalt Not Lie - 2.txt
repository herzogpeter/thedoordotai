We are entering today our second week of study dealing with the ninth commandment, a call to character, you shall not lie. Of the seven things Proverbs 6, 17 says are an abomination to God, two have to do with the lying tongue. Paul in Romans chapter 3 verse 10 quotes David in Psalm 5 describing people whose way of life is to lie this way. Their throat is an open grave. With their tongues they keep deceiving. The poison of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. And the fear of God is not before their eyes. And that is why they're not afraid to lie. There is no God in their minds to whom they will one day have to answer. Dr. Laura Schlesinger in her best-selling book, The Ten Commandments, indicated that the headline of a New York Times article, June 7, 1996, read this way. What a tangled web we weave. We all practice to deceive. 91%, the article claimed, of the people who were polled admitted that they lie on a regular basis. 20% claimed that they couldn't get through a day, be effective in their career, or keep their grades up without lying or cheating. The article further suggested that the 9% who say they don't regularly lie are probably lying. Diane Kemp in her book, Anatomy of a Lie, cites what she calls a cultural shift with regard to honesty when she says this. Since 1951, the United States Naval Academy, drawing from the brightest and the best among us, has had an honor code. Don't lie, cheat, or steal. In recent years, the Academy has learned that students no longer come to campus with the moral upbringing that enables them to work under that paradigm. Superintendent Admiral Lynch, whose career was cut short when he failed to take rapid action against a large-scale cheating scandal, found that this basic honor code is no longer valued. In previous generations, it says Lynch, midshipmen commonly come from homes where they were taught to always tell the truth. Today, we can no longer assume that that is the case. According to the Barner Report, 72% of Americans aged 18 to 25, college and graduate school age, believe that there is no such thing as absolute truth. Lynch argues that those who don't believe in truth are far more likely to lie. because basically if you have no absolute truth, whatever truth you embrace that really is a lie is still your truth. How many of you have ever heard that? It's your truth and this is my truth. Newsweek magazine reported June 6, 1994, that many of the midshipmen kicked out of Annapolis in the worst cheating scandal in naval history reported having been told by their parents to lie. One said it this way, Lie until you die. The most bizarre story to come out of this whole thing may be the case of one expelled cadet who appealed to the Supreme Court claiming that the Academy's honor code was, quote, that it, quote, failed to meet minimum standards of fundamental fairness, end quote. It isn't fair, in other words, to expect students to tell the truth and not to cheat. Something's unraveling. A cultural shift, to be sure. And nowhere is this cultural shift more apparent than in the events unfolding before us daily in our nation's capital. Not simply President Clinton's adultery, but his lying to cover it up, and not simply his lying to cover it up, but his lying under oath in a court of law, which, if true, is not only immoral but illegal. Last week I told you that we would, for these two weeks, be connecting our study of the Word of God, you shall not bear false witness, to these historic events for three reasons. Number one, because it's in the text. It's simply the next thing we came to, don't lie. Number two, because while lying always matters, no matter who does it, the consequences for a people are always greater, whether we understand that or not, even believe that or not, when a leader lies. And number three, because of the response of the American people to this whole thing, reflected in a 73% approval rating. My question about that approval rating last week was this, that the clearer it becomes that President Clinton is not only an adulterer, but a practiced liar, the higher his approval ratings go. My initial answer to that question was this. They must be asking the wrong question. They are asking the wrong question. See, they're not asking, is he moral? They're asking, is he competent? And the answer to that question, according to 73%, is yes, he's competent. And what they're generally reflecting on is that the economy is strong. Then I speculated that if they asked another question, do you believe he's moral, do you believe he's honest? It's possible that this same 73% might turn on him saying, no, he's immoral and he's dishonest. Interesting thing, turned on the TV Monday morning and found out that just such a poll had been taken and fully 79% of the people polled said that they believed President Clinton is a dishonest, immoral man, which confirmed to me this week that I was asking the right question last week when I asked this. Why is it that to some 73% of our population, it just doesn't matter that he is a dishonest, immoral man? It just doesn't matter that he doesn't keep his vows or tell the truth even under oath. My answer to that last week was this. and it came from Romans chapter 1 because God has given us over. Big statement to say. In Romans chapter 1 verse 24 God gave them over. Verse 26 gave them over. Verse 28 gave them over to three things and the reason he gave them over was because in Romans 1 they really, really wanted it. He gave them over not to the existence of, but to the normalization of sexual sin. That was the first thing. Second thing, he gave the culture over in Romans 1 to the normalization of homosexuality. The third thing God gave them over to was a depraved mind, where they got as a culture to the point where they couldn't tell the difference between what was right and what was wrong, couldn't even decide if there was a right and wrong. To be given over, I clarified and need to do it again, does not mean God has given up on us. It simply means He has given us up to what it is we want. And the way you can tell if you've been given over, whether it be as a culture or as an individual, is that the sins of Romans 1, 29-31, and the sins are being full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, which is lying, malice, gossip, slander, arrogance, boastfulness, untrustworthiness because you lie, not only exist, but are embraced, applauded, normalized, and promoted. So that we have, in fact, in my opinion, become the people of Romans 1.32, who although we know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, we not only do the same, but give hearty approval to those who practice them as well. That is all review. Turn with me now to Jeremiah chapter 5. As we continue our examination and complete our perspective of what God thinks of a nation of people who love to lie and give high approval ratings to those who do. As you're turning, and it would be helpful if you have your Bibles to turn to Jeremiah 5. I want to give you some background as you're doing that as to what's going on in this story. God has been warning Judah by the time we come to this chapter of judgment to come for quite some time. The nation of Israel has been divided into two kingdoms, the north and the south. The northern kingdom known as Israel. The southern kingdom is known as Judah. Israel had already fallen under the judgment of God and were taken into captivity at 722 B.C. by the Assyrians. Only Judah remains with Jerusalem, the capital city, all that remains of Israel. Jeremiah was one of the prophets that God was using in that day to call his people back to himself. And in chapter 5, what we get is kind of an inside glimpse at Jeremiah in a kind of conversation with God. Where Jeremiah and God are delineating the reasons that Judah, particularly Jerusalem, is in trouble. And in fact in danger of the judgment of God just like Israel had already fallen under. Let's look at verse 1. God speaking to Jeremiah. Jeremiah roamed to and fro through the streets of Israel. And look now and take note. And seek in her open squares. If you can find one person, if there is one man or woman who does justice and seeks truth, and if you find one, I will pardon her. It sounds actually kind of magnanimous. While judgment sounds severe, if you can just find one, I'll pardon all of them in terms of corporate judgment. Note this, when he's looking for someone of truth, he does not mean doctrinal truth. He is not looking here for theological accuracy. He is simply looking for someone whose eyes don't wink, whose feet don't shift, whose fingers don't point to everybody else. All we need is one. But all Jeremiah could find in the land was this, verse 2, people who although they say, as the Lord lives, I swear to God, simply swear falsely. in verse 3 Jeremiah discouraged says this oh Lord do not thine eyes look for truth what he's saying there basically this is is this Lord you're the only one who could spot this kind of person I mean I could be deceived I could see somebody who I think is telling the truth but if they're really a good liar they could be lying I don't think I'm the one who can even find this person and you're the only one who could do it. Because all I see is this, rest of verse 3, that though you've smitten them, they did not weaken. Did not weaken at what? At lying. They just kept on lying and grew strong in lying. And even though you've consumed them, they refuse to take erection. Indeed, they have made their faces harder than rock, and they have refused to repent. That phrase, to have their faces made harder than rock, I found vivid in imagery. And it speaks to at least two things that I could think of relative to lying. The first thing that came to me about this was obstinance. People who are liars, they're in one of those cycles in their life where they've gotten caught in this cycle of lying, get real stubborn. They get real stubborn denying the truth. If you've ever dealt with a liar, I mean, you just can't get to it. No, no, no, deny, deny, deny. And what they're doing is protecting their lies. See, the problem with lying is that after you lie, you have to tell another lie in order to protect the first lie. Before you know it, you have lies on top of lies on top of lies. a whole house of cards that creates, even in the liar, a spirit of fear because if this thing gets exposed, the whole house of cards is going to fall apart. By the way, one of the really exhausting, difficult things about lying is that you have to remember those lies. All of us have at one time or another been caught in this kind of thing, and it might not even be a way of life, but it could have gone over the course of a day, A course of a week where you lied and two seconds later you had to tell another one and now you're already in so deep it's going to be humiliating to back out of this thing and you just keep it going and before you know there's this whole thing. It's overwhelming and it's wrought with fear. One of the ways liars get caught quite often is they forget and you accidentally tell the truth. but now you're to the point where you've built this house of lies and I just know that some of us have come to this place and it's the frightening place where you're either going to have to come into repentance and believe there's going to be amazing grace and there is going to be amazing grace or going to yield to the fear of the enemy that's lying to you that there's no hope for you But what you come to is a place where you realize that for you to admit anything is going to open the door to everything. And rather than going toward repentance, which would be painful and humiliating on the front end, but would open the doors of amazing grace to you and healing, instead of doing that, your face gets harder than a rock, and you deny it again. it's obstinate the other thing this imagery speaks to is it speaks to skill what i mean by that is you actually get good at lying to have a face like a rock means that no one can read your face you know i i thought of mount rushmore and i thought of all the four faces there and you could speak to them i mean be an idiot if you did but you could speak to them and and but there's just nothing that you just don't get anything back it's always the same i mean you You could maybe carve an image of someone's face, and the way it was carved could communicate something like character, but it would always be communicating character, even if it was lying. The point is, you don't get any real feelings, and nothing ever changes. It's a rock. The imagery for a liar is profound. This is a person who, when they lie, don't blush. They don't blink. they don't look away this is the person who can look you right in the eye just the way honest people do and lie you ever find yourself interrogating one of your kids if you have kids you have found yourself doing this son did you do such and such and by the way the thing you're asking them whether they did or not may not be that big a deal it's it's you're not even upset about it. If they did it, you'll just want it back or something like that. It's no big deal. But with their back to you, walking out the door, walking out the room, up the stairs to their room, they say this, no. Every parent on the planet to that response says this, get down here. And you can feel yourself getting big. The thing you're asking about wasn't that big, but now you're not sure they told you the truth. They come down the stairs and here's what every parent says, look at me. Did you take the cookie? And in your spirit, you're going, it doesn't matter if you took the cookie. It matters that you tell me the truth. Why do you say, look at me? I want to see your eyes. Here's why. Because the eyes reveal the reaction of the soul to a lie. But here's the bad news. Some people get so skillful at lying that you can look them right in the eye and you still can't tell if they're telling you the truth or not. Why is that? Because they've made their faces harder than a rock. And the bad news for the liar is that that means something in your soul has died. The bad news for the person who has to live with the liar is this growing sense that you're crazy, that you can never put your feet on solid ground, and trust is absolutely gone. something in the soul dies when your face gets harder than a rock relative to lying so much so that you can actually become able to look square into a tv camera and not blink not blush and lie say things like i did not have sex with that woman people who are able to do that without a blush without a blink understand this about them they are Jeremiah chapter 5 verse 3 people side note those of you who find yourself unable to lie and there are many of you like that and the reason you can't lie by the way it's not that you never lie Oh, I never lie. Liar! It's not that you never lie. It's that whenever you do, you tip it off. Why? Because you blush, you blink, you can't look the person in the eye. No, there's something that tips it off. And even if you do and get away with it because they bought your lie, you can't sleep. You need to know this about yourself. that by virtue of the fact that you are deeply troubled by your own lies, and even if you get away with it, you lose sleep and go back to correct it, as humiliating as that is, you have by that built in a safeguard against sin, your tender conscience that sometimes bugs you. I wish I could just let this go. I wish I didn't blush every time I lied. I mean, how come other people get away with it? Does it ever bother you? I mean, I'm not saying this is pertaining to lying, but my personality is such that I'm kind of out here all the time, and I got more than a little. It bothers me. I can walk into a room, not say a word, and my wife will go, what's wrong with you? What are you hiding? It just drives me crazy. Those of you of tender conscience have by that tender conscience a wonderful protection. Why? Because if it's hard for you to lie, you're going to know something on the front end of every behavior. You know what it is? Whatever it is you do, you're going to get caught. You know what? If you know that, that's not going to keep you from ever being an idiot. But it will serve over the course of your life as a safeguard of sorts because if I do that, People are going to find out. My wife is going to find out. My kids are going to find out. The church is going to find out. You know why? Because if I get asked, I'm going to have to say, yeah. But if you can lie, here's the real scary part. You can do anything. You are capable of anything. Because you have come to learn that whatever you do, you can get away with. All you have to do is lie. Lying doesn't bother you. Indeed, you've made your face harder than a rock. Charles Spurgeon said it this way, When the heart is untruthful, it is then prepared to be the seedbed of every evil thing. Any crime is possible to a liar. He who is rotten with falsehood will break, that is, he will give in at the touch of every temptation. End quote. Here's some scary truth. about what it feels like to deal with a liar. And some of you who have run into some, and I'm not talking about someone who struggles with lying from time to time. I'm kind of separating it out. We're talking about some chronic ways of living here. The scary part about living with a liar is this. There's probably more going on than you know or even suspect. Why? Because if they're a chronic liar, They have effectively concealed from you what's really going on. Now that's really bad news if you're married to a liar. We talked about adultery a few months ago. Thou shalt not commit adultery. It is absolutely impossible to get involved in adultery and be successful, if you will, at adultery without becoming a liar. In fact, you can't get away with it for long without becoming a very, very good liar. Beloved, be very afraid of getting good at lying. And be very grateful if you can't get away with it. Be very grateful for those times when even when you try to get away with it, you got caught. As much as you hated it, the fact that you got caught was a gift from God. Be very grateful that you blush, that you blink, that you can't sleep when you did lie until you go back and tell the truth. My son Caleb was 12 at the time. And by the way, I go into the story of my son who did a thing when he was 12. It's very important that you know that I never talk about my kids in any light, whether it be good or negative, and this is going to be negative but really funny, without talking to him. I mean, I told him every word I'm about to say, and the things that you probably will find the most embarrassing were the things he enjoyed the most. Anyway, he was 12 years old. When Caleb did this stupid kind of thing that 12-year-olds do, he stole a pack of gum at a convenience store. And he got caught. And the particular owner of this convenience store was not a corporate person. This guy owned the store and took this really serious, called the cops. My 12-year-old kid ended up in the backseat of a police car. Goes to the police station. They call our home. We weren't there. The reason we weren't there was because my wife and I were on a missions trip, saving the world for God. and our 12 year old son was staying with someone from church I was very glad for who it was Dick McCauley, wonderful man along with his wife Jean kind of adopted grandparents by our kids was staying with our kids and Dick was called by the police to bail my son out of jail wasn't quite in jail he didn't quite have to bail him out but it makes a better story just had to tell the truth there about that. Needless to say, our re-entry that year from this mission trip was really quite interesting. We flew in Saturday night, went to church Sunday morning, and Macaulay's asked us to come to dinner the next morning. We were just kind of going to brief and have the kids all together and just expecting to hear from Dick and Gene. What a wonderful time they had with our wonderful kids. Dick pulled me aside just before dinner and shared with me this delightful story. Well, the first thing Bonnie and I did the next day after we got this fact straight and sat down with Caleb was we drove Caleb back to this convenience store and brought him face-to-face with the owner, who was absolutely shocked to see this kid again, and Caleb apologized to him. Then we had, by order of the police department, a consultation with a detention officer. And basically, this consultation was an evaluation. See, what they wanted to do was determine if Caleb was a criminal or just an idiot. Turns out he was just an idiot. Had to go to three classes, consecutive Saturday mornings, where they pressed in a variety of ways, lecture, movies, all these different things, the consequences of breaking the law. That was another, you know, this process, when this happened and he got caught, Actually, there was something in me that was delighted. I mean, I wasn't the bad guy. Hey, the cops said we're going. But it was a little weird when I got to this class, these three weeks of class. Two people came up to me and said, are you Pastor Dave? Are you teaching the class? No. You know, it was kind of interesting. The fact is, his little 12-year-old heart was profoundly affected by that. And he went through what my wife and I discerned to be real repentance, even coming to us later and disclosing some other things, really minor matters that he'd kind of gotten into and some directions he had begun to go that we would have never known. The kid came clean. Caleb, my son, is now 18 years old. And you know what? I really trust that kid. he is not just a good kid he's a god kid here's the word be very grateful when you don't get away with it because when you do you believe you can and believing you can get away with it removes a restraint. By the way, when I asked Caleb, I mean, in fact, I went to dinner with him, just he and I, and I told him about this and I even told him everything I was going to say and if it was okay. He told me this is the truth. He said, you know, the only reservation I have, Dad, is to think about telling him I stole the gum that's really kind of wimpy. Could you tell him I stole a car? I said no it's a sermon about lying so then we had another talk that whole thing gives you a little window into the bizarre nature of our family verse 4 Jeremiah looking at this whole thing of lying begins to figure you know this must really just be a problem in a certain segment of the society certainly not everywhere. Verse 4, then I said, it's probably only the poor. They are foolish, an interesting thing to conclude. For they do not know the way of the Lord or the ordinance of their God. I will go to the great. I'm going to go to the university people. I'm going to go to the people who have had an education, a master's degree, the PhD. Surely they have wisdom, and I'll speak to them, for they surely know the way of the Lord and the ordinance of their God. Problem, they too, with one accord have broken the yoke and burst the bonds. What those two verses together mean is simply this. It's not just a segment of society in Jeremiah's day. It's the whole culture. And that even empowers me to say and causes me to say, even though we're using the events in Washington as the illustration because there's so much in our face, this is not about Bill Clinton. at all. What I'm addressing is something in the culture. Indeed, deception in all its forms, in Jeremiah's day and in ours as well, has become a way of life, the very fabric of society, so much so that if everyone stopped telling lies, stopped and told the truth, Everything would fall apart. The entire machine would grind to a halt. Verse 7, your sons have forsaken me and sworn by those who are no gods. When I had fed them to the full, it didn't matter that they were full. So you just always thought that the people who were going to move into sin were just empty people. I gave them everything they needed, and guess what they did? They committed adultery. and trooped to the harlot's house. They were well-fed, lusty stallions, each one neighing after his neighbor's wife. Verse 9, Shall I not punish these? Did you really think this didn't matter? I mean, because Jeremiah's day, Judah, you were doing this for 20 years, and I didn't intervene because it was going on for 20 years. Did you really think it didn't matter to me? Says God. I mean, get a bigger view of history than what you've been doing for your life for five years, for 20, for 30. Most people do scoff at the possibility even of the judgment of God. I mean, in our culture, even the mention that God would someday even judge what's going on, would be absolutely mocked. I mean, yeah, right. How ignorant can you be? I mean, to actually believe that God has anything to say about how we live or will ever do anything about it. Verse 10 speaks of a judgment that is going to come. Verse 11 tells why. Here's why. Because they've dealt treacherously with me, declares the Lord. How? How did they deal treacherously with you, Lord? Verse 12, here's how they've lied about me and said, well, it isn't God who's doing this. Misfortune will not come on us. Judgment's never on God. Give me a break. God doesn't care what we do. And we will not see sword or famine. Get this. Jeremiah is speaking to a culture that is denying the providences of God. God's not involved in our lives. Nothing to say. about how we live or what we do, and he never would intervene. In fact, he doesn't even exist. They are so out of touch as a culture with what God's doing in the world that they can't tell when God's blessing them and they can't tell when God's judging them. Not he. What that means is, it's not God, it's chance. It's luck. It's a strange weather pattern. It's an unfortunate disease. and the prophets didn't help verse 13 the prophets are as wind and the word is not in them thus it will be done to them the prophets are windbags the word is not in them as I think of that as one who is called of God to declare the word I think what a terrible thing to not have in you the word was not in them Let me wrap this whole thing up by simply reading to you verse 20 and following. Listen for the word of the Lord speaking to us in these words. Declare this in the house of Jacob and proclaim it in Judah, saying this, Hear this, O foolish and senseless people, who have eyes but see not, who have ears but hear not. Do you not fear me, declares the Lord? Do you not tremble in my presence? The answer to that question is no. for we have exchanged the truth of God for a lie. Here's the truth about me, says God. I have placed the sand as a boundary for the sea, an eternal decree, so it cannot cross over it. Though the waves toss, yet they cannot prevail. Though they roar, yet they cannot cross over it. I am the Creator. And you have effectively worked me out of the entire equation when it comes to the creation. This people has a stubborn and rebellious heart. They have turned aside and departed. They do not say in their heart, let us now fear the Lord our God who gives rain in its season, both the autumn rain and the spring rain, who keeps for us the appointed weeks of the harvest. Your iniquities have turned these things away and your sins have withheld good from you. Verse 27, like a cage full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit. Therefore, they have become great and rich. That's a very interesting statement. Therefore, meaning by means of their ability to lie, they have been made great. By means of their ability to lie, they have made a lot of money. Another way to look at that, applied to our culture, They got a really good economy. In Judah, they are fat, they are sleek. They also excel in deeds of wickedness. Verse 30, an appalling and horrible thing has happened in the land. The prophets prophesy falsely, the priests rule on their own authority, and my people love it so. In a theocracy different than a democracy, prophets and priests were the rulers. But according to verse 30, the leaders were liars, prophesying falsely. But they were also popular, and the people love it so. In Jeremiah's day, they too had a 73% approval rating. Last line of verse 31. But what will you do at the end of it? What will you do at judgment when you are face to face with the one with whom you have to do? The hoped-for answer to that question is always this, that before judgment falls, whether it be on a culture or on a person, that that person turn, repent, change their mind, so that God can do what He loves to do, lavish grace. Make no mistake, God will judge. He does that. He is also, however, predominantly, His deep desire is to be a God of grace. The response to this word, both this week and last, by some among us, I think needs to be, first of all, acknowledgement. What do you mean? What are you supposed to acknowledge? Some may need to acknowledge this, that my life has become like a cage full of birds. For my life, my house, is full of lies. And I have become great. And I am fat and sleek. I excel in deeds of wickedness. But as you begin to consider the reality of that, even hearing maybe the voice of God prompting you to deal with some of these things in your life right now, a fear, I promise you, a fear is coming on you in enormous ways. And the fear is this. If I admit anything, it's going to open the door to everything, and my house of cards will collapse. Here's the deal. It will collapse. It has to collapse. But on the heels of that collapse, you need to also know, will come rivers of mercy, oceans of grace, resurrection life. The prodigal returns, put a ring on his finger and a robe on his back for the one who has died is now alive. Truth really can set you free. I ran into a guy, a good friend of mine, in the back of the auditorium as this service was just starting. He had been in the first service and he hung around to talk to me afterwards. And he says, Dave, really land on this Rivers of Mercy thing? I said, okay, okay, what's going on? He said, you know, I know his story. He says, you know, two years ago when my house of cards fell apart and all of my lying stuff just got exposed, when I was at the point, and nobody caught me, it was just me coming out with it all. When I was at that point of considering whether I could do it or not, I need you to know when you talked about the fear, you can't imagine the fear I felt because I knew that when I said anything, it would reveal everything. And the only thing that gave me the courage to come out with it all, at the risk even of my marriage, was I knew there would be rivers of mercy, oceans of grace, resurrection life, that someone would put a ring on my finger and a robe on my back, for I who was dead could maybe actually come alive again and walk in integrity again. What hope would we have? Who could stand if not for grace? Beloved, the thing that gives us courage to look at lying, as big as it is, and call it what it really is, and to move in all of our lives toward real integrity is not because we're just so noble. It's because of amazing grace. You know why? Because every one of us are liars. For others, my prayer is that this word would stir deep longings in you for intercession. That God would stir by these two weeks in ways that you might not even understand the desire, deep desire to pray for our church, to pray for the church, to pray for our city and country and our culture and our leaders. And the reason is this, because if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray, seek my face and turn from their wicked way of living, I will hear from heaven, I will forgive their sin, and I will heal their land. Dear God, may it be so among us. I'd like you to stand as we close. let's pray father I thank you again for your word I pray specifically for the men and women among us who may be facing in some very frightening ways right now their house of cards that their life is like a cage full of birds and their house is full of deceits. And the fear right now is enormous that if they say anything, it's going to expose everything. And it would occur to me that in something this vital to our health, the evil one would be very active right now, stirring up even greater fear, spewing lies like this. If you tell the truth, you're going to die. I pray in Jesus' name that by the power of your Spirit, you who are the truth would speak with much more authority and clarity than the evil one could ever know this word. If you tell the truth, you will not die. You will come to life. In Jesus' name, bring gifts of true repentance where that is appropriate. In Jesus' name, call us to intercession as well for our church, city, nation, culture, leaders. I pray all these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
