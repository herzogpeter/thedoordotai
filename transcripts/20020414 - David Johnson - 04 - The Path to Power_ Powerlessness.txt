Thank you, Maureen and group. Let's pray as we go to the Word. Father, my request this morning is simply this, that by the power of your Spirit through the Word today, you would provide what I do not have, and accomplish what I cannot do. I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. In the context of our study these days, dealing with, as most of you know, the issue of power, both rightly ordered and disordered power, began some weeks ago to talk about what I referred to as the path to power. And that's such a path to rightly ordered kingdom of God power, the kind that heals and doesn't destroy, that builds and doesn't tear down, that heals and doesn't wound, really does exist. But that the path to that kind of power in the kingdom of God is an odd path, an unfamiliar path, a path actually not taken by many, full of paradox and apparent contradiction. The paradox and contradiction is revealed in the fact that if you're really on the path to authentic kingdom power, it will often look and feel like you're on the wrong path entirely. Because it doesn't always look, and it doesn't always feel very powerful at all. Thus far, we've examined three scriptures that illustrate the paradox of that reality. Philippians chapter 2, Matthew 20, and John 13. But Philippians 2 may provide the most succinct expression of this path, it's embodied in Jesus Christ, who although he existed in the form of God, regarded equality with God, not a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking on the form of a slave, and like a slave, became obedient, because that's what slaves do, obedient to even the point of death, even death on the cross, therefore, or precisely because Jesus was willing to walk that empty yourself, obeyed to the point of death path, a path that at times in his human reality looked and felt as weak as death, precisely because he walked that path, God gave to him the name, which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus, every knee would bow and tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father. So here's the deal, beloved. If you're really interested in experiencing and walking in power, and it seems like everybody is, come walk that path of emptying yourself, obedience even to the point of death. Have this attitude in you, which was also in Christ, who emptied himself. The point is this. The path that Jesus took to power yielded real power, beyond belief power, power to heal and deliver. redeem and transform, power to usher in all the supernatural realities of the kingdom of God. But the path itself was not about learning how to grasp and wield power. The path to power in the kingdom of God is the way of the cross, the way of obedience. It is the way of the servant, we learned from Matthew 20. It is the way of the basin and the towel we discovered last week in John 13. Today I would like to examine yet another element of this path to power that, like the others, is full of paradox and apparent contradiction. For the path to power I want to examine today includes the way of powerlessness. The path to power is the way of powerlessness, which, like the others, does not look or sound or feel very powerful at all. I'd like to examine two scriptures that illustrate this very clearly. The first is Matthew 18. So open your Bibles if you have them to Matthew 18, beginning our study in verse 1, where we find the disciples asking Jesus a recurring question. In fact, we've dealt with this question and heard them ask it several times in the course of our study on power. Verse 1, at that time, the disciples came to Jesus saying, Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? Stop right there. The question itself, the very fact that they're asking it, reveals to us some things about us, some things to us about them relative to their character, their values, and their sense of self that I think we need to know. For what it reveals, the very fact that they asked a question, among other things is this what it reveals, is that they got their sense of value, they got their sense of meaning and identity, their sense of self, the old-fashioned way, they earned it. which resulted in a life driven not by compassion and love, but by competition, by comparison, giving rise to questions like this in Matthew 18, verse 1, which one of us is greatest? See, what I really want to know is compared to him, because I'm in competition with everybody else, it's kind of how I find my place, compared to them, churches do this, movements do this, our church compared to their church, compared to them, how are we doing? Now, I know we're all in the kingdom, That's why I think it's a pretty good question, Lord, because what I really want to know is how are we doing in the kingdom? Where do we stand? How does our performance look to you, Jesus? Are we doing better than, oh, I don't know, him? Are we doing better than, oh, I don't know, them? Because if we are doing better than him or her or them, then maybe we can feel a little bit better about ourselves, comparatively speaking. Add to what we know about them just because of their question this, that in Mark 9, which is a parallel passage to Matthew 18, it indicates that before they came to Jesus with this question, they had already been arguing amongst themselves about who was the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, which actually means that they weren't really wanting Jesus to answer their question. They were actually coming to him, wanting him to settle their argument. It's important to get this picture. They were not like students, and this is a way this question could be asked legitimately. It's not a bad question in and of itself. But they were not like students. Curious about and wanting to know from the teacher, what does greatness in the kingdom really look like? How is it really expressed? Because truthfully, master, we don't have a clue. So tell us. We are learners. That's not how they were asking this question. They all had an opinion about who was greatest in the kingdom. A very strong one, I suppose. And I know for sure that because they were arguing about who was the greatest in the kingdom amongst themselves. So tell us, Lord, which one of us is right? We're having an argument. We want you to settle it. Which one of us is winning? Because even in the kingdom of God, it's competition. Which one of us is doing the best job at earning our own value, of establishing with our external performance a sense of identity and a sense of self? They all had an opinion, I'm quite sure. Some I'm sure thought it was Peter who was the greatest in the kingdom. and I'm absolutely positive that Peter probably thought it was Peter. I think there are probably reasons to think that Peter would be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven as we measure greatness and power, flamboyant, decisive, up front. Peter's the guy who got out of the boat and walked on water. Surely he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven or people like him are the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. But there was an argument going on that day. So everybody wasn't necessarily buying in to that. See, others might have noted that, yeah, Peter walked on water, but he also sank like a stone. Whatever else Peter is, he's inconsistent. I think it's John who's the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, the disciple that Jesus loved, the disciple of love. And all you need is love. Yeah, da-da-da-da. Love is all you need. I think I'll write a song. Paul later in 1 Corinthians 13 said, the greatest of these is love. I think I'm on pretty good footing here when I say that John must be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. But there was an argument going on. You see, while I think and know that love is wonderful and clearly central to activities in the kingdom of God, the truth is there are people I know who are loving and the problem is they turn to mush. And things don't always get done when people get too lovey-dovey. What you really need in the kingdom of God, if we're going to storm the gates of hell and really accomplish something great in this community, is passion. That's why I think James is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. But the problem with passion and the problem with people like James is sometimes they use their passion in ways that are disordered and they run people over with their passion. See, I think it's Andrew who's the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Andrew, who quietly, consistently, behind the scenes, just kept bringing people to Jesus. Don't you love Andrew? So could we maybe just all agree it's Andrew? Now, I don't know if that's how they argued or if that's what they argued. All we know is that they argued. What I also know is the argument that I just speculated about sounds real familiar to me. See, we're not wondering about who's in the kingdom or not. I'm going to assume that all of us, you know, we've all been. So it's in the arena, Lord, of all of us who really are serious about our faith in you. What I'm curious about among those who really care about greatness in the kingdom, which one of us is the greatest? Which one of us is the best? Which one of us really get it? Which one of us are doing the whole deal, the kind, you know, the kind, the way you meant it to be done? which one of us is the purest the realist which one is the most committed which one is the most enlightened it's me I just know it's me it's us I just know it's us turns out there are lots of opinions about who is the best who's got the whole deal who is the purest and the realist some say the greatest in the kingdom is the missionary others the minister others it's the up front or others oh no it's the behind the scenes none of those the greatest in the kingdom is the miracle worker the tongues talker the prophecy giver, the signs and wonders doer the doctrine defender I think it's the Baptists no they get the Bible but they don't have the power it's the charismatics Baptist charismatics are the best or charismatic Baptists whichever it's not the baptists no it's the Catholics no it's the Methodists no it's the evangelists no it's the social activists it's the Lutherans on and on we go so you tell us Lord that's the argument going on when they come to Jesus Matthew 18 verse 1 we will submit to your lordship on this we can't all decide we've got our opinion we'll submit to you on this one after all you are God tell us which one of us is right which one of us is winning which one of us is greatest to put it in the context of our study these weeks which one of us is furthest along the path to power. We're all on the path. Which one of us is furthest along on the path to power? In answering their question, Jesus did the most amazing thing. In fact, I'm quite sure it was a disturbing thing. It disturbs me, to tell you the truth. In answering their question, he called himself a child, verse 2. Just looking around. Yeah, you, this one, come here. If I pointed to somebody, don't freak. Greek word for child this is just to give you a picture is paideon actually and it gives us some designation because there are other Greek words for children that would designate a certain age and so the Greek word paideia gives us a sense of a child between five and seven kindergarten to second grade somewhere in there picture a child that size that age coming to Jesus he sets him before them and says there there you go little five year old kid you guys want to talk about greatness you want to talk about power take a look at this child. For in this child are all the necessary ingredients for greatness and power in the kingdom of God. And here's the deal, guys. Right now, you do not possess those ingredients. Where does he say that next verse? For truly I say to you, unless you are, number one, converted. Converted? That's a very intimidating word. It sounds like he's saying, unless you become a Christian, aren't they? Yes, they were right now already followers of Jesus. The word convert there doesn't mean, well, it could apply to becoming a Christian, but the word convert there simply means to turn. Unless you are turned, why did they need to turn? Because they were moving entirely the wrong direction relative to greatness in the kingdom. You want greatness? You better turn really quick because you're moving the wrong direction. You will never find it the direction you're going. You will never find the power. You will never find greatness. You need to be converted and become like this child. The word that draws me there, that has all the energy, is the word become. The word become is a word that speaks to transformation. You need to be transformed into this child. Forget about the child piece. Just let that word transformation wash over you and let your impressions of it affect you. See, I don't know about you, but when I think of transformation, especially spiritual transformation, I think of becoming something better. I think of becoming something bigger. I'm going to be transformed into something better. I'm going to be transformed into something bigger. One of the reasons I love transformation is because I just might be transformed into something, oh I don't know, greater. Like going from a caterpillar to a butterfly. You don't go from a butterfly to a caterpillar. Like going from an ugly duckling to a beautiful swan. Can I tell you something? That when Jesus brought this little child before them and said you need to be transformed into something like this little child they did not feel like he was inviting them to a promotion that did not feel like becoming something greater this is not the direction I thought he was going to call us when we came to him and we were sincere we're just we're his really sincere followers we're interested in the greatness and the power and the glory of God and his kingdom And I thought he was going to call me this way, and he starts calling me this way, to wear a towel, to take the basin and the towel, to become a servant, and now to become a child. And something in me when I see this, again, if I keep this Sunday school stuff, I go, isn't that cute? Jesus just loved the children. Then I can go, that's a nice... But when I really let this in, there's something deep in me stirring that begins to resist this. Because whatever else a child is and whatever other qualities that children might possess that reveal the realities and the wonders of the kingdom of God, the truth about this five to seven-year-old boy or girl that Jesus has placed before them is this, that he or she couldn't possibly be more opposite of what the disciples were seeking from Jesus at this moment. For what they are seeking is greatness and power and they think they should get a pat on the back for seeking that. It's a good thing. You guys are the ones who are seeking what you ought to seek. This child, however, is the absolute antithesis of power as they understand power. Above all things, this child is powerless. It's really interesting. They're asking about power, and he shows them a child. See, Jesus couldn't possibly have put anyone in front of them more powerless than a child. Even a slave would have more power than a child. And slaves have no rights in Jesus' culture. I mean, slaves would be the lowest of the low, but not lower than a child. Even a slave has more power because a slave could band together with other slaves and have a rebellion. What are you going to do? A bunch of five-year-olds get together? That's really scary. Children are, whatever else they are, they're powerless, helpless, needy, dependent. Truth about a child at five or seven years old is you leave them alone and they die. You leave your children alone, you'll get arrested. You drop a five-year-off in the middle of the forest and walk away, they will be lost. Interesting thing about children between five and seven, they don't have any problem acknowledging their dependence. that's the rub for me they don't have any trouble with it you ever see a five-year-old kid in worship this morning i don't want to embarrass anybody but i was sitting a couple rows behind the molly crew over here and little inga was on greg's shoulder and she was looking back at me and i'm a little waved and she would smile but then she smiled she leaned into her dad she leaned into her dad she was safe to smile at me as long as dad was there kids don't kids aren't afraid of their dependence. But could I tell you something about me? This is not about children. I don't like feeling dependent. That was something I wanted to grow out of. Couldn't wait to not have to lean into my dad anymore. Kids at that age try to act like they're more independent than they are. In fact, even at young ages, they start to pull away and they feel pretty frisky. One of my favorite stories about our youngest son, Christopher, as he was kind of posturing one day about his independence and his ability to do it on his own. We were going up to camp. I was speaking at camp. We were bringing the whole family. That's how we did vacations in those days, free food, you know. So we'll go, I'll speak, and we'll have, sit by the lake. All the way up, though, Chris is bugging me. He's saying, dad, dad, dad, dad. He's wanting to know, have we ever been there? I'm pushing him out of his comfort zone and going to a new place, but it wasn't. And we kept saying, Chris, you've been here. You're going to love it. You had a great time the last time you were here. He didn't remember it, so he was all nervous and very clingy when we got out of the car. But when we got there, he realized, oh yeah, I have been here before. And he's walking down the hall of one of the dormitories, getting a little frisky, moving out ahead of us. And then he said this, Bonnie and I heard him say at the top of his lungs, I know this place like the back of my head. And we thought, you're exactly right. That's exactly how you know this place. And then when he got a little too far away, he noticed he was too far away, and he came scrambling back. His dependence wasn't something that bothered him. You know what? When I look at children, little children, like I did it with Ingo or this little precious one down here, I just look at children like you. I feel warm emotions. I love children. I'm moved by children. I can't wait for grandchildren. There's no pressure there. My kids are here in this one. There's absolutely no pressure there. I value children. I love when the children kids, the kids choir sings as long as they leave me time to preach. And I believe we can learn incredible things from children about the kingdom of God. Don't you? Don't you? Do you want to be one? Do you want to be one? Well, you do. I don't. That's good. I'm glad you do. As long as the Sunday school story I do. But you put a child in front of me and say become like that and I say I just got over being like that. I didn't like being small. I didn't like being needy. When I was needy I acknowledged it and I found safety in my father and in my mother and they were the safest people on earth and this thing is really tough by the way. It brings up all sorts of other issues about whether they're safe or whether you can even trust God. That's a whole other sermon but this does touch that stuff. But I don't like feeling vulnerable. and you know what? I think the disciples had the same thing. You weren't even a real human being until you were 13 years old in that culture. Now they're calling me to be somebody who absolutely has to have the dad and has to have the mom. I like being independent. See, whatever else children are on the positive side, carefree, trusting, transparent, and believing, which are all things I'd love to taste more than I do. On the negative side, they're small, needy, vulnerable, dependent, and powerless. And those are all things I want to get over. Those are all things I want to grow out of. But see what the struggle of my life has been, and probably yours too, is what I don't understand is that it's only when I am dependent and I press through my resistance to dependence that I find the other childlike qualities that I really desire like a carefree spirit. like transparency, like belief, and like rest. I wonder if I could share with you a secret desire of mine. After I share it, it won't be a secret, but it's an unspoken desire, and I'm calling it a secret because it's one of those things that I'm not even aware of until I kind of bump into it and feel it exposed in my spirit. The desire I have around even transformation, become like something. We talk about transformation around here a lot. I care a lot about Christ being formed in you, about Christ being formed in me. It's at the center of our whole vision and purpose for being as a church. But one of the secret desires, unspoken desires, and even expectations that I have about transformation is this. I'm hoping that in my process of transformation, I might come to a point where I get so transformed that I'm no longer vulnerable. In fact, that's one of the reasons I'm so interested in transformation, because I'm halfway hoping that by the power, by the strength of God in me, by me becoming strong in God and by my transformation, I'll no longer ever be needy or dependent or ever confused again. See, I'd like to get to the point where I know this stuff like the back of my head. I don't mind loving God. I respond well to calls to say love God and love him more, and I do love him, and something about my love for God is found and stirred whenever anybody ever calls for that. And I even respond well to obeying God. Obey God, and something stirs in me, and I say yes. And I'm not saying that I never have struggles with that. But I'll obey you, Lord, and I'll love you, Lord. It's the dependence thing that sticks in my craw. In fact, I would like to obey you. I just don't want to be dependent on you to obey, because the dependence makes me feel weak, and I hate feeling weak. And dependence makes me feel vulnerable, and I hate feeling vulnerable. And when I feel dependent, I don't feel in control, but there's a problem. The path to power is the way of dependence. It's the way of powerlessness. I told you this is a secret desire of mine that I'm not always even aware of. I became aware of it a couple weeks ago here at Open Door, but it wasn't here. It was at the Robinsdale Farewell Service. Very poignant service, lots of memories. And it was interesting, too, because the setup for me was that we were kind of remembering and reflecting on the faithfulness of God for the last years that we were in Robbinsdale. But in my mind, and for Bonnie and me, we went all the way back to the beginning. And so there were a lot of memories. Some of them were wonderful. Some of them were hard. And I went after the third service back down to sit with Bonnie, my wife, to finish out the worship time. And just began to whisper something in her mind or into her ear that I felt like God had given me. And I said, you know, with us reflecting now on where we've been, there's a real strong sense in this whole series we're doing now is on preparation for where we're going. And the truth is, in the way we did the first 20-some years, is by being absolutely dependent. And I don't know how to do the next half of this ministry, but it's going to be by, we're going to have to do it the same way, being absolutely dependent. and some of you are going, isn't that noble? And then the next thing I said was, and I hate that. And we laughed and we cried. See, there was some little expectation in me that by the time I reached 49 or 50 and we start the second run that I would know and I wouldn't have to, I could do all this stuff for God, but I could just not be as needy, not be as vulnerable, Not be as absolutely dependent on God for my next breath. But that's where the power is. It doesn't feel good. The path to power is a paradox. Because the path doesn't feel powerful. It just yields power. See, here's what I know and do believe. The power is perfected in weakness. for when I am weak, then I am dependent. Get this. The virtue is not in the weakness. I know a lot of weak people who are weak. And they play the victim all their life. The virtue is not in the weakness. It's when it pushes you to dependence. For when I am weak, then I am dependent. And when I am dependent on my father, when I'm clinging to his leg like a child, and knowing that's the safest place on earth, then I am strong. And the power of the Father comes to me and through me, but it comes through this posture of, I desperately need you. And I can't get my life from anything else. And as soon as I do, I'm like a kid walking through a shopping mall who's left their parent and now I'm lost. By the way, I believe that when Jesus set his child in front of these disciples in Matthew 18, they knew exactly what he was driving at because it wasn't the first time that he had said this to them. I think it's the first time he said it this way to them, but he had said this, tried to deliver this message to them several times before. The first time he gave this message was at the very beginning of both his ministry and at the very beginning of their relationship with him as well. You see, it all began for them in Matthew 4. That's the second passage I want to look at very briefly this morning. Matthew chapter 4 picking up the action in verse 12 when Jesus heard that John the Baptist had been taken into custody it was as if the divine starter gun of history went off indicating that his ministry was supposed to begin when John was taken into custody for from that moment on the arrest of John verse 17 Jesus began to preach and say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand kingdom is the Greek word basileia and it means the reign of God or the power of God is at hand means it's within your reach. So the reign of God, the power of God is something, beloved, that you can reach. You can touch. You can step into and experience. That's the good news. Verse 18, walking by the sea, he saw two brothers, Simon, who was called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. And he said to them, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. And they said, okay. Through verse 22, he gathers some more. This is the initial gathering of the disciples. They're just getting to know Jesus. They've left their nets to follow him. They do not know what he's about, not yet. In verse 23, his ministry begins, and it reveals what his ministry is going to be about. Number one, he is going to proclaim the kingdom, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the kingdom. Number two, he's going to do the kingdom, healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness. Read it. Jesus, verse 23, was going about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news about the reign of God being within people's reach. And then he did the kingdom. He demonstrated the power of it, healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people. The result of that was predictable. News about him spread, verse 24. Multitudes came, verse 25. So in a flash, Jesus is the hottest thing in town. He is the senior pastor of the first church of what's happening now. and I would like to be the pastor of that church. How about you? But then Jesus does the strangest thing in Matthew 5 verse 1. Seeing the multitudes, he does what I would never do and what no church growth consultant I know would ever do. He withdrew from the multitude, went up to the mountain and after he sat down, his disciples came to him and opening his mouth, he began to teach them saying, Pause it right there. Just for a moment, be a disciple. With this guy about to speak, just a few days ago, a few days ago, you were a fisherman, mending nets, and you had no other plans. It wasn't like you were mending nets and going, I know I have a higher call. No, there was no other dreams. This was it. When this guy out of the blue pretty much came to you and said, follow me, and you did. Maybe out of boredom, if nothing else, you followed him. And you have just seen things you never dreamt were possible. Again, you were not seeing dreams come true. You never dreamt this stuff. You were seeing beyond belief things that had never occurred to you happening. And now the guy who did all that stuff is about to speak. Here's my question. If you were one of those original 12 sitting on the side of that mountain with him about to speak, what do you think they expected him to say? another question what do you think they would want him to say well answer is I don't know what they would have expected or what they would have wanted I just know what I would have expected and what I would have wanted because I'm sitting on this hill right now you see what I would have wanted to know is this if I had seen what they saw and heard what they heard I would want to know this Jesus how'd you do all that and can you teach me because unlike the disciples who never dreamt of seeing things like this the lame walking, the deaf hearing the favorable year of the Lord being proclaimed forgiveness being extended, people being made new unlike the disciples who never dreamt that I've been dreaming about this stuff all my life see I've heard these stories in Sunday school I went through phases where people said get your hopes done. Lower your expectations, Dave. Because God used to do this. Isn't it great? But he doesn't anymore. And I've gone through phases where people stirred up my faith and it almost made me feel like it was up to my faith to make this stuff. And I try really hard to get more and more faith. But I'm not like the disciples who never, I've dreamt of this stuff all my life. In fact, did I tell you a few weeks ago in prayer I got a picture? Did I tell you that? I got a picture in prayer of a building with lights. You have spoke to the power of the kingdom coming to our church. I guess I did tell you, didn't I? This is the fourth time, isn't it? This has always been a dream of mine. So here's my question, Lord, as I'm sitting on the mountain and I'm seeing all this power explode, here's what I want to know. How'd you do that power of the kingdom stuff? And can you teach me so I can maybe be great in the kingdom of heaven? In a humble way, a promise. and seeing the multitudes he withdrew from them went up on the mountain after he sat down his disciples came to him and I was among them and so are you and opening his mouth he began to teach us saying church of the open door I got some good news I got some bad news the good news is this that the power of the kingdom of God that you just saw is real and it is for you it is for my church the bad news is this that the path to that power is entirely different than you think and if you don't turn you'll never experience the power that I have for you see none of the power that you just saw is going to come to who you think it's not going to flow through who you think here's the flash blessed are the poor in spirit not those full of themselves who know for sure they can blessed are those who don't have a clue if they can but they believe in a God who can blessed are the poor in spirit because they come up hungry for something beyond themselves because they're absolutely convinced that in their flesh they can't do it they're the ones who get the kingdom and the power thereof poor in spirit the word poor in the Greek is the Greek word tokos and it means it doesn't just mean poor I mean this word pushes it it speaks to begging dependence there's that word that bugs me again dependence blessed are those reduced to begging dependence who recognize they can't save themselves they come up hungry for amazing grace who recognize they can't sanctify themselves they come up desperate for the filling of the spirit blessed are those who recognize it by the power of their intellect they can't build a big church or storm the gates of hell they come up desperate for the empowerment and the gifts of the Holy Spirit of God it is amazing really when you think about it the very first thing out of Jesus mouth relative to what the kingdom of God was like and how it works is this. You guys, it's not for the big and the strong and the capable. It's for the broken and the mourning. It's for those men and women who've come to the end of themselves and recognize their only possible hope for whatever it is that they want is God. And that's where I'm going to bring my kingdom. That's where I'm bringing my power. By the way, it doesn't always happen this way, but most of us come to the end of ourselves and come to this realization that I can't save myself, I can't sanctify myself by my own effort, I can't storm the gates of hell, build a great church. We generally come to that realization. It's an awful realization by some kind of failure. And often the failure that we experience is the kind of failure that makes us feel rather than being something that we think can make us and open us up to the realities of the kingdoms. Generally failure is something that we think disqualifies us. My favorite illustration of this is Peter. Jesus is preparing them, the disciples, for just moments before his arrest and his death, and he's preparing them for that, and he gives to them a prophecy to help them. It's from the prophet Zechariah, and it's this. The shepherd's going to go down, and when the shepherd goes down, the sheep are going to be scattered. Peter hears this word from Jesus and protests, not me. Even though God, through the prophet Zechariah, says all of the sheep, all of us disciples are going to be scattered. There's something that God guess doesn't know about me. I have decided to follow Jesus. I can do it. I will do it. I won't deny him. You know how I know? Because I got the right stuff. He had the right, he wanted to do the right thing. The way he was going to do it was because he was so full of his own strength. He was absolutely convinced he could. He could. Jesus' response to Peter was in effect this. You're right, Peter. You're absolutely right. You're not going to be scattered like the other disciples. You're going to be shattered. And it's not going to be because I don't love you. And it's not because I'm trying to punish you. This has nothing to do with punishment. It's actually because I have decided to use you, you big goofball. I have decided to use you beyond your wildest dreams, but for me to use you and bring to you the power of the kingdom and flow through you the power of the kingdom, this I can, I will, self-sufficient spirit has got to go. And one way it will go is when you hit the wall going 100 miles an hour, right in the middle of I can, you're going to find out big time you can't. And when you find out you can't, you're going to come up hungry for something you've needed to be hungry for. And that is you're going to come up hungry for amazing grace and you're going to come up hungry for the filling of the spirit and the empowerment from on high because you're going to recognize you don't have what it takes in you. Blessed are those who recognize they don't have what it takes in them. They go running back to the father and start hanging on to his leg. And like little Inga they start leaning into their dad and leaning into their mom, even while they're reaching out for what it is God's called them to do and who God's called them to say hi to or whatever. Board meeting Tuesday night, this last Tuesday night, among the things we do at board meetings, elder board meetings, is check in with each other and you just kind of get the sense of how individually, personally we're doing and pray for each other. and often in that time it's kind of, you know, what kind of wind do we sense blowing in our church and what kind of things do we need to notice and pray about? And the concern was expressed, and I know for a fact that it's not just our elders' concern, it's a concern that many of you have, and I don't think I've addressed it like this from the pulpit before, but the concern was addressed at the elder meeting that we could, you know, one day in this move to Maple Grove, that we could end up just becoming some big, rich, self-satisfied church and lose that sweet spirit of dependence, which actually did mark, I think, our church. I mean, it is a weird thing when from week to week, sometimes you don't know where you're even going to be able to meet. It creates in you this, oh, God, but I got to tell you, it doesn't feel good, you know? Isn't it cool? We're so dependent. I hate that feeling. But I know that's the key to power. I do know that. And so the concern was, you know, what's going to happen when we have it and we know where it is, and it's even going to be nice. Might we lose this sweet spirit of dependence as a church? And as we thought about it and prayed about it and just batted it back and forth, it occurred to me and it occurred to us that that possibility does exist, that we could lose that spirit of dependence. And to think it couldn't happen here would be scary. Because it could happen here. But let me tell you something. very important it doesn't have to happen i'm not i'm not getting big here i'm not going it's not going to happen no i don't i'm not big today i can tell you it doesn't have to happen and i even know one simple way at the risk of oversimplifying i know one simple way to keep it from happening it's this church of the open door never ever ever forget what the real mission of the church of Jesus Christ is and what it isn't. Can I tell you first what it isn't? It isn't to get big. Do you know what? We're going to get big. How many of you know that? How many of you are a little afraid of that? Not because it's going to spoil, you know, the dependence, but just because it's going to get so big. I believe it's going to get big. The mission of the church is not to fill the seats. You know what I think? I think we're going to fill the seats. I think we're going to make more seats. I think we're probably going to get multiple seats. I don't know where it's all going. but the mission of the church even if we get big that's not the mission the mission of the church is not to gain a reputation for success or to entertain the masses the mission of the church is to do the works of the kingdom of God the mission of the church is to is to help blind people see deaf people hear lame people walk and dead people rise again and I got a flash for you. I can't do that and neither can you. We desperately need the working among us of a God who gives sight to blind eyes, hearing to deaf ears, strength to lame limbs and life to dead people who live in Maple Grove and Minneapolis and who knows around the world. see I don't care how nice our building is although I'm grateful for a nice building we're going to get I don't care how polished our program is though I really want an excellent program I really do and I don't care how wonderful our music is though I hope our music is wonderful and I think it is and I don't care how powerful we think our pulpit is and I don't care how friendly our people are although I want us to be friendly serving powerful pulpit wonderful music, great program the best we can do is what I want the best we can do but the truth is even after the sermons and the music and the program and the friendliness and everything else we don't in our flesh on our best friendly day do not have the power to make dead people rise but that's precisely what God's called us to do so all I can say is this come Holy Spirit we so desperate if all it is is make a big church how many of you know we could fill the seats without God how many of you suspect it could happen I mean the twins can fill every seat if they win and you know what that's an interesting analogy If we win, if we're funny, if we're entertaining, we could fill every seat. How many of you know that's not the job? You know that. You know that. So come, Holy Spirit, because we are absolutely, totally dependent on you to do the work of the kingdom that we can't do. Disciples had a good heart. They had a good heart. It's the same heart I got. It's the same desire I got and the same one you have. Who's greatest? I want to know. I want to know about power in the kingdom of heaven. but he called the child to himself and he said unless you turn and be transformed into something more like this child you'll never enter into the power of the kingdom life because part of the paradox of this path to power is that the path to power is the way of powerlessness brokenness dependence on the god who has the power and that's where the power is and i'm here to tell you it's real power. Let's bow our heads and just be quiet for a moment. Let the word soak in to your spirit and soul. Amen. Father, my request in closing is now not simply my request for me, but now it's my request for us. That by the power of your Spirit at work in us, you would provide for us what we do not have and accomplish in us and through us what we cannot do. And all God's people said, Amen. Amen.
