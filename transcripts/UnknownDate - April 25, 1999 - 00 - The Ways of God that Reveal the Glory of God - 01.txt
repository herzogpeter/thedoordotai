Open your Bibles to Exodus chapter 33, where we have been for the last two weeks, highlighting the centrality and necessity of the manifested presence and glory of God to be actively and discernibly at work among the people of God for this journey of faith that we've been speaking of for several weeks to be safely navigated. For without the manifested presence of God at work among us, we the people of God will simply not be able to find our way on the journey of faith. Now last week we began to examine Moses' response. Who, when he was presented with the possibility that he could procure for himself the promise and provision of God without the active presence of God involved at all, said this in verse 15. If thy presence does not go with us, then do not lead us up from here, for we are a people of the presence, verse 16. It's who we are, it's all we've got. Without your manifested presence, actively at work among us, the land of promise, the milk and honey, has no meaning and provides no joy. Today I would like to further examine the rest of Moses' response to this possibility that you can procure the promise and provision of God without the presence of God as is revealed in verses 13 to 18. This response, providing even more insight into the heart of Moses, into the ways of God that we need to know for our journey of faith. Let's look at verse 13. Now therefore I pray thee, if I have found favor in thy sight, let me know thy ways, Moses says, that I may know you so that I may find favor in your sight. Consider, too, that this nation is thy people. And God said, My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest. Verse 17. And the Lord said to Moses, I will also do this thing of which you have spoken, for you have found favor in my sight, and I have known you by name. Then Moses said, I pray thee, show me your glory. Two things Moses asks for here we would do well to examine and understand. Number one, let me know your ways that I may know you, verse 13. Number two, show me or reveal to me your glory, verse 18. Now those two requests raised for me a question that are going to drive our study actually for the next few weeks. The question is this, what are the ways of God that we need to understand and walk in as God's people that reveals and releases the glory of God, the manifested presence of God. Well, whether you know it or not, we answered that question, at least in part. Last week, we discovered a piece of it. We discovered one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God, and one of those ways is the way of desire. For God reveals His glory and manifests His presence to people who singularly want to experience His presence, who passionately pursue it. More than the milk and honey, more than power, success, or fame, we want you, said Moses. God's heart is drawn to that desire. He moves toward it. Indeed, in 2 Chronicles 16, the eyes of the Lord are searching to and fro throughout the whole land in order that He may strongly support or manifest His presence to men and women whose hearts are truly His, who really desire Him. He manifests His presence and He reveals His glory to those who want it. It's simply one of God's ways. Well, Moses did. And God said to him, because of that, verse 14, then my presence shall go with you and I will give you rest. I will give you milk and honey. Another way of God that reveals the glory of God revealed in the text I just read is the way of humility. God resists the proud, but he gives grace to the humble. It's a different way of saying God goes toward humility. In the text, the humility of Moses is revealed in the request itself when he says, let me know your ways. The way humility is revealed there is this. Keep in mind that when Moses asks here to know the ways of God, he is not a novice. He has successfully led the people out of Egypt, across the Red Sea, and through the wilderness. He has consistently experienced already the presence, power, and provision of God in a variety of ways. The pillar of cloud leading them by day. The pillar of fire protecting them by night was an experience of his presence. Manna from heaven provided every morning was an experience of his provision. In verse 11 of chapter 33, it says that God spoke to Moses face to face as a man with another man. That speaks of intimacy. Yet with all of that revelation of God, that knowledge of God, Moses' view of himself was still this. Oh God, I'm just beginning to scratch the surface of my knowledge of you. The more I know, the more I realize I don't know. The further I go, the deeper things get. I consistently feel, even though I've walked with you for years and known marvelous things about you, like I'm in this thing way over my head, I desperately need you. Let me know your ways. Here's the principle. God reveals his glory, not only to men and women who want that glory manifested, but he reveals it to men and women who desperately know they need it. One of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God is the way of humility and dependency. God goes toward that. By the way, this request of Moses also reveals to us something about the character of God. For even though God has revealed himself to Moses and made himself knowable, face-to-face communication they had, there is still something about God, even after all of that revelation, that is unknowable. What I mean by that is this. You can't plumb the depths of God. He is unfathomable, unsearchable. He is inexhaustible. Paul said it this way, Romans 11, 33. Oh, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God, how unsearchable are his judgments and unfathomable his ways. And what that tells us about the journey is something very exciting because what it tells us about the journey of faith is this, that this is a journey of never-ending discovery and wonder. It is a grand adventure because no matter how much I know of the character and grace and mercy and power of God, there is more to know. I have a picture in my mind of Dave Busby. One of the last sermons he ever preached here, a series of sermons, was taste and see that the Lord is good. And he kept going to his mouth. Oh, taste. And he was talking about experiencing God. And the glory of our journey of faith is this, that no matter how much you taste God, there's more to taste. No matter how much you see of God's truth, there's more to see. And you spend your whole life tasting more and more and more and seeing more and more and more, your whole life long, that kind of discovery adventure, until one day you see face to face, and you have walked with God, and you have known glory, and you have seen his truth, and then you see him face to face. And among the things I think we're going to see when we see God face to face is this. I didn't know anything. I didn't see anything. I had no idea it was this glorious, and this is an incredible adventure, this journey of faith. Oh, the depth and riches of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God. They are unsearchable. They are unfathomable. And that leads me to the third way of God that reveals the glory of God. And this is the one I want to spend the most time on this morning. It is the way of reverence. A sense of reverence at the awesome holiness of God reveals and releases the glory of God. To illustrate this, I want to return to the story I began to tell you a couple of weeks ago. weeks ago about Ichabod. Remember that? About how the people of God had lost their sense of the presence of God. Let me just remind you of the story getting you up to speed quickly. Hophni and Phinehas, the two unrighteous sons of Eli the prophet, had brought the Ark of the Covenant, which was the symbol of the very presence of God, into a battle with the Philistines. They did not bring it into battle out of reverence or hunger for God. They brought it as nothing more than a good luck charm. Much as religious people often do, touching all the bases, making sure they go to church on Saturday night, the day before a big game. Well, God is no one's good luck charm. They lost the battle. 30,000 men died at Shiloh. Hophni and Phinehas were among those who died. And on top of everything else, the Philistines took the ark of God, the very presence of God. When the pregnant wife of Phinehas was given the news of her husband's death and also the ark of God being taken, the presence of God being taken. She went into labor, gave birth to a son, and died in the process. But before she died, she named her child Ichabod, which means the glory of God is gone from us, and the glory of God was gone. For 70 years, the ark of God, symbol of the manifested presence of God, remained detached from the people of God until a man named David, who according to the scriptures, was a man after God's own heart. Means he pursued the heart of God until he came along. Understand this about David's passion. It was not so much for the ark itself as it was for the glory of God to be reconnected to the people of God so that they could live in the presence of God. Today we would say that this way. David was a man who had a passion for revival. because what I just said is what revival is. Revival is when the glory of God gets reconnected to the people of God so that they can, again, live in the manifested presence of God. I've made this distinction all along. I'm talking about manifested presence. We know Christ lives in us. He is here. We're talking about manifested glory where you know it is being demonstrated and experienced. But for that to happen, David needed to learn about the ways of God. He needed to learn that past desire for God or even an awareness of our need for God, the people of God. In order to be reconnected to the glory of God, needed to experience a reawakening of reverence for the holiness of God. And by the way, if you ever do a study of any revival historically, you will find that among the things that happen when revival happens is at least this thing. Along with many other things, you will see a reawakening of reverence for the holiness of God. Let me tell the story. When the Philistines got the Ark, now this is before David's on the scene, right after Hophni and Phinehas lost the Ark in 1 Samuel 4, it was for them a major coup. They knew about the Ark, they knew about Moses, the law and the history, that God met with his people on the Ark of the Covenant at the mercy seat, that it had the Ten Commandments inside, that it was a holy thing. Therefore, to profane this thing would be great fun. So they brought the Ark to the city of Ashdod, the center of worship for their God, Dagon. They placed the Ark of God in the temple of Dagon and set it before this enormous statue of their god, Dagon. All of that to say, the god of the Philistines is greater than the god of the Hebrews. Early the next morning, 1 Samuel 5, verse 3, the priest came into the temple to do a little more gloating, and they found Dagon, their great god, falling on his face before the presence of Almighty God. This was not the way it was supposed to go. So they called all of their Dagon statue lifter upper guys and hoisted this statue back into place, figuring some mischief did this, some tremor in the night. It was a very disturbing event, but they figured it was a blip on the screen. Next morning, priests come in again, but this time not only was Dagon face down in the dirt, in the presence of Almighty God, but his head was severed and his hands were severed. Impotent was he before the holy God. And the Astrodites began to get a real big clue that the manifested presence and glory of God was not to be trifled with, that it was real. And when handled with irreverence, it could be dangerous. By the way, this picture of Dagon going down is a prefiguring of Philippians chapter 2 verse 10, where Paul says, one day at the feet of Jesus, every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father. Now some people are going down because they want to. You're going down, I'm going to say, I hope everybody here, because you want, because you are my king. I went down a long time ago. I'm going down. Doesn't matter. Everybody's going down whether they want to or not. All the Dagonites of the world are going down. That's the way it's going to be. This was just kind of a prefiguring of that. Well, it kind of spooked these guys, and so they sent the ark to someplace else. Let's send it to Gath. They'll enjoy this thing. Well, to Gath there came a great pestilence, so they sent it to Ekron. To Ekron there came a great pestilence, and they began to think, we better get rid of this ark, give it back to the people of God. So they did. Interestingly, they brought it back to the people of God with a sense of great reverence, at least as much as they knew how to muster. they prepared to bring the ark. They built a cart to carry it with the finest of their woods. They got two cows still nursing, never used for labor before, and that was to them an act of reverence. They included substantial gifts of gold that the Bible says was a guilt offering on their part, as if to say, we're really sorry we took the ark. Don't be mad at us. We have great reverence for your God. Please take it back. After they delivered it, the reverence continued. They took the ark that they had built with all this fine wood, chopped it up, built a fire, sacrificed the cows as an offering to the God of Israel. 1 Samuel 6, the Israelites came out to get the ark and brought it to a place called Beth Shemesh. There was a problem, however. You see, the people of God, believe it or not, had less reverence for the ark of God than did the Philistines. Don't know exactly why. I guess in my own mind, the way I picture it is that maybe it's that familiarity breeds contempt, kind of like growing up in the church. Yeah, yeah, I've seen this. Ho-hum, no big deal. We've seen all this before. Here is the truth about the Israelites. Here is the truth about maybe churchgoers, kind of ho-hum, the whole thing. They had no idea and no appreciation for what it is they had. In that casual way they were approaching this whole thing, one of them nonchalantly opened up the Ark of the Covenant as if it were a common suitcase or a trunk, even though they knew that no one can abide the full presence of God, not even Moses who saw God face to face. He was veiled. The full presence of God is going to consume you. Even though they knew that, he just got to open it up and take a look at it. He didn't take that seriously, and 50,000 people died. that day at Beth Shemesh. 50,000. What is that about? Does that bug you? What kind of God is this? I'll tell you what kind of God this is, and it's a piece of God we need to understand and sometimes lose. It is a holy God who says, do you know what you're so casually approaching when you talk about the presence? Do you know what you're so casually approaching? When you ask for glory to be revealed, when you seek the manifestations, do you have any concept of reverence? Do you have the slightest clue about a God who says, these are my ways, walk in them. This is my word, these are my laws. Don't step outside the boundaries, I'm serious. Well, the response of the people to that demonstration of power was predictable. I mean, they were scared to death. We don't want the ark. Get the ark out of here. And they brought it to the house of Abinadab. Sound like Porky Pig there for a second. Abinadab, where it stayed for 70 years. Interesting note, it stayed at the house of Abinadab for 70 years, 10 miles from the city of God. What she needs to tell you, this is really easy to act. They could have gotten this back. A little side note about this. I do not believe that the people of God at this point, when they brought the ark to this guy's house, saw themselves in this as abandoning God. We're still the people of God. We go to the house of God. We pray our prayers. We sing our songs. They still wanted to do their religious thing. They just didn't want the presence. Why? I think the reason they want the presence is the same reason people today don't want the presence. Even though we'd never say that, the reason they wouldn't want the presence is because the manifested presence of a holy God is not always real manageable. It's unruly, unsettling, disturbing, sometimes dangerous. every once in a while you hear somebody talk about what they want God to do in a church and they kind of wistfully hope for and pray for what God did in Acts that we would be a church of Acts that he would do among us what he did there really is that what you want? would that include Ananias and Sapphira? Ananias and Sapphira who for those of you who don't know lied to the Holy Spirit, and because they lied to the Holy Spirit, died on the spot. There are wonderful things about being in a place where the active presence of God is visible, but you better know something. If you want to play games in a place where God is manifesting, you better be very careful, because it is a dangerous thing to be a pretender in a place where the active presence of God is involved. Much better you go where they're doing religious stuff and no God stuff. Because this is serious. The experience of God during this time when they gave the ark to the house of Abinadab was probably much like what Donald McCullough describes in his book, The Trivialization of God, when he writes this. Visit a church on Sunday morning and you will not likely find much awe or sense of mystery. Reverence and awe have been replaced by a yawn of familiarity. It's boring. The consuming fire has been domesticated into a candle flame, adding a bit of religious atmosphere, but no heat, no blinding light, no power for purification. Now, some of you might reflect on times you've been in church and just bored stiff and think this, that the abject boredom that you experienced is simply proof that God's not real. I mean, if God is real, if he is a consuming fire, then consume something. Then convict and confront, act. Show some demonstration of God's reality. I would like you to consider another possibility. That the mind-numbing boredom and irrelevance that does in fact sometimes attend some church services may not be proof that God's not real. It may, however, be proof that God's not there. For Ichabod is written, the glory has departed. Here's the truth. The glory of God, the real glory of God, is not boring. It may be terrifying, as a matter of fact. Troubling, disturbing. It's also healing. Awe-inspiring. but the real thing isn't boring. You know, it occurs to me too that some years ago the church realizing that we were boring figured we can't be boring anymore so we started entertaining. That's not the glory either. It's not about entertainment. It's about a people who desperately want the presence. Manifested presence of God. Annie Dillard shakes it up a bit with these questions Why do people in churches seem like cheerful brainless tourists on a packaged tour of the absolute? Does anyone have the foggiest idea what sort of power we so blithely invoke? Or as I suspect, does no one believe a word of it? Churches are like children playing on the floor with their chemistry sets Mixing up a batch of TNT to kill a Sunday morning It's madness, she says, to wear ladies' straw hats and velvet hats to church We should be wearing crash helmets The ushers should be passing out life preservers and signal flares We should be last to our pews Unless, of course, there is no presence Because if there is no manifested presence, there is no danger There's no excitement, there's not going to be any kind of disturbance You can take a very nice nap I grew up in church, many of you did too and what occurs to me is these people who were scared of the presence and gave it to Abinadab but kept on with their religious stuff, they opted out for the worst possible life there is on earth, I think. Think about this, religious adherence, where you're going to church, singing the songs, listening to the sermon, taking a nap without manifested presence, it's not real at all is of all things on this earth boring, the, I promise you, the most boring thing of all. It will knock you down. It will just kill you. You will never, oh, it's the worst choice you can make. Nothing is more boring than religious adherence without manifested presence. Back to the story. There was no hunger for the presence among the people of God until King David, 2 Samuel 6. But even David needed to learn that the ways of God that reveal the glory of God involves more than a desire for the manifestations. It involves a reverence to the awesome holiness of God. David took the best men of Israel, went to the house of Abinadab. We want the ark. He said, okay. They built an ark the way the Philistines did. They figured that was good enough for God, for them. and they began to transport the ark on this cart. There was a problem with that. God had made it very clear how the ark was to be transported. Exodus 25, verse 12, David knew this well. And you shall cast four gold rings for the ark and fasten them on its four feet, and two rings shall be on one side of it and two rings on the other side, and you shall make poles. And you shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark and carry the ark with them. You need poles. And by the way, these poles are going to be a symbol of doing what God said to do, doing it God's way. David knew the thing about the poles, but he said, no big deal, it doesn't matter. We're going to do it our way. Well, doing it their way, the ark began to tip. A guy reached out to stabilize it, and when he touched the ark, he died on the spot. And again, this question comes into my mind. What is that about? David had that question too. In fact, the text says in 2 Samuel 6 that David was angry, afraid, and confused. I thought I was desiring and doing a good thing. We need to regroup. We need to rethink. They brought the ark to the house of a man named Obed-Edom. and David who already had a wonderful passion for God that was a good thing was beginning to get clued in about a deeper truth about the awesome holiness of God three months later word came back to David that Obed Edom's house was being blessed beyond measure went to his men and said this let's try this again only this time just slow down this time we're going to do it God's way forget about all our cool ideas and the shortcuts we may have 1 Chronicles 15 13 he says for we did not seek God according to his ordinance the first time we're going to do it this time principle again one of the ways of God that reconnects the people of God to the glory of God revival is a rekindling of reverence for the awesome holiness of God. It's an awareness that God is not my equal. It is an awareness that God is not someone we deal with on our terms, someone we take under advisement, mull over, think about and sort of reorder Him to my way and my world and my desires and my values. Reverence for the holiness of God that reconnects the people of God to the glory of God happens when I begin to reorder my life and my way to his life and his way. They moved the ark with poles, which means they went back and did it God's way. Please get this. Reverence for God does not just mean you sit quietly in church with a pious look on your face. Reverence for God does not just mean you feel warm and gooey during worship and lift up your hands. Though those are good things. Reverence for God is revealed when you begin to reorder your life to the ways of God because you just got a real good glimpse of the holiness of God. Let me speak very frankly here. We want the glory of God. Really desire the manifested presence of God. That first sermon on this whole thing was, we have that desire part. Come, Holy Spirit. But your life is in no way ordered to the ways of God. You're sleeping with your girlfriend. You're having an affair. Your spirit and your mouth is full of slander, gossip, malice, evil speech. Your heart is full of bitterness, strife, and anger. Your finances are totally out of control, and it's not just because you've made some mistakes. It's because you have invested entirely in the world's stuff. You have no poles at all to carry, as it were, the manifested presence of God. Here's the deal. We can't come here and worship in great praise and then go live like the rest of the world and at the same time know the glory of God. You've got to get poles. Reorder your life God's way. And by the way, reordering your life God's way is one of the things that happens when there is a reawakening of reverence for the holiness of God. It's like a natural, when you see the holiness of God, it is a frightening thing and there's an overwhelming impression. You know what? God's not fooling around. I'm going to do it his way. look what happened when they did in 2 Samuel 6.13 they picked the ark up by poles by the way after all this history how would you like to have been one of those guys any volunteers? lost 50,000 in Shaloh, 30,000 in Beshimesh, how about you? how are you? they picked it up it says they took six steps one, two, three still here it's okay we're still alive thank you Lord four five six the sixth step they stopped so overwhelmed and grateful that they were still alive because they had a huge picture of the holiness of God that they stopped and they had a worship service and they sacrificed the axe and the fatling and David danced before the Lord they were very grateful and guess what Nobody was bored. There wasn't a straw hat in sight. Nowhere. Nobody sat like this. Not one person, I promise. Now, a good question at this point, one that maybe you're wrestling with already, would be this. Dave, I see the reverence as important, but do we have to be afraid? This fear thing is... It's a great question. And I've got good news. The good news I have to give is the gospel because you don't have to be afraid. Indeed, we need to know that because of Christ, Hebrews 12 is true. Hebrews 12, 18 says this. You need to know you have not come to a mountain. You have not come to the Ark of the Covenant that may not be touched. You have not come to a blazing fire, to darkness, whirlwind, or gloom. You have come not to Sinai, but you've come to Zion. It's a different way of saying you have not come to law, but you have come to grace and freedom. And to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, to the general assembly and the church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and you have come to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect, and best of all, you have come to Jesus, the one who made all this access and coming to the holiness of God, the Ark of the Covenant, as it were, who made all this access possible, for he is the mediator of the new covenant and you have come to the sprinkled blood that speaks better than the blood of Abel. Pull it all together. Here's the deal. When you wed a profound reverence for the holiness of God, that if you see it all by itself, would make you cower in a corner in fear. Not taking more than six steps. When you wed that awareness of the holiness of God to a deep understanding of the amazing grace of God that says, you know what? I am a holy God. I am a consuming fire. But I want you to know that this holy God, because of the blood of Christ, says you can come. When you wed the holiness of God to the amazing grace of God, it births in you a passion to adore that holy God, which ushers you into the presence of God, and you begin to experience the glory of God. And even a passion to reorder your life to the precepts of God. And what I just described to you is revival. Back to David. 2 Samuel 6. Look at his passion. He erupt. They'd already taken six steps. They'd already begun to worship. And now they're a ten mile trip. And now they're beginning to enter the city. And they're kind of dancing and worshiping the whole time. But you've got to picture this. It's been 70 years. It's been 70 years. And David, as they're entering the city, is going, I can't believe it. This thing I've been praying for and wondering for whatever happened. It's about to happen. Revival is coming. The ark of God is coming right now. I'm watching it. Coming into the city of God, it'd be like coming into the church to be with the people of God so we can experience and live in every day the presence of God. And when this dawns on him, he just blows a gasket. And he says this, you know what? I don't want to function like a king right now. I want to function like a worshiper. I want to be a subject of the king of kings. So he takes off his kingly robe. And in taking off the kingly robe, he's saying this, I want to take off my authority, and I want to put on submission to a higher authority. And I want to take off, I'm in charge. I want to take off, I'm the king. And I want to put on servanthood, worship. I want to put on garments of praise. And with all his heart, David danced before the Lord. Psalm 24. It's an incredible picture of what was happening when the ark of God was being brought into the city of God. The choir and the singers on the wall were echoing back and forth to each other. The choir was coming in with the ark. The singers were on the wall. And the choir with the ark would begin to sing this as they were coming into the gates. Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be lifted up, you everlasting doors, that the king of glory may come in. And the singers on the wall would sing, and who is the king of glory? and the processional would sing back to them, he is the Lord, God Almighty, strong in battle, full of grace, rich in mercy, he is the king of glory. So lift up your heads, ye gates, and be lifted up, you everlasting doors, that the kingof glory may come and who is the kingof glory? He is the Lord, God Almighty, strong in battle, full of grace, rich in mercy, he is the kingof glory. Amen. Would have been quite a song. Pull it all down. Bring it all together. The way of God that reveals the glory of God begins with desire. The glory of God is revealed to people who want it. It is marked by humility and dependency. The manifestation of God comes to those who need it. but the way of God that reconnects the glory of God to the people of God revival is reverence for the awesome holiness of God it's a way that moved you to reorder your life to the ways of God to get poles as it were and when God's people wed reverence for the awesome holiness of God to a deep understanding of the amazing grace of God you will have born in you a passion to worship and serve that God which ushers you into the presence of God and you begin to experience the glory of God. I believe that this question, what are the ways of God, that reveals the glory of God, is a question that is worth sitting on for a while. Pray, join, partner with me. That God, for weeks, will reveal to us the ways of his glory and his presence. Let's stand and be dismissed. Father, first of all, the thing that affects me is that you've made yourself knowable. That we could in any way, at any time, approach the holiness of who you are. It's amazing. And when we get a picture of that, we just come up even more grateful for grace, which is even more amazing when we see your holiness. Pray that you would affect us, infect us with the same spirit of reverence for the awesome holiness of God that hangs on constantly to a deep understanding of the amazing grace of God so that we would come up with profound passion to adore you as God so that we could be ushered into the presence of God and know the glory of God. Pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
