Camped as we are in these same three verses for the fourth week in a row, starting in verse 2. We should have this memorized by now. My goal is that they may be encouraged in heart, Paul writes. They, meaning the Colossian believers and those in Laodicea. And united in love so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. And I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments. Well, last week we talked about wisdom. And in particular, the difference between what we called wise masters of life and critics. Now, masters of life are people who are constantly learning, who see life as an education. People who've chosen to follow the master of life, doing what he says to do, and then finding out that his ways and his teachings really work in real life. Now, critics, on the other hand, are content to live their lives pointing out the flaws in other people, never choosing to follow a master. They remain safe in their seats, watching others and refusing to live their own life. And so we were left with this question. Do you want to be a critic or a master of life? Do you want to be someone who knows how to navigate life's problems with wisdom? Or do you want to hide behind your own ability to intelligently critique others? Well, today we're going to ask a different question, though stay on the same topic of wisdom. And the question is this. How does a wise master of life go about making decisions? Choices. Choices like who will I marry? What job is right for me? Where should I live? Should I rent or buy? How will I fill out my NCAA tournament bracket? Will I get fries or the salad? Our lives are filled with choices, big and small. So how does a wise person engage in choosing Well, well, here's the deal, though. The first thing that popped up to me as I was thinking about that this week is the amount of bad choices that I make. I want you to try to think back just to this last week to one bad choice that you made. Maybe it was something that you chose to say to someone or email to someone. Maybe it was something you chose to buy that you shouldn't have bought or to eat that maybe you shouldn't have eaten. Now, here's the thing about those decisions. even though maybe they turned out to be bad ones. At the moment that you decided, it felt right, didn't it? At the very least, it felt like you were justified in making your choice, right? Yes, and we end up with a series of these kinds of choices. So what happened? Seemed right in the beginning. It didn't turn out to be right. Well, Proverbs 14.12 sheds some light on this human plight. The writer of Proverbs puts it this way, There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end it leads to death. There's a way that appears to be right, but in the end it leads to death. Now, these verses characterized ages 16 to 21 for me. I went to a college that had a tradition every year that was called Case Day, where a few very unwise people would attempt to drink a case of beer in one day. And during my junior year, I decided to be one of those people. People are saying, I don't know what to think of you now. Well, I'll spare you the details, but let's just say that at the beginning of the day, it sounded like a great idea. But at the end of the day, I thought I was going to die. Well, some of you decided to start a business, and now it's killing you. Some of you decided to sleep with that person, and now that decision is killing you. Some of you decided to overextend yourself financially, hoping and even having a pretty good confidence in the fact that in three or four years, you'd be making enough money to afford it. And now that decision is killing you. Some of you made the decision to trust that person again. And now that decision is killing you. There's a way that appears to be right. But in the end, it leads to death. So the question that comes to us as we want to become wise masters of life is this. What makes us choose the things that lead to death time and time again? There's a passage in the New Testament book of James that I think is very helpful here. So we're going to kind of use Colossians 2 as a springboard over to James. I want to read you this from James chapter 3 starting in verse 13. It starts with a question. Who is wise and understanding among you? Well, let them show it by their good life. It's another way of saying by being a master of life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom. Verse 14 says, But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, don't boast about it or deny the truth. Such wisdom doesn't come down from heaven, but is earthly, unspiritual, even demonic. For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice. But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure, then peace-loving. It's considerate and submissive. It's full of mercy and good fruit. It's impartial and sincere. So Dave, James contrasts two different sources. I don't know what that slip was. Freudian, who knows? James contrasts two different sources from which we make our decisions. Wisdom from heaven or wisdom from the earth. Now, wisdom from heaven, I did a little reading on this, refers to something that comes from somewhere ancient, something that existed before human beings did. It's wisdom that stands the test of time. It's wisdom literally from above. It is wisdom from God. But wisdom from the earth has been created by human beings, or as we read in James 3, sometimes even worse. It's demonic. It has a demonic source, and therefore it's not trustworthy. It's wisdom from below. And when you hear those two sources of wisdom, you can't help but ask, why in the world would anyone choose the wisdom that's from the earth, that's less trustworthy, that's not from God? It seems ridiculous that anyone would choose to use the wisdom from the earth. So perhaps this metaphor will help. I want you to think about wisdom from heaven and wisdom from earth as two different pairs of glasses that you might put on, even unknowingly when you are faced with decisions of any kind. You either put on the wisdom from the earth or put on the wisdom from the heavens, many times not knowing which one you're putting on. And here's the deal, I think, and here's where we get into trouble, is because we end up choosing to put on whatever glasses we know best. We choose the glasses that are most comfortable on us, and we put them on, and we make our decisions. And that's why I think Paul writes in Colossians 2, 3, you've got to catch this nuance. He doesn't write that he hopes people will be wise. He doesn't write that he hopes people will find wisdom. He writes that he hopes people will know Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. And Paul is saying here that when you really get to know Jesus, like buried treasure that's been hidden from you, you will find the hidden treasures of wisdom and knowledge that you're looking for. But let's be brutally honest. Even many of us Christians, we actually know the wisdom of the earth much better than we do the wisdom of Jesus. And so, when we make decisions, we end up putting on the earth glasses most of the time without even knowing it. Let me give you an example. The wisdom of Jesus says in Matthew 6 that we shouldn't worry about our life, what we'll eat or drink, or about our body, or what we'll wear. But the wisdom of the earth says that if you don't look good, if you're not thin, you better make some changes and make them now. So question, how many of you have worried about how you look this week? Yes. Oh, man. You know? Right. Another passage that Jesus talks about, he says, if one of you has two shirts and you meet someone who has not any shirts, you should give them one of your shirts. Another passage says that if you don't forgive someone their sins, your Heavenly Father won't forgive you. but if you open up my closet you know we have a little room that houses all of our clothes that a little family could live in probably and when it comes to forgiveness there's a lot of reasons i choose that that person does not deserve my forgiveness. See what I mean? I follow Jesus. I believe in Jesus. I accepted Jesus into my heart. I just don't believe his wisdom is the best way to live. And so I put on my earth glasses. And so I think it's important for us to see what we're seeing when we put on earth glasses. So according to James, the earth glasses are tinted with what he calls envy and selfish ambition. Someone who's wearing these glasses sees something that they want, and they'll do anything in order to get it, even if it means hurting someone else. They see it, they need it, and they fight to get it. The wisdom that comes from the earth and the wisdom that we use when we put on the earth glasses says that you deserve that thing. You've worked hard to get it. It's not fair that someone else has it, and you don't. Every single commercial you've ever seen in your whole life has told you this message. You deserve a break today. That thing that works perfectly well but is now the old model needs to be discarded and you really need the new model. You deserve it. You need it. You should get it. it's earth wisdom got an email from one of my friends this week who just got a Garmin 405 4Runner which is a GPS watch that runners wear it tracks their pace it tracks even the elevation of their runs it tracks their heart rate, their route the calories they burn it ties their shoes it washes their running shorts I mean it is the coolest gadget for running that I have ever seen so in this email my friend emailed me how it tracks certain things and as I saw it my first thought was I have to have that it's my precious and I wants it so I looked it up online saw how much it cost and then I started scheming because I'm not the only person who makes financial decisions in our household. So I said, how can I convince Mary that I really need this thing? I mean, you know, it costs this much, but if you break it down run by run, it's pretty cheap, because I'll use it for a long time. I'll never need another GPS watch again. And now we're starting to sound like five-year-old kids at Christmas time, right? So the question is, how far would I go if Mary said, honey, we can't afford that thing? I might say, sweetie, we have the money. We just might need to not eat for a week. And it is Lent, right? So, I mean, we could kill two birds with one stone. There is a way that appears to be right. but in the end it leads to death and if I never take off the earth glasses if I only see what I want and fight to get what I want I will calculate and scheme until I can manipulate my way into getting it I'll become a master not of life but of making other people even really believe that it's in their best interest that I get what I want when you're wearing earth glasses all you see is what you want, what's in it for you, and what is in the way of you getting it. A little example of earth glasses wisdom happened a couple weeks ago at our house. We had a friend over, and we were cooking dinner, and we pulled out this pan that we were going to cook something on, and we pulled out a piece of tinfoil, ripped it off, and put it on the pan so that we wouldn't have to do the, you know, the hard work of scrubbing the pan afterwards, right? And our friend is environmentally conscious, So all of a sudden we kind of blurted out this statement. Oh, I mean, I know I shouldn't use this piece of tinfoil. I know it's bad for the environment. And then she finished our sentence. She said, but it's good for you. And we were like, get out now. Well, this is the essence of Earth Glass's wisdom. I know it's bad for someone else, but it's good for me, so I'm doing it. I'm doing it because I deserve it, and I don't care who gets in the way. I need it. Well, this is what I believe Paul is writing about in verse 4 of Colossians 2, this little phrase that sort of escaped us for three or four weeks in a row here, but I want to read it to you again. Paul writes in Colossians 2, 4, I tell you this, that you may know Christ in order to find wisdom and knowledge. I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments. And the primary fine-sounding argument I think that we've been deceived by, with, again, every commercial we've ever seen is this, that we don't have what we need. That what we do have is not enough, and that life will be better if we wear the earth glasses and give in to envy and selfish ambition. I know it's bad for you, but it's good for me. So I'm gonna put on the earth glasses. This is the essence of sin. Because it's placing us at the place where what we need should be considered the most important. The people who become masters of life are people who begin to see that that way, the way of my precious, is actually the way that leads not to life, but to death. People who are becoming wise masters of life have the courage to recognize when they've been wearing earth glasses and they have the strength to take them off. This leads to an important distinction though. In the message team this week, Terry Steinmeier helped me out with this one. He said, yeah, but isn't it true that wise masters of life are not people who always make the right choices? In fact, it's often making bad choices that helps you become wise, isn't it? It is. Many times, what makes a person finally take off the earth glasses is when they've seen the destruction and death that it's caused in themselves or the ones that they love. I'll never forget a story that Brendan Manning tells about in his book, The Ragamuffin Gospel. He tells him an alcoholic named Max that is in the same treatment center that Brendan Manning is in. And in the group times, Max kind of refuses to admit the kind of problems that he has around alcohol. Max is a successful business owner upon whom the earth glasses are firmly placed. And finally, when one of the therapists gets a little sick of Max's confident and smooth-sounding justifications, he pushes Max by asking this question, Have you ever mistreated one of your children, Max? To which Max replies, of course not. I have a great rapport with each of my kids. And then the therapist pushes a little more, and Max finally relents and says, well, I will admit that I had, I slightly mistreated my daughter last Christmas Eve, but I don't really remember the details. So the therapist asks for a phone, and he calls Max's wife. And on speakerphone in front of the whole group, his wife tells the story, of last Christmas Eve. Apparently, Max had taken his nine-year-old daughter out shopping for a pair of shoes, and they found the perfect pair of shoes. He bought it for her, and on the way home, she, gleaming in her eye, kissed her daddy's cheek and said, Daddy, you're the best daddy in the world. And feeling like he wanted to celebrate, he stopped on his way home to the bar near their house, and it was a cold Christmas Eve day, and so he left the car running, rolled the windows up tight, left the heat on, full blast, and locked the doors and told his daughter that he'd be right out. It was 3 o'clock in the afternoon when he went into the bar. When he came back out, it was midnight. The car had stopped running and the car windows were frozen shut. His daughter was badly frostbitten on both ears and on her fingers. When they got to the hospital, the doctors had to amputate her thumb and forefinger on her right hand, and they learned that her daughter would be deaf for the rest of her life. There's a way that seems right, but in the end it leads to death. And when Max was finished hearing this story, he lay crumpled up on a ball on the floor, weeping uncontrollably. Now the question is, what do you do if you are Max and you suddenly realize that your decisions have caused unbearable pain for others? What do you do? Well, a little later on in Colossians, we're going to read these amazing words. Donna, verses 13 and 14 of Colossians 2. If you're Max, you got to hear these words. When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature. When you were on the floor weeping uncontrollably, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all of our sins, having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us. He has taken it away, nailing it to a cross. See, when we're lying crumpled on the floor, Earth glasses shattered around us along with our own lives and the lives of our loved ones perhaps. When our only hope is Jesus, Jesus comes through. And because it is true that in Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, we can rise up from the floor, take off the earth glasses, and start seeing differently because there was a way that appeared to be right. And in the end, it did lead to death. But because of Jesus, death was not the end of the story. With Jesus, death can lead to life. And that is the gospel. So let's turn our attention to the heavenly glasses. According to James, heavenly glasses are tinted with not envy and selfish ambition, but humility and purity, consideration of others, peace, and even impartiality, which is the opposite of the life of a critic who stands in condemnation of others. Wearing these kinds of glasses results in mercy and good fruit, James 3 says. And you know, it's interesting. If you notice who generally has the courage to put heavenly glasses on, a person that has humility and purity, consideration of others. It's generally people who have found themselves crumpled on the floor with no hope but Jesus. When you've received mercy, you come up hungry, ready to give mercy. The word humility in James 3.13 is the Greek word prautes, which means to be gentle, but not in a weak way. It's translated much like a strong horse that's been teamed so that his great strength is now not wild and out of control, but it's under control. And it can be used for the good. It's the same word that Jesus uses in the Beatitudes in Matthew 5 when he says that the meek are blessed. Matthew 11, 29, Jesus uses this word protest to describe himself. when he calls people to take his yoke upon them because he is gentle, prautus, and humble, or gentle and humble, prautus, in heart. Prautus is the gift of the Spirit in Galatians 5.23, a gift of the Spirit, which enables someone to correct someone else without arrogance. It's the Spirit, it's the sweet Spirit that Dave was talking about a few weeks ago when it comes time to admonish and teach other people in a way that you really can say, confidence is not me in you, it's Christ in you. Someone that has proudness, someone that is humble and gentle can do that to you and with you. Someone who has proudness is someone who knows Jesus, who's been affected by the way of Jesus, and who has chosen to submit to Jesus because they have seen that that way actually leads to life in their real life. So with the time that remains, I want to quickly go through three helpful questions that wise masters of life, characterized by gentleness and humility, will ask themselves when they're faced with really hard decisions. Question number one. Do I sense that God is leading me in a certain direction? Or do I sense that there's maybe more than one good option here? And what God wants me to do is just to keep moving. Do I sense that there's a direction from God? Or do I sense that maybe there is more than one good option? I have to say that sometimes I find people absolutely frozen with their inability to choose anything. And they've asked God for wisdom. They've asked God for a direction. They've asked people for help in deciding. And no clear direction is given. And so instead of moving somewhere, they just stay unable to choose what to do. And I do think there are times when God really does lead. But I think there are other times when I believe that God simply wants us to make the best decision we can, and then trust that God will meet us in our choosing. Paul found himself in this situation in Acts 16. Just three verses, but it says, Paul and his companions, starting in verse 6, Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia. and when they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus wouldn't allow them to, so they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas. And notice that Paul and his friends were actively moving. They weren't frozen, sitting in their boat, wondering what to do. They walked through Phrygia and Galatia and they wanted to go into Asia. They were at the door, but the Holy Spirit said, no, I don't want you to go there. And so they kept walking. They wanted to enter Bithynia, But Jesus himself, through his spirit, said no. And so what did they do? They kept going. They went down to Troas. Finally, they got a vision to go to Macedonia, but they kept moving. They didn't stay frozen. And I think some of us, not choosing blindly, not doing the thing that appears to be right, but in the end leads to death, but some of us need to simply make the best decision we can with the information that we've been given and trust that God will meet you in your moving. And if you make a wrong turn, you're not gonna be in the penalty box forever. If God really does have grace, then God is the God that can make something good out of wrong turns, amen? Yes, I mean, we have to believe that or else we're gonna be frozen saying, I have to make the right choice every single time. That's where I think this prayer that I shared with you a few weeks ago, this prayer that I've been praying in the morning during the season of Lent is really helpful because the point is not to make every right choice or even to have wisdom. It's to know Jesus. So this is the prayer that I've been praying. I'm gonna invite you again to maybe use it as a way of remembering that your task is to partner with Jesus. It's Jesus, I don't have the answers to all the problems that I'll face today. And Jesus, I don't know all that you're doing and all the people that I'll interact with today. And Jesus, I don't even know all that you're doing in me today. So I'm inviting you to partner with me, Jesus, so that I can see what you see and know what you know. This is a great prayer as you're moving and trying to make the best decisions you can. Question number two that wise people ask when they're trying to make decisions, and all these questions will be on the message tool this week. But the question number two, who can help me see what I can't see? Who is it that's going to help me see what I'm blind to? Well, Proverbs 15.22 says this, Plans fail for a lack of counsel, but with many advisors, they succeed. The truth is, though I don't want to admit it, I'm blind to many of my motives. I just want the Garmin 405. And I can't even see why it's maybe not a good idea for me to get it. Things appear to be right to me that aren't really right. So I need a group of trusted friends that I can go to with decisions. A few years ago, one of my friends was going through a really difficult time in his job, and he wanted to quit it. And there was lots of good reasons why maybe he even should quit this job. And he told us all these reasons. But he invited us to listen to those reasons and ask questions. And then he asked us what we should do. So after long conversations and some prayer, We told him that what we thought was best for him was that he not quit. We felt like it was best for him and the people around him that he would stay. And he hated that advice. But because he's a wise master of life, he took it. And now, years later, now that he can see the result, he would tell you that it would have been disastrous for him to quit. That he is so glad that he invited other people in to help him see what he couldn't see. so if you're faced with a big decision right now and you're trying to make it in isolation you need to find a few trusted friends trusted friends and say listen i need to lay out as honest as i can why i should do this why i think i should do this or why i think i shouldn't do this or what i think i should do and then you need to tell me what you think i should do and then you really need to listen. Question number three, last question that wise people ask, or last, this is not certainly the last question that wise people ask, but this is the third question and last question of this talk. And that is this, will someone else have to lose based on what I decide? Will someone else have to lose based on what I decide. There's a thing called a zero-sum game that most sports have it, and tennis has it. If you score a point, someone else has to lose a point in the NCAA tourney. Some team wins, and some team loses. That's the only way it works. There's no win-win. There's a winner, and there's a loser. And unfortunately, many of us look at life this way, especially marriage this way. If there's an argument, there's going to be a winner and a loser. and if I'm the winner, my wife's the loser. And if my wife's the winner, then I'm the loser. But wise masters of life decide that there's a better way to look at life, that not all decisions have to be ended in a zero-sum game, that there are some decisions that can be made if you think hard enough and look for the third way of Jesus, that there can be a win-win. A few weeks ago, some of my friends were having dinner at our house, and they have kids, and obviously we have kids. And so at the end of the night, One of their kids came up to Isaac, one of Isaac's cars in his hand, and he asked to take one of Isaac's cars home with him for a couple weeks. Now, you've got to understand, Isaac is the wise master of all things cars, trains, or trucks. It's just the way it is. Isaac loves his cars, trains, and trucks. And so, you know, when I saw this question come at him, his parents even said to Isaac's friend, oh, you shouldn't even ask that, you know. And I said, no, no, no, that's okay. Let me just talk to Isaac. So I pulled Isaac aside and said, Isaac, do you think it'd be okay if this guy took your car home for a couple weeks? He'll bring it back. To which Isaac promptly said, no. It would not be okay. But because it's really important to us that in ways that are doable and practical, Isaac learned that what he wants and thinks he deserves and thinks he should get is not always what he will get and we want to help him in little practical ways, understand that earth glasses are not the best glasses to wear. I just kept talking to him, said, well, buddy, how about we try it? How about we try it? And with sort of skeptical eyes that said, you better be writing this, buddy. He said, okay, let's try this. So he handed his car over to his friend and they left. And I saw in Isaac a kind of excitement that it was pretty cool to give away something that was his because he saw the gleam in his friend's eye as he took the car home. And so it was a win-win. It didn't have to be a win-lose. It was really cool for me to see as a parent. And all the two-year-olds in the room are saying, you idiot, shut up now. My parents are going to hear you. If any of you lack wisdom, James writes, you should ask God who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it'll be given to you. See, the problem is not that God does not give wisdom. God gives generously. The problem is that we don't see God's wisdom as found in the person of Jesus as wisdom. The problem is, we do not see the wisdom of God found in the person of Jesus as wisdom. We want to do it our way. So people of open door, let's become people who stop. Amen? Let's pray together. Jesus help us become people who have the courage to take off the earth glasses that says that what we want and when we want it and how we want it and what we say has to go help us have the kind of wisdom that says there's a different way of living life that results in life and not death and there are some of us in here who have been pierced with a kind of realization that we've been living that way our whole lives. So in this small moment, God, I ask that you through your spirit would be working and moving in and among us, inviting us to say yes to you and your wisdom, that we may know you, Jesus, in whom are found all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, that we would say yes to your ways and yes to you. And God, surround us with the kind of people that help us live in your way, taking off the earth glasses and putting on the ones that lead to life. Amen. Amen.
