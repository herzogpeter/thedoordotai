As we continue today what we've been calling a journey of the heart we are visiting today, a time and a place in David's life that was hard on his heart. It was a time of betrayal, confusion, discouragement, and loss that in the end, however, did not destroy him, but rather did what sometimes these seasons of discouragement and loss can do. it formed in him and called out of him a steadfast heart. I want to talk this morning about a steadfast heart and how it can be formed in the midst of a very shaky world. Open your Bibles with me if you have them to 1 Samuel 19. As you do that, I would remind you of where we are in the story. From the very humble beginnings of an obscure shepherd boy from Bethlehem, David was now a rising star. Samuel the prophet had anointed him as king. Saul the king had employed him as both a warrior in his army and a musician in his court. Goliath the giant had fallen to him. Seemingly all the people loved him till songs were being sung of him in the streets. that Saul had killed his thousands and David, however, had killed his tens of thousands. He was on his way to the throne room as a king in what looked like a straight shot. But a funny thing happened on the way to the palace. Saul's jealousy happened. Saul's jealousy that we spent a couple of weeks examining out of 1 Samuel chapter 18. And with his jealousy, Everything that David had been enjoying and was beginning to build began to be stripped away piece by piece. First, he lost his job. Having great success for a while as a warrior in Saul's army, also functioning, as I said a moment ago, as the court musician, one day while playing his harp, Saul, in rage, grabbed the spear next to him and threw it at David, desiring to pin him to the wall. David did a very wise thing he ran for his life and in his running he lost his position as a warrior he lost his place in the court as a musician effectively lost his job right after that he lost his wife his legal connection to the royal family was severed David you may recall was loved by Michael the daughter of Saul David married Michael when he fled from the court, that is David fled from the court. He went home, obviously, and Saul went after him with assassins desiring to kill David. Michael, David's wife, helped David escape. When he escaped, Saul then took Michael, his daughter, back to himself and married her off to another. David lost his wife. So he fled to Ramah. We pick up the story in chapter 19, verse 18 with these words, Now David fled and escaped and came to Samuel at Ramah, and he told Samuel all that Saul had done to him. Samuel, who had been a kind of spiritual father to David, a mentor, if you will. It was Samuel who had anointed David as king. It was Samuel who had assured him in his youth of God's presence in his life, who had assured him in his youth of things you need to be assured of in your youth, the calling of God on his life. But Saul chased him there too. And once again, David had to run away, now from the presence of Samuel. Not long after that, Samuel would die. So David lost his spiritual father, his mentor, his guide from Samuel. David went to Jonathan, his best friend, his covenant friend. Again, we spent a couple weeks talking about covenant friendships, this incredible relationship between Jonathan and David. Jonathan, who loved David more than himself, who risked his life to protect David, but Jonathan couldn't leave his father's court and couldn't raise his sword against his father. So in 1 Samuel 20, verse 42, David and Jonathan said goodbye to each other with these words, The Lord will be between me and thee, and between our descendants forever. Then they rose and departed, never to see each other again. So David lost his best friend. Put it together. He's lost his job, his position, his power, his popularity. He lost his wife, his home, his spiritual mentor, and now his best friend. Chapter 21, verse 10 says, Then David arose and fled that day from Saul and went to Achish, the king of Gath, where he will lose something else again. At least he will lose it for a little while. In Gath, in the presence of Achish, the king of Gath, he will lose his dignity, his self-respect. Anybody remember who came from Gath? Goliath came from Gath. So here is David. This is a weird scene. David is now going to the camp of his enemy to try and find some safe haven. Before you judge him too harshly, just remember he had nowhere else to go. look at verse 11 of chapter 21 says this but the servants of Achish said to him is this not David the king of the land did they not sing of this one as they danced saying Saul has killed his thousands but David is tens of thousands and David heard these words and took them to heart and greatly feared Achish the king of Gath so he disguised his sanity before them and this is where he lost his dignity and acted insanely in their hands and scribbled on the doors of the gate and let his saliva dribble down into his beard. Then Achish said to his servants, Behold, you see this man behaving as a madman. Why do you bring him to me? Do I lack madmen? I've got plenty of these guys already. Did you have brought this one to act the madman in my presence? Shall this one come into my house as well? I'd say that this episode in David's life is a low point for him. A far cry from what we saw in him some weeks ago as this faith-filled, confident young man who faced down Goliath who was from Gath. But not just Goliath. The whole Philistine army was there and he faced them with five stones and a slingshot. But David's in a different place now. Do you know that feeling? Do you know that feeling of being full of faith and confidence some other time? But not now. Chapter 22, verse 1, So David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam, but he didn't go there alone. For his brothers and all his father's household heard of it, and they all went down there after him. And the first blush sounds like a sweet scene. Isn't that nice? They all went after him to be with him, but it's really not that sweet. The reason his family is going there is because Saul is after David. He's after David's household. His family isn't safe. They're going there to be with David because they're running for their lives as well. I'm not positive of this, but I'm reasonably confident, knowing what we know of David's family, that they probably blame David for all of this. Then look at this, verse 2. And everyone who was in distress, everyone who was in debt and discontent, gathered to him. Oh good. And he became captain over them, about 400. Now these 400 would become known one day as David's mighty men of valor, but they didn't start that way. So get the picture again. Let's put it together again. David was expecting a throne, a throne he did not seek. It came to him. He was told he would be king. He was anointed by the prophet. He was assured of God's presence, and at first, it looked like he was on the fast track to all of that. He had success in his early years. He had fame and friends and family and status, but now it's gone. All of it is gone. What he had expected was a throne. What he got was a cave. I'm going to talk just for a moment about the cave. Because the cave is a place where all your expectations begin to go awry. The cave is a place where all the supports and scaffoldings of your life, and by the way, there's nothing wrong with the supports and scaffoldings of your life. They aren't sinful, but the cave is the place where all of those things begin to be crumbled beneath your feet. You see, you were going to do great things, noble things, things that you believed would give God glory. You were going to have a good marriage, and you were going to have a great family, and you were going to be a good dad and a good mom, not like your dad or your mom, and you were always going to be able to talk to your kids. You just knew it. In a successful career, one that would glorify God, and in your mind, all of these things, they were the promise of God. you really believe that but it's not turning out that way see I don't need a word from God to know this this morning that some of you in this room right now are in a cave now some of you aren't and that's okay because you will be or you have been because here's the deal beloved sooner or later all of us spend some time in the cave. And the cave is the place where you do not want to be, where you begin to wonder things that you do not want to wonder. You begin to wonder things that you don't have to wonder when you're not in the cave, and the scaffolding is all there, and the props are all secure. You begin to wonder things like this. Did God lose track of me? Does he know where I am? Will I ever be any place else but here ever again? Did God forget his promises? What exactly were his promises? I thought I knew. It was all so clear, but in the cave it starts to get fuzzy. Give a little word on caves. Personal word on caves. I hate caves. I think it's okay to hate caves. In fact, I think we should just all hate them together. Ready? Ready? Go. There you go. I hate caves. They're dark and cold and smelly and harsh, but here's the deal about caves, and I even hate this deal about caves. God does some of his best work in caves. I hate that about caves, but it's still true. Here's the deal. Some of the best work he does at molding and shaping the human heart, mine and yours, happens in caves, because sometimes, beloved, it's not until all the props and securities and scaffoldings of my life and yours get stripped away that we find out that God's enough because now God's all you got and until you're in a cave that's a cliche well David would spend about 10 years in this wilderness place hiding in caves and and that's by the way what it was it wasn't like he was in one cave he would move from cave to cave to hide but it was a wilderness place he was in in 10 years the 10 years kind of bugged me you know I'd be okay God 10 days in the wilderness that would be so hard 10 years anyway but over time this band of misfits began to grow and they got married and they had children and began to form community eventually finding a place that they could stop and settle and it wasn't a cave it wasn't anything fancy it was just a settlement a place called Ziklag where David and his fledgling community of people would actually hit a new low. Turn to chapter 30, 1 Samuel 30, verse 1 says this. Then it happened when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day. Now they'd been off doing war with the Philistines. They had been living here for a while and they were just coming back. That the Amalekites had made a raid on the Negev and on Ziklag and had overthrown Ziklag and burned it with fire. And they took captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great, without killing anyone, they carried them off and went their way. And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters had all been taken captive. Then David and the people who were with him lifted their voices and wept until there was no strength in them to weep. You ever weep like that? I think we have a family in our church a husband who lost his wife and two little children who lost their mom may be weeping this week until they have no strength to weep then down in verse 6 I think looking for someone to blame it's kind of one of the natural instincts that we have somewhere along the line in dealing with these kinds of things hopefully we get over that but looking for someone to blame verse 6 it says the people began to speak of stoning David, blaming him, and David was greatly distressed, it says in verse 6. Well, I guess so. So what do you do at a time like that, in a season of life like that? Well, let's look at what David did. The most amazing thing, actually, to some of us, a foreign thing. At the end of verse 6, it's actually one of the most telling statements in all the record of David in Scripture, revealing to us his heart and the secret of his steadfast heart. It says this, that David strengthened himself in the Lord his God. The King James Version says it this way, then David encouraged himself in God. Which raises for me this question, what does that mean? And how do you do that? How do you encourage your heart in God? Because that's one of those little phrases, he strengthened himself in God, that sounds religious. It sounds borderline irrelevant religious. It's the kind of thing people say in church, everybody nods and says amen, but nobody really knows what it means. It's like the pastor says, he turned to God. And my advice to you if you're going through a difficult time is this. Turn to God. Let's pray. You know, and something in me and something in you is going, what do you mean? I know we're supposed to turn to God. What does that mean and what does that look like in real life? not just in church. Well, to answer that, I would just look at David's life, his real life, and what it looked like for David when David encouraged his heart in God. First of all, it looked like lament. It looked like lament. I like that, because we might have impressions of turning to God, being like that pious preacher guy, and you fold your hands. David's turning to God, at least in part, looked like yelling and screaming. It looked like lament. Doesn't sound very spiritual, does it? Not to me, but it sounds like life to me. Actually, we read about this lament thing in places like Psalm 142. If you turn to it, you will notice at the very top of that psalm, it says Psalm 142, and then between that and the text is this notation. It says this, a mascal of David. A mascal is just a poem. a poem of David, when he was in the cave. So we know for certain that this is a psalm of David, and it's a psalm of David that he wrote during the season of his life in caves. It says this in verse 1, I will cry aloud with my voice to the Lord. I will pour out my complaint. I will declare my trouble before him. Verse 4, look to the right and see, for there is no one who regards me. There is no escape from me. No one cares for my soul. interesting people who study the psalms break it into categories there are psalms of praise there are psalms of thanksgiving psalms of enthronement where God is declared to be the king there are psalms of instruction like psalm 1 but the number one category the largest category of the psalms are these the psalms of lament where people who know God come to God as if they believe in God like that he actually does exist and tell him how they really feel and sometimes they're upset. I mean, you find this not just in the Psalms but all through Scripture, various places where you hear God's people say things like this. How long, O Lord? Will you hide your face, silence your voice, withhold your hand? I don't get what you're doing. How long, O Lord, before you show mercy, do justice, do anything? It's interesting, a lot of us would never ever talk that way, but I believe it's how people who know how to pray, pray. One of the things we say around here relative to prayer, whenever we're teaching on prayer, is this one of the first things you need to understand about authentic prayer is this. Because if you don't get past this, if you don't kind of enter this way, you'll never experience any meaningful prayer. It's this, you need to come to God the way you are, not the way you ought to be, and not the way you wish you were. Here's the deal. Some of the biggest breakthroughs in your spiritual life and some of the most intimate experiences in your life with God will come when you quit acting religious and being polite and come to God with how you really feel. And most of the time, it's a cave that presses you into that real place. Because it's in the cave that your formulaic faith that you didn't even know you had. You know, nobody walks around going, you know what? I would like to have shallow faith. I would like to have rabbit's foot faith. You know, I call it rabbit's foot. I talk about, you know, where really my prayer is, is I'm rubbing a rabbit's foot. I would never do that. That's evil. That's all the deal. But basically my whole approach to God is that I pray a prayer, I'll pray it a certain way, I'll go to church so many times, and figuring God's going to, you know, make everything okay for me. Nobody thinks they're living that way until something goes wrong. And I get all confused. You should be confused. God's calling you deeper. And you start looking for more than this formulaic faith you had. That's really good news. It's very painful. It's very scary. That's really good news. God's calling you deeper. And you might even come to God a little bit angry, saying things like this, I thought we had a deal. And you're not even aware that you were functioning that way with God until the scaffoldings begin to fall, and you come up pretty ticked off. Maybe with God, I thought we had a deal. I thought if I kind of did this and did that and prayed that way and, you know, gave just much whatever, that you would take care of all that stuff, and I'd be happy and wealthy and healthy, and God said, it wasn't the deal. You signed on for the wrong deal. And he's calling you deeper. Remember Job? He had a cave experience of sorts. I'd say his experience counted. As a cave, he lost his family. All his children died. He lost his wealth. He lost his position in the community. And his first response was a good response. I'm not mocking this response, but it was very polite. And I think it was sincere, but he gave the answer he was used to giving in this place in his life, in his kind of life journey, his faith journey. He gave the right answer. He says in chapter 1, verse 21, pretty early in the story, and by the way, just before I even read it, I just want you to know that most of the things we quote about Job, and we do quote, you know, so he lost all these things, he said these great things. Most of what we quote about Job is in the first two chapters of Job and in the last chapter of Job. We kind of avoid the other 40 chapters where he has a fight with God. Chapter 1, verse 21, Job says this. Here's the deal. Naked I came into this world and naked I will go. The Lord gives and the Lord takes away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And in all of these things, Job did not sin with his lips. And then things got worse. Now, I do not know if Job was working his formula. You know, all these terrible things are happening. I better, I better really make sure I'm not sinning at all. I better give this right answer. I'm not sure he was doing that. But I'm telling you what, it's interesting to me. When things got worse, we heard a little bit more from the real Job. Because he got ticked. He went into a ziklag, if you will, of his own. His body was covered with boils. His friends began to come to him with stupid advice because they were formula people too. The formula of their life with God was this. If you do this, this, and this, this will happen. If you pray this way, if you go to church this often, then you'll have all sorts of health and wealth and no problems at all. And so now you have problems, You must not have faith. You must have some sin. You need to repent. Baloney. He didn't need to repent. And I'm telling you, this stuff pushed Job into a very dark place. Where he began to do something he had never done. Get face to face with God. And he began to contend with God. Press past polite. Now, I'm not calling for disrespect here. I think you know that. But there is a distance that is the reality behind politeness. And Job is pressing way past that into what ultimately will be some intimacy with God he'd never known before. When he says things like this in chapter 10, verse 1, I loathe my life. I will give full vent to my complaint and you're not going to shut me up. I will speak in the bitterness of my soul, and I will say to God, and then he says some things to God, not religious. And God says some things back to Job, not condemning, but not particularly nice either. I mean, one of the things, if you read that whole dialogue, and it's a very interesting study, Job, God doesn't try to shut Job up. God doesn't try to correct him or tell him he needs to repent. But Job, God gets kind of big with him. Where were you, Job, when I said to the ocean, stop right there? And he was God with Job. They had a fight. But in the end, chapter 42, verse 5, Job reports this. You know, God, before I went into this cave that I hated, I hated that cave. I heard of thee with the hearing of my ear. I went to church every Sunday, as it were, and I heard the sermons and I sang the songs and I agreed with it all, and I was sincere. I really was. But something happened to me in the cave where I pressed into your presence with how I really felt, and this miracle is this, that now I see you with my eye. That's intimate language. So what does it look like in real life to strengthen yourself in God. As I said, David, strengthen himself in God when this ziklag thing happened. It looks, first of all, like lament. But please get this. It doesn't stop there with lament. Though for some people, it does stop there, sadly. We spoke of these kind of people a couple weeks ago when we talked about an ungrateful heart. There are people who treat lamenting as if it were their spiritual gift. Chronic complainers who will die in graves of craving, we said two weeks ago. So now please notice this. David did lament, and I'm not sure it was after his lament or right in the middle of his lament. The second thing you need to understand about what it looks like when you encourage your heart in God is this. David did something. David took some action. Where do you see that? Chapter 34 Samuel verse 7 says this. Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, please bring me the ephod. Now the ephod was like a scepter that was a symbol of the presence of God. And he wanted that symbol of God's presence with him so he could pray. He wanted to pray. So Abiathar brought the ephod to David, and David inquired of the Lord, saying, what am I supposed to do? Should I stay here and wait for you to deliver these people? Should I pursue this band? Shall I overtake them? And God said to David, these words, pursue. For you shall surely overtake them, and you shall surely rescue all. Now let me put that in plain, everyday language that you and I can understand. Here's what God said to David. David, get up off your lament and go. Do something. Don't just sit and pray about this, though David prayed about this, and he prayed about it first. But, God is saying here, don't just sit and pray about this. Do something about this. Bring them back. Take some action here. Then verse 9, incredibly important words. At the beginning of verse 9, just three words says this, so David went. See, I think a lot of us have the perception that having our hearts encouraged in God and developing a steadfast heart is a passive thing. Where you go to church and you fold your hands. Something bad's happened, a ziklag's happened, and so you go to church, you fold your hands, and you're going to strengthen your heart in God. You act religious, you pray the prayer just right, and if you pray the prayer just right, poof, God makes the problem go away. And the enemy is defeated and the children are returning. We all live happily ever after. No, that's a fairy tale. see every once in a while God says this and I'm absolutely convinced he's saying it to some of you this morning he's saying it gently but he's saying it firmly here's the word of the Lord for some of you get up off your lament and do something so your marriage is a mess and your job is unsatisfying it's not a fit for you your boss is a creep well what do i do well number one lament well and part of what i mean by that is quit pretending about your marriage quit denying that it's a mess it's not going to go anywhere until you begin to lament say out loud what the problem is name it don't stay there step number two ask yourself a very important question what am I going to do? What am I going to do about my marriage? About my job? About my boss? Well, if I can't do anything, I can't do anything. Okay, then stay in your lament. But don't expect to have a steadfast heart built in you. Because here's the deal. God's not going to wave a magic wand and make it go away. he's not going to do that verse 8 says pursue overtake you rescue them God said to David what do you mean me I thought God would do well here's the deal incredible partnership here again it says right there in the text you rescue them would God be with David absolutely was God going to empower David who would God who would David give the credit to after the children and the wives were rescued Thank you, God. Did David wield a sword? Did David get sweaty? You think he got tired? You think he got blood on him? This is real life we're talking about. And God was with him when he went. Here's the word of the Lord for some of you. Get up off your lament and do something. Whoa. Yeah, that was worth that. I think that was... You know, in a few weeks, middle of February, we're doing a pulpit switch where Ephraim Smith is coming here. And I'm going there. And Keith and I went to Sanctuary Church. That's what I'm talking about. Sanctuary Church last week. And they talked back to him. I mean, you know, I talked back. And it's going to be very interesting when I go there. I hope I get through my talk. Yeah, start talking back. So you've got to start getting used to Ephraim being here because he's going to think you hate him if you don't talk back to him. There you go! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, just go back to being this white crowd again. No, don't do that. Just get weird. I saw Ephraim last week get up on the stage. The offertory was still going. He was dancing on the stage, and I'm just going, oh, I can't do that. I can't do that. Anyway, back to the sermon. I'm going to rue the day. I have therapist friends talk to me about stuff. It really helps me. It gives me insight to myself and the people. I was talking to one of my friends recently. He said, you know, Dave, sometimes I have to fire my clients. I said, what do you mean fire your clients? I thought they fired you. What do you mean? He says, well, here. See, after a while, I'll be with someone for a month or so, and I will realize that I'm the one doing all the work. I give advice. They don't take it. I tell them to try this. They don't do it. Because the real reason they came to counseling was what they wanted to do was lament. That's all they want. It's good to lament. That's step one. But you haven't done anything yet. I fire them. here's the deal with that approach of just lament and never doing anything you will never develop a steadfast heart and it's not what it means to strengthen your heart in the lord get up off your lament and do something third thing he did in the cave and it's part of what strengthened his heart in the lord was he resisted the temptation of taking spiritually damaging shortcuts. He resisted the temptation of taking spiritually damaging shortcuts, shortcuts that would solve the problem, provide some temporary relief, maybe even get him out of the cave, but they would damage his soul. Now to see this one, we got to go back to chapter 24. Chapter 24, an account that many of you are familiar with, it says this, now it came about when Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, saying, behold, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi. Then Saul took 3,000 chosen men against 400 from all of Israel and went to seek David and his men in front of the rocks of the wild goats. And he came to the sheepfolds on the way where he was in a cave. And Saul went in to relieve himself. He wasn't taking a nap. He was relieving himself. Takes off his coat. And I'm not going to act it out. Now David and his men were sitting in the inner researches of the cave where Saul was doing his business. And it's not in the text, but it's in, well, it's not in some of the text in mine, and they were laughing their heads off, watching this. I mean, imagine trying not to laugh. It's like being in church sometimes when you're, anyway. And the men of David said to him, behold, this is the day of which the Lord had said to you, Behold, I am about to give your enemy into your hand. This is God's doing, and you shall do to him as it seems good to you. See, David's men recognized, with Saul coming in there, easily accessible, easy to kill, that this was the way out of this problem. And they even put God language on it, which is something we often do when we're trying to do what we want to do. This is the Lord's provision, David. God promised to deliver you. This is it. God doesn't want you living in a cave. You're the Lord's anointed. You're the king's kid. And Saul deserves to die, by the way. All those things are true. He was the Lord's anointed. Saul did deserve to die. One problem. It was the wrong thing to do, and David knew it. It was a shortcut. It was a shortcut that would solve the problem, provide relief. It was a shortcut that would have gotten him out of the cave. and it would have damaged his soul. Partly because it would have made him just like Saul. Verse 7, so David persuaded his men with these words and did not allow them to rise up against Saul. And Saul arose and left the cave and went on his way, but as he did, he felt a draft. And you know why, if you read the rest of the verse that I didn't read, it was on the screen. Because while he was sitting there doing his business, David cut out a piece of the robe that he had set aside and put back on, and he walks out, and he feels a draft. And in the service Saturday night, I told everybody that he was standing there with his butt hanging out, but I decided not to say that here because my wife is here, and she would get upset with me if I said that. Preach it. In fact, between services, his body came up to me. My Bible says that David cut a piece out of the corner of his robe, and I just said, not my Bible. My Bible doesn't say that. My Bible says his butt's hanging out right there. It's right here. Hmm. Now, if I can, I need to reel this in. because some of you are in a cave right now and you are face to face with a shortcut a shortcut that looks like it could solve your problem provide some relief get you out of the cave but it's the wrong thing to do and you know it because it'll damage your soul in fact I am pretty confident that some of you may be here today to hear this very warning. Don't do it. You may not realize it. We often don't at moments like this, but your whole future may be hinging on whether you press into God right now and obey Him or take the shortcut out of the cave. That would be very easy to do. I don't know what it might be for you. It may be that you feel really alone right now. that's a pretty dark cave you've been single maybe for a very long time and you don't want to be or you've been married maybe for a very long time and something has grown very stale and there is something or someone right there so available, so tempting and I just know God doesn't want me living in this cave maybe it's a financial cave and if you just fudge this or lie about that, you could get out of the cave. Here's the question. Will I have the courage? Will I have the steadfastness of heart to do what David did and not take the shortcut? A little teaching on that. It requires a measure of steadfastness in the heart to say when there's a shortcut available, I'm going to say no to that. But there's a cyclical thing here. It's how the kingdom of God works. When you have enough steadfastness to say no, in the saying no, the steadfastness of heart actually grows. In fact, so therefore, saying no to shortcuts at critical times in your life is one of the ways you develop a steadfast heart. Where from time to time we're pressed by circumstances to say, in effect, I will stay in this cave the rest of my life if I have to before I disobey and defy God. The fact is, David didn't know if he was ever going to get out of this cave. He was in there for 10 years. Well, you know, he was anointed as king. And I know he was anointed as king. And maybe if you remember that, he would go, I'm going to be king someday. I'm going to be king someday. It's been 10 years. If I was him, I don't know this. But I wonder if he, every once in a while, just thought, well, I guess this is, you know, I know I was anointed. Maybe this is my kingdom. Maybe this is it. So what did he do? Well, the text says he strengthened himself in the Lord his God. What does that mean? It sounds so religious. Go to God. No, it means in real life he lamented that cave. He named his pain. He poured it out his heart to God about it. Number two, he did what he could do about it. Number three, he refused to take shortcuts around it. And right in the middle of all that real life stuff, he discovered an amazing thing, that God really was his refuge and strength. A very present time, a very present help in time of trouble. Not because God changed the circumstance, though eventually he did, but it wasn't why he discovered God to be a refuge, but because God was present for David right in the middle of the circumstance and if you are experiencing the presence of God you are utterly safe even if you're in a cave and that's what I think it means and that's what I think it looks like when it says that David strengthened himself in the Lord it looked like lament it looked like action it looked like refusal to take the shortcuts. Let me close with this. A word to those who this morning may be in a cave and may be in a very dark one. The word is this. God understands all about caves because he's been there. Remember Jesus? the son of David he was called like David Jesus started humbly David started as a shepherd boy nobody noticed he existed Jesus started in a manger so we celebrate right now at Advent David made an ascent to popularity the song they were singing of him in the streets was David has killed his tens of thousands. Jesus made an assent as well. The multitudes came to hear him preach and see his wonders. And one day they began singing songs of Jesus in the streets. Hosanna, Hosanna. Blessed is he. He, that is Jesus, who comes in the name of the Lord. But also like Jesus, also like David, Jesus lost his position. He lost his popularity and his safety and security. He lost the admiration of the crowd. His life was threatened by his enemies. He was abandoned by his friends. He was lied about and despised till they nailed him to a cross and he died. It looks like he never gets out of his cave. He died. But then the enemy of our soul made a really big mistake. You see, they took Jesus down from that cross and they put him in a what? A cave. And they thought that was the end of him, but they forgot something very important. They forgot something very, very important. See, they forgot that God does His best work in caves. Let's pray. Father, as we consider this particular stop on the journey of the heart, this place of darkness and disappointment and deep discouragement, dark caves, We just acknowledge that there are probably numbers of people here who are in one right now. And so we would just invite and release the spirit of lament where that is needed. To break through denial and pretending. To realize that there are times we don't have to be polite with you. That we can come to you the way we are. And it's part of God calling us deeper. It's part of you calling us deeper into places where we come to know you and see you. It goes way beyond the formulas and the rabbit's foot praying stuff. Father, we also would recognize that some may be stuck in their lament and they are really in this place, a scary, scary place where they need to do something they don't want to do. They need to confront something, say something they don't want to say. And I pray in your name that you would give those of us on the journey in this place the courage to get up off our lament and do something. Others, Father, we would just know are being faced with a shortcut. It's right there. It's easily accessible. But we know it's the wrong thing to do and it will damage our soul. We pray, Jesus, that this word today would be for some almost like a hook that grabs them just as they're about to take a step and just pulls them back. Allow, I want to speak to some of you, allow your heart to be pulled back right now by God. And as you do, your heart will be strengthened in God's. It also occurs to me that there may be some who've already taken the shortcut and right now you're just full of shame. And you need to know you can come home. You can come back. You can come back. You need to come back. So God can restore your heart. I pray these things be done, Father, as again we just consider this journey of the heart. Be the God of our journey. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
