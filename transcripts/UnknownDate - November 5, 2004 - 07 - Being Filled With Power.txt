show's about to begin. We're going to get Keith to mud wrestle here in the front or something nasty like that. All right. a year or so ago, I don't remember where we were. Oh boy, I'm going to have a, I'm really tired. I don't know how you guys listen because I get sick of the sound of my own voice. I'm serious. I go home after days like today and I tell my wife, Debbie, I say, I'm sick of the sound of my own, how'd it go? I'm sick of the sound of my own voice. All right, here we go. one last time this this won't last too long but uh numerous times when dallas and i have done this together and one time a while back i i just sort of off the top of my head said to a group i think we're in chicago um i was just you know sort of trying to explain the whole idea that the answer to misuse is not no use the answer is right use and i just sort of started reflecting on my 20 or 25-year journey in the vineyard and knowing many, many Pentecostals and Charismatics and the, you know, the Kansas City prophets and the Toronto blessing and all the both criticism and compliments that came through that. And just, you know, there's not much in the last 20 or 25 years that I haven't, you know, personally been involved with or known about. And so what I want to suggest to you under the spirit of us trying to create with each other communities of the Holy Spirit some values, okay? Just a handful or so of them that I want to commend to you as values for communities of the Holy Spirit that can keep you on the straight and narrow. Ready? Ready to go. One, I've already mentioned, it's be naturally supernatural. But let me tell you what that means. it means that we do nothing manipulative we do nothing for effect are you with me here so like in a few minutes um i'm gonna ask a few of you if you're willing to um to share what happened to you this afternoon when we prayed i mean i don't know maybe nothing happened and if nothing happened that's okay but we'll just see and I'm going to do that because I believe that it will help people as we move on in this but I would never dream to do something like that to manipulate you into something or to do it merely for effect but there is something about just witnessing to the the goodness and the the faithfulness of God and meeting us in those times when we do pray and ask him for stuff. But we never do anything, whether it's talking to each other about what the Lord is doing or praying for one another, we never do anything that's manipulative or for effect. We're just natural about it. Number two, and again, I've mentioned this, this comes from the Eddie Gibbs thing, don't make this journey all about meetings. Your actual life, as I view it, as I wrote it up here on the board yesterday, where you work, live, and play, your actual life has to be in view. Number three, you can learn and grow in this. In fact, you will. But you'll never get to the place where you can control outcomes. Do you hear what I'm saying? So you're gonna grow, but don't ever think you're gonna get to, you're gonna grow to the place where you're in charge. of this. You'll never grow to the place where you can control outcomes. You're just literally often not going to know what's going on, and you just have to learn to reconcile yourself to that and be okay with it. Like, honestly, this morning when we were done, I was only picturing in my mind's eye like a couple of dozen, maybe 20 or 30 people coming forward. I was literally shocked. Like, what do you, did I say I was giving away money or something? You know what I'm saying? When, you know, virtually everybody came forward, I wasn't expecting that. I didn't know, but I don't control outcomes. I think the Lord just gives me pictures so that I can see what's happening. And that's sort of just the way I pictured it. But I wouldn't have minded if it was six. It was just the way I saw it. But you just, you need to learn to get comfortable with, yeah, you can learn and grow, but you're not going to ever be able to control outcomes. And that's a really big deal. Now think of how that, now let me just give you another concrete example. What about when you're having prophetic exchanges and you're the prophetic person and you're demanding to be heard? That you are hell-bent. You are literally willing to do anything to make sure that that word you control the outcome of. can you see how that would just become dueling prophecies you know what I think would have been funny remember the movie that was just out not long ago called God or what was it you know with I think it was Jim Carrey Bruce Almighty what a scream but wouldn't have been even a wouldn't it have been even a bigger scream if they would have showed some really wacky charismatic churches or something where the prophets were having dueling prophecies and God was like oh no I'm supposed to go over here and do this. Oh, no, look, he's prophesying over there. Oh, no, you know, like when, you know, like when Jim Carrey was hearing all the prayers in his head, you know, imagine if God was having to deal with our dueling prophecies. You're cursed. No, you're cursed. You know, well, God says if you don't do this, you know, did you guys say butthead and, and, you know, Europe? Sorry, it's getting late. Well, little Todd just came out to play. Okay. I mean, can you just imagine if we were trying to control the outcomes with our words of wisdom or words of knowledge or prophecies or whatever? That's why I was saying tentativeness is so important. And tentativeness will not. Now, again, I'm open to the fact that there are times when really somebody does need to say, thus saith the Lord. I'm actually open to that. But I think it's like aces in a deck of cards, like maybe four in a lifetime. Are you with me here? that sort of predicting the future like that, it is to prophecy what growing a new leg is to healing. Are you with me here? Like it's fairly routine for us to pray for somebody who's sick and them to get well. Occasionally even amazing things like people getting well from cancer and stuff. But you know, how many times have you seen people grow back new limbs where they had an amputation or something? Oh, could it happen? Sure. Does it happen? Yeah, occasionally, but it's not routine. And see, if you try to control those kinds of outcomes, here's what's gonna happen. It's possible in the pursuit of religion to become a worse kind of person. And I have known many people who pursue the Holy Spirit and actually become a less kind, more judgmental, they actually become that bh thing i let slip out they really do become little butt heads and it destroys communities and it destroys marriages and friendships as they start trying through these supposed gifts of the spirit to control all the outcomes in their life you just can't do it number four life in the spirit cannot be controlled by you and here's why this is important. That kind of attitude overturns the whole attitude and process necessary to being servants of Jesus. See, we're happy as servants to just carry the water and, you know, put it where it goes. Because we're the servants of Jesus. That's what we do. But we're willing also to let it sit there and you know what happens to it is up to the lord number five faith and you can see how a lot of these things work together faith while an essential element of a life in the spirit never controls god it's it's absolutely essential i mean think about it nowhere in the new testament does jesus say daughter your healthy skepticism has healed you you know I mean it's just not there you know daughter your scientific rationalism has made you well it's just not there what's there is Jesus gets amazed when people place confidence in him and his kingdom so he says to the centurion wow faith like you have in how my power and authority in my kingdom work I have never seen anywhere in all of Israel. So I mean, he commends faith, but faith never becomes an instrument through which we control God. Okay, two more. And I'll give them to you if you promise not to tell Dallas I said that bad word. I'm just kidding. All right, are you ready? Two more. Do you notice how, well, here it is, dial down emotions. because dialing up emotions are actually counterproductive over the long haul. And I think right now we could have in the room people like me or any other people who have been around the charismatic movement for the last 25 or 30 years and any of us could tell you that when we look back in hindsight, emotional hype was actually not helpful. It wasn't always particularly damaging. I mean, sometimes emotions, just emotions. You know, if you're, you know, if you're at the, is it the Target Center here? What is it? If you know, and you watch Kevin McHale throw down a big old slam dunk, you know, you might have a hard time holding back. You might not just go, you know, you might, woohoo, you know, way to go, Kev. But if you're doing that when they're blowing up the balls before the game, you're a little weird. Are you with me here? Like, woohoo, look, honey, they're blowing up the balls. I mean, there isn't a place, a normal, natural place for emotions. But in the life of the Spirit, I think we think that we're adding something to the Spirit when we get emotional about it. It actually works the other way around. And actually may explain why Jesus often asked people to leave the room before he did what he was going to do. Because, again, I'm not saying, emotions are just a part of being human. I'm not in any way suggesting they're bad or unspiritual or something. It's that when we think that we add them to the life of the Spirit, like gives it a supercharger or something, it's actually not true. You're actually much better to try to dial down emotions and be normal about it. That's what I was trying to do up here today, was just saying, you know, we're not going to manipulate you with, you know, weepy music, you know. and we're not going to make you nobody has to do anything we're just going to be totally straightforward about this and and just whatever the lord does he'll do and i think that's very important and it never harms the lord he's not looking for us to get all emotional if something amazing happens and we get emotional that's fine i tell you a little story one time years ago i was in st louis doing a healing seminar and i don't remember why but i'd called this group of women down forward and a bunch of them were standing there and we were on a stage in an old school auditorium that was probably twice this high and so I'm looking down out at this group of people and I say to this woman I think the Lord wants to heal you and as I say that everybody moves away from her and I see that she's like hanging on not crutches but you know those you know I don't know what they're called but you know she's like dragging her feet like she can't walk and I'm like uh-oh you know I'm like probably 25 at this time maybe 27 I'm like oh boy this ought to be fun and I'm like had I known that I wouldn't have said hey lady I think the Lord wants to heal you and as they move away I'm like sort of panicked and I don't know what to do and And so I have her, why don't you come over here? So I have her come over here and like sit on these, where these stairs are, only the stairs went the other way. And I sit down there with her and I ask her what's going on. As I'm talking to her, I see these two football-shaped things in my mind's eye, each with the number 23 in them. And they come together in my mind's eye and turn to 46. And I'm thinking, what is this? And I just, you think I'm weird now, don't you? Are you like thinking I'm a butthead? No, no, I'm just like. Okay, so they turn to 46. And so I'm asking the Lord, what is this? And just the thought comes into my mind, chromosomes. Isn't that how many chromosomes are in the human body? I think chromosomes. So I say to her tentatively, I said, you know, I don't know. I didn't tell her what I saw because, you know, she'd think I was a freak. And so I just said, you know, I think the Lord's saying maybe that this is like somehow inherited. Can you tell me about your parents? And she goes on to tell me that she comes from a long line of witches and warlocks in Scotland. And so now I'm thinking, dang, I got myself in some deep doo-doo here. And I'm thinking, what the heck am I going to do? And so then I realized that like the 46 hereditary thing doesn't really mean chromosomes. It means like she sort of inherited this through some sort of weird stuff on the dark side, you know? Well, anyway, make a long story short. She tells me that she has some major kind of lupus, hasn't walked in months, but she's there with a bunch of friends from her church. I pray for her. She gets instantaneously healed and starts running around the room. And the place just goes crazy. Well, that's okay. You know, that's like appropriate emotion. You know, that's like Kevin Garnett throwing one down with the lights going off to beat the Lakers or something. God help the Lakers. Are you with me? So it's like okay for emotions to come out in a time like that, but that's not emotionalism. That's like, wow, none of us had ever seen anything like that. And everybody was going crazy about it. But, you see, I had to sort of dial things down for myself. Football's in your head, chromosomes, weird dark side stuff, you know. I had to dial myself down not to be weirded out by that. And I think that that's really important. And then the people around us will dial down as well. And then the last one, just do it. And again, I think probably here I'm mostly speaking to the kind of conservative evangelicalism that I came out of. Where we were just always very tempted towards criticism. And towards being right. And you know, I'm happy to say that the Pentecostal movement from the turn of the century. The charismatic movement from after World War II and, you know, into the 70s. and then the vineyard movement are oftentimes called the third wave movement. I'm sure they have plenty of things to be criticized about. In fact, I could probably do it better than you. I was actually there. Are you with me here? I mean, I'm happy to talk about that. I don't feel the least bit defensive about it. Yeah, we made mistakes. But we were actually doing something. We were on the field getting our uniforms dirty, playing and trying. We weren't sitting up in the stands criticizing. And that's what we can't do. We really have to get into the game and just try. But that's why it's so important for me that you hear it mixed up in this stuff that Dallas is teaching us. I really actually get pretty excited when I think of you guys growing in grace and character and growing in your risk-taking in the Holy Spirit. I actually, you know, winds my clock. I just think that's a beautiful vision. And when I can just see you being the cooperative friends of Jesus, you know, 24-7. in a just very routine, natural way. Realizing that you live in a conversational relationship with God, being his cooperative ambassadors, filled with the Spirit, and doing it for the sake of others. I love that vision. I could talk about it all day. I just know that it cannot and will not happen without the Holy Spirit. But the Holy Spirit is real. Hey, Keith, can you be Oprah here for us? Where's your mic? we need a mic this oh here we go here comes oprah um we only oprah oprah can i have a car too um boy little todd has come out to play you get me tired enough and All right, I would just like to hear, if you're willing, you know, seriously, nobody has to do this. I have plenty of other things we could do. But just as, you know, several, a handful or more of you have come up to me since this afternoon and just told me about really beautiful things that happened to you today as we prayed. And I just thought it might be good before we prayed again tonight for some of you to just very quickly, it can just be a sentence or two. You know, don't give us your life's testimony because we've got to be out of here in a couple minutes. But just some sort of sentence, you know, thanksgivings of something that the Lord did for you this afternoon as we were praying. Are you up for that? How about just, even if you're just one of the ones who came forward, just tell everybody else. But it doesn't have to be you. But okay, who would like to do that? Come on, there's probably a few of you. Come on, I've been playing with you. Okay. Just thank you that you invited us down in a really safe way and it was exactly that, an invitation and that you promised was that it wasn't going to be hyped and there wasn't going to be music and it wasn't going to be manipulative and that was a true invitation to us. So thanks. You're welcome. Someone else? I think in the back of this section here. When you started talking about hands getting warm, mine just got a little warm, but I thought, okay, this is interesting. Had that ever happened to you before? I've had certain tingling sensations, and it was similar to that. So I thought, okay, something's on the move here, but it didn't quite, wasn't like it. And then I started feeling like my tongue, before you started talking about wisdom and knowledge and that sort of thing, I started feeling my tongue get kind of weird, and I had this sense where I just wanted to come up and touch it. So I did, and then I thought about the coal on the lips and that kind of story. And then I noticed I kind of dropped my head back, and I wanted to catch raindrops from heaven and have the drops land on my tongue. Nice. Cool. Someone else? You guys are going to have to help because I can't see because of the lights. Oh, come on. Let's play here a little bit. are you there I just felt like a cleansing a washing the tears just kind of flowed down it was a quiet tears you know and then I felt I just wanted to I just felt so filled inside so warm inside that the spirit was overflowing through me so touching the friends that were beside me nice thank you you told the guy back there told exactly what was happening with me. My hands were getting hot. And then you said, well, some of you might be getting hot. Well, and then about the same time that you were saying that, my tongue did the same thing. Wow. I told my friend here that that was what was going on. And then I really saw that what God was doing with me is he's really, I homeschool my kids. And we're planting a church and it feels overwhelming. Yeah. But I'm learning. and they're the best classroom I have. That's great. All right, one or two more. How many of you, you can go ahead, but I'm just wondering, was there maybe one or two of you who maybe for the first time really felt, you know, in a sense, connected to the person, work of the Holy Spirit, something like that? That'd be neat to know. Yeah. I hope you can understand me. You go, girl. Okay. I'm definitely from south of the river. That's all right. You're accepted in the beloved. Thank you. And I'm really a little nervous because this was real powerful for me. But I recently accepted a position in our body as a leader over a significant number of women. And so when you had the word of the outpouring, the out of your belly will flow. So that was a real confirmation for me. Actually, the picture that the Lord had given me was they have bread. What they need is wine. I had had the picture of the wine. But again, it just confirmed that thirst for the Spirit. And it was just very significant for me. Cool. Thank you. That's great. Anybody else who maybe was having kind of a first time experience? That would be neat to know. Anyone? All right. Going once? Going twice? Oh, sold to the man in blue. My name's Greg, and I go to open door here. Hi, Greg. Hi, Todd. Yeah, I had a sensation in my hands before you talked about it, so I was surprised when you brought it up and said, have any of you got hot hands or tingling? Well, I was able to, you know, God's got me in a place. I can cry about things pretty easily. He lets things bubble up. I did cry about some things. It's just like grieving. Ever since Kim and I have been married, I got knocked out of engineering. That's been four and a half years. I'm just doing odd jobs and stuff. and not being the provider for four and a half years. So, you know, my emotions are, I'm able to pour those out before the Lord, you know, the grieving, the crying, and other things, all these things that in my life, like I feel like I just can't get these things done, 100 things, 200 things that ought to have been done, ought to get done, and I'm not getting them done, and I grieve that too. But I poured those out to the Lord, looked to him, and believed in him. And I told him I'm sick of these things, the way my life is, those bad things I talk about, those negative things. But after the experience up there, just that I had a lot of peace come over me and that feeling where I could say at this time, all is well. Amen. Thank you. All right. Here's what I think I'd like us to do as we close tonight. Several of you, and by the way, I don't know what that warm hand or tingly hand thing is. Honest, I don't know. There's nothing particularly weird about that. It's just something that we've seen a lot over the years. And again, I just sort of had the impression that that was happening. And you notice I asked. I didn't say. I asked because I don't even know if my impression was right. It's just a strong enough impression that I know enough to know that I should at least ask. and I remember I felt like it was connected to healing and so the way I just this afternoon it came to me that the way we should end tonight is for those of you who feel like you sort of receive some sort of impartation that has to do with healing to get you to pray for those of us tonight here who maybe are sick or have something going on in our bodies and so what I want to do is connect it though to some real life learning I know lots of you are tired. I'm tired. You know, you may just want to slip out. And if you do, that's fine. We're not going to go a long time. But, you know, we're probably looking at least another 10 minutes here. I want to, like, give you a little paradigm by which to learn to minister. There's nothing magical about it. There's nothing foolproof about it. But it is a really good, handy little mental model to keep. Might want to jot it down. or but just I want you to at least use it tonight as you pray for one another because it will keep it again safe and not weird and you know kind of grounded. So here's the first thing you want to do. What I want you to picture now is in five minutes here you're going to be standing in groups of six or so six to ten whatever and you're going to be praying for somebody with one of these people who feels like God rekindled in them their faith for healing today. and so just appoint somebody in the group as leader or let somebody lead and just sort of interview the person that's step one what's it's just tell us what's wrong where does it hurt and it's not quite like a doctor interviews people because we're not doctors and you know lots of medical information is not going to help us you know like they can just say i broke my arm not that you know i broke it in seven places in the 13th degree on this break and you know that's just I broke my arms good enough. And so you're just sort of interviewing them. But when you're interviewing them, sometimes it's more involved than that. Like, you know, when I interviewed that girl from Scotland, it was more involved than that. And so I had to sit and patiently listen to her. But as I was listening to her, I was forming that golden triangle of I was trying to listen to her and to the spirit to try to figure out what was going on with her. Because what I was looking for is step two. I was looking for a kind of a diagnosis, for lack of a better word. I'm looking for some sort of hypothesis through which I can do step three, which is select the way to pray. So I'm talking to somebody and listening to the Holy Spirit to try to ascertain what's really going on here. Because, again, we can't get into a whole big teaching on healing, but sometimes, you know, sickness can actually be directly from the enemy. Frankly, most of the time it's not, but it can be in rare cases. Other times maybe people are sick because they're sinning, but not usually. Most people are just sick. But, you know, there could be something going on, and so you're just sort of listening, trying to figure out what's going on. Because if somebody really is sick because they're sinning, you know, like maybe they have some disease from dirty needles that comes from drug abuse, well, there may be more to pray about there than somebody who has a headache. Are you with me? So you're just, you're trying to get a feeling of what's really going on in this person's life so that you can, number three, select the right prayer to pray. Like, you know, sometimes in the Bible, Jesus or the apostles spoke directly to an affliction. And like, remember in the New Testament where Jesus speaks to the fever and tells it to go? He speaks to the dead girl and says, rise up. So sometimes that's the appropriate prayer to pray. Other times the prayer ought to look a little bit more like intercession. You just kind of have to get a feel for how should I pray here? and then number four of course is you just you begin to pray and I would encourage you to try to learn to pray with your eyes open so that you can actually see what's going on and you can get that golden triangle going where you're being present to the person you're not just closing your eyes and going away to your God spot wherever that is you with me here but you're staying present to the person while staying present to the Holy Spirit and the rest of the group around you but you began to pray. And then at some point, the last step is you realize that it's over. That now you've got to stop. And I would ask the person, what happened? Did anything happen? Did you feel anything? Did you hear anything? Did you get any impressions while we were praying for you? And they might say, yeah, you know, like maybe you were praying for somebody who's been struggling with depression and they might say to you, you know, when you were praying for me, this thought came into my head about maybe where all this came from. And I'd never had this thought before. I don't know if it's right, but boom, they'll tell you their thought. And you and the group might all look at each other and go, wow, yeah, I think that's probably right. Let's pray again. And so then you can sort of take another shot at a couple minutes of praying for them. So all that little model is really designed to do, there's, trust me, there's no magic in it. All that model is designed to do is to help you to be present to them and to God simultaneously. and to treat them with respect as human beings, to listen to them, to pray carefully for them, to be aware of them. And so I just want to give you a little chance to do that tonight. And I think for some of you, it will be a good time for you to sort of take some manageable risks in this whole business of learning to walk in the power of the kingdom of God. All right, so who have you had sort of that experience this afternoon of feeling like God was restoring in you your faith for moving back out into praying for the sick the way you used to. How many had that? So we got about 10 maybe, okay. Now who of you here tonight, you're here with something like bodily or I guess it could be emotionally, but let's start with bodily. There's something bodily wrong with you that you really like prayer for. How many? okay we have more of you than we have uh prayers but that's okay we'll do something here okay all right here's what here's what i want to do i want everybody who would like to be prayed for uh stand up where you are so we can so this is just so i can see i can manage the sort of
