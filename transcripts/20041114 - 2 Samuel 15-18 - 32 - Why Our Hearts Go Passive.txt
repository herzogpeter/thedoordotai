What I want to talk about this morning was originally stimulated by a question I was asked a few weeks ago in the context of our dealing with the story of David and Absalom, particularly David's passivity in this story, his disengagement in this story that actually kind of took us by surprise and the problems that his disengagement, his passivity, particularly with Absalom created. You may remember when Amnon was, when Amnon raped Tamar, David got angry. He felt some things, but he didn't do anything. He was passive. He was disengaged. When Absalom was in exile, David felt some things. He was very sad that he was estranged from his son, and the text even said that he longed to go out to be with him, but he never did go out to be with him. He just felt angry at the rape. He felt sad at the exile. He just didn't do anything. He was passive. He was disengaged. And while the rebellion of Absalom was, in terms of beginning the story, was anticipated by me to be the focus of what we talked about, it really became David's passivity That was the bigger issue because it was his passivity that created the environment for David's or Absalom's rebellion to take place. Just the question with all of this talk of passivity a couple of weeks ago that came to me was this, Dave, what kind of things make you go passive? What kind of things cause you to disengage? Said Jack Quick to me. Jack is one of the leaders of our men's ministry. And then after he asked that question, would you come and share those things with men? Would you come and share your journey of passivity with men? He didn't say it that way. Well, it is an interesting question for a lot of reasons. One is this. That question carries the assumption that I do go passive, that I do disengage. And so my question for Jack is, what makes you think I do? well fact is i do from time to time disengage shut down and so do you from time to time so here's the question when you do what brings you there what brings me there now for some weeks we've been speculating and wondering what made david go into passivity and i think i gave some pretty good insights relative to the text. That's not the question, what made King David. The question this week is, what makes me do that? What makes you do that? When we do that, what makes us do that? When Jack asked me that question, I thought of two things very quickly. And it was one of the reasons I knew I could have something to say to the men. The two things grew to three rather quickly, and it made me know that maybe there was more than just talking to the men in our church, but there was something to say to our whole church. Three things came to me. Three things, I'm quite sure are not exclusive to me, the three things are these. Number one, fatigue. Sometimes makes me shut down. Number two is fear. Particularly fear of what people think. And if I'm driven by what people think and the fear of what people think, I will disengage, I will shut down in ways that sometimes people can't even see, but disengage nonetheless. And the third I thought of was this, and as it relates to my life's journey, is forgetting. Forgetting, first of all, what the call and mission of the kingdom really is on my life and on your life. And if I forget that, I will shut down. And the second thing I forget, and if I forget it, I'm in trouble. I forget sometimes that this whole thing is a war. That there really is some conflict. And if I forget that it's a war, I'm not prepared at all when it comes. Because see, I thought it was just going to be easy. easy. Let's talk first about the fatigue that shuts us down. The fact is, I think most of us can relate to this one at some level, where in the context of your marriage or your family, your kids or your career, you just shut down. You disengage. You find yourself uninvolved. You find yourself inaccessible. And it's not because you don't care about your marriage. It's not because you don't care about your family or your kids or your career. It's just because for whatever reason, you don't have anything left to give. You wish you did. You wish you did. You know you should, but you don't have anything left to give. And out of your fatigue, you shut down. You go passive, you give up. By the way, this shutting down, this passive thing has been kind of hard to nail down from time to time because it doesn't always look the same. I was talking to a friend of mine about what it feels like and how you can tell when you've kind of disengaged and ways that you can tell you've disengaged that other people might not. The insight he had was this. He said, Dave, you know, on those occasions when I lose it with my kids, and I know most of you have never, probably don't even know what I'm talking about, losing it with you. On those occasions where I just really blow up at them, I know that in those occasions where I'm blowing up, I look very, very active, not passive at all. I'm really doing your sermon. I have broken the power of passivity because I'm blowing up my kids. Now, there are times when I'm confronting my kids, and there's a lot of energy with that confrontation, Dave. He said, but there are times when I blow up on my kids, and it looks very active, but the real reason I'm blowing up on my kids is because somewhere inside I quit. I decided I didn't want to do the hard work anymore of really being engaged and maybe bringing a very hard word. but sometimes those blow up things happen when you just got so done you gave up because for among other reasons you were just exhausted. Looks real active. It's really all about passivity. Now lots of things can bring you to that place of depletion. Life can do it. The battle that life is can do it. Trouble at home, at work can do it. Success can do it. And if you can get enough of these life issues to pile on at one time for a prolonged period of time, you can enter into a kind of fatigue that leads to despair. And you find yourself saying things like this, whether with words or just this spirit talk you have to yourself, it's this, I just can't do this anymore. I've got nothing left to give. I'm tired. And boy, does that sound wimpy. What's the matter? How come you're disengaged from your ears? I'm tired. Wake up! But you can't. Whatever you had to give is given. I have nothing left to give. I think it's what Elijah felt. Remember the story of Elijah, 1 Kings 19. week and a half ago when Dallas Willard was here. He was here in our pulpit, but the week previous to that he was here with Todd Hunter doing this Kingdom Living Conference. Dallas made reference to the story of Elijah and drew some wonderful analogies from it and gave some incredible advice. You remember the story? 1 Kings 19, Elijah was facing down the prophets of Baal, called down the fire of heaven. He won the day. Not only did he scatter the prophets of Baal, but he just destroyed them completely. And that scene of power encounter wasn't passive at all. Elijah was very active in that. But you can know that in doing that, there was a tremendous exertion of energy and strength expended. I'm pretty sure after that, he was tired. He was depleted. No shame in that. You're tired after you deal with the prophets of Baal and call down fire from heaven and they all die. It's kind retiring. But just at that time in his place of depletion, having given what he had to give, one more thing got added to the pile. Just one more thing. It wasn't as big as the prophets of Baal, but it was big, but it was just one more thing. It was Jezebel who threatened him. Now, Jezebel is no small threat, but you would think if he could do all the prophets of Baal on Sunday, he ought to be able to handle Jezebel on Monday, except for one thing. He was depleted. He had given everything he had to give. He was fatigued, no resources left to draw on. He tried to draw on them, I'm sure he did, but there was nothing left to draw on. And because of that, against Jezebel, he was defenseless. And so he ran for his life, sat under a tree, asked God to let him die, and fell asleep. Now, when Dallas Willard was telling the story last week, he was telling it different than me, primarily because he was telling it much softer. He came to this point in the story and he said, Elijah fell asleep and then he woke up and he got something to eat. And then he fell asleep again. And then came the advice. So take a nap. And take two naps because the second nap, is the one that helps. And so I did. Right in the middle of his talk. I did. I'm not even kidding. And it was the second one that helped. he called it the Elijah discipline the Elijah discipline it's a strange way to look at rest isn't it like it's a discipline I mean I was falling asleep my wife poked me she goes Dave you're making noise you're snoring I go what are you doing I said I'm practicing my spiritual disciplines you ever think of rest as a discipline if you're in the battle you need to something you need to actively intentionally do if you hope to stay engaged it's counterintuitive that's why these things don't always occur to us but to the untrained because to the untrained eye resting looks passive when sometimes resting is a spiritual discipline you need to on purpose enter into so you can stay engaged. Now, it's weird. I have a lot of parents who talk to me about their kids listening to me preach and they like it that their kids do. And I can just hear you kind of going, Dave, I like it when my kids hear you preach, but now you're telling them to rest. That's all they ever do. Well, this sermon's not for you. Some of you need to wake up. That's another sermon. Psalm 1 verse 3 listen to this speaks of people who are like a tree picture the imagery there's something stable and strong and enduring in this picture of a tree planted by the rivers of water in a place where they are drawing sustenance and drawing nourishment from the river the river of life the river of God and because they are planted by the rivers of water They are able to yield their fruit in their season. A number of things you could draw from that little image, but part of it is this. You don't yield fruit in every season. The tree that is a healthy tree is yielding fruit in the appropriate season. See, there are seasons for plowing, and then there are seasons for planting and seasons for watering and seasons for waiting. you don't plow every season sometimes you have to do a different thing and I'm not into agriculture I don't know anything about farming but I would suppose that if there were farmers here they would even say not only are there seasons of planting and plowing and watering and waiting but there are seasons where you need to let the whole field rest where there is nothing no plowing, no planting, no water just rest and if you hope to stay engaged if you hope to bear the fruit you'd like that field to bear, you're going to have to give it a season of rest. You're going to have to enter into Elijah's discipline. You're going to have to figure that out. It's counterintuitive. It goes against the grain. We think we're always supposed to be, especially in this response. Do you remember a couple weeks ago, we broke the power of passivity, and now we're all really tired. A vitally important part of bearing fruit is getting rest. a vitally important part of avoiding passivity and shutting down is taking a nap. But let's say you did it. Let's say you did take a nap. Let's say you went on vacation. I need a vacation so bad. So you go on vacation and you come back from vacation and you took your nap. You took your vacation but when you come back, guess what you come back to? You're out of control. You're unbalanced life. By the way, I kind of have a joke about vacations, and it's this. The value of a vacation, you only get the value of vacation while you're on the vacation. The only time you really get any rest is while you're on it. Because as soon as I'm back home, it's all over. Not rested at all. Are you rested? I even hate the week after vacation because you have no excuse. Nobody gives you any sympathy. Well, he's been on vacation. He's rested. How many of you know what I'm talking about? Nobody. Okay, there's three of you. That's good. That's okay. That's okay. God told me that's okay. If there's only three, that's okay. See, for some of us to effectively deal with the kind of fatigue that leads to disengaged passivity, we need to not just rest and take a nap, go on vacation, but some of us need to seriously re-evaluate how and when and where we're spending the juice of our life. We're spending the energy of our life. We're using the gifts that God has given us because the fact is this, and this is all real obvious stuff, but we don't always stop and think about it. The fact is this, we only have so much juice. You only have so much energy. So here's the question. Are you spending the juice of your life? Are you spending the energy that God has given you to spend on things that matter even to you? Are you spending the juice of your life on the things you really value? In fact, here's another question. Have you ever even stopped to think about what it is you value most? Have you ever even stopped to think about where it is you're spending the juice of your life and whether that's where you want to spend it? And the operative word in that question is stop. But here's where it's counterintuitive again because stopping looks passive and we're supposed to be active, actively, on purpose, stop. and reevaluate where it is you're spending the juice of your life. Because if you'd stop and think, it may be that the reason you're disengaged in areas of your life that you desperately need to be engaged is because you're spending your juice on something that doesn't matter. And so you're disengaged from things that do matter. I'll never forget a couple years ago meeting with a group of pastors I wasn't preaching, no one was we were just being together and talking about life and what we do and how we do it and one of the guys got particularly vulnerable and talked about the fact that he was on a sabbatical at the time actually it was more of a leave than a sabbatical he wasn't sure he was going to go back to his church he wasn't sure he was even going to go back into the ministry because six months previous he had gone home to confess to his wife that his drive for ministry success, it had finally become clear to him that his drive was not kingdom living, it was a drive for ministry success, had caused him to treat the church like a mistress. And he wanted to repent. He kind of came to his wife and said, honey, I've never had an affair with a woman that's never even been on my radar screen, but I feel like I've been having an affair with the church. And he went home to repent, and that was a good thing. Except that when he got home, her response to him was, Honey, I'm really glad you shared this with me, and it really feels like a step in the right direction. It really gives me hope that you would say this to me. But I just need to tell you that church isn't your mistress. Church, career, could be for you. Church is your wife. I'm your mistress. You've married your work. You come here to feel good. And when I don't make you feel good, then we have all sorts of problems, and that just knocked him down. So you know what he did? He stopped. Stopped? You can't do that. That's passive. No, that's not. He actively, on purpose, stopped in order to reevaluate where it is he's spending the juice of his life. You know why? Because he's only got so much juice. And as he began to reevaluate where he was spending the juice of his life, he did it in such a way that it helped him begin to re-engage in the thing that mattered more to him than his ministry success, than his career success. By the way, none of this reevaluation happens by accident. None of it happens by accident, and all of it requires hard choices. Sometimes the kind that upset other people who are used to you doing your whole life for them. A couple weeks ago when I did go to Kingdom Warriors and Tom and I were sitting there on a stool and I didn't preach this stuff. We just kind of talked about a bunch of stuff around this issue. But one of the things I shared with them, I shared out with you, is how I see my life, how I see my life when it's rightly ordered. And it isn't always rightly ordered, just like yours. It gets out of whack from time to time. But when my life really is rightly ordered, I see my life as a series of circles that ripples out from the center. And to stay engaged, it needs to stay that way. To stay engaged, it needs to ripple out from a center. And then move out to other circles and the further out it goes, the less I need. I have to just be aware that as this thing is out here, it may be a very good thing. But I can't be spending the juice of my life there, especially if this stuff isn't being nurtured. And in these little circles that ripple out, it starts with me and God, just me and God. What's really going on there? I don't mean that I preached a good sermon last week. That's not the question. What's going on with me and God? Just me and God. Am I engaged there? Am I open there? Am I listening there? Am I centered there? Or am I just going through religious motions? Because here's the deal. If I'm not engaged at that center, and it's the same as true for you. If I'm not engaged at that center place, I've got nothing to give my wife. I've got nothing to give my kids. I've got nothing to give you. Maybe a good talk. I've got nothing else. So it comes back to that. Am I engaged here? And that involves some disciplines. It involves solitude. And it involves prayer. And it involves quiet. And it involves journaling for me. I don't know what it involves for you. But that's where it starts. And after that, it ripples out to my wife and I. The Bible says something interesting about a marriage. It's like one flesh. And it's kind of like important, I think. And how are we? And what's really going on there? And am I just assuming that's there and out here doing all this? No, no, no. Get back in here. And when that's healthy and being cared for, and I'm spending some juice there, then from there we go to our kids. You mean the kids come after your marriage? Absolutely, absolutely. This first, then the kids. If it's coming from the marriage, then I have something left for the kids. And after that, it ripples out to my friends. And after that, it ripples out to career. And after that, it ripples out to acquaintances. And after that, it just keeps rippling out. And pretty soon, you're out here. And you know what's out here? A lot of people and a lot of causes. And let's just say this, they're all good. Really good people and really good causes. And here's the insight. If you're spending all your juice out here with really good people and really good causes, but you are not centered here and here, and you're not centered here. If you're spending all the juice out here, you won't have energy for juice in here. You won't have juice to do what you need to do here, and you will, at the center place of your life, be disengaged. You will look really busy, and you will be absolutely passive, impotent, in the places of your life that matter most. And none of this alignment and realignment and rediscovering my center happens by accident. All of it requires hard choices, and when I lose my balance, and I do lose my balance, I have to stop, actively stop and reevaluate in order to re-engage in the things that matter most. Think about it for you. I mean, what are the things that ripple out for you? And then just ask yourself a question. Where am I spending my juice? I mean, I have so much. So where is the energy of my life being spent? And is where I'm spending my juice where it matters? Because if it's out here, you won't have anything left for what matters most. In fact, let me just let you do an experiment with you. We'll kind of practice this. Somebody comes up to you, maybe after church, and asks you a question. What are you doing Thursday night, Dave? Nothing. Really, nothing. Good. Would you come to our very important function at church? Well, what are you doing? Well, we're going to win the world. That's what we always do here at church. We're always winning the world, and we do it every night. So come every night. Okay? So come and so you say, now here's where you have to practice. Are you ready to practice? They ask you to come Thursday night because we're going to win the world. Here's what you say. Ready? No. Next question. Why aren't you coming? I mean, I just heard you say you're doing nothing. And here's what you say. You're right. I am. That is what I'm doing. Nothing on Thursday night. That's how you practice. That's how you practice. this. I think you get the picture, and this is not a minor matter. If we don't get this right, we will spend our juice again on things that do not matter and be disengaged from the things that do matter. Fatigue is one that shuts me down. Fear is another one that shuts me down, and disengages me from time to time. Fear primarily of what people think. Again, I think this one's fairly common to us all. I think all of us want people to like us. I don't think any of us are free from that need from time to time. I think all of us want to get along. Nobody likes conflict, but here's the deal. It's just the way it is. If the need to be liked is what drives you, if the need to be liked is what controls you, you will be controlled all your life by what other people think, by what other people want. In fact, this one really applies to the ripples. If what other people think and your need to be liked by everybody else is what drives you, this is exactly when you will find yourself spending your juice on these outer ripples that you really don't care about. Because you know, the real reason you're involved in all this stuff isn't because you care about it, it's because the person who you wanted them to like you. So you went there and you neglected this, the thing that mattered most. Early in our marriage, my wife used to say to me, and I didn't know how to fix this, I found, I felt like she was putting me in such a bind, and honestly, I can tell you, she doesn't say this to me anymore, because she doesn't need to anymore as much. What she said was this, she said, Dave, I feel like you would drop anything for anybody, but I don't feel like you would drop anything for us. I was spending it all out there. Why? Because I'm a great guy. Why am I a great guy? It's settled. That's not why. You just can't say no. Why? You just got to have people like you. And you spend it all out there. And you're disengaged from what's in here. This isn't going to happen by accident. This is hard work to figure this out. in fact one of the things I remember about early ministry was again this we never get over this but this need to be liked was so strong in those early years it was so strong guess where I spent almost all of my juice in the early years because I needed everybody to like me you know who I spent it all with almost all of my juice was with people who didn't like me you know why because I was trying to get them to change their mind like me. And if I spend enough time with you, maybe you will. They never did. And after a while, my wife didn't either. So I say, well, you're never gonna, and she kind of does. See ya, and I went back home. If we don't figure this out, we can't survive this kingdom life. Like you, I still do struggle with this. And when I'm losing this struggle, giving into the fear of what people think, you know what I find myself doing? I find myself doing what you find yourself doing when you're giving in to this fear. I find myself saying yes when I mean no. I find myself agreeing when I don't really agree. I find myself giving in when I should stand firm, being silent when I really should speak. Outside my ministry here at Open Door, my favorite place to be, my favorite place to minister is in the context of other pastors, men and women in ministry of various kinds, and I do get opportunity to do that from time to time. And when I do, almost invariably, one of the things I want to make sure at some point I talk about with them is this kind of stuff, and one of the things I say to them in a variety of different ways is something like this. Men and women, here's the truth. If you continue to humbly and faithfully do what God calls you to do and say what God calls you to say, you will never lose your ministry. But you might lose your job. Do you know the difference? See, every one of them do know the difference. They know exactly what I'm talking about. Because when we're living under the tyranny of what people think and we're driven by this need for everybody to like us, guess what will happen when God tells you to do something but you're afraid people won't like you if you do it? You won't do it. and if you're afraid of what people are going to think if you say something God has called you to say so you don't say it because you're afraid of what people will think guess what happens you keep your job but guess what you lost your edge you lost your ministry you kept your job you just don't have ministry no effect no life no sword none of this gets into adjustment by accident you're going to have to do this on purpose and it takes a lot of work it takes a lot of activity to figure out where am I going to spend my juice so I can stay engaged and not be passive in those places of life where it is most critical that I not be passive that I stay engaged like, oh, I don't know, me and God. I'm just preaching sermons here, folks. Me and God, how we doing? I mean, really, how we doing? Me and my one flesh, and then my children, and then my friends, and then it goes out. And by the way, what's ironic, the stronger this is, oh boy, the stronger this is, the more juice I spend here and not worry about that, the more, ironically, I find out later, it rippled out there and I didn't even know it. How about you? You getting this? I think you get this. Let me talk about another fear that keeps us passive. It's the fear that no matter what we do or what we say it will be. And I know you know what that feels like. I know you know what I'm talking about. Here's the deal. If you live with the fear that what you say or what you do won't matter anyway guess what you won't do? You won't do it. You won't say it. Why? It doesn't matter. So why say it? Why do it? This one's big, I think. That's why there are scriptures that say things like this. Don't lose heart in doing good. For in due time you'll reap if you don't grow weary. It matters what you do, even though you can't see the results right now. It matters what you do. That's why there's scriptures that say even a cup of cold water given in Jesus' name. Do you believe it? Do you know this? A cup of cold water given in a kindness. that simple ripples into eternity. But if we don't think what we say and what we do and how we love and how we live makes a difference, we move into passivity and passivity is expressed this way. Why try? Why try? My daughter's not changing. My son's not changing. My husband's not coming home. My wife doesn't respond to me. Why love anybody? Why love anybody? You know, this why try thing is such a big thing and so common to the human experience that the early church fathers actually had a name for this. It was called acedia. It comes from the Latin, and it literally means sloth or laziness. One of the seven deadly sins is sloth, according to Augustine. Now, when I think of sloth or someone who is lazy, I think of a lazy bum. Get up! Keyster and do something. This sloth, this acedia thing, isn't a person who is inherently lazy. This is a sloth that comes on people who have succumbed to the fear that what they do and what they give and how they love and what they say just doesn't matter. And so they say, well, I try. Literally, the word acedia, it speaks to the plague that strikes at noonday. Now think about the imagery there. The plague that strikes at midlife, in the course of a day that would be a picture of someone's life, midday is a hot part of the day, and you've worked half your day, half your life, and you have a long way to go. You know, if it was near the end, I could see the end, and you didn't see the end yet, and it's really hot right now. And at the midday period of time, with the heat of the noonday sun pounding on you a little bit, You become convinced or you become afraid that you're not making any progress. You're not making any difference. You can't see any consequences. You can't see any results of what you do and how you live and who you are. So why bother at all? And you slip into acedia, passivity. And that leads to the third thing that makes me, us, go passive. It's this, forgetting what the goal really is. forgetting what the call of God on my life and what the mission of the kingdom of God really is you see and this is going to sound like a cliche but it's true and I'm going to let it be as simple as it sounds the goal beloved cannot be and the goal is absolutely not to be successful as we would measure success as we evangelicals tend to in even America and evangelicalism the goal has to be it just has to be and the goal is to be faithful and by faithful I do not mean regular he's like a little puppy and he's always there I don't mean faithful that way I mean faithful like full of faith full of believe in God the goal has got to be and is not to be successful but to be faithful to be full of faith to be full of hope to be full of life to be full of joy, to be full of love, to be full of peace, even if the stuff out here, as it ripples out, isn't going real well. In fact, if the things that I would like to ripple out into aren't going really well, you know what it does? It ought to do. It'd bring you even closer and closer and closer to your center. And in that center, God, I want to be full of faith. I don't see anything. I don't see anything that matters. Fill me with your life and your spirit. Right to the end. I told you at this Kingdom Living Conference, Dallas Willard spoke and so did Todd Hunter. Todd, just a tremendous contribution that he made. He said a lot of things, but one of the things he said, it was almost an offhanded comment and he never went back to it. I was going out to lunch with him that day, so I said, I'm talking to him about that. Here's what he said. Of all the most gifted, of all the most gifted people, men and women I have ever known in ministry, none of them finished well. I was stunned. I said, whoa, none of them. I mean, I know some of the people you've been in ministry with. And I'm thinking, you just said none of them. That bothered me a lot. For one reason, I mean, there are, I'm at a place in my life where I have, I'm simplifying things. I have, I have kind of three things I'm asking God for, for the rest. I have three things that I want and it would be enough if he would give me the one is to finish well. I care about that a lot. And by finish well, I do not, honestly, I do not mean successful. I mean, I want to, at the end of my life, I want to be full of faith and I want to be full of love for my God and for my wife. Full of it. I want to be, somebody say, I is full of it already. Well, I want to be full of that too. Because I want to be a little feisty and a little crabby, but not crabby really, crabby pretend. I want to be crabby pretend because I want to be full of faith. I want to be a crusty old grandpa. That's grandpa, yeah. But I want to be, they're going to know I'm full of love and full of faith and full of life and full of joy, not success. That's what I want. It's what I want. So I was curious when he said that. Nobody, I don't know anybody. So I met him for lunch. We talked about a number of things at the end of lunch. I said, what do you mean? Really, nobody? And he goes, no, I did overstate that. That isn't true. But then he told me about best friends who chose a different path. He talked about sexual immorality that was rampant. frightening and a friend of his who died of AIDS because of a homosexual lifestyle that he entered into after ministry and stuff and I'm going my goodness that's scary and then there was this one person he hadn't mentioned and I knew that he worked closely with him and I'm not going to mention his name and I said well what about what about him and and he said no he didn't finish well I go you're kidding and I immediately thought he meant immorality sexual immorality of some sort and he said no it wasn't that he just died angry and cynical and I said why and he said because the dream he had for ministry he never got realized in his lifetime in fact when he died his particular dream for ministry was crumbling so he died angry and cynical and I'm just here to tell you I don't want to judge that guy at all I got lots of grace for him I know the person I know the guy and I'm here to tell you he was a warrior in the kingdom of God but I and I don't want to oversimplify what happened to him but I think he forgot. I think he forgot what the goal is. What the call and the mission of his life is and my life is. See, it's not to be successful. It's just to be faithful and the goal is to be full of it. To be full of it to the end. You know, Timothy, or Paul finished well. But if you look at the circumstances of his life, his circumstances didn't look successful. I mean, we have these weird, almost romantic notions of what it was like to be around Jesus, what it was like to be around Paul. Most of the church didn't accept Paul or his apostleship. It was after he died, everybody started quoting Paul. Nobody was quoting Paul when he was still around. Paul's an idiot. He used to kill Christians, and people were undermining his ministry all the time. In fact, Paul himself said, there's only one of kindred spirit, that's Timothy. He's the only one who gets it with me. Died in prison. Pastor of a big church. Now, pretty anonymous. In prison, but in prison, he said this, 2 Timothy 4.7, I've run the race, I've finished the course, I've kept the faith. By saying I've kept the faith, I do not believe that he meant I kept believing the right thing about Jesus until the day I died. I don't think that's what he meant when he says he kept the faith. I think he meant this, that even in prison, without the trappings of what looks like success as it relates to how people measure success, I'm here to tell you, on my last day, I am full of faith. There's the goal. I'm full of love. I'm full of joy. Because I'm spending my juice right here. The center. And guess what? He spent all his juice right here. Do you think any of his juice rippled out? huh didn't it that's how it works here's the deal if we forget that the goal is not to be successful it's to be faithful then when we don't see what we think means success we can come to believe that what we do or what we did didn't and doesn't matter and if we come to believe that what we do and what we say doesn't matter we will slide into acedia the plague that strikes at noonday and we yield then to what's the use we yield to cynicism and sloth shut down, give up, disengage there's another thing that if we forget we will disengage and it's this that this really is a war that when we were invited into life in the kingdom of God we entered into a conflict with a rival kingdom interesting in 2 Timothy 2-3 Paul is kind of recruiting Timothy and he says I don't know you're going to sign on with me and just come with me but here's the invitation imagine this at the end of an evangelistic crusade here's the invitation suffer hardship with me like a good soldier who signed on for that? I didn't I think in fact most of us come into the kingdom believing in fact is when I think of American evangelicalism I think most of us come into the kingdom of God believing that we have the inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and many of us come to God believing that if we come to God he's going to give us all that in fact that's why we come to God so he will give us all that which is our inalienable right and I'm finally going to get God in my life because nothing else is working so I'm going to get God so I can get all this happiness in fact that was the deal and when you don't get that deal you're going this doesn't work the result of that mentality is this that when the opposition difficulty and suffering that inevitably comes does come you are entirely unprepared for it and you go down real easy so here's the invitation in fact I think this is an invitation to where we are going as a church. I think if you've been around Open Door for the last several weeks, even months, I don't have time to explain this, but there is a sense of God bringing us to another level of faith and life in the kingdom of God. And I know he's bringing me to some things, and some of them, they're all very exciting, very life-giving, but they come with a cost. And I have sensed in my own life an increase of what I would identify as spiritual warfare. I had a meeting last Tuesday and we were talking about this with the elders and just said, you know, how can we handle this? And one of the things is we need to know more about spiritual warfare. If we're going to go where God's calling us to go, we're going to need to know more about spiritual warfare because we're not prepared. So here's the invitation. I invite you to suffer hardship with me in the kingdom of God. I invite you to step into the fire. Word about the fire as I close. Dallas Willard didn't talk about this when he was here at the conference, but he wrote a pamphlet on this that Keith Meyer was passing around and I got a copy of it. And the reason I was interested in this is because Dallas talked about his theory in terms of why movements of God in certain generations aren't passed to the next generation. We have a lot of interest in that because it's part of our vision that what God's doing here would be passed to the next generation. So I read the pamphlet of his and was curious to see his explanation. It was this, that when any movement of God, whether it be in a church or some sort of historic movement in history someplace, starts with a core of people who have what he called a fire. Just call it the fire of God. Something in their belly and from that fire, that life, that energy, things are created. Good things are created. And people are drawn to that fire. Now, some of the people who are drawn to that fire catch the fire. That's what happens. But it's because they kind of saw what this was really all about, and they got into the fire, and they said, God, I don't want to just do this religious thing. I want this fire that I see in this movement, and I am warmed by. I want to get in this fire. I want this fire to be in me. But a lot of people never get the fire in them, never enter into the fire themselves, but they come to the movement and are drawn to the movement to warm themselves in the fire. In fact, I got to be honest with you, there's times when our church fills up and then it kind of goes back down. Then it fills up and what's going on? When it fills up, it's revival. Maybe. I don't know. I think there's a lot of people who like to get warmed by the fire. The reason he says then that movements don't get passed to the next generation is that very often you have people who haven't got the fire. They've never stepped into the fire. They just like being warmed by the fire. They have no idea what it takes to carry the fire. So when that core of people move on who had the fire, there is no fire left. The movement dies. Here's the invitation. Step into the fire. Not just be warmed by the fire. but if you do I need to warn you that it will burn you it will burn off your pettiness it will burn off your smallness it will expand the room you live in it will stretch you in ways that scare you it will change you, it will transform you you know what else it will do? it will fatigue you you step into this fire it will fatigue you and you're going to need to learn things that you didn't think were that important you're going to need to learn how to rest you're going to need to learn how to re-evaluate and really do the hard work of evaluating where am I spending the juice in my life because if I really say I care about this I can't be spending it there and you will be forced into those kinds of that kind of work when you step into the fire if you're just being warned by the fire this is just a talk that was good advice now if you're in the fire this is like saving your life if you step into the fire it'll scare you and you're going to have to learn to get your fear right there's going to have to be a weaning away from what people think and whether they like you or not if you step into the fire that fire is sometimes going to confuse you and when it confuses you you're going to forget sometimes what the mission really is and you're going to forget that this really is hard there really is a conflict because there really is a rival kingdom. We're not kidding about that. So how do we walk all this out? Well, I got one more week on this. I think. At least. Let's close in prayer. Would you stand as we dismiss? First of all, Father, I thank you for the men and women in this room who are in the fire. Who have the fire in them. who have said, yes, God, I don't even know what it means, but I just don't want to play church. I don't want this religious stuff. I want to be in the fire. I know them. I know they're here. I know that. And so, Father, I lift the men and women up to you, our young people who are in the fire right now, and because of that, they're tired. And because of that, they're scared. Because of that, they're a little confused. And maybe they've forgotten. Holy Spirit, come. minister your life fill us with your spirit and I pray for those dear ones I pray for those dear ones who come to be warmed by the fire but they've never entered in and may be believers they may know you and at some level love you but they've never stepped into the fire Father I bless them we bless them we welcome them they're closer to the fire than if they weren't here but Father I pray in Jesus name that you would move on the hearts of men and women boys and girls that they would say oh God this scares me but I want this fire in me I don't want to just be warmed by it I want to be in it in Jesus name I pray this and all God's people said Amen Amen.
