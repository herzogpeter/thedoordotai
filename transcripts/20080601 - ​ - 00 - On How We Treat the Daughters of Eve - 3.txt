For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. As I listened to Steve's message last week, one of the hugest things I felt was this sense of relief. I mean, finally somebody was saying something to me about men and women that made sense. It was a relief to know that God had a plan for what this would look like in the beginning. A plan that was consistent with what I've been learning about the kingdom. And it's a healing thing to acknowledge that women have really suffered for generations at the hands of men in power. You know, at the same time, there's a huge sadness that wells up in me. I mean, I look at the daughters of Eve in my midst and see how they're still exploited and limited and oppressed and objectified. And then I look at the sons of Adam and see how they're oppressed in a different way, how they're confused by the power they have. And I can't help but to think, what a mess. You know, we have come so far from the way things were in the beginning. I have this really vivid memory of being a little girl and playing with a Barbie doll. I think in some ways I was trying to figure out what it meant to be a woman. And I can remember looking in the mirror and thinking, how am I going to be tall, thin, blonde, and drive a red convertible? And then I got to high school, and I was bombarded with images of what it meant to be a woman. Thin, classy, mysterious, seductive. I mean, some of the stuff I learned from advertisements and TV shows, and some of it I learned just from jokes or the way people talked about women. I was 14 years old, and I was kind of a tomboy. a little bit klutzy and short. And I remember wondering, how is this going to work out for me? Am I going to be accepted as an adult? Shortly after that, I got really involved in my high school Bible study in my church youth group. You know, I think I was secretly hoping that the church would offer me some better explanation of what it meant to be a woman. But you know, what I really found in this community is that I just traded one set of messages that didn't make sense about women for another. I didn't seem to get any explanation about who I was, why I was valuable, and why I was worthwhile. I remember being told things like, eat the apple first, so women are more easily deceived. Or, you should keep your shoulders totally covered so you don't cause men to lust after you. I mean, I even was told the interests of Christian women, what they should be. Women like to cook. Christian women like to clean. They like to spend hours in their bedroom praying. They like to take care of children or play the piano or teach Sunday school. And with all these messages coming at me, I was really struggling because it didn't seem to fit who I was. I mean, I didn't really like to clean. I couldn't cook. And whenever I spent hours praying in my bedroom, I found myself bored and looking out the window wanting to go on a walk. So I realized that I like to teach and grow and learn and lead. And I found myself wondering, am I going to have to spend the rest of my life pretending to be something I've not? I mean, trying to wear a coat that just doesn't fit? You know, after a couple years, this started to feel so hopeless to me. I mean, it didn't feel sacred or holy. It didn't feel loving or protective. I actually just wanted to give up on the whole thing. I mean, I think in some ways the blinders started to come off and I started to really look critically. You know, it didn't feel loving when the men at the Christian school that I was at would whip out their Bibles. As soon as I even suggested there might be a different way we could relate to each other. It didn't feel loving when I was told that it was in the Bible that women cook dinner for their husbands every night. It didn't feel sacred or holy when I was told in my senior year of college that it was okay if I was there just to get my MRS degree. Or when I was told that it was wrong for a man to stay home with his kids because men had to be productive. It was wrong for them to sit around all day and do nothing. I don't mean to just rip on men here. I started to look at the Christian women in my midst of good, submissive wives who would submit to their husbands on some big decision, but then they would think nothing of ripping them apart at their Bible study and talking about how incompetent he was when it came to raising their children or doing the laundry. I'd be in their home and I'd see them just make their husband feel like an idiot. I'd just put him in his place. They seemed to want to consume and have control over them in just these specific areas. And something started to click. You know, I started to think there has got to be a better way for us to relate to each other. There has got to be a way for us to not vie for power, but to come underneath each other. To not consume one another, but to lift each other up. I have this friend who told me a few years ago that she spent a large portion of her life thinking that she was a mistake. that she was an afterthought, that there was no way that she was an image-bearer of God. And it got me thinking about the girls in our community. I mean, how are we teaching them that they are image-bearers of the one who created them? How are we showing them that they are Azer Konegdo, who Steve told us last week is a powerful, life-saving force and a face-to-face companion? You know, we know that our culture is not going to be objectifying women, but what are we offering them as alternatives? here is something i know the young girls and boys in our congregation are watching us they're trying to figure out what it means to be a man or what it means to be a woman they're watching the way that we treat each other they're listening to the way we talk to each other and about each other i have this vision of the seventh grade girls in our congregation surrounded by family and friends being encouraged and empowered, being taught that they are azar connecto, strong, life-saving, face-to-face companions, co-reigning and co-ruling with the men in their lives. And I have an image of our 7th grade boys surrounded by their family and friends, being taught the truth about who they are, being taught to lay down their power and lift others up. What would modeling these things look like? I think it would look like talking to each other and about each other in a way that was respectful. I think it would look like laying down our power. I think it would look like coming under and lifting up, submitting to each other and supporting each other, just like it was in the beginning. Well, that's an important voice to hear. Amen? Yeah. that's jen lindwall she's our metro impact pastor she's running a triathlon this morning it's amazing well as i heard her talk it made me echo the question what kind of community would we model, sons of Adam and daughters of Eve, where our seventh grade boys and girls would learn what it meant to be men and women who treat each other with love and respect and who talk to each other and about each other in a way that reflects the image that they bear. What would that look like? In Ephesians 5.21, we read these words, submit to one another, to one another, out of reverence for Christ. And I believe that picture, those words are our way back. There's just one problem. Nobody likes to submit. Everyone likes to be submitted to, but nobody likes to submit. When I think about submitting, the image that comes to my mind is when I got sick as a kid and my mom had a bottle of Robitussin that she was trying to force down my throat. I didn't want to take it. I didn't like it, but I grudgingly took it because someone told me I should and someone told me it was good for me, but I never, never would have taken it voluntarily. And Paul's radical proposal that we read in Ephesians 5.21 is this, that Christians all across the world, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, co-workers, students and professors, would learn what it would mean to submit to one another. And the words that come to my mind are, that'll never work. That'll never work. I want you to imagine this scene. This didn't happen. I'm not describing one of you. This is an imaginary scenario. But imagine that I'm sitting with a couple, doing some work with them around their marriage in my little cube over there in the north offices. And they're fighting because they're trying to make a decision, and they're on completely opposite sides of the decision. Let's say it gets a little heated, especially when the wife shouts, you know, he's not made one good decision in his life. To which he says, see, she just won't submit. And he opens up his Bible to Ephesians 5.22 and reads it out loud for us. Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. There might be a little groan or maybe even an out loud scream from his wife at that point right there. The word submit in our culture drips with weakness. it's never something we would aspire to. It would be something we would run from. But the word that Paul uses here, and this is important, it's weird to go back to the original languages all the time or as much as we do, but we have to in order to know what Paul meant. The word is this compound word called hupostasomai. And upo means underneath, and taso means to place in order. So it literally means to place oneself underneath. And the verb tense that carries it is in the middle voice in the Greek. That's weird. We don't have a middle voice. We have an active voice like I teach you. And we have a passive voice like you are taught by me. But a middle voice happens voluntarily that you do to yourself. Like when you teach yourself the guitar. And so this verse in 521 and 522 is not a command by Paul because it carries with it the implication that it would be voluntarily and you can't command someone to do something voluntarily. And so this is what makes this word beautiful. To voluntarily place yourself underneath in order to lift someone up. I saw a really great picture of Hupotasomai on YouTube. And maybe some of you have seen it, but it's a clip of a women's softball game, college softball game. This young woman gets up to the plate, kind of short, and she knocks it out of the park. Her first home run in her career. And people start going crazy. People on her team are yelling and shouting. There was two women on base. They came around to score. But in the video, you're waiting for the woman that just hit the home run to round first and start coming around second, but you never see her. Well, it turns out in her excitement, she missed first base. So as she was pivoting to go back, she tore her ACL and just went down and was hugging the bag. Well, the coaches came over and what's going to happen? And the umpire said, well, none of her teammates or coaches can touch her or else she'll be ruled out. So they asked, can we insert a pinch runner for her? And they said yes, but it'll be ruled a single. And that person will have to stay on first base. So pretty soon, a member on the opposite team comes over and asks the umpire, would it be okay if me and another teammate carried her around the bases? well the umpire was shocked they said there's no rule against that so two players on the opposite team picked her up came underneath her and lifted her up and they walked her around the bases being careful to lean down and touch every base as they were going around And that is a beautiful picture of submission. Upotasamai, to come underneath in order to lift someone else up at personal cost. See, the husband in the counseling session over there in my cube in the north offices, he wants his wife to obey him. And the problem with that is that Paul isn't asking his wife to obey him. If Paul had meant that, the word that he would have used is hupakao. It's the same word that he uses in Ephesians 6.1 when he says, kids, you are to obey your parents. Two different words. But in the English language, we get it mixed up. Submit and obey become the same word. It wasn't the same word for Paul. So when Paul encourages wives, asks wives, beseeches wives to submit to their husbands, he's calling them to do something that only a woman of tremendous strength could do, especially in their culture, but even in ours, to actually desire that her husband would be lifted up, so much so that she would voluntarily come underneath him, not in a pecking order kind of way at all, but in order to help him get his needs met. Now, unfortunately, as Jen mentioned, in some circles, some women will submit to their husbands in decisions or big types of things, but around the circle of other women, she tears her husband apart, ripping him to shreds. And that isn't a picture of submission, whether or not you decide to do what your husband decides to do or not. Let me tell you how a true Ezer Kinegdo, what we learned last week, a face-to-face companion, the word for Eve when she was created, a powerful, life-saving force. Tell you how a true Ezer Kinegdo lifts her husband up. I have a friend who meets with a group of guys every Tuesday morning at 6.30 in the morning. And his wife has told him that this is the hardest morning of the week for her. Because she becomes a single mom. And she gets ready for work and gets their kid ready to go to daycare. And it's very difficult for her. And she tells him that. But she doesn't want him to stop going to the group. In fact, if he decided to stop going to the group, she would have a lot to say about that. Because she knows how important it is to them and even to their marriage. And so she voluntarily places herself underneath on Tuesday mornings in order to lift him up. My question is, is she weak? No. She is strong and powerful. Back to our counseling session. Let's say both the husband and the wife are confused now. And they open up their Bibles to Ephesians 5.23, really weird, really confusing verse. And they kind of say, what do you do with this? Ephesians 5.23 and 24 say this, For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. And before we know it, we are back to the medicine metaphor. And it's very confusing. I got a lot of help from this text from a book that I would highly recommend called What Paul Really Said About Women. I listed that and two other resources on the message tool this week if you want to check that out on Monday. John Bristow wrote it, What Paul Really Said About Women. But in English, he says the word head is very obvious. It means two things all at once. It literally means the head of the body, like my head right here. But it also figuratively means the head of a corporation or body of people. So if you are the head of a company, we know what that means. If you're the head of a volunteer society, we know what that means. It means you're the leader. But in the Greek, there are two unique words that are both translated as head. The first word is a word called arche, A-R-C-H-E, in the phonetical spelling of it. It means head in terms of leadership, but also in terms of what was first in importance and power. From the Greek word arche, we get English words like arch enemy and arch bishop, carrying the primary first order of importance meaning. It's also used to describe the oldest, therefore the most important. We get words like archives, archetype, archaeology, all of which refer to first things or old things. So it's really interesting to me that Paul does not use the word arche in Ephesians 5.23 because he could have done two things at one time. He could have said, men, you're the leaders because you should be the leaders and because you were created first. you're the archetype of humanity so if he wanted to make this point he could have done it so easily but paul deliberately chooses the other word for head in greek which is a word called kephale k-e-p-h-a-l-e kephale and it does mean the literal head of the body like my head right here but it never was used to describe the figurative head like ceo meaning leader or boss it refers to that which is on the extremity the end of a pole, the tip of a spear the nose of an airplane and it's a military term denoting that which is first into battle it's what receives the impact first in the case of conflict I saw a movie a few years ago called We Were Soldiers I don't know if you guys saw this movie it was starring Mel Gibson he plays this lieutenant colonel who's getting ready to lead these troops into Vietnam before the Vietnam conflict started in 1965 and before they leave he gives this stirring speech to them and he says this I can't promise you that I will bring you all home alive but this I swear when we go into battle I will be the first one to set foot on the field and I will be the last one to step off and I will leave no one behind. That's the picture of kafali. When you think of men, those of us who are tempted to withdraw from our wives when we are asked to give something that we're afraid to give or when we just force our way in, forcing our wives or our female friends to adopt our way, the challenge to be a kafale is much more difficult than the challenge of being an archay. I mean, man, it's like you should wish that the word was archay because it's a lot easier. A husband who's the kefali of his wife is willing to be the first into battle. Not a battle against her, but a battle for her. Now the word head, I grew up in evangelical circles much like you did. And the word head for what a husband was meant at least two things. And these are the two basic things that I heard over and over again. I heard, well, what are you going to do if there's a decision that you can't make between a husband and wife? I mean, who gets the tie-breaking vote? That's got to be the head. So that was the husband's first job as the head. The husband's second job as the head was to make sure the couple was doing their devotions every morning. The husband's job was to make sure their spiritual life was on track. I just think that diminishes kephali. I don't think that's what Paul meant when he said, Husbands, you are the head of your wives. Because I think a true kafale says to his wife, you are worth dying for. Now husbands, if you asked your wife this threatening question, do you feel like I think you're worth dying for? If I asked my wife that question, I mean, I feel like I would need to brace myself. Wouldn't it be an easier question to say, do you feel like I'm the leader? You are worth dying for. Ephesians 5.25 expresses this dynamic. Paul writes this, Husbands, love your wives. Just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her. Now the word for love, you can guess it. It's agape. Meaning giving a love that expects nothing in return. Laying oneself down and giving oneself in order to lift the other person up. In fact, it's virtually identical to hupotosomai. So when Paul says husbands love your wives and Paul says wives submit to your husbands, he's telling them this is how you submit to one another. Ephesians 5.21 says submit to one another. In Ephesians 5.22 when it says wives submit to your husbands in fact in the original text it doesn't even have the word submit. It just says wives to your husbands. Meaning it's a direct correlation to verse 21. And when it says husbands love your wives he's using a synonym of submit. Paul's asking husbands, just like he's asking wives, to voluntarily come underneath your wife in order to lift her up. And so we get the beautiful and difficult picture of mutual submission between a husband and a wife. Now what does this look like? Well, a few years ago, actually seven or eight years ago, my wife and I were in Southern California and I was interviewing for this job. that I really wanted. I mean, I wanted this job really bad. And we were out there together. And after the first day of interviews, we were exhausted, so we were in the hotel room and I was just nodding off to sleep when I heard my wife crying in bed beside me. And the sensitive, tender soul that I am, my first reaction was, she's gonna screw this up. she's going to tell me all the reasons we shouldn't move here in fact she's going to even in the way that she's reacting she's going to influence the people that are interviewing us to not pick me I mean how can she be so selfish this is literally what I'm thinking I'm not even kidding you now in that moment I got a gift of grace because this was not my natural reaction. I don't know what it really feels like to hear the voice of God. I don't want to sound like I heard some auditory voice, but I felt as strong as I had ever felt before, God saying this to me. Steve, if you want to be a real man right here, you're going to stop this internal monologue, and you're going to turn over, and you're going to listen to your wife. And then I'll never forget this impression I got. Because God said to me, because I am very protective of her. Let me tell you, man, I received the gift. And I turned over and I said, honey, can we talk? How are you feeling? Now, I've done 75 ways the wrong way as well to this one way of doing it right. but let me tell you, something opened up in our marriage when I entered in like that. This is what mutual submission looks like. Terry Steinmeier, he's on the message team, and he helped me see what this all boils down to. He said this, for love to win, I can't start with the premise that I have to win. For love to win, I can't start with the premise that I have to win. And so we've been focusing a lot on marriage, but really this mutual submission thing can be expanded to friendships or working relationships. Love will not win if you have to win. Love will not win if I have to win. And here's the thing. I am so crafty at this that I can even make it look like I'm coming underneath my wife. But really what I'm doing is doing it so that she'll lift me up. I'll say to myself, you know, I've done this three times in a row. It's her turn now. I'm still thinking that I have to win. Oh man, here is something to think about. Jesus is both Kefale and Arche of the church. He is both first into battle and leader. There is no question about that. But when we read husbands, you're the head of your wives as Christ is head of the church. Here's my dare. I dare you, and I'm in it with you. But I dare you to focus on kafali instead of arche. To focus on what it would look like to have your wife say to her friends, my husband, he thinks I'm worth dying for. he thinks I am worth dying for I think that would be a beautiful thing women for your husband to say the same thing about you man you guys my wife because men do the same thing when they're sitting around for men to go, man, my wife, she is so strong and she loves me so well. Dave ended his message two weeks ago by asking us a question. Do any of us have any intention of following the rabbi into this area of our lives, our marriages, our sexuality? My question to that question is this. If I follow the rabbi this way, coming underneath in order to lift my wife and my friends up. My question is, will I disappear? How will my needs ever get met? See, there is another submission that we need to learn here. We need to learn how to submit ourselves to a love that actually is perfect. Now when we stand up on these stages like this and get married and we vow to one another to love each other and sicknesses and health and all this kind of stuff, we really should say to each other, honey, I'm going to make fun of you when I shouldn't. I'm going to leave the house sometimes when I should stay. I'm going to call you things I never should. But I will stay. The submission we need to learn if we're ever going to come underneath someone in order to lift them up is to learn that we are loved by a perfect love that isn't our friends or spouse. And this is the kind of love that comes from the best friend of Jesus. He writes about it in 1 John 4, 17 through 19. I want to read it to you. He writes, This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment. In this world, we follow the rabbi. We are like Jesus. There is no fear in love. No fear of not getting your needs met. No fear of not getting lifted up because perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love but we love because we love because he first loved us. here's what I know is true I run out of desire to come underneath my wife and lift her up and my friends and lift them up I run out of desire for that but when I learn more and more to submit to the love that God has for me a love that placed himself underneath me in order to lift me up I can begin to love this way and I can begin as Joel's song tells us to find my way back to the way it was in the beginning. I want to leave you with a picture. It comes from Deuteronomy 33, 12, and I want to read that to you. Let the beloved of the Lord rest secure in him, that is God, the Lord, for he shields him or her all day long, and the one the Lord loves rests between his shoulders. Now the picture of resting between someone's shoulders is this. You know my little guy, little Isaac, my little one-year-old son. The other day he was cranky and needy. You know how little guys get. Sometimes 19-year-olds get that way as well. 37-year-olds too. But anyway. So I saw that. I saw him getting kind of needy. And so I came up to him. And I picked him up and came underneath him. and lifted him up onto my shoulders. And I held him up there. And pretty soon he started laughing and squealing with delight. The truth is, I put him up there because I love it when he's up there. I delight in this little guy. There's nothing I'd rather do. His job in life is to rest secure, Knowing that his dad loves him like that. Our job in life is to rest secure. Knowing that our Abba loves us like that. That's the only way we're going to come underneath in order to lift others up. It's the only way. We need to submit to a love that is perfect. Two questions for you to think about as we close. These are on the message tool as well if you want to go back to these. it'll be online tomorrow about noon but the question first question is this what is stopping you from submitting to the perfect love that God has for you coming underneath you and lifting you up so that you can rest secure on his shoulders what's stopping you you might have a word that jumps to your mind immediately pressure or stress or fear of failure or shame what's stopping you the second question is this are you willing to start that journey up to God's shoulders now are you willing to start that journey up to the position of God's shoulders resting secure there now Joel's gonna sing this song that he wrote for this serve us and I think it's absolutely beautiful. He's going to sing it just as a way to give you a little bit of space to wrestle through those questions. What's stopping you from submitting to the perfect love that God has for you? And are you willing to start that journey now? Joel. Sons of Adam, daughters be. Seems like we've all forgotten the way it used to be. You know in the beginning it was not like this. Where we stand in our silence Or betrayed with the kiss How do we get back? How do we get back? Can we learn to trust after the cut? Will we let others love us and let them lift us up? Can we give up on winning and the need to be right? Can we fight for each other? And end this long, long night. How do we get back? How do we get back? Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh Sons of Adam Daughters be Do you know what you're made for? Do you even believe That life could be different That love's still gonna win Will you move toward each other And let one another in I want to invite you to stand for the benediction. may you find yourself seated in between the shoulders of God resting secure in a love that makes winning seem irrelevant amen amen go in peace Thank you.
