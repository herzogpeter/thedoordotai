Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Let's pray as we go to the Word. For words of life to call out life, I pray. that utterance may be given to me, says the Apostle Paul, I make it my prayer, that utterance may be given me in the opening of my mouth that I might make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel. And I ask that in Jesus' name. Amen. Colossians 3.16 says this. Let the words of Christ dwell in you richly with all wisdom. Here's how. Teaching and admonishing one another with songs and hymns and spiritual songs, the result of which is joy. The kind of joy that makes you want to sing. Singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God. If you have your Bibles, open them with me to Colossians chapter 3. Picking up our study in that 16th verse that I just read, where we find the Apostle Paul kind of in the middle of his letter to this newly formed, fledgling community of faith that had come to be known as the church in Colossae, because that's where these people lived, Colossae, which as most of you know, if you've been with us these several months in our study of the book of Colossians, was a pretty frightening place to live. Situated as it was, that is Colossae, in the shadow of Rome, under the rule and reign of Rome, which was a frightening place to be, because if you got in the way of Rome, you just got bowled over, you got bulldozed. They called it the Pax Romano. Remember that? Talked about that a lot, especially in the early days of this text. The Pax Romano was called the Peace of Rome. And Caesar was declared the prince of all peace. Our hope for peace was Rome, but the way that Rome got peace was to bulldoze everybody who disagreed with them. And as soon as all of the dissident voices were gone and killed, often nailed to a cross, they now had their peace. So it was a frightening place to live, Colossae was, but also a very confusing place to live because there were lots of ideas about who God is. Indeed, there were a lot of alternatives because there were a lot of ideas that there were many, many different kinds of gods. So it wasn't just a frightening place. It was a confusing place with lots of ideas about who God is and how life works, kind of like where we live today, which is actually an important thing to remember when we're studying these books of the Bible because the books of the Bible that we study, particularly the book of Colossians being no different than the others, is not just a random collection of religious precepts, of do's and don'ts, to kind of make people behave or act a little more religious. It has nothing to do with that because its real intent, the writing of these letters, the real intent was to, in a variety of ways, help the people of God in general with all of the scriptures. But this particular epistle as well, the fledgling community of faith in Colossae in particular, to navigate their lives. In the context of a culture that was both religiously and secularly very confusing and sometimes even frightening because the song that most people were singing in Colossae when this letter was written was a song that went kind of like this and don't be scared, I'm not going to sing it. It just went like this. Caesar is Lord. Lady Gaga is Lord. But we're singing, this little group of people in this pretty scary place, we're singing a different song. We're singing this song, Jesus is Lord, which is a very different song. But it's a song they love to sing. It was a name they love to tell. But sometimes that name, in the context of Colossae, and it's the same with us today, that name and that song that Jesus is Lord is hard to hear. In the mix of all the other voices and all the other songs and the noise of the culture, both religiously and secularly. So the question for the Colossians is the same question for us. It's this, how do we navigate all this? How do we find our way in the context of a culture, both religious culture and secular culture that stirs up often such confusion and sometimes even fear, but beyond just finding our way. Finding our way kind of is like, oh my gosh, it's going to blow up. I hope we don't step in a hole or on a landmine someplace. Beyond just kind of finding our way in what feels like the dark, here's another question. How do we step into our destiny? How do we become and remain? Who God's called us to be in the world, and he's called us to be salt and light, in the middle of Colossae, under the shadow of Rome. I don't care how frightening. I don't care how confusing. So how do we step up into that? Here's how. Beginning in verse 12 of Colossians 3, it's not the only answer, but I'm just trying to stick in with the flow of where we've been. Here's how. Don't worry about the culture and don't even confront the culture. Become a different kind of person. Start there, said Paul, Colossians 3, verse 12, by putting on a heart of compassion and kindness and humility and love because that certainly speaks to a different kind of people, a different kind of kingdom. And if you authentically are living that way, you might be surprised the difference that it might make. And then he goes on to say, In the text that Steve dealt with a couple weeks ago for a couple weeks himself, let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, not the peace of Rome, the Pax Romano. Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, he says in verse 15, because the kind of peace that comes from Christ, not Caesar, is a different kind of peace. And it's the kind of peace to which we have been called in one body. And be thankful, he said, all of which brings us to this next thing. that Paul says in verse 16 is absolutely central, critical and necessary for a community of faith that's trying to navigate their lives in the context of a culture that is religiously and secularly quite confusing and sometimes even frightening. Here's what you need to do. You need to not just let the peace of Christ rule in your heart. You need to let the word of Christ, you need to let the word of Christ richly dwell within you with all wisdom. Here's how teaching. An admonishing one of the psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God. Why? Here's why. Because we live in a world, as did the Colossians, where there are many different voices speaking many different words, singing many different songs about life and how to live it, about God and what he's like. Therefore, says Paul, Colossians 3.16, because all that is true, it's even more important than maybe you knew that we become and then remain the kind of people as a community where we, not just individually, but as a community, as a church, that we are marked by this thing, that we are a people who are letting the words of Christ reveal to us in the word of God, find a place in us, richly dwell in us. That word dwell is the Greek word oikos, which means house. to let the words of Christ settle down and be at home. Like there's no more fight in us relative to the things that are spoken to us of the words of Christ and the word of God, teaching and admonishing one another. There's kind of an energy there that says, this is kind of what we're to be about, teaching and admonishing one another. Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, which combines the word and the worship, which is fascinating to me, all of which helps us navigate our lives in the context of a culture, both religiously and secularly, that's very confusing and sometimes even frightening. So what I want to talk about today is how this word of Christ, the words of Christ, revealed to us in the word of God, can indeed richly dwell, not just in us as individuals, though that is very important, how it dwells in us individually. What I want to talk about today is how the words of Jesus need to dwell in the context of a community, how they need to dwell in us as a church, which might sound kind of weird to you. I hope I can explain it well. And my question out of that is, how does that happen? How can you create the kind of environment in a church where the word of Christ, the word of God, richly dwells in it? What does that look like? What might that take for the words of Christ to literally become, and here's this word we've been throwing around a lot lately, become part of our DNA, become part of what we call the embedded life of the Spirit among people so that the words of Christ revealed in the Word of God, so the Word of God itself becomes central to how we think and how we live and how we love as a community that's helping us as a community navigate our lives in the context of a culture, both religiously and secularly, that is often quite confusing and sometimes even scary. Well, I think there are many components to what it takes to make that kind of thing a reality, the first thing that comes to my mind, because it's in the text, is teaching. Teaching and admonishing one another. Let these things dwell in you. How? Teaching and admonishing one another. And he writes in his commentary on the book of Colossians, says it this way, and I'm quoting him here, that for the word of Christ to dwell richly, not just in individuals, but in the context of a community, like Colossae, or like our church, Church of the Open Door, the church needs to be stocked, he says, with good teaching, like a palace filled with treasure. It's just like central to who you are and what you do, which is why the apostle Paul in Ephesians chapter 411 says this, just makes it very clear, that one of the gifts that God has given to the churches are people, particularly apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, who are there for the purpose of equipping the people of God with the words of Jesus, with the word of God, so that they can, before be equipped, no longer tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine, because we live in a very confusing culture, and there's lots of wind blowing. So what do we know? What comes to me out of that, I really do believe that historically God has given, and you could probably mark this historically, that God has given to the churches in every age, in every generation, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, to teach. I sometimes wonder if the ones that, all of them that God has called, I wonder sometimes if they've all stepped up to that call, because you sometimes wonder, where are they? I don't know if you ever do that, but I sometimes do that, because the teaching can't just be this, like, here's some information for you. This teaching of the words of Jesus need to be driven by a belief, and I think it needs to be a passionate belief that the words of Jesus revealed in the word of God really are words of life. So if you don't believe they're words of life, you won't spend much time examining them. So this teaching needs to be driven by a belief. What I I think it's a passionate belief that the words of Jesus revealed in the word of God really are living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword. There is no tool you have that is more effective at helping you navigate life than this. You'd have to really believe that the words of Jesus really are the food we need. People like Jeremiah had that. He said things like this, Jeremiah the prophet, Thy words were found, and I did eat them. Weird. And they were to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart. couldn't get enough. 1 Peter 2.2 says this, like newborn babes long for the pure milk of the word that by it they may grow, but the teaching also has to be, according to the text, with all wisdom. But the word of Christ, reeled in the word of God, richly dwell in you with all wisdom, which creates a problem. Who has that? Because not all do. And if you don't have it, wisdom, How do you get it? Particularly in dealing with the words of Jesus and explaining them to people. Well, N.T. Wright again suggests this, and I find this pretty helpful and pretty clear. He says this, that if the words we need to preach and teach, not just from the pulpit, but among each other, are in fact the words of Christ, let the word of Christ dwell in you richly. And if Christ is himself the embodiment of wisdom, then the way to wisdom, at least an important way, one important way, it's not the only way to wisdom, But one important way is to become familiar with, duh, preoccupied with, to be absorbed with the words of Christ that are revealed to us in the word of God. So I would expand it beyond just the words of Christ, the word of God, which is precisely, by the way, what the apostle Paul says to this young man in the ministry named Timothy, who he was mentoring, when he, that is Timothy, was very young. And just starting out in ministry, Timothy, when he was just starting out as a very young person, in this kingdom endeavor. It's a fascinating story. He was the pastor of the church in Ephesus. The church of Ephesus was begun by the apostle Paul. Paul stayed in Ephesus longer than he did in any other church. He was there three years. He started the church. It exploded in a positive way. It turned the whole place upside down. You might remember the story of Ephesus when Paul went there and the thousands were saved. So when Timothy comes on the scene, the church is numbering about 3,000 people. Kind of a mega church in the first century. But he's in way over his head. I mean, I just have some advice. You know, following a guy like Paul is not an easy thing to do. You need to follow a loser. That was supposed to be funny. You know, so all the people are going, great, we love you. You're an idiot, but he was worse. So it's really tough to follow Paul. And he's young, and he doesn't know what to do. He doesn't know where to start. He's got one thing going for him. Paul is his mentor. So in asking, what do I do? Paul says, here's where you start. This isn't the only thing you need to do, Timothy, but this is where you start, especially at the beginning. 2 Timothy 2.15, I want you to study. That's not very jazzy. That's not very kind of cool. No, no, shut up, Timothy. I want you to study, to show yourself, 2 Timothy 2.15, to show yourself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed. What do you mean, shame? Embarrassed. You don't need to be, but you're gonna have to study. If you hope to rightly divide, rightly dividing the word of truth, if you hope to rightly divide the word of truth, and not everybody can, but you know why? Because sometimes I don't say, I want you to study. Not very jazzy. I want you to become really familiar with the words of Jesus revealed in the word of God. Indeed, says Paul in 1 Timothy 4.13. Let me keep it simple for you, young man. And this is especially important when you're young, when you're starting out. Here's my advice. Until I come, there are many things you need to do in this huge church you're in, Timothy. But just do this one thing. Until I come, give attention, 1 Timothy 4.13, to the public reading of Scripture, not very jazzy, to exhortation and to teaching. In fact, I want you to take pains with these things, be absorbed with these things. As you do this, as you're absorbed in the words of Jesus and studying them so you can rightly divide them, Another thing will happen. Your personal progress will become evident to all. Why? How? Here's why. Here's how. Because as you're absorbed in these things, the words of Jesus revealed in the word of God, the word you're absorbed in will begin to richly dwell in you, providing wisdom for you that as a young person you don't have right now. So pay a close attention to yourself and to your teaching, he says in verse 16. In other words, keep your eye on the ball, Timothy, Because there's lots of things you could get involved in, lots of things you could do, lots of things you could give your attention to, and they're really important things, and you need to get to them eventually, but don't get distracted. Instead, especially at the beginning, persevere in these things. Because as you do, both you and those who hear you will grow. You will literally be saved, it says up there, so be absorbed in this, especially when you're young. this thing between Paul and Timothy this is where you start study, be obsessed with these things, the words of Jesus is fascinating to me and it's personal for me for a number of reasons one reason is is this that when I read these verses what Paul says to Timothy as I was going through it this week and kind of getting back in this text that for years has been important to me I don't hear Paul's voice I hear my dads Who said these kinds of things to me over and over again Especially when I was young And when I was young I believed them And partly I believed them because I saw the effect of studying the word of God And becoming absorbed in the words of Jesus that were revealed in the word of God And doing that kind of work I saw the effect it had on him And I saw the effect it had on the church that he pastored Which is why in the early days of my ministry This kind of thing was magnetic north to me my primary paradigm for what I was to do, for how I was to do it, for how you grow a church. Because the fact is this, I don't know. I don't know how to grow a church. I don't know how to build a ministry. I mean, where do you start? I'm 23. I came to Open Door when I was 27. You mostly know that story. But I pastored a church while I was going to seminary, a little tiny church in Chicago, and I started at 23. I'm 23. Are you kidding? What do I know? I'm serious. I'm 23. I have some brilliant things for you. No, I don't. Like, shut up. I don't. So what do I know? What do I say? What do I have? What should our vision be as a church? I remember when I first came to this church, there was a vision in our denomination. And we were supposed to all pick it up. It was 1,000 more by 94. Nothing wrong with that. 1,000 more by 94. Okay, okay. Which said to me, get big. Okay, how do you do that? Be smart. Be innovative. Be cool. Whatever. Be funny. I am all that. Ah. Ah. But I mean, who would buy a vision? No, no, yeah, I want to get big. It would be nice if people came. I like that a lot. But what if our vision wasn't to get big? What if our vision was to create an environment where the words of Jesus, the word of Christ, could richly dwell among us with wisdom? Yeah. That was huge. But how do you do that? How do you do that? teach with all wisdom. In the early days of ministry here, the person, as it relates to the story between Paul and Timothy, that I identified with most was Timothy because I was young in the early days. But in these days, you guys, I find myself, again, kind of immersed in those verses that I haven't been for a very long time, 1 and 2 Timothy. I find myself identifying more with Paul. and it's not because I'm some kind of apostle. It's because of the place I stand with you now, 30 years later, in this church at my age, being called, I believe, to pass on an inheritance, one that really matters to the next generation. So how do you do it? See, we still have the same question. How do you do it? What do we have? Where do we start? And with those questions, the story of Timothy and Paul reemerges to me at a personal level with a fresh kind of urgency because the problem Paul and Timothy were facing relative to ministry in their culture, both religiously and secularly, that was very confusing and sometimes frightening, was this, that much like us, they lived, again, in a confusing and frightening time, where according to 2 Timothy 3.13, this is fascinating. He was kind of describing what they're going through. According to 2 Timothy 3.13, evil men and impostors grow from bad to worse. We're growing from bad to worse. So however bad it is right now, Timothy, it's getting worse. Deceiving and themselves being deceived. So when people are deceived and then they're deceiving, who do you trust? How do you know? How can you tell? Because some of those imposters who were themselves deceived were in the church. If you read that text, it becomes very clear. Holding to a form of godliness, it says in verse 5, though they were denying the power therein, they were ever learning. They're very bright, it says in verse 7. But they were never coming to the truth. They just keep going round and round in circles theologically, which is very confusing if you've ever been around that. But beyond that stuff in the church, the culture itself was being marked more and more. I'm still talking about Colossae, or not Colossae, Ephesians now. This is where Timothy and Paul were talking. The culture was being marked more and more by people who, according to 2 Timothy 3, 2, were lovers of self. Can you believe that? You never heard of that. Lovers of money. They were boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient, ungrateful, unholy, unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of good, treacherous, reckless, conceited lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God. I could go on. I think the list is long enough. You get the picture. What do you do? It's really confusing. Actually quite scary, especially if you're Timothy. I've never done this before. Paul, where do I start? Paul says, start at the beginning. Remember where you started. Remember your roots. Remember the faith, he says to Timothy. And where it came from, 1 Timothy 1, verse 5. Fabulous, fabulous thing Paul's saying to Timothy. I remember, I'm mindful, he says to Timothy, of your sincere faith. But then he says this, and how it first dwelt, I love this. This is about roots. This is about DNA, of how it first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and then your mother Eunice and now it is in you as well. I see it. So when your head is spinning, Timothy, out of control, and when it looks like the culture is spinning out of control, remember who you are and where you're from. Remember the faith and that it didn't start with you. Remember that in the context of a culture where everything feels like this, there is something that has some root to it, and it is your faith. It goes back a while. And if you personally don't have a Eunice or a Lois, someone in your family, there is a rootedness in other people's faith. It's one of the reasons you don't forsake your assembling together, because it's what encourages us. Remember who you are. Remember also this, he says, 2 Timothy 3, 14. And again, this becomes even more urgent when the culture is confusing and sometimes even scary. Remember also and continue on the things that you've learned and become convinced of. Knowing from whom you learned them. And that from childhood you have known the what? The sacred writings. The words of Jesus revealed in the word of God. Get this. The sacred writings which are able to, what does it say? Give you the what? Wisdom. Remember Colossians 3.16? The word of Christ is richly dwelling you with all wisdom. Where does the wisdom come from? Study, therefore. Be absorbed in these things. So he's able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith that is in Christ Jesus, because all scripture is inspired by God, because they're the words of God, they're the words of Christ, and they're profitable. Not everybody knows that, but they are, if you spend the time in it. They're profitable for teaching, reproof, correction, for training in righteousness, that the people of God may be thoroughly furnished. In other words, it has everything you need, if you rightly divide it, fully equipped for every good work. Therefore, he says to 2 Timothy 4.2, here's what I want you to do, Timothy, especially when you're young, especially then. Keep it simple. Start with this, preach the word. It's in the pulpit. Just be absorbed with this. Be ready in season and out of season, which means do it when you're hot and when you're not. In season and out of season is actually more picturesque and more meaningful, evocative than that. To be in season means to be preaching the words of Jesus when you're bearing fruit. There are seasons where you harvest. That's fun. Preach it then. And seasons when you plow. Not fun. It's hot and dirty and you're plowing up the field and it doesn't look like there's any life. In fact, after you plowed it, it looks worse than when you began. Preach then too. He says, indeed, chapter 4, verse 1, Paul makes it real clear that this is not a friendly suggestion. When he says, Timothy, I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Jesus Christ, who is the judge of the living and the dead, and by his appearing and by his kingdom, preach the word. The word of Christ, the words of Christ, revealed in the word of God, because when you do, in a community, like a church, it has the possibility, doesn't always happen, but it has the possibility to create an environment where the very words of God can begin to richly dwell with all wisdom in the context of a community, in the context of ordinary people, just like you and just like me and just like us. And all of that stuff is interesting to me for a number of reasons. But one is because just about a year ago this time, we began a visioning process here at Open Door. I talked to you about it in the announcement just a few moments ago, to try and discern what God is calling us to in this next chapter of our church's life. And ironically, the first step, under the leadership of Kristen Evenson, Steve Weins was part of this, Vicki Degner, Terry Steinmeier, the elder board, and myself, was to think back and remember, what is the DNA here? What's the embedded life? And out of that kind of question, what is the embedded life? What are the things the Spirit of God has spoken to us and done among us, came this word inheritance, because whatever that is, is the inheritance we're gonna give to the next generation, not interested in anything else, which is interesting because that's what Paul said. Remember, go back and remember the DNA. That's what Paul said to Timothy. Go back and remember the faith, where it came from. Grandmother, mother, now it's in you. And out of that remembering came a fresh articulation of our mission, vision, and values as a church because what we remembered, among other things, were these things that we're a people of the Spirit, that we are a people of the power of the Spirit, the gifts of the Spirit, dependent on that to break the power of strongholds in people's lives. And without the power of the Spirit, we can have all sorts of teaching, all sorts of stuff, really nice. But if we aren't tapping into the power of the Spirit to set people free, there's no kingdom thing happening. Everybody might feel good, but we are a people of the Spirit. We are a people of the kingdom. We are a people of grace. But the first we identified, we're gonna go more into this, I think, at the annual meeting, the first that we identified was this, that we are a people of the book here at Open Door. And any way that we've forgotten that, we need to remember that because it's in the book that we can find the words of Christ, the words of God that we so desperately need, especially now as we're trying to navigate our lives in the context of a culture that is both religiously and secularly very confusing and sometimes frightening. So more than ever, you better be rooted in something. it's funny uh last week um brad jackson spoke um i love brad and his word about the kingdom and his kingdom and god's kingdom i just love it and so grateful to him for his work but he's as he began to talk you remember this he was joking about us being in colossians and how he predicts and we'll see that we'll be done with colossians in 2013 remember that i don't know if i've ever I don't have ever done a sermon that talked this clearly about why we do this. Like verse by verse, this is why we spend maybe a year in Colossians 3. Because when you get down into it and you really examine it and you wonder where else it's going and you listen to the text and you listen to the Spirit and you absorb yourself in the words of Jesus, it creates this possibility where those words might richly dwell among us. That's just this thought we had and walk away. You sit in it. And it's why when we were trying to examine and try to understand the ways of our rabbi Jesus, we spent three years trying to figure out his ways. Remember that, the way of the rabbi? And we studied the law that Jesus loved and the Ten Commandments, and we saw him as he sat on the side of a hill with these teenage guys and didn't talk to them about religion. He talked to them about life. Let's talk about your anger. You know, 18-year-old boys don't have much trouble with that, do they? So let's talk about your anger. Let's talk about sex. Remember that was the next thing. let's talk about lusts another thing that 18 year old boys don't struggle with much so it's pretty irrelevant teaching we spend a lot of time in that stuff and one of the reasons you do is because it creates a possibility it doesn't always happen but it creates a possibility where those words of Jesus can begin to richly dwell in us with all wisdom and it's why some of you actually remember and have been changed by the things you've learned in the book of Colossians that the gospel of the kingdom and you may not even think of this when you think of this but as I say this you go, yeah, no, that really has come to me, that the gospel of the kingdom is not just about being saved. The gospel of the kingdom, Steve Wien started this in chapter two, it's about coming to life, and that the work of the spirit and the gospel of the kingdom is actually about becoming more and more and more alive, and so as those, chapter three, verse one, who have indeed come alive in Christ, keep seeking those things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God, which sounds very ethereal, but actually what it means is, If you want to come fully alive, having been made alive in Christ, you need to start standing up straight into those things that give life and those things that are above. And we began to talk, you might remember, of those things to which we're bent, trying to get life from sex or alcohol or drugs or whatever, even our job, getting life from things down here. And we talked about how we need to let go of those things and stand up straight. This is all Colossians 3. And then we even talked about how sometimes when you wake up and realize I'm embracing things that can't give life and want to stand up straight. The things that we bound ourselves to have now bound themselves to us, so we need the power of the Spirit to cut the cord and set us free, and we experienced what we called, about a year ago, kind of a revival here. I don't know if you remember that, but all of that is what it looks like when the words of Jesus start richly dwelling. Some of you who've been at Open Door for maybe a little longer would have other thoughts and ways that you just, you don't even think about it anymore because it's just become the way you think. It's just become the way you live and love because you kind of know that the blessed ones really are the broken ones. Remember that? Blessed are the poor in spirit. And that's a really important word of Jesus that we need to know because in a religious culture that's very confusing, the religious culture that many of us came from, the blessed ones were the polished ones, the ones who looked good and knew how and we're all put together and never made a mistake. And then we hear the words of Jesus that helps us navigate all that baloney because he says it isn't true. The blessed ones in the kingdom of God are the broken ones who recognize they can't help themselves and the ones who realize they can't help themselves come up hungry for grace and power that they know they don't have. And there's the kingdom. Yep. I mean, I could go on. I think of blessed are those who mourn. I would change the DNA of our church. Mourning doesn't mean blessed are the bummed, happy are the sad. Mourning means to get out here, what's really going on in here. Blessed are those who quit pretending, and some of you did. And when you did, it changed your life, and that's what it looks like when the words of Christ richly dwell with wisdom. And so we preach and teach. But it's not just with preaching.
