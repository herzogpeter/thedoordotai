for reasons that will soon become apparent, we are changing the order of things a bit this morning, bringing the word before the worship. And as I said, you'll understand that in a few moments why. I'd like to pray as we go to the ministry of the word. My prayer is this, Father. that the power of your spirit would fall so that your people might be able to rise and to stand up into the fullness of who we are in your son Jesus. Pray that in Jesus' name. Amen. If you've been with us the last couple of weeks in our dealings with the story of David and Bathsheba, you know that they've been quite extraordinary, actually, these weeks. Culminating last week where, at my invitation, many of you, what actually looked like most of you, left your seats at the end of the service, came down to the front, where we corporately and publicly renounced, repented of, and asked God to deliver us from a spirit of passivity. a spirit we saw embodied in David as we were studying 1st, 2nd Samuel in the context of his relationship with his son Absalom and I was careful to point out that I wasn't just talking about an attitude of passivity I was talking about a spirit, a principality and a power now if you weren't here last week then what I'm saying this week about last week has got to sound a little weird I mean really think about it to corporately publicly renounce and ask to be delivered from a spirit of whatever is weird but actually it's weirder than you know because for the last couple of weeks we have been asking God to help us identify, expose renounce, repent of and ask to be delivered from two principalities I'm not talking about attitudes I'm talking about spirits, powers, if you will. The first, actually, was this spirit of control. He called it a usurping spirit as embodied for us in Absalom, who, according to 2 Samuel 15, verse 2, used to rise up early and stand beside the way to the gates. With open arms and slippery words, he sympathized with whoever came by the gates wanting to get to David, the king, with a grievance of any kind. He would intercept them and sympathize. He would understand. Your claims are right and good, he'd said in verse 3. You've been misunderstood, but no one will listen to you. Certainly not the king. He doesn't care about you. But if I were king, things would be different. There would be justice. We said it this way, that Absalom was operating under or with or in cooperation with a usurping spirit. He was usurping by means of manipulation. In other words, he wasn't direct. People who are operating with this spirit or by means of this are not direct. It was by the gate. It was behind the scenes with a pretense of concern for the purpose of control. If that's the only part of the story we knew, it would all be very clear if we're just looking at Absalom, who the good guy is and who the bad guy is. David is the good guy. Absalom is the bad guy, the demonized guy. David is the victim. Absalom is the perpetrator. But what we've been discovering over the last couple of weeks is this. That David played a part in Absalom's rebellion. And the part he played was this. He was passive in his role with his son. He was silent when he should have been speaking. He was uninvolved when he should have been involved. He was disengaged when he needed to enter in. He was inaccessible when his son desperately needed to see his face and hear his voice. In three particular instances, we saw this passivity played out in the impact it had on Absalom. When Amnon raped Tamar, Absalom's sister, David, was very angry, but he did what? Nothing. When Absalom was in exile and needed to be pursued by his father, David stayed in Jerusalem. The Bible says he mourned over Absalom every day. And he longed to go out to him and bring him back, but he never did. And when Absalom finally did return to Jerusalem, David refused to see him. He refused to speak to him when Absalom desperately needed to see the face of his father, to hear the voice of his father, thereby creating in Absalom what we've been referring to as a father hunger, what Richard Rohr calls a vacuum in Absalom's soul, and into that vacuum demons had rushed. This passive spirit, we said, created an environment where a usurping spirit could be born, if you will, could grow and then flourish. We saw the same thing in Jezebel and Ahab. I kind of saw these things as a parallel and wanted to see this because, you know, you see David and Absalom and it looks just kind of like a masculine thing or a male problem. And in Jezebel, we kind of see a feminine manifestation of the same thing that Absalom was doing. She was a usurper. She was usurping by means of manipulation for the purpose of control. I told you last week, her means of manipulation was generally sexual, but sex was never the point. The point was always control. And the reason Jezebel was able to do what she did was primarily because Ahab was what? Passive. In Absalom, David's passivity created a wound. Thus, the usurping spirit was born in Jezebel. Ahab's passivity granted permission so the sin could go on unabated. So it is this passive spirit is something that we've been taking very seriously and speaking about in very serious terms. Because if we don't change the environment within which this usurping spirit grows, then the Absaloms and Jezebels of the world will flourish unabated even among us. and that is why last week as best we could we began to identify expose repent of and renounce this spirit of passivity and it was amazing what we did last week you came I prayed and at the end of the time of prayer with all of you gathered here you began to speak out words of truth and as we did that something stirred I'm pretty convinced most of you could feel a stirring of some kind in many ways I think that something very deep was being stirred but it wasn't all fun what was being stirred I don't know if you came aware of that or experienced that it didn't all feel good see some of what was stirred and it ought to be something we understand and know if you're actually confronting something as big as I think it was you're going to stir some things that are a little scary if we really did last week confront not just an attitude or something we'd like to get better at but if we really were corporately confronting a principality that has had a stronghold in this church and I identified it that way last week do you think that if it had been a stronghold here and we have one little session where we go we don't want you anymore that it would leave without a fight? Or wouldn't try to come back as if to test resolve? Now, here's the deal. And by the way, this is something we need to, as God is calling us to different levels all the time, one of the things we're going to have to become aware of, and it's not just going to be a nice series of sermons, so we have some more information about spiritual warfare, we are going to be desperately needy. You've got to tell us how to do this war thing. Why? Because you've begun to step into things where the enemy doesn't just walk away and go, okay, I'll give you that. we entered into warfare last night Sunday it felt great it felt great to me passive spirits broken God has saved today do you remember Elijah 1 Kings 19 first thing you know about Elijah is this here he is confronting and defeating the prophets of Baal hmm he kicks some tail prophets of Baal kicks some tail I mean, that was rhyming. It was rhyming. And I'm going to quit now. Thank you very much. He routed them. The power of God was on him. The fire of God fell. The sacrifice, the altar was burned up. The prophets of Baal were seen to be absolutely impotent. Most of them died. Elijah had a really good day. The people of God went going, hey, church was good today. Jezebel heard, 1 Kings 19. same Jezebel I've been talking about, what Elijah had done was incensed by that and said to Elijah through Ahab, who is her little messenger boy, in effect this, Elijah, you're going to pay for that. And you know what Elijah did? He stood in the same authority and power that he had on Sunday when he defeated the prophets of Baal. How many of you know the story? How many of you know he didn't do that. You know what he did? You know what he did? He did what I would have done. He did what you sometimes do. He got really afraid. Day after, day after. And he ran. The Bible says he ran into the wilderness, sat up under a juniper tree, and asked God, just let me die. What a baby. I never say that. Here's what I say. Just let me sell cars. I'll just sell cars. I don't want to do it. I would never do what he did, though. I alone am left. I am the only one. He starts telling God. He starts telling God. He says, I've been so zealous for you, and now it is Jezebel. Okay. Very interesting if you read the story how God had, you know what? God loves Elijah. God loved him. Was pleased with him. But you know what? If you read 1 Kings 19 and you see him under the juniper tree, God does not coddle him there. He does not poor baby. Oh, you're so bad, Elijah. You got it so rough. He doesn't poor baby him. You know what he does? He confronts him and firmly but gently says, Elijah, arise and eat. Well, eventually, Elijah did. Eventually, you do. Eventually, I do. The point I'm trying to make is, when you confront principalities, you're not just coming to church to sing some songs and hear a talk. You've entered into war. And it's real, and sometimes it's scary. Some of what got stirred was scary. Some of what got stirred last week was silly. Now, I'm not sure silly is exactly the word. But when you call people out of passivity, and you get as big as we got last week, and I think it was appropriate to get as big as we got last week about this, a lot of warrior energy kind of goes, yeah, yeah. It's stirred up, and that's a good thing. But one of the things we've been saying through this whole series is we've been talking about warriors and kings and all the typology, the archetypes that those things speak to, is this, that a warrior who is not in submission to a king is a loose cannon. There were some things stirred last week. There was some loose cannon stuff stirred last week. And again, it's not bad. You just need to notice. It's just like, I'm not going to be passive anymore. I'm going to do this, and I'm going to do that, and I'm going to fix them, and I'm going to fix them today, and I'm going to go over there right now and a lot of misdirected, well-intended energy that's going to win the world today. A lot of demanding came, rose, got stirred up. What do you mean demanding? It sounds like this. God told me I'm to do this ministry and you need to let me. Okay. Okay. Jack Quick, who's one of the leaders in our men's ministry, came up to me after one of the services. He's just a great, encouraging guy. Comes up a lot and just gives me a word at the end sometimes. And came up after me and says, Dave, when you're preaching this sermon, it's almost like I could hear the men of our church pulling out their sword. And I thought, man, I could too. That's a good thing. I hope that happened. That's a good thing. But you know what happens? You pull out your sword, and that's a good thing. Bless you. Pull out your sword. And then you look at your sword and you go, what are you supposed to do with this? it's out there I'd really like to do some good with this but I could probably do some I don't know damage with this and that's where you need a king see pulling out your sword is not a bad thing but here's a word for you slow down not all of you because some of you need to speed up just apply this where it needs to go learn to submit learn to submit. Oh, that's a popular word. You know what? Anybody who's not under authority has no authority. Let me just speak something in this church. Anybody here in our church who is not under authority, you have no authority here. None. That's how it works in the kingdom. Take some small steps of obedience. See, maybe confronting your whole family today isn't a good idea. You're laughing because you did that, didn't you? Yeah, that's why you're laughing. I love that scene in the movie, The Mask of Zorro. The young understudy Zorro, the young Zorro, sees the enemy. He's right there. He pulls out his sword, rushes in to get him, and the old Zorro in the movie intercepts the young guy, knocks him down, beats the living daylights out of him. The young guy is sitting there reeling and asks, what are you doing? I was confronting the enemy. I was going to save the day. The old Zorro looks at him and says, yeah, yeah, okay. And I'm quite sure you would have fought bravely. You really would. You have a good heart. Pulling your sword's a good thing. But you would have died quickly. And at that moment in the movie, this young Zorro became submissive to the good king, if you will. And he entered into a time of training and discipline. And that time of training and discipline wasn't any fun. He kind of got knocked around. He got humiliated once in a while. The young Zorro kind of always had this feeling, you're trying to hold me back. You're trying to keep me from doing my destiny. When in fact, he was calling him to his destiny. But he needed to learn some discipline and some disciplines. Because the truth is, all discipline does not feel joyful, but sorrowful, but afterwards, brings the fruit of righteousness. A lot of stuff got stirred up last week. as we came against what I think was a principality. Didn't all feel good. But I want to tell you something else. A lot of it was really, a lot of it, most of it was really, really good. In fact, even some of the stuff I just said didn't feel good, even that was good. As we corporately came together last week, and as best we could, identified, exposed, repented of, renounced, and renounced the spirit of passivity, Something was not only stirred, but something began to rise. I know that some of you could feel something begin to rise. You couldn't necessarily even put your finger on it. You couldn't even put words on it. But something began to rise. For some of you, it was faith. For some of you, it was hope. You had lost hope. And it just began, maybe there is hope. And for some of you, what rose in you was courage, because you had lost courage. It wasn't just stirred, it began to rise as we corporately began to look up and see more, as we began to corporately declare not only what is real, but what is more real. Remember that? There was a teaching I brought last week that said there are things that are in fact true, but if we're going to live life in the kingdom of God and keep on making advances and grow in our life, We also need to understand, and if we're going to break free from the spirit of passivity, we also need to understand that there are things that are more true. Example, you're a sinner. That's true. You know what's more true? You're forgiven. You're redeemed. In him, we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins according to the riches of his grace. You know what else is true? It's true that you have wounds, and so do I. It's true that you've been hurt, and so have I. It's true that sometimes we feel weak and really afraid. All of that is true. You know what's more true? That even in the middle of our fear, God is with us. God is for us. And if God is for us, says Romans 8, who can be against us? So right in the middle of our fear and our feelings of weakness, here is the truth. Here is the more real truth. We overwhelmingly conquer through him who loved us. And nothing, absolutely nothing can separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Not our sin, not our hurt, not our wound, not our weakness, not our fear. So arise and eat, says the Lord. And as we began to declare those things last week, something began to stir. something began to rise of faith, of hope, of courage, as passivity was beginning to lose its grip on us. You didn't know that that's what was happening, but that's what was happening, not necessarily without a fight. Remember David? I had a theory about him I shared with you last week as to why he had become so passive at this particular time in his life. We certainly didn't see this passivity earlier in his life. Why now? My theory was this, that because of his own sin, particularly with Bathsheba, his adultery, and Uriah, her husband, the manipulative way that he got him murdered, he had lost, because of that, what I call moral authority in his own home. Sure, he confessed his sin. Sure, he repented and was forgiven by God. But he was not living, in my opinion in that forgiveness as he was not living in that forgiveness as his ultimate truth as being what was most true about him so when it came time for David to stand up confront Amnon his son and hold him accountable for his damnable deed of raping his sister he was passive when it came time for David to rise up to defend the honor of his devastated daughter He didn't do that. He stayed passive. When it came time for him then also to shepherd the heart of his son Absalom, who desperately needed to know, Dad, how do you use strength in a rightly ordered way to bring justice, to make right what is wrong? How do you do that, Dad? Show me how to do that. When Absalom needed him the most, his father was passive. Because sin had been allowed to do what sin does. And what sin does, among other things, is this. It gives the accuser of your soul something to accuse you about that's true. See, when David heard that Amnon raped Tamar, the Bible says he became very angry. And then he heard a voice whispered in his ear, whispered in his spirit. David, who do you think you are to confront Amnon? How on earth do you think you have any right, authority, to confront him? You're no better than him. Well, sure, you did technically rape Bathsheba. I know that. But really, what choice did Bathsheba have? You're the king. Kings take what they want. That's what you did. You just took what you wanted. That's just what Amnon did. Sure, you're forgiven. And go ahead, feel good about that. But if you begin to act as though you actually are forgiven, It's going to look like you didn't take your sin very seriously. So here's what you should do. Sit down. Shut up. Do nothing. Stay what? Passive. And he did. Remember last week we talked about how this passive spirit can sometimes disguise itself as humility or remorse. I want to tell you, it's not humility or remorse. It's unbelief. you know I've been talking about David and my theory about him around his not stepping into the fullness of his forgiveness let me let me give you another example who had a battle with that a person who had a battle with that who really had to to stand up and see more is the apostle Paul I mean I think of the apostle Paul as a great apostle writer of all the epistles and kind of forget part of his life where he was like a murderer 1 Corinthians 15, 9. Paul is speaking of himself. He says this, For I am the least of all the apostles, not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church. And if the verse started there, it would sound like, I am just the least. I don't have nothing to say. So don't listen to me. I'm just the least of the apostles. What he just said there is true. I am the least of the apostles. I persecuted the church. If you read Acts, his persecution, it speaks of Saul, before he was named Paul, in a rage, enraged. He murdered people. He drove people out of their homes. All of that was true. But here's what's more true, Paul says, next verse. But by the grace of God, I am what I am. What is that? I'm an apostle. Therefore, I will speak. But the grace is because the grace of God did not prove in vain toward me. In other words, the grace of God was not wasted on me. You know what would have wasted the grace of God on Paul? If he would have walked around the rest of his life saying, yeah I'm forgiven but I'm the least of the apostles I don't have anything to say the grace of God would have been wasted on them what do you mean he's going to heaven? it's not about going to heaven yeah he's going to heaven it's about something bigger than that right now passive spirit I told you last week will press you to live under the shadow of your past and convince you and convince me that doing that is spiritual that doing that is humble and right and good so go ahead again and feel forgiven go to church sing a song get a cherry I'm so glad I'm so forgiven but don't do anything don't change anything don't seize anything don't believe God for anything because that just wouldn't look humble that's why a passive spirit is a self-absorbed spirit a self-absorbed spirit has accepted that the truest thing about me is my sin. A passive spirit has accepted the fact, the true thing, that the truest thing about me is my wound and my weakness. And if you have accepted that as being the truest thing about you, guess what? That's all you're going to see. In fact, one of the things I told you last week is if you're under the influence of this passive kind of spirit, you're going to be incapable of even looking up to see what's more true. Are you redeemed? Of course. Are you going to heaven? Of course. Passive people are not bad people. They're bound people. And here's the hard news, and I can't give this to you any easy way. The only possible way for you to break the power of this preoccupation with the wound or your sin and seeing that and nothing else, the only possible way for you to get free from that is to look up, and you have to do it. Here's the good news. You can do it. and all of that is why last week we corporately did our best to identify, expose, repent of and renounce and ask to be delivered from this spirit and it's why this week I want to corporately do an exercise enter into a discipline that will help us do this very thing to actually stay in this stand in this, walk in this an exercise that we're going to do together that will literally help us look up and see what is true, but see what is more true. And the thing I really like about this is that what we're going to do together, you can take with you. You can do this in your car. You can do what we're going to do at home. You can do this. But we're going to model it here, and it's going to help you look up and see not only what's true, but more true. And the two, it involves participating and interacting with two things, Two things that are vital in this process of looking up and seeing more, they are quite simply, number one, the Word of God, which helps you look up and see more, and the worship of God. It's been a weird week for me. Weird is saying it in a nice way. I spent a good portion of my week under a juniper tree, and I don't want to get grandiose about this, but it is as if last week I can transport myself in my mind back to last week on this stage all of you are here and we pray the fire of God and we pray the life of God and we pray the severance that was a good day that was a good day and I woke up two o'clock in the morning three o'clock in the morning Sunday night and I had things coming in my ear and I was flying fear all over me there's just fear all over me I didn't have any any individual saying anything to me it was just although I woke up and I was what is this I got up two o'clock in the morning three somewhere It gets a little foggy that time. Two, three, whatever. Doesn't matter. And I just was walking up and down my living room. I was just praying. I was, God help me. And I was starting to believe the lies. And I pushed the lies away. God help me do this. I don't know how to do this. Happened Monday. Happened Tuesday. Happened Wednesday. Began to break on Thursday afternoon. By this time, by the way, I don't do these things alone. Don't ever, when you're in this kind of stuff, don't ever do this stuff alone. You call your people. You call your intercessors. Had people praying. Even getting, in fact, one of the things that made a break was I was working out on Thursday afternoon. In fact, I told my wife later, you know, I get so many words from God when I'm on a Stairmaster, I should exercise all the time. I should just stay there and stay there. Just write something while I'm doing that. But I told God I would do something he asked me to do. And it doesn't sound like a great profound thing, but I can tell you what he asked me to do when I'm on a Stairmaster. It's Thursday. my bucket was empty. I didn't have anything to give today, nothing at all on Thursday afternoon. And he said to me, will you trust me? And I knew what he meant. Would you even trust me if you've got to get into the pulpit with nothing? And you just need to know that. It's a fight for me. And I said yes. Three o'clock in the morning, Friday morning, Thursday evening, I go to bed three o'clock in the morning. I woke up again. This is the fourth day in a row. Only this time scriptures were in my mind. And I began to hear the word of God coming into my mind. And I said, you know, I think this is for my sermon. I got to go in my office. So I walked in my office. My eyes are just barely closed. I wrote it. Didn't even turn the light on. I wrote it. And I thought, how may I get out tomorrow? Went back to bed. More scriptures came. I got up six times writing down the scriptures that came to my mind. And this is maybe a little out of your comfort zone. But I am a little weird about this stuff. But I'm sitting there and tears are streaming down my face. as I'm getting all these words and these scriptures just kept coming and I knew where I wanted to put them. I knew where I wanted to put them all of a sudden. But then I talked to God and I said, Lord, why'd you do this at three in the morning? You know, I've been needing to sleep. I'm asking your protection. And then I feel like this time, why'd you do this? And he said to me, because I wanted you to know it was me. And not tomorrow morning, because you're so creative. I gave this to you in a fog. so here's what we're going to do as a way to learn and model and to exercise a discipline that helps us look up and see not just what's true but what's more true I'm going to bring to you the words that God gave me I'm going to give you the verses that I got in the order I got them Friday I thought of other scriptures and I just said I'm not going to get there are other scriptures I'm not going to give those just the ones I got and then we're going to worship because that's another thing that's going to help us look up see not only what's true, but what is more true. Now, when we worship, I'm going to ask you all to stand. Not now. What is the rustling of paper? Oh, you're going to write them down? Oh, good luck. I'm going to go fast. What is this rustling of paper? Oh, I get it. Okay. Okay, you can write them down. You'll get the texts. But here, actually, get the tape or something. Because I want you to write them down if you want. But consider doing this. I want you to close your eyes. And when we go to worship, everyone's going to stand. But as I go through this, there are going to be scriptures that I say and comments that I make about them that you are going to feel something rise in you. You're just going to feel it rise in you. And here's what I want you to do. If while I'm reading the scripture, something rises in you, and something says, you need to look up. I want you to rise with it. Feel a little awkward. You may be the only one. There was more than one in both services. I just want you to stand up. Stand up into the word. Stand up into it. Let me just pray as we go to Father, Son, Holy Spirit, come. Give life to your word in ways that help your people look up and see more. See not only what is true, but what is more true. first scripture Hebrews 12 1 so let us lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which does so easily beset us think about that verse you can't do that passively set aside the sin some of you need to become fierce about your sin rise up and say no more by God's help no more and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us how do we do that here's how fixing our eyes on Jesus beloved look up look up fix your eyes on Jesus the author and perfecter of our faith who for the joy set before him endured the cross despised the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the father consider him who has endured such hostility by sinners against himself so that you may not grow weary or lose heart for you have not resisted to the point of shedding blood in your resistance against sin. When that scripture came to me, I had a memory instantly of my father. I would often call my father. I would always call my father when the heat was high, when things were tough, when the battle was raging, and I was confused. He would always listen. He would give instruction. He would often encourage. But almost every time after one of those conversations, he would end it by saying this, Have you bled yet? And I would say, no, Dad, I haven't bled yet. And he would say, arise and eat. I am not here to coddle you. I am here to call you. You need more than comfort. You need an encounter with the living God. Paul to Timothy said this, stir up the gift that is in you. You have a responsibility to stir up the gift. You have a gift. Some of you have left the gift, the anointing that God has given you and you have neglected it. You need to stir it up. Stir up the gift that is in you that was conferred upon you through prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands. You can't do that and be passive. Stir it up. Jesus one day said to a paralytic, arise, take up your bed, and walk. no I wasn't there I don't know how that happened I don't want went through that paralytics mind but but I but I think people would have understood if he would have responded to Jesus by saying walk I'm a paralytic I can't I can't walk I have a wound walk me I'm telling you for some of you this is a word from God to you and it's coming today here's the word I know you're wounded. I know you're hurt. Today, arise. Take up your bed and walk. Be filled with the Holy Spirit, Ephesians 5. Be filled with the Holy Spirit. We are filled with many things. This week I was filled with fear at times. Oh, this fear, come and fill me. I need to be full of something else. Some of us are full of anger. We're full of it. Holy Spirit come fill me fill me with your spirit some of us are filled with lust I need to be full of something else fill me with your spirit it says be filled it's in the imperative do this Psalm 24 do you not know have you not heard the Lord is strong and mighty did you forget that the Lord is mighty in battle so lift up your heads lift them up in the middle of your battle lift them up that the king of glory may come in who is this king of glory? he is the Lord that is his name 1 Timothy 1 Paul speaking to Timothy Paul the king to Timothy the warrior God has not given us a spirit of fear Timothy or timidity but of power, love, and discipline. So don't be afraid. Fear not. Joshua chapter 1, be strong and courageous. Only be strong and very courageous. Have I not commanded you? Commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not tremble or be dismayed for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go. We have just done an exercise, beloved. I've just taught you how you can look up and see more with the Word of God. There's another way with the worship of God. And we're going to do that now.
