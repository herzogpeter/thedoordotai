Let's open our Bibles to the book of Ephesians, the fourth chapter, and our continuing study, Wonder of Wonders, we are moving into a new section, Ephesians chapter 4, the first verse. Let's pray before we begin. Lord Jesus, we love your word so much. And Father, this book of Ephesians has done some things to us. It's done some things to me. And Father, these past few weeks, as we have been considering the ignition, that part that takes all the truth and turns it on, Lord, we have been stretched. And we have been deepened. And Father, as we come again to your word, to that pool of power, we ask again that you would stretch us, Lord. That, Father, you would deepen us once again. And, Lord, as we come to this, may we ever be aware that you are our teacher. In Jesus' name, amen. As I mentioned while praying, we are moving into a new section. And as we do, I want to remind us from whence we have come. As we just turn over the page, we see that Paul began this whole letter, this whole instruction to the church in Ephesus with this fabulous doxology. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has what? He has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should what? Be holy and blameless before him. In love he predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the kind intention of his will, to the praise and glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on all those who believe. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins. Incredible riches that Paul began to sum up and tell the believer, these are the things you have in Christ. This is who you are in Christ. And as he was telling them, he couldn't help but just get wrapped up in praise to God for the riches that he has bestowed upon the believer. the inheritance verse 13 in him you also after listening to the message of truth the gospel of your salvation having also believed you were sealed in him with the Holy Spirit of promise who is given as a pledge of our inheritance with a view to the redemption of God's own possession to the praise of his glory chapter 2 we discovered that we were dead in our sins we called it spiritual zombies walking around thinking we were alive but spiritually we were dead. But God, verse 4, being rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions and in our sins, he, what? Made us alive in him. You were dead, he made you alive. You were far off later on, he's brought you near. You were at war, he came preaching peace. What a glorious heritage is ours as believers. And then in chapter 2, verse 19, it says this, So then, you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and are of God's household, having been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole building is being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling, a habitation of God in the Spirit. And then in that third chapter, we spent so much time there, we began to see that this is where the power of the believer is turned on. All the resources in the first three chapters are being turned on right here as Paul bows his knee before the Father and says, Father, I pray that you would grant these believers according to the riches of his glory, that they would be strengthened with power through your Spirit in their inner man, that Christ would settle down and be at home in their lives so that they would comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height of your love and to know that love which surpasses knowledge in order that they may be filled up, in order that they may be filled up with all the fullness of God. And now we read chapter 4, verse 1. I, Paul, I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, entreat you believers to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called. The call to the believer who's got these incredible resources, who has that power turned on, the call to the believer to walk a worthy walk. The first thing I want you to catch here, even before we get deeply into the text, the first thing I want us to catch as we get into this is the atmosphere with which Paul is speaking, is the attitude with which he is speaking. He gets right into it and he says, I therefore, therefore kicks us back. It's like saying this, I, Paul, because of, on the basis of, as a result of what? As a result of the riches of his grace, as a result of your high position believers, as a result of your exalted position in Christ, as a result of your lofty position in Christ, I therefore, because of those things, I entreat you to walk worthy. I entreat you. The word there, entreat, is parakaleo. The root is kaleo. I ask. I call. Remember what happens when we put... That's a verb. Remember what happens when we put a verb with a preposition? Para? What happens? That verb is what? It's intensified. So it isn't just I ask you. I entreat you. I beseech you. That isn't even it. Literally, it would be this. I, therefore, because of your exalted position, because of who you are in Christ, because of the riches that are yours in Christ, I beg you. I want to tell you something. As we begin this section, incredibly important section, the Apostle Paul, when it came to the deep things of God, he didn't mind begging people to respond to them. when it came to the important, vital realities of a believer's relationship with Jesus Christ, he didn't mind begging that they would respond. His ministry was never, ever, ever marked by passive indifference. There was always a sense of passion. The same kind of passion we would read in the Old Testament as the prophets came and spoke the word of the Lord. And whether they said it or not, their tone was this, I beseech you, I beg you, respond. the same kind of passion that Jesus came with as he wept over the city of Jerusalem and he wept, his heart was broken there was never, never in any important kind of ministry there can never be passive indifference as if Paul would kind of lay out the truth and say well, that's the truth, take it or leave it if you don't like it, that's fine, if you take it, that's fine it doesn't really matter to me he prayed, he agonized, he hurt physically he hurt Galatians 4.19 says I have labor pains for you. Until I see Christ fashioned in you, I have labor pains for you. I see your lives, and more than anything in the world, I want to see the vital, deep truths of God become real in you. And the reason he is begging, the reason he is entreating with this great passion is because, believer, until we are walking a worthy walk, God is not glorified in our lives. Until we're walking a worthy walk, we are not fully blessed. The church cannot fully function. And the world cannot clearly see who Jesus really is. And so it is with impassioned pleading that Paul says, I entreat you, I beg you, based on, because of the riches that are yours in Christ, based on who you are in Christ, exalted and lofty and high. I beg that you would walk a worthy walk. Many teachers in dealing with this particular text and especially that particular word would point to the fact that he is beseeching them and not commanding them. He is not saying, I command you to walk a worthy walk. And one of the indicators that we would draw from that is that we are dealing now under the law of grace and not the law of Moses, for instance. We do not as believers respond anymore to the thunder and the lightning and the fear and the demands of Mount Sinai, do we? As believers, we respond to the beckoning love of a broken Savior put up on a cross. And that's the beseeching that he's doing here. I beseech you. I beg you, respond to this. There's nothing more important. The law says, I command. The law of grace says, I beseech. I beseech. I call on you to consider this. the law says if you obey i will accept grace says hey we spent three chapters six months saying i already accept you i already love you i have already blessed you now i beseech you walk worthy and so paul says i beseech you i entreat you i beg you but you know some of these same teachers who i've heard teach that difference, that word indicating the difference between law and grace and asking instead of commanding that you almost come away with the feeling like since he's asking it really doesn't matter. You know, you can do it or you can't and either way it's okay. I would submit to you for your consideration that the fact that he is saying I beseech you and I beg you is even stronger than a command. There's something, this is not an option for the believer. There is not going to be the thunder and crash of Mount Sinai if we don't respond. There is not going to be a putting out or a breaking of the seal that the Holy Spirit has on your life. But I have to go back to this again. The reason he begs is because he says God will not be glorified in your life. The church will not fully function. The world will not be able to clearly see the glory of God in you. And that's what it means to be a believer. That's what it means to be the church. Remember the church. Christ in the world, the body too. To walk a worthy walk. Let's look at the text. Break it down very quickly for you. Dealing today and the next couple of weeks with the first three verses. Breaks down very simply. The first thing we would see in these first three verses is first of all the call to the worthy walk. Verse 1. We've already read about that. I entreat you, I beg you to walk in a manner worthy of the call. The call to the worthy walk. The second part of our study is dealing with the characteristics of the worthy walk. Verses 2 and 3. Let's read them. The characteristics of the worthy walk are humility and gentleness with patience, showing forbearance to one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. The call to the worthy walk. Part 1. Lest you think I never give you outlines or anything like that. I know they're hard to follow. I've given you two. You may be able to forget about them from here on in, but I gave you them, so there you go. The call to the worthy walk. A couple things I want you to catch. He says, I therefore the prisoner of the Lord, and treat you to walk. I want you to notice that word walk. It means literally this. It refers to the daily conduct of the believer. The manner of living for the believer. That your manner of living, that your daily walk, that your daily conduct would be worthy of the calling with which you've been called. Now the concept of walking is absolutely crucial, and this is why I bring it up right now to the rest of our study in the book of Ephesians. By the way, there's going to be a lot of teaching here as we introduce this topic, and that's basically what we're going to be doing today. We're going to be introducing this whole section, extremely important. But this concept of walk is terribly important to the rest of our study. The reason is, is that from chapters 4 through chapter 6, we're going to be talking about the Christian's walk, the believer's manner of living, the believer's lifestyle, the things the believer does, the things the believer doesn't do. And I think we're going to be a little bit surprised at what kinds of things are emphasized. Chapter 4, 1 through 16, we're going to be talking about a walk of unity. Chapter 5, we're going to be talking about a love walk. Chapter 5, a light walk. Chapter 5 again, a wise walk. Chapter 5 and 6, a spirit-filled walk. And finally in chapter 6, a warfare walk. And the whole idea is simply this, let your manner of life be worthy. That second word is another one we need to discuss very quickly so I understand what that word means, worthy. What does it mean to walk worthy of the gospel, of the call? The word worthy comes from a word whose root in the Greek is this. It's very interesting, to equalize the scales. To equalize the scales. simply stated, to walk a worthy walk is to walk in such a way that my life would be equal to my position. What have we been doing for the last six months? We have been describing for us, from God's Word, what the position of the believer is. It is exalted. It is high. It is lofty. It is in Christ. And we are possessors of the Holy Spirit. We are possessors of Christ. We are possessors of the fullness of God and all this power. Now the call, that's positional truth. That's my position in Christ. Now the call is equalize it. Balance the scales. Make your practice equal with your position. That's a pretty heavy call. That's a pretty heavy call. Who I am needs to be seen in how I live. The worthy walk is simply living in harmony with my position in Christ. A balancing of the scales. Okay. The million-dollar question then has to come, How do you walk a worthy walk? How do you walk a worthy walk? That's kind of scary. When I first began to get into this, I started feeling all sorts of pressure from all sorts of different directions. I think of, okay, how is it my stomach began to turn? How is it that I measure up? All of a sudden, this grace thing is becoming obscured and it's really what I do. It's all my own effort and all this kind of thing. How is it that I walk a worthy walk? And I began to even think, and all the recordings that I had when I was a little kid began to come flying back to me, all the ways I had, the things I had to do to measure up, you know. I want to say right from the beginning that I believe a lot of us, a lot of we evangelicals, have sadly missed the real focus of what it means to walk a worthy walk. In far too many cases, I believe that we evangelicals have defined the worthy walk in terms of meaningless external things. Underline it. Meaningless external things and point to those little things I do and don't do. Almost nothing more significant than cultural taboos as being the indicators of one who is walking a worthy walk. It's subtle. I don't believe it's an evil thing and very often it's coming out of a heart that's desiring to serve the Lord and please the Lord. it is not some devious thing it's well intended but I believe it's misguided and let me explain some of the things that would indicate to any believer what a worthy walk is if you're going to walk a worthy walk if you're going to be a Christian everybody knows that the first thing you need to do is you need to go to church at least three times a week right? you need to go to church Sunday morning, Sunday evening and Wednesday now, what's wrong with that? nothing don't you ever think I think there's something wrong with that But I am going to say this It's external So I go to church three times a week Me and ten million other people do that You know that? That isn't an indicator That isn't one of the things I focus upon To establish a worthy walk Sometimes, let me take that back Sometimes it is an indicator of where my heart's at In fact, it is an indicator of where my heart's at But it's not the thing we focus on Let me give you a few others This is getting a little closer to home In terms of our little cultural things To walk a worthy walk To live a real Christian life means this I won't drink, I won't chew And I won't go with people who do I won't go to movies, and I won't play cards And I won't vandalize their yards Rhymes Like that And I'll get my hair cut, right? Those are the things that indicate what it means To walk a worthy walk To be a real Christian Those are the things so Dave what are you telling us are you telling us it's okay to go drink and smoke and play cards and go to movies you know what I'm not even going to answer that question I'm not even going to answer that question because you know what it's not the focus it isn't the important issue the important issue is this developing a group of people who are focusing on coming to verse 17 and verse 16 and saying, Lord Jesus, by your Spirit, strengthen me in the inner man. And Lord Jesus, I want you to come into my life and so possess me that you are able to settle down and be at home in every dimension of my life. And Lord Jesus, I want you to so control me that I am able to comprehend with all the saints what is the height and breadth and depth and length of your love and know the love of Christ and be full of all the fullness of God so that all that power can come. And you know what? As your pastor who is concerned for you like Paul was for them, I don't, if you're here and those are your desires, you know what? Funny thing, I don't worry one bit about how you're living. Not one bit. Not one little bit. I don't care what you're doing. Because I have a sneaking suspicion that if the deepest desire of your heart is to be controlled by the Holy Spirit of God, He's going to take care of your lifestyle. And I don't have to get you focusing on all these external little things that we do or don't do. These things will just fall in line. Proof. Galatians chapter 5, verses 22 and 23. It says the fruit of the Spirit is what? The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, on and on and on. And then at the end of that thing it says what? It says, and against such things there is no law. You know what that means? Two things it means. One, it means this. If you're living by the Spirit, what the result of that is going to be is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, on and on and on. That's going to be the result. When you're living by the Spirit, you don't even need a law. You know, when we're not living by the Spirit, when we really don't know what that means, when we're really not asking Him to control us and every dimension of our lives, and we're not focusing on internal qualities, what I need then is all sorts of fences. If I don't know what it means to be controlled by the Spirit, I need all sorts of fences. I need things that will say, don't do that, and don't do that, and don't do that. And so I just stay within the parameter of those things and feeling because I'm not doing this or I'm not doing that that I've kind of satisfied the criteria. I'm walking a worthy walk. I believe God's called us to a ministry that focuses us on the internal parts, on the inner parts. You see, the real issue is the Spirit's control. And that will always result in godly living every time. I grew up in a church. And maybe this is one of the reasons I feel so strongly about this, but I would anyways because it's just scriptural. But I grew up in a church where the message focused on the external. It focused on the external. That changed after a while. You know my father's in the ministry. One of the reasons I'm in the ministry is because he changed. Because I was walking right out the door because of the hypocrisy I saw. See, what we would put on a banner when I was a kid, what we would take in our little church and just we felt so good, you know, and what we put on a banner and held up to the world were all the little things we didn't do and all the little things we did. And I want to tell you something. Those things we didn't do and those things we did were good. They were right. They were moral, you know. Those were things we probably shouldn't do. But they were the focus, folks. Do you know what we had in that church? We had a whole lot of people who never went to a movie. Good for me. We had a whole lot of people who never had liquor touch their lips. That was, I mean, they both never did. Never smoked a cigarette. Never did. That's a great thing. Put it on a banner. Held it up to the world. This is my testimony. This is my testimony. The model of biblical Christianity. same people full of bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking and slander and malice rigid lack of love I couldn't put it in all those words when I was a kid all I knew was I didn't like being around them and sometimes they just weren't nice a lot of times I was afraid of them but they never did this and that they had all the externals but love joy peace long suffering gentleness meekness give me a break never saw it never saw it and that's why I was walking right off the bat we better realize when we're talking about a worthy walk we are talking about far more far more than the external observation of a few little cultural taboos it goes a lot deeper than that I think an awful lot of us and I'm into this because I was in this I think an awful lot of us get kind of self-satisfied as believers because we have this feeling that since I'm observing these little cultural things I've done what I need to do and I'm walking a worthy walk I've got news you've missed the point completely the call to the worthy walk let's look at it the call to the worthy walk is characterized by chapters 2 and 3 by the way, I mean verses 2 and 3 by the way, the rest of the whole book are the things that characterize the worthy walk. This first verse is the thing that kicks us into the rest of the book because the whole rest of this book is going to tell us how to walk a worthy walk, but focusing on verses 2 and 3. The characteristics of the worthy walk. Five of them. Humility, gentleness, patience, forbearance, and diligence to preserve the unity. We're only going to get one today and we probably won't even get to the second one next week either. One today. Humility. I like this. catch it how Paul is introducing this. It's really exciting. Here I am, a believer, having been saturated. Again, you know, I figured it out the other day. We've been in this. We're at the fourth chapter. We've been in this for six months now, and finally we're here. So for six months, we have been saturated from God's Word with our lofty, exalted, high position in Christ. And now he says to us, you know how you walk a worthy walk? You know how you walk in your manner of living to a level that's just as high and exalted and lofty as your position? You know how you reach that? And we go, yeah, sure. I stick out my chest and I pull my head high and I tell myself I'm a king's kid and I better live like a king. Right on, yeah. That's how I do. You know what he says? He says, you know how you walk according to the high and lofty position that you have in Christ? The way you walk worthy of that is you walk in all humility. You walk in all lowliness. the first characteristic of a worthy walk is humility humility think about that for a minute get a definition in your mind what is humility? what is humble? to be humble to be humbled to be humiliated think of the most humbling experience you've ever had in your life I want to tell you what I think of is the time I'm standing here in front of a bunch of people with my zippers down or something, you know? That's the most, it's a degrading kind of thing, isn't it? To be humbled in our minds is to look stupid. To be humbled is to be embarrassed. To be humbled is to feel real small. A humble person, a humble person in our minds is the proverbial Casper milquetoast guy, you know? The humble person in our minds is a weak guy. He's afraid of his own shadow. He's namby-pamby. He's mealy-mouthed. He has no integrity. He's got no strength. He's like Don Knotts or somebody like that. You know, he's a wimp. That's what he is. Humble. He ought to be humble. You know, he's got nothing on the ball. Nothing. Now, that's what humility is in a lot of our minds. It's kind of a worm. Now, add to that, add to that already kind of negative perception of what humility really is, the fact that we live in a society that exalts pride. All the time. Forever and a day we're pinning awards on somebody. From the time you kids are able to hold a bat, from the time I was able to hold a bat and put a glove on my hand or play football, you're getting trophies. I mean, it doesn't matter that you hand them out like peanuts, but you're getting trophies all the time. Pride, pride, all these wonderful things we exalt that. Humility is something to avoid. And if we do kind of think humility is a virtue, it's so misconstrued that we're going to get into that next week, so I don't want to preach that sermon now. look at what I can do look at what I've controlled look at what I've accomplished look at what we do we eat that up forever and a day again pinning awards on people even in Christian organizations I was in a gathering not too long ago with a bunch of Christian people and it was at a gathering that was representing an institution that was a Christian institution and in that gathering were a bunch of high mucky mucks you know big shots in the group and I remember the guy at the microphone looking through the group frantically trying to remember everyone's name, and whether they were a PhD or just a master's degree, and knowing that if I don't remember him, I mean, I'd lose my job, you know. Pride, it's all there. I even have, I have to be honest, I have problems with this reverend thing even, you know. It's all to me, to me, okay. We may say, well, respect, fine. I think a lot of it's pride. The reason is that humility is a weakness. It's something ignoble. It's something to be avoided. And nevertheless, here in the Word of God, humility is being extolled and exalted as one of the highest of all virtues. And Paul is as strong as to say that if you want to walk a worthy walk, you're going to have to walk in all humility. So what does that mean? And this is where one of our misconceptions come in. What that means is, if you want to be a good Christian, you've got to be a dip. Right? If you want to be a good Christian, I ought to start acting wimpy if you want to be a good christian you got to be mealy mouth and have no integrity we kind of get into this worm theology you know i'm really a worm i'm not worth anything yes i am we think we should put ourselves on i was talking to a girl this last week who i was sharing some of these things with her you can't hardly come in my office i live in this so you can't hardly come in with that hey you know what's thinking right now and so she started sharing with me about how when she was a little girl that growing up in a christian family that her perception of what humility was was that she was constantly putting herself down no matter how well she did it no matter you know what she succeeded at it was oh boy you know we don't know how to take a compliment and she was always putting herself down and she ended up feeling pretty much like a worm because of that and then i asked her well how did you deal with that how did you how did you come out of that he says well i did the opposite i started exalting myself you know i I started thinking I'm doing some of these things pretty good and I started pumping myself up. And the message this morning is that both of those approaches missed the point completely of what we're being called here to in terms of walking a worthy walk. Godly humility is not self-abasement. It is also not self-exaltation. Let's start. Considering this study, again, it's going to last a couple of weeks. We're going to touch. I want to introduce you to it. I want to give you a flavor for it as we begin this morning. Looking at pride. Pride, the opposite of humility, if you will. An attitude and an activity that God absolutely abominates. Jesus. If we could picture Jesus in dealing with people who were in sin and who had gone a direction that was absolutely contrary to the Word of God and to everything that He represented, when He confronted these people and they were ready to repent and their hearts were breaking, He was so tender and so caring. It was an incredible thing. but that same Jesus with his tenderness and caring in terms of in dealing with people who were absolutely in the gutter this same Jesus in dealing with the Pharisees who had like we often do all the externals wrapped up you know all the fences were there they didn't do this and they didn't do that and they didn't do this and all the externals were there they observed them beautifully as he looked at them in the rigidity and the self-righteous pride that they had, Jesus bristled and said things to them like this, you whitewashed, you are whitewashed sepulchers full of dead men's bones. Pride. The very first sin ever committed. It began in heaven. Lucifer, the angel, the son of the morning. The story of it is found in Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 28. Lucifer says to God, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will. Five times. One time God says, no you won't. And he removed him from glory. Proverbs 11.2 says, when pride cometh, then cometh shame. But with humility there is wisdom. Proverbs 16.5 says, everyone that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord. An abomination to the Lord. He shall not go without chastisement. Proverbs 16, verse 18, pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall. Proverbs 21, verse 4, the high look and the proud heart and the prowling of the wicked is sin. Humility is always the indicator of the righteous and pride is always the indicator of carnality. Every time. And I believe as I was even preparing this this week and my mind was kicking back into these principles of asking the Lord to strengthen us in the inner man, Christ being at home, full of love, all these kinds of things. The very thing for some of us that are keeping us from moving into that power of verse 20, now unto him, is able to do exceeding abundantly, is pride. That's the thing that's holding us back. The indicator of carnality. I can do that. I know that. I am God. I can run my life my way. It's something God abominates. It's also something God will judge. Absolutely. I want you to turn with me to Isaiah chapter 2. Isaiah chapter 2, verse 11. This is good. He's dealing with the people of Israel who had become proud and were beginning to strut their stuff around, you know. And he says, the proud look of man will be a base. Oh, in fact, verse 10, we can look up there. If you think you're hot stuff, I want you to know something. If you looked right into the face of God, you know what you'd do? You'd enter a rock and hide in the dust. If you really looked face to face with God and saw his glory and saw his power and then saw you're kind of strutting your stuff all over the place, if you saw what you're really doing, you would hide under a rock. Verse 11, the proud look of man will be abased, and the loftiness of man will be humbled, and the Lord alone will be exalted in that day. For the Lord of hosts will have a day of reckoning against everyone who is proud and lofty and against everyone who is lifted up, that he may be a base. And it will be against all the cedars of Lebanon that are lofty and lifted up, against all the oaks of Bashan, against all the lofty mountains, against all the hills that are lifted up, against every high tower, against every fortified wall, against all the ships of Tarshish, against all the beautiful craft, the pride of men will be humbled. And the loftiness of men will be a base. And the Lord alone will be exalted in that day. The people of Israel had begun to parade themselves. They were strutting their stuff, just like the world, you know. The world is in the habit of doing that, strutting their stuff and saying, how great we are. But what had happened here was that the people of God had done that. And that's exactly why this rebuke comes, because these are God's people who are doing this. These are God's chosen people who are acting like that. These people who were designed by him to be a channel of his love to the whole world instead of being a messenger to the world concerning God's love, they became just like the world, just strutting their stuff. And we do the same thing. We see the same thing happening in our churches, in our church. You know, all you have to do is turn on Christian TV. Whenever I want to laugh or need an illustration, I do that. Pride. Singers with spurting fountains, diamond rings all over themselves. If you want to come and sing, it's thousands and thousands of dollars. I mean, wouldn't it be nice if they would grace us with their presence? Incredible. Speakers, the same kind of thing. Spurting fountains, enormous edifices. And it's almost as if... I don't get the... I get the... Okay, I'll say I get the impression. I get the impression that we're getting to the point where we're just kind of competing with the world. And we pat ourselves on the back because we do it almost as good as real TV. We do it almost as good as they do in the world. I want to tell you something. The world is used to doing it. That's their program. We'll never do it as good as the world because that's what they do. And God came and rebuked his people when they got into that whole kind of thing, strutting their stuff. Look how great. Stick and chest up. Isaiah chapter 2 again. No, I'm sorry. Isaiah 3. he confronts the daughters of Israel verse 16 verse 16 moreover the Lord said because the daughters of Zion are proud and walk with heads held high and seductive eyes they were just walking cocky you know they were real cocky and go along with mincing steps just again that's threatening their stuff you know and tinkle the bangles on their feet therefore the Lord will afflict the scalp of the daughters designed with scabs. What a sight. And the Lord will make their foreheads bare. In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, headbands, crescent ornaments, dangling, earrings, bracelets, veils, headdresses, ankle chains, sashes, perfume boxes, amulets, finger rings, nose rings. That's coming too, you know. Nose rings. That's one of the things coming if you're into punk rock. Nose rings, festal robes, outer tunics, cloaks, money purses, hand mirrors, outer garments, turbans and veils. Now it will come about that instead of sweet perfume, there will be putrefaction. Putre, it'll smell bad. Okay. Okay. Instead of a belt of rope, instead of well-set hair, a plucked-out scalp, instead of fine clothes, a donning of salt sackcloth, and branding instead of beauty, your men will fall by the sword. Judgment. God will judge pride. Jeremiah 31, the end. The end of Jeremiah, the 31st verse. God says this, Behold, I am against you, thou most proud, saith the Lord God of hosts, for thy day has come. The time that I will punish thee for the most proud will stumble and fall, and none shall raise them up. In the New Testament, James 4, 1 says, God resists the proud. The opposite of that is also true. Proverbs 22, 4, By humility and the fear of the Lord our riches and honor and life. Proverbs 27 2, let another man praise thee and not thine own mouth. I like that one. Let another man praise you and not your own mouth. A stranger and not thine own lips. Jesus himself was a supreme example of this. God, the king of kings, the lord of lords, and yet Philippians 2 tells us he what? He emptied himself, took the form of a bond servant, made like a man and being found in the appearance of a man he humbled himself but not only that not only did God become a man in that very act being one of humbling and humility but he adorned himself with a lifestyle of humility a lifestyle of humility he was born in a stable he never had a place to lay his head he didn't have anything of his own except the clothes that he wore on his back. He was a stranger almost every place he went. Even when he died, he had to be in a buried tomb. He told his disciples at one point when he was teaching and they were talking about who was going to be first and who was going to be last and rank and order and power and, you know, I want to be number one and sticking out their chest. And he told his disciples, he said, listen, look at the Gentiles when they talk about leadership and honor and power, how the leaders among the Gentiles lord it over. When they get into the position of authority, when they get into that exalted position, they lord it over they tell everybody what to do they just control them it's not to be so among you if you want to lead you're going to have to serve humility humility now you tell me as you consider humility and all the things you know that we described about humility as we come up with definitions you know it's feeling stupid and feeling small and all these kinds of things. Do you, when you think of Jesus, think of someone who's a patsy? Do you, when you think of Jesus, think of someone who's weak and stupid and stumbling, inept and inadequate? Do you think of someone who's mealy-mouthed? I think of anything but that. None of us see that. Maybe we're learning something of what humility really is, godly humility. Philippians 2, 9 through 11, tells us what the result of God's humbling of himself, Jesus' humbling of himself and taking on this role, this lifestyle of service. You know what it was? God, therefore, therefore, there's that word again, because of the fact that he humbled himself, therefore God highly exalted him and bestowed upon him the name that is above every name, that at the feet of Jesus every knee will bow and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. 1 Peter 5, 6 says, humble yourselves, Therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that what? That he may exalt you. All of a sudden, here we are. We're talking about the great paradox of Christianity and the worthy walk. I humble my, here's my position, exalted. How do I attain that exalted high position in my everyday life? You humble yourself, that's how. And what happens? God exalts you and you're walking a worthy walk. I want to walk worthy of the calling to which I've been called. If I want to have my life to be balanced with the lofty position that I have in Christ, I need to humble myself. We went to council a few weeks ago. I've talked about it every once in a while. And Dr. King, the president of the Alliance, was there and kind of officiating at all the meetings. And I never, I had a chance to shake his hand and I didn't wash it for a week or so. But here was a man who was at the very head of our whole institution, the Alliance. And I believe to be a great, great man of God. But even before he preached his sermon, one of the attitudes and one of the things that just reeked from him was a humility. A humility. It was incredible. And I remember, I'll never forget this, because it even taught me something about communion, the Lord's table, and he was, we had communion with thousands, thousands of people in this room. And he was beginning to just do a short devotional like we do on those communion days. And he was talking about the blood, and he was talking about forgiveness and reconciliation and a right relationship with Christ. And then he talked, he asked the people to remember the day the blood applied to them. And he said, I remember the day the blood applied to me. And this man, PhD, just broke, broke down. Humility. You know what happened? He grew. He grew. Great man of God. And I want to tell you something. Mealy mouth, mushy, weak, stupid, insipid. When he spoke, he spoke with the thunder and authority of the voice of God. But there was humility. Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, and he will exalt you. Let me close by simply illustrating how basic this is to every dimension of our lives. You know, I want this word here to come out of our Bibles with big, bold letters. We can't walk a worthy walk without humility. There's no way. It is essential to every dimension of our Christian life. It's as basic to our Christian life as salvation itself. This is obvious, and it's one of those things that when we say it, I say, I knew that all the time. Of course, we all did. Matthew 18, Jesus says, except you come as what? As a little child. Unless you come that way, you can't come into the kingdom. And then he goes on and says, you want to come into the kingdom, you've got to do something first. You need to humble yourself as a little child. think about the day the blood applied to you think about the day you came to the lord for some of us there was a breaking and it was hard but even in the breaking and the hardness of it there was a sweetness and a power and i and maybe for the first time in my life mealy mouth and mushy and weak for the first time in my life i felt together but for some of us that was that that sweet and gentle humility no one came to the lord and said hey God, it's me. You know, the one you've heard so much about. No one comes to the Lord with all their credentials. You don't come to the Lord with your credentials. You don't come and say, here's my PhD. Here's my master's degree. Hey, I've been in the ministry for eight years. Hey, look at what I did in my job. Hey, look at my family. We don't come with our credentials. Look how I can hit a softball. Look how I play sports. You don't come with that. You come how? You come as a little child and you say, I'm a sinner and you're a savior and I need you. And you know what I think Paul is saying here? He's saying this. That's how you came. That's also how you ought to walk. And some of us spiritually haven't grown in years. That's because of pride. I got all the answers. I'm in control. You know what? There's no way we can grow as Christians without humility. The song Angie's sang, I loved it. I don't remember. You are the potter. I'm the clay. Something like that. You fashioned me. It's a recognition of who he is and a recognition of who I am and how much I need him. I can't grow as a Christian until I come to the Lord and say, Lord, I need to grow. But if I'm walking around saying, I've got it together, never. I can't grow without humility. There's no way I'm going to be spirit-filled without humility because somewhere along the line I've got to say, Lord, I'm empty. And there's a humbling. and then there's a filling. There's no way in the world there can be unity in the church. You know that? You know, it dawned on me. There's no unity in the church without humility. You know, it dawned on me. I could preach a big sermon on unity in the church. We need to be united. You know what you should do? You preach a sermon on humility. That's what you do. And then unity comes. James says, From whence comes the wars among you? They are because you want with your own lust. and you desire to have and you'll do anything to get it, God resists the proud. God can't move among us unless there's humility. There is no way in the world there can be renewal, revival. We cry, Lord, open the heavens. Last week we talked about 2 Corinthians 11. If my people who are called by my name will what? Humble themselves. I will hear their prayers and I will forgive their sins and I will heal their land. For some of us even after all the time we spent in those verses on top the only thing standing between you and the fullness of God in your life is pride. There is no way that we can walk a worthy walk with pride. there's no way we can walk a worthy walk without humility and I dare say the same thing for anyone who's here and maybe you've heard the message a million times and you know in your heart you've never come like this and said Lord I come as a little child humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God and he will exalt you and he will fill you and he'll cause you to grow and he will give you himself. And we're going to have an invitation. And you know what? If you don't know him this morning, humble yourself and let him come and take residence in you. And I'm going to ask you to come forward and maybe you're a believer here and none of this is broken for you. Humble yourself so he can fill you, so he can control you. And if for you, in order to seal that, to make it real. You need to come forward. I do not believe that coming forward makes it real. I do believe that there is significance in coming forward because it's a public declaration. It's something that I take a step and I do it. And I would love to pray with you. But if that's where you're at, I just invite you to come and we'll break together and we'll cry and we'll all pray. We can't walk a worthy walk. The first characteristic is humility. talk about it a little bit more next week let's pray Lord break us we're so afraid of that and yet it's such a it's such an exalting strengthening kind of experience think of David creating me a clean heart renewing me a steadfast spirit Lord if you wanted sacrifices I'd do it what you want is a broken heart thank you for your word and your Holy Spirit that energizes it to pierce into our hearts and change our lives. Amen. Amen.
