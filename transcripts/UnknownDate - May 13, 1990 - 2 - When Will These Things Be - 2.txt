If you were here last week, you're aware of the fact that we are this week entering the second week of our examination of what has come to be known as the Olivet Discourse. The Olivet Discourse covers chapter 24 and 25 of the book of Matthew. The contextual setting of this discourse is the final week in the life of Christ. It is Wednesday of that final week. On Friday, he will die. Having spent the entire day this Wednesday in the temple, in the midst of tremendous conflict and confrontation, at this point of chapter 24, verse 1, he is now leaving the temple with his disciples. As they are going down the backside of the temple mount, they then cross the little Kidron Valley and begin to ascend the Mount of Olives on the other side. And as they begin to ascend the Mount of Olives, the disciples stop and look back. And in the late afternoon sun, they see the temple buildings there, and according to verse 1, they point out the temple buildings to Jesus. It was an innocent gesture, simply one where they noted the majestic nature of it, the beauty of it, I suppose, in that time of the day with the sun just about to set. And Jesus' response to their consideration of the temple was a prophecy of frightening proportion in verse 2. Do you not see all these things? In other words, do you see everything? take a good look at everything you see there. For I say to you that not one stone here shall be left upon another which will not be torn down. And literally that prophecy was fulfilled in 70 A.D. in their lifetime with the destruction of the temple and just about all of Jerusalem by the Roman emperor Titus Vespasian. The response of the disciples to that prophecy is a question in verse 3. And in my opinion, as we dealt with this last week in the introduction, the understanding of this question is the key to understanding the Olivet Discourse. The question they ask is twofold. While in their minds it's only onefold, there's only one aspect to the question. It is twofold. Their question is this, Tell us then, Jesus, when will these things be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age? Twofold. First of all, when will these things be? Clearly, obviously, these things that they're asking about are these things that he just mentioned. not one stone being left upon another. When is the temple going to be destroyed? And the second part of the question, which to them was all one question, when is the sign or what is the sign of your coming and the end of the age? I pointed out last week that the way we, from our perspective in history, would ask that question would be like this. Lord, when is going to be the destruction of the temple? And separate from that, when is going to be the second coming? But it's not what the disciples had in mind. Literally, the word coming there is the Greek word parousia. And it simply means full presence. When is going to be the fullness of your presence? When is going to come the fullness of your kingdom? And they saw the destruction of Jerusalem that Jesus just prophesied and the fullness of the kingdom, the fullness of his presence coming at the same time. We noted last week and have noted all through the book of Matthew that the disciples, in terms of their eschatology, their theology, expected the fullness of the kingdom at any moment during all of Jesus' ministry. It seemed that just about every time Jesus would begin to express his miraculous power, signs and wonders, people would be healed and demons would be cast out. Every time that happened, there was a tremendous energy coming from the disciples. This must be it. It's going to happen now. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. And we'd get very disturbed and very discouraged when Jesus would back off of all of that hysteria and say things like this. I must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things and die. And when he talked like that, the disciples said, no, you can't do that, and Peter especially, well, I won't allow that. Remember that? They didn't get it. They were expecting it all to happen now. Even after the resurrection, by that time you'd kind of get a handle, you'd think they'd get a handle on the eschatological impact of all of these things, but they still didn't get it, and that's okay. But in Acts 1, verse 6, Jesus is about to ascend, and they ask again, is it now? Are you going to do it now? Is the full presence coming now? And Jesus said something then that we need to hear now as we sometimes get involved in trying to figure out, is it now? Jesus said in Acts 1, verse 7, that it's not for you to know, disciples, the times. It's not for you to know the epics, which the Father has fixed by his own authority. But I'm going to promise you this, chapter 1, verse 8, in the book of Acts. while this is not the parousia, while this is not the full presence, you will not be left alone. You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. I could preach a whole sermon on that whole thing as it relates to the parousia, the end times. You will not get the big P, disciples, the big parousia, but you're going to get a parousia of sorts, the coming of the Holy Spirit indwelling you, and that indwelling presence of God is going to enable you and empower you to live in this age. as an overcomer by faith in the indwelling spirit presence of God in you. And all of that dynamic that I just gave you in Acts chapter 1 is consistent with Jesus' answer here to the disciples' twofold question. His answer is twofold. There are two objectives to Jesus' answer, and the answer is the entire Olivet Discourse. The first objective of Jesus in the Olivet Discourse is to assure the disciples and reveal to the disciples that the full presence is not yet. The full end of the age is not yet. Verse 6 at the end. See that you are not frightened when you hear about wars and rumors of wars. Those things must take place, but that is not yet the end. They are merely, verse 8, the beginning of the birth pains. And the birth pains are an important metaphor, concept for us to understand as it relates to end times. Birth pains simply being something that when a woman gives birth to a child, those birth pains start relatively easy and get more and more intense and more and more frequent. And the issue of the end times is not that things in the end are going to be so different than every other age. It's going to be the same in the end as it has been in every generation. In the end, however, it's going to be more intense and more frequent as the birth pains begin to increase with both intensity and frequency. he tells them these things in the Olivet Discourse to assure them the full presence is not yet but secondly to prepare them for what will be in their lifetime and in the lifetime of every generation following them up to and including our generation up to and including and through the end of the age and so there is a sense in which he is speaking to the disciples to every generation following he is speaking directly to us about our generation He is also speaking to everyone who will be here at the end. And so there is a timelessness to this whole thing. The purpose of the warnings that he gives and the signs that he reveals is not so that the disciples or so that we could become good sign watchers of the end times. He does not give these signs so that the disciples or we could become good parousia predictors. But he gives them so that we can be, along with the disciples, prepared to hang on to Jesus for dear life, all our lives, no matter what the age is that we live in, no matter how intense the birth pains of our particular age or generation might be. He gave six signs we dealt with last week from verse 4 to 14. The first sign was this, verse 4 and 5, deception will come. In every age there will be false Christs. Just know that. That is not necessarily the end. Matthew 23 indicates that there is a history of false teachers in every age seeking to defile the truly redeemed. In the end of the age, this deception will be greater than it ever has been before. And all of the Antichrists of all time will be embodied according to Revelation 6 in one Antichrist, the embodiment of deception. The second aspect will be that of wars and rumors of wars. You're going to hear that in every age. Don't be frightened. These things must take place. It is not yet the end. Every time things kick up throughout history and wars begin to move through the globe, don't be assuming that that's the end. I'm sure that when Jerusalem, the temple, was destroyed in 70 A.D., there were believers who were going, this is it. There's never been anything like this. This has got to be the end. And every time wars and rumors of wars happen, people do that. When World War I came across this globe, People, I'm sure, believers, this has got to be it. There's never been anything like this. The Holocaust of World War II comes through. This is it. Everything is coming together. Oh, my goodness. In every age and every generation, those things are going to happen. Not only that, there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. Verse 7, at the end of verse 7, Luke added the parallel to that. Not only earthquakes and famines, but disease, an increase in demonic activity all through every generation. atmospheric alteration these things are indeed signs of the coming of the king but you need to understand verse 8 they are merely the beginning of the earth or the birth pangs the birth pangs as we move to verse 9 we saw the signs of every age that are also going to be part of the end of the age becoming more personal not just signs and activities in the world but there are going to be things coming at you believer at you, disciples, at you, people who are here at the end of the age, at us as well, and that's persecution. They will deliver you to tribulation, will kill you, and you'll be hated by all nations on account of my name. Again, that is part of every age. Jesus warned, John 15, 20, if the religious system hated you, don't be surprised if they hated me, don't be surprised if they hated you too. John 16, 33, Jesus said, in me you will have peace, but in the world you'll have tribulation. be of good courage I have overcome the world but in the world you will have tribulation it's going to be part of every age and every generation up to and including the end of the age and what every generation needs including the end of the age is the same thing an attitude that says my only hope is Jesus so it's going to help you through disciples every generation following and the one in the end of the age the result of that persecution in every generation and more intense at the end will be defection People will fall away. Verse 10, at that time, many will fall away, deliver up one another, and hate one another. Three reasons for that. Number one, the price will be too high. Gone, as I said last week, will be the people who follow Jesus because they thought they were going to get a lollipop at the end. Gone will be the people who've been playing church. Gone will be the pretenders. The true believers, redeemed by the blood of the Lamb, indwelt by the Spirit of God, will not defect. in fact some of you true believers wonder about tribulation and you wonder how you handle it if you are a true believer in who the spirit dwells when trouble comes you know what will happen to you whether you know it or not the spirit that is in you will rise up and give you authority and power you don't even know you have but the pretenders will fall away and it's a mark of the end and every generation it's going to be that way but in the end it's going to be closer together more frequent and more intense another reason people will fall away verse 11 many false prophets will arise and mislead many it will be because of deception verse 12 says some will fall away because they literally simply choose iniquity verse 12 because of lawlessness being increased most people's love will grow cold we spoke of a demonic draw of sin increasing as the birth pains become more frequent and more intense that will be true in every generation increasing until the end. Verse 14 says this, however, that in the middle of all of this demonic increase, and in the middle of all this powerful draw of sin, and in the middle of all this persecution, the gospel will prevail in every generation increasing until the end. And in the end of the age, with a powerful demonstration of demonic power, there will also be in the end of the age, a tremendous demonstration of the power of God. It says in verse 14, this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world for a witness to all nations. Stop right there. Right in the middle of all of this trouble and tribulation, the word of God will prevail. And again, as my mind goes through history, you can see that as being true. The disciples did not live in the generation of the parousia. They did not obviously live in the end because we're here, Jesus didn't come and set up his kingdom fully. The full presence hadn't come. And they lived through incredible tribulation. All but one died a martyr's death. But right in the middle of that demonic activity, or right in the middle of all of that opposition and oppression, the word of God grew mightily and prevailed all the time, every generation, increasing till the end. Now we think of all the marks of the end times. And we think of all the marks of the end times being negative ones. I don't know if you do, but I have. They're all going to be bad and rumors of war is getting worse and worse and worse. You know what else is one of the marks that the birth pains are getting greater and greater is that the power and expression of God in the world through the church is going to become greater and greater and greater revival. At the end of verse 14b, it says this, and then the end shall come. With those words, I believe that we're kind of kicked into a different gear. I believe that as we follow this study and as we leave verse 14, catch this here, by way of teaching to catch the flow, I believe in verse 14 at the end we are now moving past what I would call general signs that are typical of every age into more specific signs that are typical of the end of the age. Catch that switch as we move to verse 15. And now we're moving into new territory. Therefore, when you see the abomination of desolation, that is a sign to you, that is an unmistakable sign to you that something extremely significant in the history of the world is happening. The abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, let the reader understand something powerful has happened, then is the time to run. stop right here. We need to teach. What is the abomination of desolation? What is this thing that is marked by this text as the sign of something catastrophic that is about to happen? The abomination of desolation, what it means, the abomination simply means something very despicable, a despicable act that desolates or desecrates. The obvious key is this abomination of desolation is the one that was spoken of through Daniel the prophet. In order to understand what the abomination of desolation is, let's go to Daniel. There are three passages in Daniel that speak of the abomination of desolation. This is where we start to work. Turn first to Daniel chapter 11, verse 31. Daniel 11, chapter 31. Just read the verse to kind of get the first mention of abomination of desolation. And forces from him will arise. Desecrate the sanctuary fortress and do away with the regular sacrifice and they will set up the abomination of desolation. There's the word. Now I still don't know what it means. Let me explain to you. The fact is this, that 400 years after this prophecy in Daniel, this prophecy was fulfilled. 400 years after the prophecy of Daniel right here is still 175 years before Christ. So the prophecy of Daniel, at least in this particular verse, in the experience of the disciples, had already happened. It was fulfilled through the life of a man named Atiochus Epiphanes, who was a Syrian king, who 400 years, again after Daniel, 175 years before Christ, had a goal, and that was to absolutely wipe Israel off the face of the earth. The nature of his desolation was to move into the temple in the Holy of Holies and slaughter a pig, a defiled animal to a Jew, upon the altar in the Holy of Holies. They stuffed pork down the throats of the priests and then set up a god, And most scholars believe that the God set up by Antiochus Epiphanes was the God Zeus, a great statue of him as God in the Holy of Holies. And that was the historic, already done abomination of desolation. So catch up here now. What the disciples are accurately hearing Jesus say is this. What you had prophesied in Daniel and what has already happened is going to happen again. What you know in your own existence has already happened, was prophesied by Daniel, is also going to happen again. When is it going to happen again? Some believe that the happening again of the abomination of desolation was in 70 A.D. So that's done too, according to some scholars. I think it's possible that the disciples themselves, hearing this prophecy, abomination of desolation, in their own life, seeing the destruction of Jerusalem, the ultimate destruction of the temple, might themselves have thought, this is it. This is the abomination of desolation that Jesus prophesied had already happened in Daniel but is going to happen again. Here it is. We're there. This is it. I think if I was there, I would think that. I think if I saw Titus Vespasian coming upon Israel and coming upon Jerusalem, setting himself up as a god in that land, When I saw that happening, I might turn to Matthew 24 and decide it's time to run to the mountains. This is it. Get out of there. In fact, Eusebius, the historian, records that the church congregation in Jerusalem got a revelation just before this war broke out. And maybe what they did, somebody said, we need to read Matthew 24. I believe that God is giving us a word that Matthew 24 is happening. And the fact is, historically, that Christians in large numbers left Jerusalem at that time. But I don't believe that's the full fulfillment of that particular prophecy. While I do believe that there is maybe some immediate, maybe a type of fulfillment in the destruction of the temple, there is a longer view. There's an end-of-the-age fulfillment of the abomination of desolation that is, I believe, yet to come. And the reason I believe that, I hope you trust me that it's not just some preconceived ideas about what the end times are supposed to be. The reason I believe that is because of what Daniel and the rest of the book says about this abomination of desolation. I told you just a moment ago that there's three places, four places actually, where the abomination of desolation is mentioned. And one of the places speaks of Antiochus Epiphanes, already done. but the rest of the book of Daniel is a prophetic view of the end times not of an event in 70 AD but a prophetic view of the end times and a teaching of one who is going to rise as the Antichrist let me do some teaching give you some background first of all let me give you the passages that this reference of abomination of desolation is found and then we'll refer back to them if you're taking notes write them down the first is Daniel 9.27 Daniel 9.27 Daniel 11.40 and Daniel 12.11 Get those now back up, take a breath, and let's get the big picture here a little bit. In Daniel chapter 2, let me kind of tell you this in story form to get the flow. What Daniel chapter 2 indicates is that in the end of the age, there is going to be a rising up of the old Roman Empire. It is not going to be called in the end times the Roman Empire. It is going to have a different name, but it is going to occupy the same basic territory that the Roman Empire of old occupied. In the final form, according to Daniel, in this vision that Daniel got, this final form of the Roman Empire is pictured as a statue with ten toes. Bizarre thing. Daniel goes on to indicate that these ten toes were representative of ten kings or ten kingdoms. And those ten kings formed an alliance together, a ten-nation confederacy where they bound together to strengthen each other. It is interesting to note, as you consider that dynamic, That the Roman Empire basically is in a geographic place where Western Europe and parts of Eastern Europe are today. It is also interesting when you consider that reality that in Western Europe right now, there is what is called the European Common Market, occupying the same fundamental area as the Roman Empire. And right now today, the European Common Market has 10, count them, 10 member nations. What that means for us is that the prophetic plan is set to go. So, both Daniel and Revelation seem to indicate that out of that confederacy, there is going to rise a great leader. And we discovered last week that according to Revelation 6, when this great leader comes to power, he is first of all going to come on a white horse, symbolizing peace and authority, and he's going to be everybody's hero, and he's going to be a wonderful guy, and he's going to solve everybody's problems, and everybody's going to think he's a hero in the end times. he will be the antichrist nobody on the front end of this is going to say ah the antichrist everybody's going to love him and israel in particular according to daniel is going to see this antichrist rising up out of the west as a friend as an ally as a protector and the people he is going to protect israel from are its enemies the king of the north ezekiel ezekiel 38 identifies the king of the north that is going to consistently harass Israel as the king called Rosh or the kingdom of Rosh. Most scholars believe that the kingdom of Rosh, R-O-S-H, is today Russia. And I don't think I need, and I don't know if that's true for sure, but I don't think I need to do a whole lot of work trying to convince you that there's a powerful anti-Jewish sentiment in Russia. They it would just as soon Israel was wiped off the face of the earth. Whenever it seems that there are victories in Israel over an Arab nation and they find weapons, whose weapons are they? They're Russia's weapons. There's a strong thing there. According to Ezekiel 38, the king of the north is going to be moving on Israel. There's also the king of the south and the king of the east. And in the end times, there is going to be in the spirit of Israel, in the heart of Israel, a growing sense of vulnerability because it will be surrounded on all sides by enemies. The north, the south, the east. Its only hope will be the west. Today, I mean, again, just read the paper if you want to get something current on that. Surrounded by Arabs and other nations that would just as soon Israel disappear. And it says in Daniel 9.27, turn to that, that Israel is going to make a covenant with this great leader. and he will make a firm covenant with the many. He is the Antichrist. The many is Israel for one week. Now, the one week there, trust me on this. Go and do your study later so you know I'm not just making this up. But the one week is a symbol of one day of every week being one year. So the one week is symbolic of a seven-year period of time. So there will be a seven-year covenant made designed by Israel to give protection to them. halfway through this week it says in the middle of the week he will put a stop to the sacrifice and the grain offering the reason for that is that in the middle of this week the kings from the north and the kings from the south and the kings from the east begin to move on Israel and move on the antichrists that's referred to in Daniel chapter 11 verse 40 says this at the end time the king of the south will collide with him the antichrist and the king of the north will storm against him with chariots, horsemen and many ships What's going to happen in this conflict as these kings move against the Antichrist who's protecting Israel because they're moving on Israel is that the Antichrist is going to win and put these forces back. But after he wins and holds back the forces against Israel, and Israel looks at their leader and goes, Ah, what a guy! He helped us! That same leader who helped them is going to turn on them and become their ruler and become their oppressor. It says in verse 27, chapter 9 of Daniel, but in the middle of the week, the middle of the week would be three and a half days, three and a half years, three and a half years, he will put a stop to the sacrifice and grain offering, and on the wing of abominations will come one who makes desolate, even until a complete destruction, one that is decreed, is poured out on the one who makes desolate. And in chapter 11, verse 36, it says this king that then turns three and a half years into the tribulation, into this last, that is the tribulation period, by the way. That's what we're in right now, historically. When that happens and he turns on Israel, the king who was their friend now will do as he pleases, verse 36 of Daniel 11. He will exalt and magnify himself above every god, will speak monstrous things against the god of gods, and he will prosper until the indignation is finished, for that which is decreed will be done. And he will show no respect or regard for the gods of his fathers or the desire of women, nor will he show regard for any other god, for he will magnify himself above them all. He will instead honor a god of fortresses, a god whom his father did not know. He will honor him with gold, silver, costly stones, and treasure. And that's the abomination of desolation. In chapter 12, verse 11, it says, And from that time the regular sacrifice is abolished, and the abomination of desolation is set up. That is an event that is, in my opinion, to come in the future. It is one of the final birth pains of history, and when that event happens, I believe we are then, as a globe, entering into the final three and a half years of human history before the full presence, before the parousia. It is called, these last three and a half years, the Great Tribulation. Most of you are aware that the Tribulation is a seven-year period. The Great Tribulation is a three-and-a-half-year period that begins with the abomination of desolation. Three-and-a-half years in, this alliance turns. Those who are here, both Jews and New Testament redeemed saints, are going to have to hear these words in chapter 24. What do you do when that happens? Back to our text, chapter 24, verse 16. Let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Get out of there. It says in Revelation 13 that it will be given to him in that day. It will be given to him, that is Satan, to make war with the saints. Every generation, every generation has had Satan as their enemy. Saints. Satan is our enemy. Satan is targeting our church. I mentioned that last week. But in the end times, when this thing begins to unfold, It will be given to him to make war with the saints in a way that is more intense and more frequent than any other time in history. And when you see this sign, run, flee Judea, flee to the mountains, and do it quickly. Verse 17, let him who is on the housetop not go down to get things out of that house. Let him who is in the field not turn back to get his cloak. The picture there is in the early part of the day. You had a jacket on. It got warm. you took your jacket off, you laid it down, you walked away and you worked. This is so urgent when you see this event happen. Don't even go back and get your coat. Just get out of there. Run. It's time to go. It isn't time to face it and fight. It's time to get out of there. But woe to those who are with child, verse 19, and those who nurse babes in those days. Why? Because that's going to slow you down and you need to get out of there fast. But pray that your flight may be not in the winter or on the Sabbath. Why? and Sabbath would slow you down. In Palestine, if you were a Jew on Sabbath, you don't go anywhere. And if you do try to go anywhere, Jews who are Orthodox will try to keep you from moving. Hope it doesn't happen then. For then there will be a great tribulation, a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now. And by the way, that verse could apply to the destruction of Jerusalem. No tribulation occurred on the earth, thus bad until now, nor ever shall, however, kicks me right into the future. This is the ultimate great tribulation that Jesus is talking of here. The fact is this, that in that day, there will be a letting of blood that is powerful. Zechariah 13, 8 says, two-thirds of the Jews who are trying to flee will be cut off and slain. Verse 9 of that same passage says, One third will be spared, they are called a remnant. In Revelation 6, 9, speaking of this very day, it says that I broke the fifth seal, and underneath the altar of God I saw the souls of the saints who were slain because of the word of God and because of the word of their testimony. And it says in Revelation 17, 6, of this day, that the false system of that day was drunk with the blood of the martyrs. it's clear to me that the saints are going to be there. And the same thing that every generation has needed to survive is hanging on to Jesus for dear life, is what the saints of that generation are going to need as well. But there is a specific word here to them. Get out. There's another thing that's very interesting, something I've never seen before, very exciting, concerning this day. It's in Revelation 12. I want you to turn to it. See, not only will the false system be drunk with the blood of the martyrs, and it will be a dark day for the saints and for the Jew as well, by the way. The truth is this, that in that same period of tremendous turmoil, there will be tremendous power, and some, you see, will be protected. There will be some saints who will be protected. There will be some Jews who will be protected in a supernatural way. Look at Revelation 12, verse 13. It says this, And when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child. Weird verse. What does it mean? The dragon is Satan. The woman is Israel. And the child that Israel gave birth to is who? Jesus. And all of the saints that came from Jesus. Verse 6, look back at that. Chapter 12 of Revelation, verse 6. And the woman fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared by God in the wilderness. Tie that in with Matthew 24. Get out of Judea. Go into the mountains. And it says here that when the woman, that is Israel, fled into the wilderness, there was a place there prepared by God so that she might be nourished there for 1,260 days. Any mathematicians here? How long is that? Thank you. I didn't know. Three and a half years. Three and a half years. What we're talking about here, right here, is the Great Tribulation. The big buddy of Israel has turned. The abomination of desolation has happened. This event in history that marks the last three and a half years of human history has begun. Many, many are slain. Many, many are nourished and prepared and taken care of. It says in verse 7, And there was a war in heaven. Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon and the dragons. And his angels waged war. And they, that is the dragon and his angels, were not strong enough. and there was no longer a place for them found in heaven. And the great dragon was thrown to earth and that's when the persecution happened. The dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, persecuted Israel and the child that was born of Israel, the protector of the saints in this day, the protector of the Jews in this day, literally, is the Archangel Michael. Supernatural, supernatural protection and empowering. In fact, verse 14 says this of chapter 12, and the two wings of the great eagle, and I believe that's a metaphor for the archangel Michael, were given to the woman, that is Israel, and the child and all those of the child in order that she might fly into the wilderness to her place where she was nourished for a time and times and a half a time from the presence of the Spirit. And there it is again, this weird thing, time, times, and half a time. A time is one year, times is two years, and a half a time is a half a year. So what do you have here? Three and a half years. Again, what are we talking about? It's talking about the last three and a half years of human history set into motion by the abomination of desolation, spoken of in Daniel, referred to here by Christ. Back to chapter 24. I warned you. Verse 22. And unless those days had been cut short, No life would have been saved, but for the sake of the elect, but for the sake of the saints in this time, those days shall be cut short. What does that mean, the days will be cut short? Some believe that the time of the tribulation was somehow shortened and made shorter than it normally would have been. I don't believe that's true. All through Scripture, all through prophetic Scripture, the time of the great tribulation is set. What is it? We've heard it all over and over here already. It's three and a half years. 1260 days, 42 months, according to Revelation 13, which is 33 and a half years, a time, times and a half a time, again, which is three and a half years. It doesn't mean that the time itself is shorter. I believe what it means is this, those days themselves will be made shorter. The days themselves were shorter. What are you talking about? I'm talking about this. Revelation 6, 12, Revelation 8, 12, Revelation 16, 10 says this, that in this last period of time, the atmosphere is going to be altered. We spoke of it last week. The sun will be darkened. The daylight will be reduced by a third. And God is going to be so interested in empowering these saints and Jews to be protected during this final time that he's literally going to alter the atmosphere in order to protect them. And it's the darkness of the day that protects them. You get it? The sun's not going to be out as much, so they'll be able to hide. That's the idea. The days themselves were shortened. then in verse 23 then if anyone says to you who are there at that time hiding in caves and staying away behold here is the christ and there he is don't believe him for false christ and false prophets will arise will show great signs and try to draw you out you need to understand something again with this historic perspective of all time it has been from the beginning of time the intention of the dragon if you will satan to destroy the people of god first of all israel the people born of Israel, the people of God, the Christian, the saint. I hate that word Christian. Christian means nothing anymore. The redeemed of the Lord. Satan's function is to destroy them. And in this particular period of history, it's going to be the same. And while they're hiding, there's going to be all these rumors going on. He came back. You missed it. Come on out of your hiding. And they're not telling them that for their good. They're telling them that so they come out and can be then slaughtered. Don't listen to them. Don't listen to these false Christs. They're going to be doing signs and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect. It isn't possible. They're not going to be able to mislead the elect. If possible, they could. That's how good they're going to be. But they will not be able to mislead and deceive the elect. You know why? Because my sheep hear my voice and they know me. And when they hear another voice for a period of time, they might go, It sounds like it might be, but in their spirit they hear my voice, John 10 says. And they don't listen to the deceiver. Let me give you a little sidelight on that issue, away from the text. Viv Hauk, our children's pastor, we were in a staff meeting this last week, and she just was relaying to the staff. She had listened to a tape of a speaker who said this to her, and it really troubled her. it said this, whenever you hear the truth of God, you need to know that it's going to go against the grain because our flesh is so against what God wants that it's going to go against the grain. And every time you hear the truth, one of the ways you'll be able to spot the truth is it'll go against the grain and you've got to go at it anyway. Baloney. In the heart of a redeemed person, you know what? When the heart of a redeemed person hears the voice of their shepherd, hears the real truth of God, you know what goes on in their spirit? They go, yeah, yeah, that's the truth. Redeemed people hear lies all the time, and they go, I suppose I should think that, but that doesn't feel right in my spirit. And then that teacher kind of yells at you, if you're really a Christian, you know God's truth doesn't always sound good. I guess I must go that way. And then they hear the truth, and it does what in their spirit? It resonates. The real truth of God resonates in their spirit. Many false Christs will come. And if you're redeemed, you have an indwelling spirit that gives you a detector. I'll call it a crud detector. And it's that inner thing. It's that inner thing that says, this is baloney, this is garbage. If possible, these guys are going to be so slick, they would mislead even the elect, but they won't be able to. Behold, I've told you this in advance. If they come and say, Behold, he's in the wilderness. Don't go there. Behold, he's in an inner room. He's hiding. He came and nobody knew. Come on. Come on out. Don't go. Don't go. Why was that a warning they'd need to be hearing? Well, I'll tell you this. If this was us, let's say this does happen. Let's say next week, the abomination of desolation happens. We all see it. Okay? If that happens, we aren't having church next week. Well, at least we're not having it here. You know what's going to happen? We will be scattered. The saints will be scattered. There will be a coming together, I suppose, someplace. There will be this incredible chaos in the world. But we'll be coming together. You know what we'll be saying? I think what we'll be saying, among other things, is this. You know what? It's incredible. Things have never been worse. Things have never been more frightening. But the same thing is going to get us through here. is what got us through every other thing in our life, and that is this, our only hope is Jesus. So we're going to hang on to him like we never did before. It's the same thing, the same approach. And then there will be words, oh, you guys missed it. He really came, and he's in Israel now, or he's in Chicago, and he came, and he's hiding in a room, and he's up in Bemidji there, and we'll all go up there and see him. This is such a neat word in verse 27. it isn't going to be like that when jesus comes it's not going to be it's not going to be subtle when jesus comes again it's not going to be quiet it ain't going to be no secret when he comes it isn't going to be hidden it's not going to be behind the scenes he's not going to be a little inner room someplace you know i'm not all my life when i was a little kid i used to i used to get these images that that it was gonna he was gonna come and and i every time i'd walk in the room i told you this last weekend the iron from my mother's ironing would be hot and she wouldn't be there. I go, I got left. I got left. I wonder if he came and I got left. Oh, when he comes, you won't wonder. When he comes, we won't wonder. When he comes, it's going to be like this. No subtle thing. Just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so shall the Son of Man, his coming, the Son of Man, his coming shall be like that. It'll be a cracking of the sky and nobody will wonder if it was really him. That him didn't come. I don't know. You'll know. Everybody will know. And all the enemies of Jesus and all the enemies of the saints and all the enemies of Israel and all the demons of hell and Satan himself will be brought under his feet. And at the feet of Jesus, every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father and he shall reign forever and ever and ever. Every eye will see him in that day. Nobody will wonder. verse 28 wherever the corpse is there the vultures will gather what does that mean? I have absolutely no idea that is the goofiest verse I've ever read You know, I'm studying this passage all week long, and I'm putting all the pieces together, and it's all starting to flow, and then Matthew, what are you doing? Here's what I think it means. When you guys hear all these false Christs crying out like vultures, you need to know something. They're calling you to a corpse. They're not calling you to life. They're calling you to death. But when I come, it's going to be a different picture. It's not going to be a picture of vultures coming around a corpse. It's going to be a picture not of coming to death, but of coming to life. It's not going to be a vulture and a devourer. I'm going to come as a redeemer and a life giver. It will not be characterized by darkness, but light. Literally, a light that flashes from the east unto the west. Let's wrap this up. So Dave, after all of this stuff, what do you think? Do you think we're close to the parousia? Do you think we're close to the full presence, the suntelia, the end of the age? Do you think that maybe in our lifetime we will see this thing you talked about today, this abomination of desolation? Do you think it's possible that we, as saints, who are living here now, will go through even the events of verse 16 through 28? Here's my answer to that. You ready? Write it down. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. and I don't have a lot of energy to spend time speculating as to whether we will or not Matthew or Mark rather 13 32 Jesus said a word again for us just like Acts chapter 1 verse 7 is a word for us he said this of that day this day and of that hour no one knows when this is going to happen not the angels they don't know nor the son he's speaking of himself I don't know only the Father. Leave it up to Him. But you know what? And right out of this text, right out of this text, there is something that I do know for sure. And it's something I absolutely believe, and that is this. That whether or not we are in the end days, and even as I say that maybe we are, I want to just qualify that by saying every believer, including Paul, including Peter, the Thessalonians, everybody believed they were in the end times. Whether we are or not, what I know for sure is this, that God is calling out a people in every generation, from the disciples unto us, from us unto the end of the age. He is calling out a people, a generation who is ready for this. A generation of people, a race of people, a holy nation, a royal priesthood of people who are a redeemed people who have bent their knee to their king, who name the name of Jesus, who belong to him, who overcome in every age, who overcome in every generation, from the disciples' generation, past them up to us, including us, past us into the end of the age, who overcome in every age, not because they're smart, and they overcome not because they're big, and they overcome not because they're strong, They overcome because of one thing, the blood of the Lamb, the blood of the Lamb, the blood of the Lamb will add this, and the word of their testimony embodied in their worship, and they love not their own lives even unto death. I've got a prayer for us as it relates to this. Whether or not we go through this or not, whether or not this is part of our legacy, and we are part of that gathering of the saints, some of whom will be found under the altar, the souls that were slain. or not. What I pray is that the God that called us to this would make us a prepared by the spirit people. You understand that? That we would be in our generation a prepared by the spirit people who are in our age, who are in our own generation, whatever kind of birth pains we experience, a people who love not our own lives, even unto death. And that kind of spirit is not born of, because we're so tough and we're so strong. That kind of spirit that says, I love not my own life even unto death is a spirit that is born by the blood of the Lamb, applied to me, that has washed me clean and empowered me by the Spirit. The full presence, the full end is not yet, but I am not going to leave you alone. You shall receive what? Power when the Holy Spirit comes on you. And by that Spirit indwelling you, that full presence in you, you can be prepared in any age to love not your own lives even unto death. to be a people who can with the authority of God's spirit in them proclaim the excellencies of him who called us out of darkness into his marvelous light forever and ever and ever. We will do that. And in doing that, we join all the saints of the past. And in doing that, we join all the saints of the future, even those at the end. And one day we'll gather on the throne. A holy race, a holy priesthood, a redeemed people washed in the blood of the Lamb.
