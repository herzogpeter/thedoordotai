Let's pray. Let's pray. Lord, the words to that song begin with, there must be more than this. And what occurs to me is I think there's something in the hearts of every human being that yearns for something more than this. And we are people who believe that that more can be found in you and in life in the kingdom of God. And I pray, Father, that as we even find ourselves being drawn to other things and being distracted often by things that we think might produce more, give us this more thing, that we would ever be brought back, we would ever be brought back to life in the kingdom of God and the big story that is the kingdom of God, you as being the center of it all. I pray as we move now to the ministry of the word already in tune I think with the movings of your spirit among us through worship now through the word may your spirits continue to be strong in the word calling us into deeper places and bigger places as it relates to life in your kingdom I pray these things in Jesus name Amen Hi now if you're visiting this morning you're probably wondering why when this guy says hi they clap it's weird it's a very easy crowd um i have been gone for a while just coming off my summer break and uh had a wonderful time uh a good mixture i think of ministry and rest and time with bonnie and our kids, and we married our boys off. Both of them are gone, and it's just, and just having a wonderful time, because it's an amazing thing to have your kids kind of going, and at the same time, they just come back and probably enjoying the best we've ever had with our kids. It's just a good, sweet time, and I'm grateful that while I was gone, just the move of the Spirit among us was strong here at church, and good reports, thankful for people like John Lynch last week, and I know you enjoyed him. And three weeks with Al Shuck, I was able to hear all three of the tapes, or the two of the tapes, and then the communion service. But just so proud of Al. I just, honestly, I felt like God gave a word to us through his pastor heart around community, and just very grateful for that. Today we are returning to, and we'll continue what we have been calling for quite a long time now, a journey with the Holy Spirit, dealing of late with the gifts of the Spirit. Particularly, we've been dealing with what we've called the supernatural gifts of the Spirit as revealed to us by the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter 12. If you have your Bibles, I'd like you to open them to 1 Corinthians chapter 12. We'll pick it up in the 7th verse because in the 7th verse, he calls these particular kinds of gifts, and I'm not going to go back into review because we've talked about different kinds of gifts and categories of gifts. These particular kinds of gifts Paul calls manifestations of the Spirit. Given for the common good of the body, for the building up of the body, so that by these manifestations of the Spirit, what I heard one writer call the dancing hands of God in the body of Christ, by these manifestations of the Spirit, we can, as a people, become who God's called us to be, and we can by these manifestations of the Spirit do in the world what God has called us to do. For to one is given the word of wisdom, he says in verse 8, through the Spirit this comes to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit to another, gifts of faith. We spent four weeks talking about the gift of faith. We spent several weeks talking about the word of knowledge and the word of prophecy and word of wisdom. And today we come now to gifts of healing. and the effecting of miracles by the Spirit. Miracles. What's a miracle? Well, first of all, I would say that when I talk about miracles, I'm not talking about the fact that you got your family to church on time today without any major fights. Though when our kids were little, that actually was a minor miracle. I'm talking about what is literally translated as the dunamis. The word miracle is the Greek word dunamis, and it simply means the power of God. It is the operation or the effecting of the power of God. It's a gift to the church, says Paul. 1 Corinthians 2, verse Paul. Paul is speaking to the Corinthians about his time with them, and he says, you remember when I was with you that my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration or manifestation of the Spirit and of power, which means a number of things. At one level, that undoubtedly means that his message and preaching had a supernatural effect on the hearts of people in ways that the people hearing didn't even understand, that there was an impact through his message and his preaching on the lives of people that went beyond the fact that Paul was a really smart guy. Though I think Paul was a really smart guy, The effect that his words and his message were having on the internal realities of the human heart couldn't be explained by just this good argument and this quick mind that Paul had. It was a demonstration of the Spirit. It was a demonstration of power. The operation of power was happening through his preaching, his message. But at another level, this operation of power also means that his message and his preaching were attended by signs and wonders. By the effecting of miracles and gifts of healing. Manifestations of power that Paul now in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 calls gifts of the Spirit. Verse 11 of chapter 12 says, one in the same spirit works all these things. The operative word there would be all these things. All of these manifestations. The spirit of God works all of them, distributing to each one individually just as he wills. For what purpose? For the building up of the body so that we can become who God's called us to be and do what God's called us to do in the world. Now, as we begin this part of our journey with the Holy Spirit, dealing now with gifts of healing and the operation of miracles, which is for some people kind of a scary part of the journey. I want to begin the journey by talking a little bit about our journey in this as a church, my journey as an individual. You see, I spent the first 30 years of my life, and if you dial into that, that would be most of my life, being taught and therefore believing that these particular gifts, supernatural gifts of healing and miracles, the operation of power, that these kinds of gifts are not for today, that they ceased being functional at the end of what's called the apostolic era. And the apostolic era ceased when the original 12 disciples ceased. The explanation I was given pretty much my whole life as to why these gifts ceased goes something like this, that the supernatural gifts of the Spirit, particularly signs and wonders, miracles, healings, etc., were necessary and active in the early church, in the early part of the church's life for a variety of reasons. Number one was this, to firmly establish the church in its infancy. The thinking there would be to kind of, to be giving the church a boost, if you will, with signs and wonders, kind of starting with a bang. And if you think about it and you look at a story that kind of makes sense, when the Spirit landed with power in Acts chapter 2, at Pentecost the Spirit came and there was this explosion. And because of the supernatural nature of it, thousands of people at a very short period of time came to Christ. And that's why we were told the gifts of the Spirit were very strong in the early days to affirm and establish the church. The second reason was to authenticate in the early days the apostles as the writers of scriptures. As the foundation layers of church doctrine. 2 Corinthians 12, 12 says, For the signs of a true apostle are these signs and wonders. And the signs and wonders and the miracles were given to the apostles in the early days to affirm that they actually did have apostolic authority. Therefore, when they wrote the scriptures, we would know they were the scriptures. Much like Christ. And this was one of the explanations I always heard, and it is true, by the way, of why Jesus manifested signs and wonders and miracles. It was to affirm his deity, to affirm that he was indeed God. In fact, Peter at Pentecost in Acts chapter 2.22 says this. It's explaining what was happening. He begins to preach Jesus. And Acts 2.22 says, Men of Israel, listen to these words. Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with signs and wonders which God performed among you. He attested to the deity of Christ, the reality that he really was God through these signs and wonders. And that was the purpose of these gifts in the early days. There was one other reason we were told, and this was also true, that signs and wonders were part of the early church. And that was that it was there to prove and to affirm over and over again that the kingdom of God had authority over the kingdom of darkness. And that every time the kingdom of light that Jesus was bringing, the kingdom of God came in contact with the kingdom of darkness. It was very important that it be clearly demonstrated the kingdom of God had authority. And this was kind of seen in some of the deliverance issues of Jesus when he would come across people who were demonically oppressed or even upset, whatever, some word. They're demonized. Possessed. There you go. Eventually. All these words locked in my brain. I can't always unlock them. There would be what is called a power encounter. And the power of the kingdom of God that Jesus was walking in would come against this dark power, and every time there needed to be a demonstration of power, and that's why demons were cast out, because these two kingdoms were in conflict. Now, while signs and wonders in the early church did indeed do all those four things, the contention of this cessationist view that I grew up with, which is called dispensationalism, is that those things were pretty much the only purpose for these gifts. So when those purposes were fulfilled, in other words, when the church was established, when the apostles' authority was confirmed and the Bible was written, those gifts, those supernatural gifts, ceased to exist because they were no longer needed. No longer needed, why? Well, the church was established, we had the Bible, that was the explanation, and it was an explanation that for a long period of time in my life I accepted and indeed taught. But even in those years where I was accepting that teaching as true and teaching that teaching as well, it always made me wonder, really? We no longer need a demonstration of power to affirm the reality of Jesus because everybody already believes, okay? We no longer need demonstrations of power to kind of get underneath and give some veracity to the truth of Scripture because we already have and everybody already believes the Bible. You kind of have to push those thoughts out of your mind. But I wondered, I wondered, has the kingdom of darkness ceased its operation of power too? Was there a deal made? Because if the kingdom of darkness hasn't ceased its operation of power, But the kingdom of God and the gifts God gives to the church to do what he's called us to do, if those gifts have all been taken away, specifically the supernatural ones, but the kingdom of darkness still has supernatural ones, don't think these thoughts, Dave. You're kind of left wondering what weapons do we have if we don't have an operation of power, if there aren't gifts of healing and demonstrations that the kingdom, supernatural demonstrations that the kingdom of light has authority and power over the kingdom of darkness. What weapons do we have? Turns out, the weapons we had were slick programs. And a lot of our energy would go, let's have the slickest one in town. That'll be our weapon. And the latest trends, that'll be our weapon. And really intelligent arguments as to why Jesus really is God. And I'm telling you what, we need really intelligent arguments. But I get a little scared when I think that's the only weapon we have because I'm not that smart. We need somebody a lot smarter. Entertaining preachers, really good music. Turns out the weapons we have would be religion, maybe really nice and pretty and slick-looking religion. This made me wonder. This made me wonder. Growing up with this perspective that the gifts aren't for today, we found a way to be comfortable with certain kinds of gifts. It's part of the story, my story, our story even as a church. gifts of knowledge and wisdom and faith and even prophecy those gifts that we just got done talking about for several weeks in the context I grew up in of dispensationalism we were very comfortable with those gifts as long as you define them a certain way prophecy for instance would be embraced as a gift that's for today as long as you identify that or define it as preaching forth telling that would be the prophetic expression and it is one but gifts of knowledge were the supernatural gifts that really smart people had, and the gift of wisdom was the supernatural gift that really wise people had, and the gift of faith was that just incredible thing that some people you know who have a lot of faith, they got that really special gift of faith thing, but it was weird too, because in those days, we never call it a word of knowledge. Word of knowledge, that sounded too charismatic, so we would just kind of keep it at knowledge. But we found a way to be comfortable with and tell people that these are gifts, and we were supposed to discover our gift, whether we had knowledge, or nobody in our church had knowledge. We're all stupid people. So, anyway. But when it came to these miraculous gifts, signed gifts, the operation of power, the gift of healing, and then especially tongues was very controversial, which we'll get into, and I'm just going to put that off as long as I can. None of that was for today. It was kind of like God used to do those things, praise the Lord, hallelujah, but he doesn't anymore, so don't get your hopes up. Indeed, indeed, nobody ever said this, and I don't even remember ever saying this, but I remember thinking in my mind, it was as if there was a line in the text of 1 Corinthians 12, verse 9, that there was almost like a line right in the middle of verse 9 to another faith by the Spirit. Everything above that line we thought was for today, but now you get into miracles and healings, everything below that line, none of that exists. There was a line in the text. Only charismatics believe that these gifts are for today, and you know about them. you know charismatics they're emotionally unstable they're biblically illiterate they're a mile wide and an inch deep don't go there whatever you do so I didn't now a number of things began to converge to change my mind about that and it's part of my journey and it's part of our church's journey and I think it's an important journey again to talk about as we're again on this journey. Among them was something I think I inherited. I think that you can inherit, well, you obviously inherit physical attributes from your parents and generations of your family. I think that you can inherit spiritual DNA as well. And I'm pretty sure that part of what I inherited spiritually from my ancestry spiritually was a hunger. for more. You see, I have never, ever, even when I would be real defensive and talk about how the power of God and the miracles and the healings they aren't for today, even when I was in that mode, even then, I never had, I never had much confidence in the power of methods or fads or formulas to do the work of the kingdom. And the longer I've been in ministry, the more convinced I am that the depth of people's pain, that the hopelessness sometimes of their despair and lostness and blindness just cannot be touched or healed by human stuff. And out of that awareness, there comes bubbling up a hunger for more. You see, there's just got to be more. There must Be More Than This. There's got to be more than good talks. Now, I think good talks are better than bad talks. There's got to be more. There's got to be more than cool songs. And I think cool songs are better than stupid songs. There's got to be more than that, there's got to be more than slick programs and the latest wind of what's working to reach the culture. seems to me, wouldn't it be something if there really could be a demonstration, a manifestation of the dunamis, the power of God to make hearts come alive, to make blind eyes see. But God doesn't do that anymore. So kind of let it go, let it just be this hunger you have. but I had the hunger. In addition to the hunger came my and our churches working with the text. I'll never forget it. It was 20 years ago right around this time and the reason I know it this week I went back to this section of scripture pulled out my notes and at the top of one of the pages in fact it was 1 Corinthians 12 verse 9 I was teaching and I don't know why I said it that day but my first words were I've been here five years. I did the math. 20 years ago was the first time I went through the book of 1 Corinthians verse by verse. It's a what, 32-year-old man applying as best I could pretty much right out of seminary the principles of good exegesis. I was just so strict and actually quite anal about it. Making sure as best I could that I didn't read into the text. That would be eisegesis. You read into it all your preconceived notions and make it say what you want it to say. I wanted to do good exegesis where I let the text talk and exit. To exit out of the text what it's really saying. Well, in the process of doing that exegesis, we'd been in 1 Corinthians for a little over a year when we came to 1 Corinthians chapter 12. And I came to 1 Corinthians chapter 12, verse 9, and I did a week on the gift of faith, and rah, rah, rah, and I was kind of scared because I knew the next one I was going to have to tell people. But after this thing in verse 9, there's a line in the text, and none of these are for today, Except when I went into the text this time, trying to do good exegesis and not trying to read into it anything I had already believed. For the life of me, I couldn't find that line. I couldn't find a disclaimer that said in between the lines, maybe even somewhere subtle in the Greek. By the way, the Greek word here means none of these are for today. I couldn't find any of that stuff in the text. And that began to stir in me two things. Number one was fear. Fear? yeah I was afraid and what I was afraid of was I was going to have to break with my tradition I was going to have to disagree with people I respected whose opinion mattered to me and many of them were in our church I'd only been there five years I think we had a church of about 300 people at the time and to give you some perspective on this I could tell you a story when I first came Church of the Open Door was part of a denomination called the Christian and Missionary Alliance Christian and Missionary Alliance has what they call a fourfold gospel it's a wonderful kind of expression of what we believe And it's this, that Jesus is our Savior, our Sanctifier, our Healer, and our coming King. And I remember reading the material when I was candidating and just wondering about whether I was going to come to the church or not. And I loved the Savior part, and I loved the Sanctifier part, and I loved the coming King part. But the Healer thing was kind of, what? And I remember going to the elders when I was candidating. They had questions for me. Well, I had questions for them. What about this healing thing? Are you guys weird? And the elders at that time comforted me by telling me, Dave, don't worry about it. We haven't prayed for healing for anybody here for years. And what's really weird is that that actually did comfort me. But telling you that story gives you a little bit of perspective why when I began to come to this place where I was just trying to say what the text said, I was going to have to change my mind about something. But something else was stirring in me besides fear. You know what it was? Hope. That maybe there really is more than me being smart and us having a slick program. I'd been in the ministry long enough to know I wasn't that smart and our program never has been slick. So I preached that day 20 years ago. 1 Corinthians 12, verse 9. With fear and trembling, I remember it very clearly. I can actually see it in my mind's eye. It's a crystal building with a great big wooden pulpit that dwarfed me. Those were the days I still wore a suit and tie. It's funny to me now when people come to church with a suit and tie, they are a what? Visitor. Yeah, that's cool. Of all the things I said that day, the two I remember most are these. The first was this. I said out loud, like for the first time. Maybe that doesn't sound radical, but in those days, this was radical for me. I said out loud, folks, I used to think there's a line there, there's no line there. I no longer believe what I've always believed, that the gifts are not for today. I believe they are, at least by basis of the text. Second thing I said that I remember is this, that if I'm wrong about that, if the operation of power actually isn't for today, I'm at the point where I'll just have to leave the ministry. Because if there is no operation of power, then it's all up to me and it's all up to you to grow this church. It's all up to me, and it's all up to you to heal the brokenhearted people that we know. If there is no operation of power, it's all up to me. It's all up to you to save the marriage. I'm going to have to be a really good counselor. I'm not that good a counselor. In fact, they don't let me counsel here because people come, they have a problem, and I say, well, what are you doing? And I stop doing that, and I'm not helpful. You see, if it's all up to me, here's what I know. Here's what I know. If it's all up to me and it's all up to you, by being smart enough and funny enough and slick enough, if it's all up to us, I already know I don't have what it takes. And neither do you. Without power. The real kicker in that story of preaching that sermon 20 years ago where I kind of made a break with what I used to think is that, this is really a true story. The day after I preached that sermon and felt like I was kind of Declaration of Independence and I was scared to death, and okay, I did it. The next day I got on a plane to Kansas City with a group of our elders to attend a signs and wonders conference led by a guy named John Wimber. Now, if you have to know John Wimber, you know why that's funny, because that conference ruined me. I felt like God had set me up in the best possible way. Because I did come back weird, not only believing that the power of the kingdom was for today, but we began to try to figure out how to do this. I asked the Spirit to come and move among us with power to heal the human heart and body and restore. Now, that was a long time ago, which means I've had a lot of time to think about the reasons why I was in those days so averse to and afraid of this kind of thing and why sometimes, to be quite honest, I still am afraid of these things because three things still linger for me in moving in these kinds of things. The first is this, a very strong impression I have, and it's one I think some of you have as well, that people who move in these kinds of things, ministries of healing and operation of power, that people who move in these things are just plain weird. There are porch lights on, but nobody's home. Past weird, and this is, you know, the weird thing is one thing, but past weird, sometimes I have seen, and you have as well, people who it seems like they're just being dishonest, pretending that there are things happening that aren't happening, declaring healings that haven't really happened, and it leaves you wondering, yeah, who falls for this stuff? And it leaves me sometimes vowing, I never will. That's a version number one. Do you know what I'm talking about? Well, it turns out there's some other people who have noticed this as well. Just take a look at this. Well, amen. Praise the Lord be saved. Lord Jim Bob, welcome. God bless you. Jim Bob, how long have you had these headaches? About five, ten minutes. God help him. And how do you feel now? Well, it's a throbbing. God bless you. A thriving headache comes right up through your heels, up through the hip bone, the knee bone, up the spine, up through your back, through your head, like Satan was belching through his head. Exactly. Do you believe? I believe. He believes. Hallelujah. Amen. God bless. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Rid this man of these headache demons, of these migraine demons. Heal this man! Amen! Amen! Hallelujah! Oh, good God, Miss Molly! How do you feel, son? My headache is gone, but... God bless him! Is there anything else I can do for you? No, no. Good God bless you! Praise be! Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much! Ouch! Okay, okay, okay. That's mean, I know. But that leads to the second version. It's kind of tied into the first, and that is this, of not only that kind of thing, and that's way over the top, obviously, but it's of being associated with that kind of stuff. I mean, I had this fear of the word kind of going out, Dave's going charismatic, which in circles I used to run in meant Dave has become an idiot. And one of the big things I had to deal with was this whole issue of pride as it relates to wondering what people think. Now add to that, add to all of that, a theology that's deeply embedded in me and in many of you clearly said none of this is for today, almost kind of a disobedience if you move toward this stuff. Add to that a Western worldview that all of us are part of because of where we live, a Western worldview rooted in secularism and rationalism. You stir all of that together and you not only have an aversion to this stuff but you could quite easily develop a deep-seated spirit of unbelief which for some of you may be the first thing that needs to be healed as we begin our journey. Matthew 13, 58, for example. Jesus had been moving in the power of the Spirit for quite some time when he came to a city called Nazareth which was his hometown, as you know, where it says he did not do many miracles because of their what? Unbelief. Beloved, there are, and in the course of our journey with this ministry of healing and the gifts of healing, we're going to discover that there are many reasons why sometimes when we pray for someone, they aren't healed. And while this is not always the reason, sometimes it is unbelief. We're going to talk about many miracles that have a lot to do with faith. We're going to see a lot of miracles that Jesus did that had nothing to do with anybody's faith. But sometimes, the inability to receive, the inability, I don't know if I want to say it quite that way, of God to even move, has to do with unbelief, which is why I say for some of us, this might be the first thing that needs to be healed. Or unbelief. By the way, a little side note, and this might be clear already, we are going to talk about healing, and when we do that, we think automatically of physical healing, and that certainly is included. But when we talk about healing, I want you to expand your mind. We have a God who heals. He is a restorer. And healing applies to the need for healing of the heart, healing of the soul, healing of hope. The ultimate healing is when people spiritually go from death to life. Just wrap this up. Let me give you four reasons. I've talked to you about why, for years, scared to death to move into this stuff. Let me tell you four reasons why now we do. Here's one reason, because Jesus did it. Now, for some of you, that's a reason why we wouldn't do it, because he's God and you're not. Hang with me here for a second. The primary pattern of Jesus' ministry involved two things, actually. Over and over again, we hear of Jesus, and you see this at the very beginning in Matthew 4, verse 23, doing two things. He would, number one, proclaim the gospel of the kingdom, and then he would do what I would call do the gospel of the kingdom. Matthew 4, 23 says, and Jesus was going about in all of Galilee, and this is at the very beginning of his ministry, doing two things. Number one, teaching and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, the good news that the rule and reign of God is within your reach. You can enter into this big story. But he also did the kingdom. He proclaimed the power of the kingdom, and then he put it on display, healing every kind of disease and sickness among the people. But it doesn't just stop with Jesus, and it's why I call this the pattern for his ministry, because then he came to the twelve one day in Matthew chapter 10, and he commissioned them to do the very same thing. Matthew 10, verse 1, and having summoned his twelve disciples, he gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out, and to heal every kind of sickness. Verse 5, these 12, Jesus sent out after instructing them, commanding them to do basically two things. In verse 7 and 8 of the same chapter, verse 7, I want you to proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God. In verse 8, I want you to do the kingdom of God. Cast out these demons, operate in the power of God. But that was just the 12, and it kind of still fits the paradigm of what I grew up in. And it was Jesus and the 12. And when the 12 died, all that went away. But the problem is that Jesus gave this authority to more than the 12. He told and he sent the 70. There was a group of 70. He did the same thing. The point is this. This was the pattern of his ministry in Luke chapter 10, verse 1. It says that Jesus appointed 70 others, not just the 12, 70 others, and sent them two by two. And he told them, I want you to do two things, verse 9. I want you to proclaim the kingdom. Two, I want you to do the kingdom. In other words, heal those who are sick, and when they're healed, tell them the kingdom has come near you. That's the good news. That's the good news. The kingdom of God, and it didn't stop there, beloved, because after that, and you know the rest of the story, he then commissioned the church, and all of you haven't heard the great commission in this context, but it needs to be heard in this context as well as other contexts. In Matthew 28, 18, it's his final word to the church, this is what I want you to do. Began in verse 18 by saying, reminding them, all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. Do you know that? Well, it was the risen Jesus who was saying it, so they knew it more than they ever had. And now he's saying, this authority that I have in heaven and earth, I'm giving it to you. Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations. Make them apprentices of me, followers of me, men and women who say what I said and do what I did, and make them apprentices of Jesus, disciples do that, Jesus said, by teaching them to observe all that I commanded you to do. And part of what Jesus commanded them to do, the 12, and then the 70, and now them, and now he's given to the church, part of what Jesus commanded them to do was, number one, proclaim the good news of the kingdom, and number two, do the kingdom. Beloved, at the core of the gospel, that we preach. Part of what makes the good news good news is that we have a God who heals. He is Jehovah Rapha, the God who heals. He is, at the very core, a restorer. I mean, if you think of the whole length and breadth of redemptive history, it's all about God taking what was spoiled in the garden and inviting people into a story that will be part of, in cooperation with God, bringing the restoration, bringing the healing to the land, to the hearts of people, to the souls of people who can be reconciled and healed in their relationship with God. Can experience that same thing in their bodies as well as the Spirit would decide to distribute these gifts. Thus our journey begins. one of the things I felt a nudge about as we began this journey was that whatever it is I preach from week to week and I can tell you where we're going to go one of the things I want to do is I want to look at the healings of Jesus it's not the only thing we're going to do but I want to look at them and we're going to discover that in addition to his healings there are subplots that are very interesting and it even makes sometimes the healing that he did almost a subplot to something else that was going on, and I think it's going to be really an interesting part of our journey, but that at the end of every sermon on healing, I want to have a time for ministry, where we, I like how John Wimber defines faith. He says, faith is spelled R-I-S-K. We're at the end of all these sermons where we declare what God can do. We're going to ask him to do it and bring some healing. I want you to stand with me as we close. Let me just pray. Let me pray. Father, I pray that we pray that as we begin, it's ironic to say we're beginning this journey. We've been on this journey for a very long time, but in a real pointed way, I think you're calling us to some deeper places. And I just ask your spirit to be very active right now, even in me and others around to even, I don't want to get ahead of you today. I don't want to lag behind what you might want to do this morning. So help me, help us hear what you're saying and doing. Yesterday I was out running just before church. Well, it was Saturday morning. We live close here, and so I ran by the church, and it was empty. And I was on the way back, and I looked at the church. And I was praying, thinking about the service. I just was praying, Spirit come, Holy Spirit come. And I was a little troubled by how to close. And I said, Lord, do you have anything? I don't know what to do. I'm not exactly sure. I don't get up there and look stupid. And I got, I hate looking stupid. But I got what I thought was a word and I'm gonna go with it now. That at least, there may be other things God wants to do this morning. But that, at least to begin this journey, I was supposed to pray for people who, to begin this journey, you need some healing in your faith. That unbelief needs to be healed. And I felt like God was telling me I needed to pray for people who were like that. So if that applies to you, I want you to come down right now, wherever you are. Just leave where you are. I know there's, oh, maybe one. I'll wait for you. Lord we believe help our unbelief we're not going to be pretenders but we don't want to let unbelief we don't want to let unbelief build a wall around our heart for what you might want to give us let's keep coming I'll wait I'm going to ask the prayer team people call them purple cord people that's how we identify you to just kind of quietly come around and just be among us here and come around some of these people for support you know what like just like a child who's asking their parents for a gift and you want something just hold out your hands would you do that I don't want to be goofy here but just do that let's pray Holy Spirit come we are people who desire to live in the big story of your kingdom and these men and women have come here saying they need some healing some more than others Father I want to do something else right now I want to include people who maybe haven't come forward and they're feeling now that if they aren't up here they can't receive anything from you and I just call that a lie right now but I pray in Jesus name you would come with gifts of healing for the struggle we have with unbelief I literally I see a wall around some of our hearts a wall around some of our hearts so afraid of being duped so afraid of a false hope and there's that word fear again Holy Spirit oh God we need your help to uproot this fear perfect love casts out fear it is your love it is your compassion that gives these gifts to begin with it's not because we deserve them you just give them try out fear uproot fear Holy Spirit if that is the root of this unbelief Holy Spirit come to those places and uproot that in us and drive drive it out of our church I pray for more and more freedom among us to worship you and to receive from you your gifts just let the spirit of God give you and speak to you what he needs to speak to you and now let me just expand it out there may be others here who need healing for something else beyond this and because I have anything to stir up or y'all scream about, but I just believe the power of the Spirit is here to heal. And so as we are dismissed in just a few moments, I'm going to encourage those of you who just want to just sit in this for a while and be with God, you do that. But others may need prayer for something very specific. And you find someone, you come forward right now, you find someone with that purple cord or a red cord and you ask them to pray. And as I kind of release our prayer team to pray, I want to say something kind of to them and to you as well. I just kind of take off our prayer people. Any responsibility, you have to heal anybody. You're not a healer, you're a prayer. What you do is you ask the Spirit to come for people for healing. The Spirit heals. The Spirit of God heals. Holy Spirit, come. For all the things we need to be healed of, Lord. I don't have a list. It's too long. I'm overwhelmed. Pour. Pour out your spirit. Bring healing to people who can't get to a prayer person. Where we're standing. In our cars as we leave. I pray, Father, that you bring this anointing and this pouring and this healing out of these doors. In fact, God, on this first day, I want to again declare that we want to break the idea that this is where it happens. At least this is the only place it happens. It isn't. That we would bring this into our families, into our workplaces in gentle and not obnoxious ways. Bring the healing of your kingdom to our friends and marriages and hearts. stir it up in our hearts stir it up in our hearts you
