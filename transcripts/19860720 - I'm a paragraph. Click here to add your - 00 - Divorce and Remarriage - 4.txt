Okay, open your Bibles with me to Matthew chapter 19. I think most of you know that this is the final night in a mini-seminar that we have been doing. This is something that was given birth from our study in 1 Corinthians in the morning. We came to 1 Corinthians 7. We saw the Apostle Paul dealing with an issue that is of extreme import to us, that of divorce and remarriage. We realized at the time that the time we needed to deal with that in depth on a Sunday morning was not sufficient. We wanted to move on to 1 Corinthians, so we have taken these last three Sunday nights to do this in a seminar kind of setting. But what we've done is after we got into 1 Corinthians 7, we bounced and heard Paul's commentary on divorce and remarriage. We bounced over to Matthew 19 to hear the original teaching of Jesus when he first dealt with this whole issue with the Pharisees concerning marriage, divorce, and then remarriage. And let's just very quickly run through a quick review. before we even get into the text or something i want to reaffirm first of all let's pray i need to pray again lord i just thank you for again our opportunity to get into the word and father i pray for my own spirit now that i would be able to direct my attention to this and put all the other things aside uh this is vitally important and just quiet me in my spirit in jesus name amen need to reaffirm something we said at the very outset of this whole issue very often in our dealings with the issue of marriage and divorce and remarriage, we make two, what I think, are very serious mistakes. The first mistake we make is that some people look at the problem of divorce and remarriage, and what they see is the people who are involved, and they see pain. And there is a lot of pain involved in that. And they see the hurt, and they see the blood all over the place, emotionally speaking. And one of the responses we have as believers to people who are heard is that we want to heal. And that's a very positive response. But the problem is that sometimes in an effort to heal, to accomplish the healing, we end up lowering the standard of God to accommodate people. And that's a problem. And people who do that, we would probably call liberals, okay? There's another problem, however, that is just as serious. And that is this, that other people look at the problem of divorce and they see it out of control. And they see the problem and the people involved, and they see the pain too. But the problem that they see is skyrocketing divorce, social disintegration, and not only that, but they see it invading the church, and the impulse that we have is we need to stop this, and that is a good impulse. But sometimes, instead of lowering the standard to deal with the problem, some people take the standard of God and make it higher than God ever intended it to be and put some people under a yoke of bondage that God never really intended. Our desire is not to have a cause about divorce and remarriage either way, to try to accommodate people and make them feel better, or to sound real holy and make it higher than God ever intended. Our purpose and our intent is to try, objectively as possible, to find out what the Word of God says about the issue. Let's move quickly through what we've done so far. Matthew 19, verse 1, we pick up where we left off. The setting we see in 19, 1 through 2 is this. It came about when Jesus had finished these words. He departed from Galilee, came into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan. And great multitudes followed him and he healed them there. We realize from our study before that his Galilean ministry is over here. He is now beginning what is called the Perean ministry. He's turned a corner in his ministry. Everything that he's doing right now is escalating toward the cross. He's got that in his mind. The cross is imminent, okay? And when that happens, some old friends of his called the Pharisees come up to him. and that leads into point two of our outline, the confrontation. The Pharisees came to him testing him and asking him a question that was no question at all. The reason they were asking him the question was to what? It was to trick him, to put him into a corner and embarrass him, to get him to lose credibility with the people who had been under the pharisaical teaching that said you could divorce for any cause and they really liked that teaching and they were doing just that along with the Pharisees. They were doing it as well. So if they could get Jesus to take a strong stand against divorce, that he would lose his following with the people because it wouldn't be popular. They also thought that possibly he would lose his life because Herod Antipas, the guy who beheaded John the Baptist, was the ruler of that area, and he could get in trouble from him. Okay, that was the confrontation. The counterpunch that Jesus gave was in verses 4 through 7. Spent a lot of time in this. Jesus answered and said, have you not read? Very sarcastic. The fact is that these guys were Pharisees. Their jobs were to study the law of God. He's going back to the very beginning and sarcastically saying, you guys who study the law, don't you even know what it says in the very beginning? The very beginning, it says this. God made them in the beginning, male and female. And then he went on from there saying, this cause man shall leave his father and mother, cleave to his wife, the two shall become one flesh. Then in verse six, what therefore God has joined together, let no man put asunder. He gave four reasons there that divorce is not lawful. As the Pharisees came and said, is it lawful to divorce for any cause? He says there's four reasons why divorce is not lawful for any cause. The first reason is because of God's intention. His intention is one man, one woman, no alternatives, no options. That's verse 4. The other reason it is not lawful for any cause is the strong bond concept, to leave and to cleave, stuck together, verse 5. The other is the one flesh principle. The two become one. One is the indivisible number, okay? That's verse 5. And the fourth reason was it is an act of God. Marriage is an act of God. It is God created. Just buzzing through this very quickly. Confrontation number two, the argument, verse 7. They came back. This is something that they came back very quickly with from the text. You're led to believe that they had this all planned out, ready to go. If I can get them to be discredited and disagree with us, that's one thing. But if I can get him to disagree with Moses, then we've really got him. Why then did Moses command to give her a certificate and divorce her? You will remember from last week, we spent tons of time going through the text that this passage is drawn from. The Pharisees had built their entire doctrine of divorce and remarriage around Deuteronomy chapter 24, one through four. It was based on a misinterpretation of that passage. The passage is talking about a man who had a wife. The wife committed some indecency. She was sent away for that indecency. He divorced her. Their interpretation of that, by the way, then it goes on in that passage to talk about the fact that when she remarried, having been divorced for an illegitimate cause, that she committed adultery. The only command in that whole passage had to do with remarriage when you have been divorced for an illegitimate cause. They took that passage, interpreted it to mean that Moses had commanded them to get a divorce when your wife acts in an indecent way. They then further went on to give all sorts of wonderful definitions to what an indecency is. If Moses has commanded me to give my wife a writ of divorce, if she commits some indecent act, then I am acting in a spiritual manner if I do that divorce. Get it? okay now if i can define indecency in all sorts of broad ways then i can get divorced for any cause that's exactly what was happening and you remember that we talked about this in depth and talked about the fact that an indecency began to be defined as seeing a woman who was prettier than my wife because in comparison it made my wife look indecent okay if she burns your bagels that's a good enough reason that's an indecent thing so i can divorce my wife for that their teaching had become so they had embraced this teaching so much that it actually began to be that divorce was a virtue among the Pharisees. Let me give you some quotes from the Talmudic writings of the rabbis. It says this, among those who will never behold the face of hell is he who has a bad wife. Why? Because such a man is saved from hell because he has expiated his sins here on earth for having to tolerate a bad wife. Further, it says this, a bad wife is like leprosy to her husband. The remedy? Let him divorce her and be cured of his disease. Not only let her divorce her, but it is his religious duty to divorce her. It is the spiritual thing to do. That's how twisted their theology had come. Now, it is important that we realize that when Jesus gives the teaching on divorce here, that that is the attitude that he is addressing. He is addressing hard-hearted people. He is not addressing people who are broken by relationships that have been crumbling around their ears and trying to heal them. He is talking to people who are hard-hearted, who are getting divorced for any cause. Not only that, they are promoting other people to do the same thing. And the result is a proliferation of adultery, not only among the Pharisees, but through the whole culture. It's coming down from the religious people, however. That was the point. We see Jesus then come back with the counterpunch in verses 8 and 9. He says this, what you need to understand is that Moses never did command divorce. He did permit it, however. He never did command it. He did permit it. Because of your hardness of heart, Moses, key word, permitted, not commanded, you to divorce your wives. But from the beginning, it was not this way. It was never God's design. Moses did not command it. He did permit it. And even when he did permit it, it was only in the case of hard-hearted adultery. Remember that? We went into that deeply last time. I don't have the time to explain all of that. And even then, even when it was in the case of hard-hearted adultery, divorce was permitted only because of God's mercy in that it didn't result in death. Remember that? Deuteronomy 22, the Old Testament dealing with adultery in that time was death. We saw God begin to act mercifully among his people when he began to permit divorce. So Jesus in this passage simply reiterates the Old Testament principle. The question was this, can you get a divorce for any cause? The answer was no. Why? Because from the beginning, God never intended that. Question number two, why then did Moses command that you give your wife a writ of divorce? The answer is he didn't command it, but in the case of hardness of heart, he did permit it. He did permit it. We began to touch on remarriage in that context last time. I'm not going to mention that now because we're going to go into it more when we get to 1 Corinthians 7. Now, at that point, the Pharisees leave, okay? At that point, the Pharisees leave. They disappear. One of the reasons I believe they disappear at the end of verse 9 is that Jesus has just exposed them as adulterers and also promoters of the same thing because their theology was promoting that very thing. So they are unmasked and embarrassed. But now he's got a new audience in verse 10, and the audience is the disciples. They are absolutely enraptured with this teaching. They have never heard anything like it, because it is a bold confrontation of their culture. It is also a bold confrontation of what they think. We're going to see that in what they say. The scene moves to a house in verse 10, and Jesus' teaching just is leaving them kind of struggling. And then their classic line comes when he is talking about what happens if you leave your wife, and speaking of the permanence of marriage, both for the husband and the wife, and if you leave your wife for an illegitimate cause, the only legitimate cause being for immorality or hard-hearted adultery, and marries another, you commit adultery, and then these guys with their wide eyes say, man alive, if a relationship of a man with his wife is like this, it's better not to marry. They even had the attitude that if this thing, this turkey doesn't work out, I'll just downloader. No big deal. That wraps up Matthew 19. I want you to flip now to 1 Corinthians 7, which is the scene of the crime. This is where this whole thing began for us. Several weeks ago, on a Sunday morning, we preached through, starting in verse 8 through verse 40. Now, I am not going to give you anything brand new on this text. What I want to do, because I think this is so important and so involved, I wanted to do basically the very same thing. I'm just going to walk through this text with you. You have got a sheet in your hand, and I want you to be able to walk out of here with a written thing that you can look at to figure this whole thing out for yourself. Hopefully it will make sense and come clearer even than the time that we preached through it before. You remember that this teaching is coming to a group of people who are living in a society much like our own. There's a lot of confusion about marriage and sex and singleness and all of that kind of stuff, and we've been addressing that for several weeks. This, however, is not being addressed to pharisaical, hard-hearted people like Matthew 19. This is being addressed to people who are coming out of that culture where their lives really have indeed been messed up. Some of these people have been living with their girlfriend or their boyfriend. You remember the four different kinds of marriages? Some of them were slaves where they had no legal rights to marry. And the slave owner would give them permission to live in what was called tent companionship. And they would never really be married. And if the slave owner wanted to change his mind and put him with someone else, that would be fine. So some of these slaves who are now becoming redeemed, part of the Corinthian church, might have had four or five different wives. And they come into Paul and they say, what's our status now? What am I supposed to do? I feel like an adulteress. I never knew the law of God before. And now I see it. I see what I've done. what's my status? Can I remarry? Should I go back to that original? Some of these guys were being saved out of a situation where one day they were laying down with a temple priestess prostitute. The next day they were redeemed by the blood of Christ and they're asking this. Should I go marry that prostitute? What should I do? Some of them were married and divorced. Legally married the first time. Now they're living with somebody for six years. They never really legally got married. What should I do? We got three kids. Should I break this relationship? Go back to that first husband. on and on and on. It's very confusing. Much like people that we come in contact with in our culture when they get saved out of the society that we live in. Lots of questions, lots of problems, none of them easy. And we're going to be able to see that, again, with the backdrop of Matthew 19, that Paul begins to make commentary on Jesus' teaching, but he deals with issues that Jesus never dealt with. And it's hard to just take Jesus' teaching that was intended to do a certain kind of act and confront a certain kind of person and apply it across the board. It doesn't necessarily apply across the board to every situation. You need to apply it where it does apply. We'll see Paul do that as we go through this. Let's just begin with it. Situation number one. The situation concerning the formerly married. Verses eight and nine. The situation comes in the form of a question, can those formerly married remarry? Let's read the verse first, then I'll break it down. But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, that it is good for them if they remain even as I. But if they do not have self-control, let them marry, for it is better to marry than to burn. Okay? Those of you who are with us every Sunday, I'm looking out here this evening, and I'm aware that we have a lot of visitors with us, and so you haven't been with our 1 Corinthians series. And I feel like I need to catch you up. What happened in this chapter is that the Corinthians have written him a letter asking them about specific situations in their life. In fact, chapter 7, verse 1 says, now concerning the things about what you wrote. And the first group of people, the first situation were these unmarried people, these widows. What should we do? Paul tells them, I think you should remain even as I, but if you don't have self-control, it's better to marry than to burn. That seems pretty benign, but there's a lot of stuff in here. There are three references to singleness in this chapter. That's right on your outline here. The first reference is to widows. Write that down. The first reference is to widows. Write that down. We see that in verse 8. And to widows. We know who widows are. Verse 40, you see the same thing. A widow is someone who is formerly married, right? But she's not anymore. Why? Because her husband, what? Died. There's another group of singles in this chapter, and that is virgins. Parthenoi. Virgins. Verse 25, we see a reference to them. And to virgins I say, now concerning virgins I have no command of the Lord. And then in verse 34, another reference to them. And to the virgin I say this. You know what a virgin is? It is speaking to someone who's never been married. They are single. They have never been married. And then there's this other category called the unmarried. The unmarried. We see them referred to in verse 8. We see them also referred to, I believe, in verse 34. this category is one of the keys to understanding verse 8 and 9 let's move down the clarification of terms who is this unmarried person well let's see how it's used you remember when we studied this that there were only there are only four uses of this word in all of the new testament i mean the only usage of this word is right here in this chapter this is the only place we find the word used in any way. Okay? So the only way to draw our meaning, the meaning of it, is to look at this particular chapter. Let's look at verse 32. It's used there once. See if it helps us. But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord. Okay? Verse 32, you recall that just gives us a general term. It gives us a general usage of it. No real insight. It's just one who is unmarried. Okay? It doesn't really give any specifics. Verse 34 uses it, however, in such a way that it reveals something. Let's just read the verse. And his interests are divided. And the woman who is unmarried and the virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord. And it goes on to say some other things. But what we realize here is that the unmarried person and the virgin are not the same. Okay? The unmarried person and the virgin are not the same person. You've got a virgin who has never been married, and you've got an unmarried person, and he's making a distinction between those two. So I'm scratching my head. Okay, I've eliminated did one thing. I know that the unmarried person is not a virgin. Now we go to verse 8. And it says this. This is the other place that unmarried is used. But I say to the unmarried, that's that word again, and to the widows. Now you know what else I know? I know that the unmarried person is not a virgin because the distinction was made. And I also know that the unmarried person is not a widow. Why is that? Because he would have just put them together. The unmarried person and to the widow that it is good for them to remain even as I. He is not a widow. Verse 11. All I've done so far is eliminate things. She's not a widow. She's not a virgin. But then in verse 10, it says, but to the married, I'm giving instructions, not I, but the Lord, that the wife should not leave her husband. Then in verse 11, but if the unthinkable does happen, let her remain in what condition, in what status, what would I call this person unmarried? Okay. Who is the unmarried person then? The unmarried person is someone who was at one time married, but because of divorce is not married any longer. He is speaking in verse 8 and 9 to someone who in their former life was married, probably became divorced, now is coming to Christ and is redeemed. His former life is maybe a mess. Let's say all the worse. It was his fault. It was her fault. They messed up the relationship, but now they're coming to Christ and they are redeemed and they're coming to Paul and they say, what is my status? What do I do? Do I need to stay single the rest of my life? He gives some advice. it would be my preference that you do. I think it's good for them, both the unmarried, this is the formerly married, the unmarried person who was divorced, and to the widow, is good for them to remain even as I. But if they do not have self-control, let them marry, for it is better to marry than to burn. I want to give you a little illustration of this, to underline it, verse 26 through 28. He says basically the same thing. Just so you know, that's not just like a one-shot deal. It feels a little convoluted, maybe. verse 26 started and I think then that this is good in view of the present distress that it is good for a man to remain as he is how is that single then he says these things are you bound to a wife okay that would be one situation do not seek to be released that's your instruction are you released from a wife do not seek a wife but if you should the release from a wife would be a divorce situation again this is not a believer being divorced though okay this is not two believers being divorced. Why? Because we've got instructions concerning them. If you divorce believers and you are in a situation, both of you are believers and you divorce, don't remarry. Reconcile. That's the only option or singleness the rest of your life. If you're two believers in that situation, except for one other exception, this is someone who before their redemption had that trouble. Then he says, do not seek a wife, but if you should marry, you have not sinned. And if the Virgin should marry, she has not sinned. Again, you got all three groups right there? The widow? The unmarried? The virgin? I do not. I want you to note something here, and this is just kind of putting my attention back on something I gave you before. I do not believe he'd say this, Paul would say this, to the hard-hearted Pharisee. What's the point? Why is he saying what he's saying? He is dealing with people who have been broken by relationships that haven't worked. He is not dealing with pious, self-righteous, religious people here. He is dealing with people who have come and said, I want to do what's right. Before the Lord, I want to do what's right. Okay, the second thing, situation concerning married people. The situation concerning those who are still married, verses 10 through 16, we have three categories of people who are married. First of all, the first category is those who are both Christians, verses 10 and 11. But to the married I give instructions, not I, but the Lord, that the husband should not leave her, that the wife should not leave her husband, but if she does leave, let her remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. At this point, if I could get your mind to trigger this way, we would take all of Matthew 19, the last two weeks that we studied the passage of Matthew 19 and plop it right in here. This is where Jesus' teaching applies. This is the situation in which Jesus' teaching applies. And it applies in full. You plop it right in here. This is where it fits. That is why in verse 12 he says, To the rest I say, not the Lord. Why? Because Jesus did not comment on the situations that Paul was about to comment on. Jesus did comment about this situation. So when I'm talking about a situation about which Jesus spoke, to which Jesus spoke, I am going to quote him. And he did. But when we came to a situation where you have a believer and a non-believer, Jesus did not address that issue, so I am going to speak now. When he says, it was I, not the Lord, you remember this. This does not mean it is not authoritative. It is authoritative. He is inspired by the Holy Spirit to write this. He is simply saying this is an issue that the Lord did not address. Let's get back to verse 10. What was the teaching of Matthew 19? Well, you know what it was, and this is what's addressed to two believers. One man, one woman, strong bond, one flesh, God created. If you separate and remarry, except for the case of adultery, you have committed adultery. It's simple, it's clear, it's really not very debatable. Second group. Second group. The second group is where you have, and this is where you begin to move into the area that Jesus never did address. He didn't deal with this issue, so Paul does. And in fact, one of the things I titled this whole thing for my benefit was 1 Corinthians 7 is Paul's commentary on Jesus' teaching. It's Paul's commentary or his application of Jesus' teaching because he deals with broader issues. Verses 12 through 14, we see this issue where there is a believer in a marriage and a non-believer. But the first category, the non-believer wants to stay in the marriage and make it work. Now, culturally, you remember what was happening. These people being saved out of this pagan culture were coming to Christ. And let's say the man was redeemed, but the wife wasn't. Or the woman was redeemed, but the husband wasn't. And this woman now looks at her husband and sees the rank paganism of his lifestyle. It used to be her lifestyle. And now she's redeemed, and now she's feeling real spiritual and real pure. But instead of that new life making her a better wife to her husband, it's making her withdraw from him. He's a scuzzball. I don't want anything to do with him. And remember at the beginning of our study, they were causing a withdrawal even sexually. Women were, and men both, were withdrawing from their mates because they somehow felt this sexual stuff was really bad news. Yuck. Remember that sexuality had been so vile in that culture that understandably it was hard to see sex in any context that it would be pure. So when they got saved, they wanted to put all of that aside, so they were withdrawing from one another. Paul gave instructions. stop depriving one another. Stop doing that. Come back together. Give yourselves fully. The instruction to a believing wife or a believing husband with an unbelieving wife or husband is give yourself fully to that guy or give yourself fully to that woman. The question then would come and it's addressed in verse 14. Man, oh man, if I do that and I give myself, especially sexually, I am going to defile myself in the presence of this guy or this gal is going to defile my children. Then he says this. It's exactly opposite of that. The unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband, for otherwise your children are unclean. But they are not unclean, for they are now holy. You remember the word sanctified does not mean sanctified in a salvific sense. It means sanctified in a set-apart sense. They are set-apart to blessing. What that means, wife, if you are part of a marriage where your husband is not a believer, you bring blessing into that home that otherwise would not be there. That's all it means. It doesn't mean anything more than that. And it means, and it is also a confrontation of their mentality. This self-righteous, aloof attitude that the wife was saying, I don't want anything to do with that dirty guy. And he was saying, listen, that is 180 degrees wrong from what you're supposed to do and the attitude you're supposed to have. Your spirituality needs to make you a better wife, a more loving, giving, caring wife. This condescension can do nothing but maybe even close the door to his desire to know Christ. So give yourself completely. It's the opposite of defiling, you bring blessing. Okay, move on. We've got that situation pretty well clear. Now we've got the other situation, the last category of married people. One of them is a Christian, one of them is not, but the one person wants to leave. Instead of that unbelieving person wanting to stay, they want to leave, verse 15 through 16. If the unbelieving one leaves, the word there is koryzomi. Koryzomi, it means to take himself out. This is a person who is being abandoned. If the unbelieving one abandons, takes himself out, this is not because the woman became such a crab, or the man became so self-righteous that she couldn't stand it anymore and left, this is assuming that that woman or man kept being a giving caring loving spouse if however after doing that the unbelieving one leaves let him the brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases but God has called us to peace God has not called you to kick and scream and yell and go to court and try to stop it and do everything you can to drag him or her back into that house, God has called you to peace. If they demand to go, you let them go. The brother or sister is not under bondage. That's the key phrase. Not under bondage. It's the same idea as in chapter 7 of Romans, verse 2. Chapter 7, verse 2 says this, for the married woman is bound, same idea, the same word, is bound by law to her husband while he is living. But if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning the husband. What is it that would release a wife from a husband so she could remarry? It says right here, death would. Okay? She is bound, the kind of bond, the strong bond that happens in a marriage. And the thing that can release her here is the death of that spouse. There's another thing that can release her from that bondage. What is it? If that unbelieving husband or wife leaves, that's what. And she is then free to remarry. he's not under bondage then it goes on to say this for how do you know oh wife whether you will save your husband or how do you know oh husband whether you will save your wife that is a confrontation of and addressing of the issue man oh man if he goes now how in the world is he going to get saved if he leaves the sanctification of this home that i bring to it because i am a believing wife or i'm a believing husband, what in the world chance does he have to ever be redeemed? How do you know, oh wife, that you will save your husband? How do you know, oh husband, that you will save your wife? That's not your responsibility. Your responsibility is to be a chaste wife, 1 Peter 3. Your responsibility is to love and to give and to care. And don't let the reason he leaves or she leaves because you're so self-righteous, but if given the fact that you are loving him and caring for him, he leaves, let him leave. You're not under bondage in such cases. Isn't it interesting he even says that? In such cases. Paul is dealing with the fact that there are different kinds of situations. You sum it all up in verses 17 through 24. And the question behind this, by the way, should salvation change my marital status? Now that I'm saved, again, what's the backdrop of this? The backdrop is this unbelievably confused culture when it comes to sexuality and marriage and remarriage. It was just a mess. But now that I'm saved, what do I do? Should it change my situation? Should I leave my husband? Should I leave my wife if they're not a believer? Should I go back and try to remarry? Okay, on and on. Here's the sum of it. Only as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each, meaning this, the position you were in when God called you, as God has called each, in this manner let him walk. And thus I direct to all the churches. What does that mean? Well, thus I direct to all the churches. I've got a message for the churches. Let me explain what I mean. Was any man called to Christ? And when you came to Christ, you were already circumcised. Well, I've got some advice. for you. Don't let him become uncircumcised. I have no idea how they would have pulled that off anyway, but he's trying to make a point, isn't he? I don't even know if there's anybody saying, well, I think now that I'm saved, I think I should become uncircumcised. Nobody's saying that. He's trying to make a point. The point is this, the way you came to Christ, let it go and come to Christ the way you are and move on from there. You can't unscramble the egg. Has anyone been called an uncircumcision. Let him not be circumcised. Don't change anything. Why? Circumcision is nothing. Circumcision is nothing. But what matters is the keeping of the commandments of God. Let each man remain in that condition in which he was called. Again, that can be really misunderstood or just kind of left there meaning nothing unless we understand what they're asking. What are they asking? They're saying, what should I do now? I came out of all these weird situations. Should I go back. Let each man remain in the condition in which he was called. Again, the pressure too from some of these ascetics, the Greeks who were saying that if you're really spiritual, you won't have any sexual activity and you should be single. He's saying stay married. If you're married, stay single. If you're single, don't go changing it just because you got saved. Goes on later to clarify, but if you marry, you haven't sinned. He's going back and forth and back and forth. Were you called while a slave? Don't worry about it. I must think he's saying, lighten up, would you? Just lighten up. But if you are able also to become free, do that. Stay a slave, good. Don't worry about it. Be a slave. If you can be free, be free. Great. For he has called you in the Lord while a slave is the Lord's freed man. Likewise, he who is called while free is Christ's slave. You were bought with a price. Don't become slaves of men. Brethren, let each man remain with God in that condition in which he was called. That's the sum of it. the question behind that again as i said is should salvation change my moral status the answer is no no don't go getting leaving don't leave don't try to fix things up again let me ask you this question does that mean that if two people who were divorced and then one of them becomes a believer and maybe even the other one becomes a believer but maybe not that they should not try to reconcile doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that he's trying to answer a question. They were changing their status left and right because they'd become Christians. It doesn't mean you shouldn't try and reconcile. Maybe you should. Maybe you should. And I've seen it happen. We had a guy give a testimony here not long ago of a situation where he and his wife went through a divorce and both of them were unredeemed. He was committing adultery. In fact, at the time he was living with a girl. She didn't get married again. He didn't get married again. He was just living with this gal. One day he got saved. Bad idea. Well, he got saved and it changed. the first thing he knew he had to do was leave this girl and begin to reconcile with his wife. He did indeed get reconciled with his wife. They got remarried. She did come to know the Lord. And there's a powerful thing in that. So this is not saying don't do it. It's just saying don't go running around, leaving your wife, leaving your husband in the name of God. Don't feel like you got to unscramble the egg automatically. Don't put yourself under that kind of bondage. Then he says, again, the situation concerning singles. Now I'm just going to buzz through this. The only reason I'm even giving you this is so you can kind of hang on to it contextually. We spent two weeks on this passage from 25 through 20, whatever it was, through 40. The situation concerning singles. This is just wrapping it up. The situation concerning singles in 25 through 35. Now concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord, but I give an opinion as one who, by the mercy of the Lord, is trustworthy. I think then that this is good in view of the present distress, that it is good for a man to remain as he is. How is that single? We spent two weeks talking about reasons to remain single. Reasons to remain single. Some powerfully exciting reasons to remain. You remember again that one of the pressures from the Jews in that community was that if you're not single, you don't have any value. And Paul just blows up for the next several verses dealing with that disgusting mentality. Setting these single people free to be single to the glory of God. The last thing, the last two things was finally a word to parents. Don't act unbecomingly towards your virgin daughter. Simply mean don't be unfair. When they come of age and you would like to see them stay single and you would like to see them just serve God, but they come to the flower of age, sexual maturity, and they have a heart to get married, let them marry. If they don't have a heart to get married and you're not under that constraint, let them stay single. You put your arm around them, you say praise God for you, that's a gift from God, be single, that's wonderful, do it with everything you've got. And then finally a word to widows, 39 to 40. A wife is bound to her husband as long as her husband lives, but if her husband is dead, She is free to be married to whom she wishes only in the Lord, meaning this, only in the Lord, meaning only a Christian. But not only that, not just any Christian, only a Christian that is in the will of God. I feel like it just ran a hundred yard dash. But that is the full circle of all the teaching we did on this. We started in 1 Corinthians 7. I unloaded the dumpster. We came back, did three weeks of Matthew 19 and have tried tonight to bring it back, put something in your hand, and dovetail it with this whole issue. I hope that it's been helpful. Last week, I had a question, and I don't know if I've even got, I really don't have time to open this up for questions. I think we're going to take a Wednesday night and just deal with some of the questions that you might have. And the questions do not come, I don't think, in terms of the theology. You know what they come in? The same kind of questions that people gave to Paul. What about this? What about that? What about these specific incidents? Debbie Moulds asked me a question last time. What about if the husband is beating the wife? I mean, should she just stay in that situation? I promised that I would address that. I do not have the ultimate answer, but let's just use our sense on this concerning what the Word of God has says, not lowering the standard to accommodate that, not making it higher than it ought to be. My assessment of that, you want the judgment from Dave. Don't take it as that, my opinion. I can't possibly see a good enough reason for anybody to beat anybody else. I can't think of a good enough reason for a husband to beat her wife. I can't think of a good enough reason for a woman to stay in that situation. According to the word of God, it would be hard to justify without tremendous jumping around a divorce for that cause. Remember we talked about indecency. What was indecency in Deuteronomy 24? Indecency was excremental behavior. Remember as it was defined in Deuteronomy 22. The most vile, disgusting behavior you could get. And when that person got a divorce and remarried, what did they commit? Adultery by the remarriage. And so in that kind of situation, you have a situation where I don't know if biblically you have grounds for divorce. To stand out at home, no way. Get out of that home. Protect your kids, protect your family. That is the kind of thing, by the way, that can put the kind of pressure on that guy that needs to be put on him to get help. I don't know what else would. Staying by and being the submissive wife, I don't believe that. I've seen enough people like that that it wouldn't happen. It wouldn't work. Divorce, I don't think that would be appropriate either. You know one of the problems, however, in situations like this? Generally, when you've got a situation like that, you've got more going on than abuse. You may be dealing with a very hard-hearted person. It may be that he's helpable. The grace of God can touch, and maybe the only thing that would get him to get the help he needs would be for you to leave. I have encouraged more than one person to do just that, never encouraging divorce in that situation, but encouraging to leave and stay away and putting that person under enough pressure to get the help he needs. The other issue is that according to 1 Corinthians 7, if I'm going to interpret it right, if that unbelieving husband leaves and says, you know, your activity is just bizarre and leaves, that's not necessarily adultery, but you're not under bondage in such cases too. You know, the problem with this, you said something last week to me after the seminar that was interesting and I'll share it now. You know what I'm aware of when I do this seminar? That if you're here and you want to get a divorce, you're going to get a divorce. Nothing we say is going to keep you from doing that. And nothing we say is going to give you freedom to do it, or anything. If you're bent on doing it, people are going to do it. What we've tried to do is give as clearly as possible the clarity of the Word of God on this. Again, one of the things I hope we're learning in this whole thing is that when we exegete the Word of God, we don't just take principles that are designed to answer a certain question, to deal with a specific issue, and then apply it all over the place. You can't do that.
