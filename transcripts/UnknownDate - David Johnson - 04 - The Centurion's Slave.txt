I'd like to pray as we go to the Word. Father, first of all, I just want to thank you for the power of your Spirit among us already. In the context of the worship, like Stephan said at the beginning, there are things going on in our city, there are things going on in the world that confuse us and scare us, and it's so good to be reminded that you are glorious. And in the end, you are pulling all things. You are reconciling all things. Even though it doesn't look like it today at three o'clock, you are reconciling all things. That's where it's all headed and we are part of that. Help us to believe and help us to hang on to that hope to stand in the middle of storms. I pray now, Father, It occurs to me, even as it relates to the word this morning, that in the kingdom of God, people have authority who are under authority. And from that posture comes power. And so I pray for myself that as I bring this word, that it would come from a place that is under authority. And because of that, have authority and give birth, as it were, to authentic, authentic kingdom power, the kind that can actually change people and things. I pray these things in your name. Amen. Open your Bibles with me to Matthew's Gospel, the eighth chapter. Picking up the story in the fifth verse as we continue our study on the healing miracles of Jesus, which began for us a few weeks ago in the context of what we've been calling actually for almost a year now a journey with the Holy Spirit. It was our journey with the Holy Spirit which led us eventually to an examination of the gifts of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 12. And that led us eventually to an examination of the gift of healing in 1 Corinthians 9, healing and the operation of power. And that examination of power and healing led us eventually to where we are now in Matthew 8, the healing miracles of Jesus. Having dealt with the cleansing of the leper in verses 1 through 4 a few weeks ago, we begin today to examine the healing of the centurion's slave. It all began in Matthew 8, verse 5. When he had entered Capernaum, that is, Jesus, a centurion came to him, entreating him and saying, Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home and suffering great pain. And Jesus said to him, I will come to your house and I will heal him. But the centurion answered and said, Lord, I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof. And we'll find out why as the story goes on. He was a Gentile, therefore deemed by the religious among that day as being unclean. So I'm not worthy to come and be under, or for you to come and be under my roof. but you just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For there's something I understand about you, even though I see you from a distance. I too, there's something I understand about you relative to authority. For I too, says the centurion, am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to this one, go, and he goes. And to another, come, and he comes. And I say to my slave, do this, and he does it. When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who were following, Truly, there is something we can learn from this guy. For I say to you, I've not found such great faith. I've not found this kind of faith with anyone in Israel, and none of you would expect it to be in this guy. Indeed, I say to you that many shall come from the east and the west like this guy, from places you wouldn't expect, and they will be reclining at the table, the messianic table, the marriage supper of the Lamb in heaven in the kingdom of God, and they will be sitting at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the sons of the kingdom, at least some who think they are the sons of the kingdom, ironically, some of them will be cast into outer darkness. And in that place, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. And Jesus said to the centurion, go your way. Let it be done to you as you have believed. And the servant was healed that very hour. I want to begin this morning by, first of all, resetting the context within which these miracles, this one in particular, but all of the miracles in this section take place, and to remind you of some major themes that run through this one, but all of them in this section from chapters 8 through chapter 9. The miracle we're dealing with today is the second of nine healing miracles performed by Christ in this rather remarkable section of Scripture from chapter 8, verse 1 through chapter 9. Miracles that I indicated last time were not randomly chosen to simply prove that Jesus does miracles, though these things do indeed prove that. There's more going on than that, and I want us to be reminded of that when the Apostle John in the 30th verse of the 20th chapter of his gospel says that many of the miracles that were performed by Jesus were not written in the book, it leads me to believe that the ones that were written in the book were chosen carefully, were chosen purposefully, not randomly for the purpose of communicating something beyond the miracle about the character of God, about the mission of Christ, about the nature of the kingdom. I said it this way a few weeks ago, That on the surface of things, as we look at these miracles, we see the miracle itself. But underneath that are subplots, or what I would call kingdom purposes beyond the obvious. In fact, I called it messages in the miracle. We see messages in the miracle that are at least as important as the miracle itself. Among those messages, one of the most primary is this. And by the way, this particular message is found in all of the miracles, but in the one we're looking at today, it's particularly highlighted. And the message is this. Every miracle that we're going to examine, particularly in what today, says this. That Jesus has authority on earth to do certain things. Again, one of the major themes of this miracle is about authority. In verse 9, I see that you are a person under authority. In Matthew 28, verse 18, Jesus says of himself, all authority has been given unto me in heaven and on earth. What's the message? The message is this. Jesus has authority in a variety of arenas, in several arenas of life. Now, let me break that down or broaden that out to show you how that applies to all nine of these miracles. Last time we began this, I told you that these nine miracles in this section fall into three categories or kinds of miracles, each of which affirms that Jesus has authority to move in those areas of life with power. The first area or the first arena or kind of healing, arena that Jesus has authority to move in with power is physical. So when he heals, for instance, leprosy and paralysis and fever, which are the first three miracles in chapter 8, the message in that miracle is this. I have authority on earth to move in that arena with power. it's clear from the story we're dealing with today that the centurion understood this when he said Jesus all you have to do is say the word and my servant will be healed he understood Jesus had authority in the arena of the physical to bring healing but it's not the only arena of life that Jesus has authority to move in because in this section we're also going to see that he has authority to move in the arena of the spiritual when he says to the paralytic For instance, in Matthew 9, verse 6, these words, in order that you might know I have what? Authority on earth to forgive sins. Arise, take up your bed, and walk. Now, he did the miracle, but the real message in the miracle is this, that I have authority on earth to forgive sin. That's the thing he's really saying there. Everybody on earth doesn't receive that forgiveness. Everybody on earth doesn't step into that forgiveness. Everybody on earth doesn't even want that forgiveness. But if they do, here's the message in the miracle. I have authority on earth to forgive sin and set you free and cleanse your heart. And the power of that authority is made manifest. Not when people, because they're forgiven, are just off the hook. The power is made manifest when by the power of God and the authority of God to forgive sin, when that person's life is actually changed, that's the manifestation of the power. Jesus cast out demons on two occasions in these two chapters in Matthew 8 actually there are two occasions where he casts out demons there's the wow about that but here's the message in the miracle relative to authority it's this I have authority to move in that arena of the demonic against the works of Satan as well so church here's the word out of that message in the miracle quit living in fear of the demonic and quit living in the denial of the demonic which is strangely and frustratingly where many of us live when the evil one presses so significantly on our lives that we kind of feel it we live in fear of it and sometimes we kind of just stick our head in a hole about it and live in denial about it quit living in fear about it quit living in denial about it let me tell you why because at the name of Jesus demons buckle at the knees they always have they always will. Do you know why? Because Jesus has authority in that arena of life. Amen. And sometimes we forget it, and sometimes we don't know it, and sometimes we don't believe it. So I'm here to remind you. And these miracles are here, not just to go, wow, we did a miracle. These miracles have these messages in them. I have authority. I have authority on earth to heal. I have authority on earth to cast out demons and bring down the workings of the evil one. finally the third category that these miracles move in is the eternal when Jesus in the ninth chapter the twenty-first verse the twenty-fifth verse raises a little girl from the dead the message in the miracle is this I have authority over death and while that little girl eventually died physically the message in the miracle is undeniable and it reverberates through all of eternity. And the message is this, I have broken the power of sin and death and all who believe in me, put their hope in me, choose to follow me, will come to life eternally. That's a message in the miracle. I have authority on earth to give people life. Eternal life. It's all about authority. It's all about authority. First message in the miracle, all of these miracles, but particularly the one we're looking at today is Jesus has authority on earth to do certain things in specific arenas of life. Second message is this. So do you. Now, this is where we get a little nervous. Me? I like it when it's Jesus. Way to go, God. Me? This is where we freak. This is where, again, we get nervous. And quite frankly, this is where we don't believe it. picture it this way that for two chapters and this is a flow I want to keep hanging on to because we just get sometimes lost in the little verses we're examining you need to see the flow of the text for two chapters, chapter 8 and chapter 9 Jesus is performing miracles one right after another the fever, the paralysis, the demon the little girl being raised from the dead for two chapters the disciples are doing what you and I would be doing if we were watching Jesus do all that. They were amazed. They were excited. They were filled with worship and awe. They were proudly singing. Maybe the way we were singing this morning, how great is our God from their toes with an incredible sense of adoration and thanksgiving to God. We worship you, God, for the great works that you have done. But in chapter 10, verse 1, right in the flow of the text, in chapter 10, verse 1, after all of these miracles, it says that Jesus summoned his disciples and he gave them authority I almost see them in the middle of the cheer going wait wait wait wait wait and Jesus says not just me you and they would go ha ha ha and then when he gives them authority what I hear him saying between the lines is this you know I love it when you worship me you were made to worship me. You find something of your fundamental identity and place in the world when you worship me, but don't just worship me, follow me. Don't just cheer for me, join me in this work of bringing down the workings of the evil one in people's homes and cities and communities. And I'm asking you to join me, but I'm not going to leave you alone. I will give you authority. It's why we're studying the gifts of the Spirit. And some of us, if you're back from my background, you go, well, yeah, in chapter 10, verse 1, he gave that authority to the disciples, and everybody knows the disciples had it, but we don't. And here's the problem with that, even biblically. The problem is that in Luke chapter 10, he also gave it to 70 others. And then in Matthew 28, I believe the Great Commission is actually when he gives the marching orders to the church. He says this, Matthew 28, 18. All authority has been given to me, Jesus says, in heaven and on earth. By this time they knew something about authority and being under authority. And the authority I have, I give it to you. I gave it to you 12 in Matthew 10. I gave it to 70 others in Luke chapter 10. But now I want you to go into all the world and make disciples, apprentices of me, people who are learning, not just all the right theology about Jesus, And because they know the right thing about Jesus, they think they're going to heaven when they die. That's not what I want you to do. That's important. But what I want you to do is make disciples, apprentices of Jesus, people who are learning to say what Jesus said and do what Jesus did under the authority that I am giving you. And lo, I am with you always. And I will help you bring the kingdom and be part of what God is doing in the kingdom, in the world. Beloved, at the risk of overstatement, I believe the two of the most debilitating dynamics in the church that keeps us, the church, from being who God's called us to be and doing what God's called us to do in the world is, number one, an inability for a variety of reasons, and we've spoken of this often, an inability to understand, embrace, believe, and step into, as if it's really true, our identity as believers, and number two, our inability to understand, embrace, believe, and step into, as if it's true, our authority as believers. Because here's the deal. I mean, you can just think of this on a rather simplistic level. If you have, if I have no sense of authority, if you have no sense of your right, as it were, to move with power in the kingdom of God, here's what I promise you. You will never storm the gates of hell. Why would you? Who am I? What authority do I have? If you have no sense of your authority, your rights to move in arenas relative to the kingdom of God where Jesus has authority, you will never pray for the sick. If you don't have any sense of your authority, you'll never do it. You'll never touch a leper. You'll never go out of your comfort zone. And you'll never offer hope or healing or forgiveness or redemption to anyone. And you might have a good heart, but it's basically driven by the, well, who am I? Why do I got nothing? And it doesn't turn us into bad people. It turns us into impotent people. I like to sing the songs, but we're not in the game. Please note that it was the centurion's understanding of Jesus' authority on earth that stirred up in him faith, or faith is this religious word, confidence. You ever felt confident? It was his understanding of Jesus' authority that stirred in him confidence that all he had to do was speak a word. And it was the kind of confidence or faith that Jesus called great. I don't know, I haven't figured this guy out entirely, which this sermon will make clear. wouldn't you like to have the kind of faith that made Jesus marvel I don't know if I figured it out yet what kind of it all is but the kind of that you could say something and make Jesus go whoa I'd get off on that a little bit I think third message we hear in all these miracles in this section but particularly in this one is that these miracles reveal the heart of God for the least and the lost, for those outside the camp. It is no accident, I told you last time, that the first three miracles in this section involve a leper, a slave, and a woman. All three of them having been marginalized and despised by the culture they lived in, particularly the religious culture. But it isn't just pity. Jesus, oh, the least and the lost. It's not just pity. that's going on here. Turns out that it's among these kinds of people, the lepers that no one else will touch, centurions that are kind of outside the niceties of religious propriety. It turns out that it's among those kind of people and in those kind of places that the kingdom of God is most obviously and visibly happening. Which leads to the fourth message in the miracle. It's this, that God blesses faith wherever he finds it. It's instinctive. He just moves toward it. It's almost involuntary. I mean, I don't want to get weird here, but it's almost like Jesus would, well, when the woman with the issue of blood touches the hem of his garment, he may be looking the other way, but the Bible says that there was an issue of power that flowed from him. Well, there's faith. It just went out of me. Who was that? Who was that? God blesses faith wherever he finds it but here's the kicker he finds it in the strangest places most unlikely unexpected places like I said last time you'd expect it to find faith in the temple, in the synagogue, in the church among people of quote unquote faith but these over and over the stories here in these two chapters reveal that he keeps finding it not there but he finds it among lepers Samaritan half-breeds and slaves and centurions like this one here now in our story today that we're dealing with that message that he blesses faith wherever he finds it but he finds it in the strangest places is accompanied with a stinging rebuke a bold confrontation designed I think to be kind of a wake-up call and it's a wake-up call that some of us maybe need to hear it's a wake up call to self satisfied religionists speaking of the centurion's faith in verse 10 he says as I've already indicated I've not found faith like this in anyone in Israel but then he comes on with this confrontation but I say to you many shall come from the east and the west like this guy and recline at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven in other words he's saying this to these sons of the kingdom who think they're in, what he's saying is the people that you don't think are coming to the messianic banquet that you believe are not going to make it. By the way, that's what religion's all about. You know that? I mean man-made religion. It's all about who's in and who's out. And we have our little things that determine if you say it this way or you say it that way, if you believe it this way or that. Then you're in. And everybody else is out. And Jesus is saying, you know, I'm not even going to tell who's who, but here's the deal. Lots of people who you don't think are in, are in. There are people coming to the banquet that right now you won't even go to their house. They're coming to the banquet. You won't touch them. They're coming to the banquet. People that you don't think are part of this are part of this. People that you think are on the outside because they're untouchable, they're unclean, they're on the inside. In fact, it's the sons of the kingdom. This is a huge, there is no way for me to kind of try and reproduce how controversial this statement is. It's the sons of the kingdom or people who think they are the sons of the kingdom, the religious who would never touch a leper, go to a Gentile's house, who assume they're in, who may be out, and basically these sons of the kingdom that he was talking to believe they were in because they were kind of in an ancestral way connected to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They believe they were in because, like a lot of religionists, they believe the right thing, or at least they thought they believed the right thing, and they believed that believing the right thing was what made them welcome at the banquet. Turns out Jesus and God is always looking at the heart of people. We're to sing. And he isn't fooled. Now, exhibit A of this dynamic that he finds, he blesses faith where he finds it, wherever he finds it, but he finds it in the strangest places. Exhibit A of that is the leper that we talked about last time. Exhibit B is this centurion. We're meeting this morning, so let's meet him now. Verse six. comes to Jesus and says, Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, suffering in great pain. Can you help? Now, just reading that verse doesn't look weird, but it's weird. This is a weird thing that's happening here. For you to know how weird it is, you need to dial into the picture that's really here and understand the culture and the people that are part of this culture. First of all, the servant was not just a servant, he was probably a slave. That is made clear in Luke chapter 7, which is kind of a parallel account of this. And the Greek reveals that not only was he a slave, he was probably a child, because the Greek word peis is connected to the word servant or slave. So it's a slave who's a child. Let's talk about slavery a little bit. most of you know, the slaves were seen as less than human, valuable only for what they could do relative to work. So what's a kid going to do if they're a slave? And a paralyzed one on top of that. But this guy cares about them. Slaves in this culture were like tools or a piece of machinery in your garage. If the piece of machinery worked, it had value, and you used it till it didn't. If it didn't work, you threw it out, you got a new one. Because they were disposable. They didn't matter. They were the what? Least. So what do we know about the centurion? The fact that he's coming to Jesus on behalf of a slave who's nothing but a tool in his garage, and he's a child, and he's paralyzed, which means he's useless. What do we know from that about him? Well, that he's a good guy. No, more than that. This centurion had an authentic heart of compassion for what kind of person? The least and the lost, which makes his heart a lot like whose. Takes my breath away. Makes his heart a lot like God's. I think that's part of what made him marvel, Jesus marvel. I see the heart of God in this guy. Nobody wants to touch. I see God there. The kingdom there. But it's weird. The kingdom is appearing in this person who doesn't go to church. Wasn't allowed in church. I mean, this centurion, again, I don't know how to, I'm trying so hard to go, who is this guy? Whoever he is, he'd be the kind of person who, if he showed up at our door, I don't, God, this wouldn't happen here. But in a lot of proper churches, we wouldn't let him in. You can't come here. You don't have the right password. I don't know, whatever. You're wearing the wrong shirt. I don't know what. He didn't go to church. He didn't go to the synagogue or the temple. He wasn't what we would call a Christian, if we were trying to dial into who he was. He wasn't who they in that culture would have called orthodox, but he had the same heart as God has for the least and the lost. Just let it kind of bug you. Think, think, where have I seen that? Wonder, where have I seen that? Because wherever you've seen that, the kingdom might be happening there. God open our eyes to this have you ever noticed that sometimes sometimes not always but sometimes the people you meet in church who are pretty sure they're the sons of the kingdom primarily because they believe the right thing about Jesus are sometimes petty and small and self-absorbed consumers of religious goods are sometimes, not always, not always, but sometimes, sons of the kingdom, who think they're sons of the kingdom because they believe the right thing about Jesus, are sometimes among the most judgmental, negative, and critical people you'd ever meet. People who often, often, and please, this is not everyone, maybe it's not even most people, You know the impression the world has of us as Christians? Often, not always. It's about what we're against and who we hate. Not everyone. Not even most. But often there comes this wondering among the sons of the kingdom, who think they're the sons of the kingdom, about the least and the lost. And they wonder, why can't the least and the lost? Why can't they just help themselves? Why can't they pull themselves up by their bootstraps like we did? Well, let me answer that question just by using your story. You know why the least and the lost can't help themselves? What was the problem the slave had? He was paralyzed. The least and the lost can't help themselves because they're paralyzed. Somebody needs to touch them. But have you ever noticed that sometimes it's easier to find really compassionate people? Maybe not easier, but you find really compassionate people, sometimes outside of religious context than you find inside religious context. Have you ever noticed that? Has it ever bothered you? Turns out it bothered Jesus too. Let that encourage you. I'm serious. It bothered Jesus too. That's why he said in Matthew 8, verse 11, many will come from the east and the west. beloved there are people that you are writing off that you won't even have dinner with that we have decided because they don't say it right there are many who are coming from the east and the west who are going to sit at the table and right now you're missing it because you maybe don't even understand the real nature of the kingdom that I'm bringing what's the message the message is that Jesus blesses faith wherever he finds it but he finds it in the strangest places and by the way if you're not a little bit disturbed by what I'm saying. You're not hearing what I'm saying. You need to be disturbed by what I'm saying. This needs to stir you up a little bit. A couple of weeks ago, I indicated when we were talking about the gifts of the Spirit, I indicated, and particularly the gift of Helan, I indicated that of the 35 miracles that Jesus did, 32 of them were done outside. Only three of them were done in the context of a synagogue, a temple, or what we would call a church. And part of the reason I told you that was because we're trying to change our paradigm of where the gifts of the Spirit need to be or where we should expect them to be operational, most consistently. And while they need to be and we want them to be operational among us in this room when we gather, the place where those gifts of the Spirit, where Jesus did the power things He did, was out there in the highways and byways and people's houses and at weddings and in the context of everyday life. And we're trying to get a picture of that. But one of the reasons I said that Jesus probably did those supernatural things out there and brought those kinds of healings out there was because that's where the sickest people were. People who in a million years wouldn't come to church because they're paralyzed or they're blind or they just don't even care. and to have people who have on them the same anointing that Jesus had on him walking out those doors and just being salt and light and loving some people for Jesus' sake might begin to bring them to life and heal them. So I said one of the reasons the miracles happened out there was because that was where the need is. But according to this story, it's also where the faith was. I have not found faith like this in all of Israel. I'll go to synagogue. I don't see this kind of faith. I see it when I meet the centurion on the side of the road. And with that, I just want you to, I don't know if you journal, I journal. A good thing for you to do might be to journal and just, Lord, help us see. In fact, Lord, I just pray, Father, pray, pray, Holy Spirit, come. Open our eyes. Help us to see where your kingdom is happening in unexpected places. but an interesting thing this Friday all the teachers in the Osceola district were in this auditorium they had some sort of meeting and all of the teachers in the whole district were here in this church and Keith welcomed them and it was really cool we were so glad to be able to open our church to them for them to use it but because of that I kind of have teachers in my mind and I'm thinking of teachers teachers like you some of you who are kingdom people and you love Jesus and begin to wonder begin to wonder where is the kingdom coming in my classroom? Where are the unexpected places? Who's the kid? Who's the least kid? The kid I would least expect for the kingdom to be. Where is it? And you know where it might be? It might be in the kid who no one else will touch. That might be where it is. You know what the real answer is? I don't know. Start asking God. Help me. Help me see the centurion. Help me recognize the leper. John Perkins is coming this weekend. Ties in with this word. There's a humility on this guy, an authority, and a power on this guy to talk about the least and the lost. And I believe that one of the effects, we'll see, but I think that one of the effects of what he's going to bring is he's going to help us see some people we don't see. Because we're bad, because we're blind. Back to the centurion. Though he was a good guy, he was also a Gentile. Very likely a Samaritan, Josephus the Jewish historian, records that because of the massive number of soldiers required for Rome to maintain occupation in Israel, they would commonly draft soldiers from neighboring regions that they'd conquered. Josephus also records that the army in Capernaum was under the rule of Antipas, who was known to recruit almost exclusively from Samaria. Samaria, Samaritans. Let me tell you what they didn't like about Samaritans. Samaritans were Jews who intermarried with Gentiles, which made them worse than regular Gentiles because they weren't just unclean. They had made what was clean, unclean. So they would look at a Samaritan. A Gentile was just a Gentile, but a Samaritan was like a defiler. They were someone who messed everything up, intermarrying. That was the deal there. On top of that, he was a ranking officer in the army that had Israel under its thumb, which means that any self-respecting, God-fearing, Torah-reading, Bible-believing, temple-attending, church-going person would feel quite justified in not only staying away from this person, but despising this person. But Jesus' response when he came to him was this. I'll be right there. Again, we read this verse and we go, isn't that nice? No, you don't understand the trouble he's getting in for saying this. Again, I don't know how to exactly give you the correlation, but it would be if you saw me with somebody on the street walking and the word would spread, you won't believe who I saw with Dave. I don't know who that person is, but that would be the response here. And Jesus says, I'll be right there. I'll come to your unclean house and heal him. But the centurion of verse 8 said, no, for two reasons. He said, no, don't come. Number one, because of something he felt. Number two, because of something he discerned. Let me tell you what he felt. unworthy. It says it right there. For I am not worthy for you to come into my house. Like the leper that we talked about a few weeks ago, this guy had come to believe what the religious system had said about him. Remember the leper? According to Leviticus, because of his disease, no one would come near him. And it was his job to continually say out loud to anyone who came near, I am unclean, I am unclean. I am unclean. You say that enough. You begin to believe it yourself. I am unworthy. The centurion believed that about himself. So part of why he said, Jesus, don't come to my house, part of it was shame. And we're such a mixed bag. It's just so weird. All these things are in there at the same time. But part of it was this faith that caused Jesus to marvel. So part of it was, no, don't bother. Another thing was this thing that this guy discerned that he somehow knew. And what he somehow knew was that if Jesus would just say the word, verse 8, his servant would be healed. And that confidence came from something he understood about authority. Verse 9, for I too, he says, like you, I'm a man under authority. To be under authority. I think you get the picture there. But what it means is, first of all, it has to do with the fact that the authority he is operating in isn't his personal power. He was under the authority of Rome. Therefore, he had the authority of Rome. So if he said go, they would go. Not because, I mean, it's quite possible that the centurion would say to a soldier, you need to go. And he didn't go because he was bigger than the soldier. I mean, it's very possible the soldier was bigger and stronger and in a fight could kill him, hurt him, beat him, win. Anyway. Came close. Anyway, my wife is over there. There we go. I'm back. The reason he would say go and they would go was because there was authority on him. And it wasn't his, but it was his, but it wasn't his. He was under authority. It was Rome. Rome was behind him. I don't know if this is a good illustration, but it's simple, and it helps me. I see it like a police officer who, when they're wearing the uniform or show you the badge, they are under authority. They have authority to simply raise their hand. A semi-truck is coming. You know, I am so big and strong, I will stop you. I'm Superman. And the wheels spin. No. All he has to do is raise his hand. Why? He's got authority. Why? He's wearing a uniform. It's his, but it's not his. And then when he waves his hand, the semi-truck moves. And he could get behind it and personally push it with all his personal power. Wouldn't help. But he's got authority, so he just goes, time to go. And it goes. That's what the censorian was discerning here. You just say the word. You just raise your hand. Get this. Jesus, you don't have to yell. You don't have to scream. You don't have to touch me a certain way. In fact, you don't even have to come to my house. Just say the word. By the way, dial into this. In the next healing, verses 14 and 15, Jesus is going to heal Peter's mother-in-law of a fever. But in that healing, he goes to the house. That's how you do it. In the previous healing, when he healed the leper, he touches the leper. That's how you do it. In this healing, he doesn't go to the house. He doesn't even see the person who is going to be healed. Which means, among other things, that this isn't teaching a formula for faith healing. Just say the word and get us all stirred up. Walk around, say the word, heal, heal. That's not what this is teaching. It's not teaching. In fact, one of the things that these miracles, message in the miracle, the messages in the miracles, But one of the things that we're going to hear is that there is no formula. So if you're tied into a formula, I hope to just bust it all to smithereens. Here's how you do it, you touch them. Here's how you do it, you don't touch them. Here's how you do it, you go to their house. Here's how you do it, you don't go to their house. Here's how you do it, you're doing the big conference. Here's how you don't do it. No, I believe this story is simply highlighting a quiet, deep, and settled understanding on the part of this pagan that God can do what he wants. Just say the word. My servant will be healed. I believe that if you say the word you will be healed. It's revealing, this story is revealing a quiet, deep, and settled understanding belief that Jesus has authority on earth. given to him by the Father to move in certain arenas of life with power and one of them is physical. So Jesus says to the centurion, you don't have to yell and you don't have to scream and you don't have to jump up and down. You don't even have to come to the house. Just say the word. Just say the word. Which stirs in me a question I want to close with. The question is this, and it's not one for you, it's really one. I'm asking God, it's this. What are you saying, Lord? What are you saying today? Just say the word. What are you saying? Yesterday morning, as I was kind of putting it in the finishing touches on this talk, I felt prompted to do what I want to do now, and that is invite people to come for healing. maybe again this is kind of prompted by this story it's not for your healing it's somebody you know needs healing come forward for someone else's healing does it work that way? please hear me here I don't know how it works but here's what I believe here's what I know and believe Jesus has authority on earth to heal. So let's ask him to heal. No yelling. No screaming. No jumping up and down, even though I've been yelling and screaming and jumping up and down. Not now. Not now. To come to God and just say, if you just say the word. I want you to stand as we close. no big thing we're not going to have any music playing here if you want to be prayed for for healing I want you to just leave where you are and come forward right now if you want to pray for someone for healing I want you to just leave where you are and by the way I want the altar team the ministry team prayer team I want you to come down too as well just come down and make yourself available to people for prayer up in the front here just present yourself to them okay would you come people are coming just come on one thing I love about our church people aren't there's no embarrassment in moving just come just come we did this last night too and there was a word that came out of last night and it's kind of grown in me today that one of the things we think the Spirit of God is doing today, one of the things he's saying is that there's healing for people who are paralyzed today and there's a lot of different ways to be paralyzed. Do you get that? Some people are really stuck, can't move, can't get up off the bed, can't move their legs, can't move toward anything and I really think there's some healing here for some of that. prayer team I don't know what kind of instructions to give you except be sensitive to the spirit touch people don't touch people just listen to God can we just pray Father we're here we're here and we're here saying we don't know how to do it we don't know the way but we've been affected by something the centurion understood that we don't always understand. And it's kind of been stirred up in us again to believe and to know that you have authority on earth to move in this arena. And we believe if you would just say the word. So I pray in your name, without yelling or screaming, that under your authority, there would now be exercise and authority to heal. I do pray for those who are paralyzed. I pray in Jesus' name, even if they didn't come forward because you didn't have to go to a house and you didn't have to come forward to get what God's doing here. Holy Spirit, move, break bondages. Give strength to paralyzed spirits and hearts that can't get off the mat for whatever reason. Arise, take up your bed, walk. Holy Spirit, come. There are others here who are here for very specific needs from you. And Father, I just speak the word. I pray you speak the word of healing and deliverance and restoration. Physically, Holy Spirit, come for physical healing. We believe. We don't have the magic wand. We don't have the formula to make it happen. We believe you have authority on earth to touch our physical bodies. And so we pray, God, speak the word. Speak the word right now. To fevers and to cancers and to tumors and to physical heart ailments. Holy Spirit comes, speak. Move, touch. Father as we receive your gifts and are touched by your spirit I pray that you would more and more in gentle ways and ways that shake us up as well Father continue to impress us with the fact that the anointing that was on you to minister to the gospel to the poor, to the lepers, to those outside the camp. That anointing that was on you was on us. And that we have authority to walk out these doors and sometimes just by loving people and noticing them, bring to them the kingdom of life and light and healing. Help us to be a people who are living under authority and aware of that, exercising it with deep humility, but authentic power. And all God's people said, Amen, Amen.
