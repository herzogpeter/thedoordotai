Would you open your Bibles with me to the book of Matthew, chapter 5, verse 1, as we continue in our study of the Gospel of Matthew. And it brings us to this very, very important text. Matthew, chapter 5, verse 1. And when he, that's Jesus, saw the multitudes, he went up on the mountain, and after he sat down, his disciples came to him, and opening his mouth to them, saying, Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the sons of God. Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when men cast insults at you and persecute you and say all sorts of evil things against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad with exceeding gladness, for your reward in heaven is great, because they persecuted the prophets who were before you. And with those words, Jesus begins what some have called the greatest sermon ever preached, the Sermon on the Mount. It is a sermon that begins here in chapter 5 and does not just end with the thing we're familiar with, the Beatitudes, but it goes through chapter 5, all of it, through chapter 6, all of it, and through chapter 7, all of it. And then when we merge out of chapter 5, 6, and 7 into chapter 8 and 9, it is the first time that he then begins to talk about the power of the kingdom of God. But in these three chapters, as he sits down on this mountainside with his disciples and begins to feed his lambs, he is telling them before the power of the kingdom, you need to understand something about the lifestyle of the kingdom. Let's pray as we begin. Father God, all week long I have had this overwhelming sense that the truths of your kingdom, especially those that are beginning to be delineated this morning are truths that cannot be taught. They need somehow to be caught. They need somehow by your spirit to be given life so that we understand and can enter in. But even God I'm aware that our ability to enter in is not just an act of our will while there is an element of submission and while there are elements of choice that I take to bring myself to some of these things. There are ways in which, God, you have to produce these things in us. And so, God, even as we begin, we ask for the supernatural work of your Spirit among us this morning. First of all, simply to understand what it is that you're saying to us. But second of all, Father, the power and the dynamic and the energy from your Spirit to enter in to kingdom life as you describe it here. I ask these things in Jesus' name. Amen. The greatest sermon ever preached has words that sound somehow strange. They sound sort of odd. Maybe in a church context, these words don't sound odd and you don't know exactly what I'm saying because we've heard, blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are those who mourn, blessed are the gentle, and we all know that those are spiritual things that we're supposed to be. But in the real world, those things don't really ring true at all. They sound odd. Blessed are the broken. That doesn't sound right to me. Happy are the sad. You see, I've always thought happy are the happy, you see. Something's not right here. Satisfied are the hungry. Doesn't work for me. Hungry are the hungry. And full are the full and that kind of thing. Somewhere along the line, Jesus is coming and turning things upside down for a purpose. One of the writers who was reflecting on this said, it's as if in the Sermon on the Mount and beginning in the Beatitudes, somehow Jesus walks into the display window, that is life, and changes all the price tags on the merchandise and says the things that you thought have value don't, and the things you care about the most you shouldn't be caring about, and the things you're striving for aren't worth striving for, and the things you're trying to avoid at all costs are the things you need to move into because that's where the life of God can be found. but I got to tell you something I've had a struggle with this passage especially the first one that we're dealing with blessed are the poor in spirit the reason I struggle with it is I believe the same reason you probably struggle with it and that is this I have spent my whole life trying to avoid being broken trying to learn how to be tough trying to learn how to be strong and adequate and a good leader and if we're going to move into kingdom power that we talked about the last time I was here in verse 24 and 23 and 24 and 25 of chapter 4 then we're going to have to really get going and really be cool and know everything right and I've spent my whole life learning the right answers and so have you and then he gets us on the hillside and says blessed are the broken over the next several weeks and I think several months who knows it might be years three chapters three years wouldn't that be something and then that'd be something else we could be proud about yeah that was a snap there's going to be two themes that I think we're going to hear and I want us to have ears to hear them right as we begin before I begin even to break the text apart there's two things that are constantly are going to be coming at us as Jesus begins to delineate kingdom life for us. One of the things that I'm going to be hearing that we need to hear is a confrontation over and over again. But the other thing is a consolation. You know, while at first my spirit moves against this thing, blessed are the poor in spirit, one of the things that I need to understand is that there's a tremendous consolation. You know who hears that and hears it as good news? You know the person to whom that passage is good news? The person who is broken. I've got good news for you. Those of you who are among us who are hurt and broken and aren't coming up with the right answers for your life and don't feel like there's any direction in your life and any purpose, I've got good news. You're in a position where you can receive the blessing of God. I've got good news. Grace is right here at the beginning. That's one of the things you need to hear all the way through here. Those of you who are sad and those of you who are hungry, I've got good news. Blessed are you. Because you are in a position where you will become dependent on me. And in a position of dependence, you will know power that you've never known before. So I got good news here. But those of you who've learned how to be tough. And you've learned all the answers. And you've surrounded yourself with your own inadequacy. I got some bad news for you. Not a consolation, but a confrontation. And that is this. You think because you have all the spiritual answers and all the spiritual attitudes and activities down and you look so good that that is what spirituality is. I've got some bad news for you because blessed are the poor in spirit. It's the broken who are the blessed. It's the sad who are the happy. It's the hungry that get the filling because they are the ones who are receptive to the message and hungry for grace and know that they can't do it. and it is those who end up possessing the kingdom and understanding the power of the kingdom. That kind of tells us a little bit of where we're going. But now I want to begin to break the text apart for you, and all I'm going to do this morning is two things. I want to define or set the contextual scene for us, and then I want to simply define some terms. That's all I'm going to do, those two things. Set a contextual scene for us, and then define some terms. And in the two of those things coming together, hopefully paint a picture so that we can understand what Jesus is saying. Would you join me in something though? There is something we need to tune in on here at the very beginning. Up to this point, we have been hearing the apostle Matthew tell us all about Jesus. And it's been very exciting. And we've been seeing Jesus' kingdom come. And we've been seeing his ministry unfold. But there is a change here that is powerfully significant that we need to note. From this point on, Jesus is our teacher. And I would that we could somehow see ourselves on that hillside chewing some grass and listening to him and scratching our heads with the disciples going, what does he mean by that? Where do I fit in with that? How is it that I can enter into this whole thing? With that in mind, let's be reminded of what's going on. See, I don't think in terms of setting the scene that Jesus kind of comes along and has all sorts of 10 million things he wants to teach them and he goes well this is the time to do it and i'm just going to do it here randomly this didn't just get plopped here there's something happening here that makes what he's saying here make sense in order to understand that we need to go back a little bit and catch up with what's been happening we are coming off of chapter four and in chapter four there was a tremendously exciting drama unfolding and you remember it from weeks before before i was gone that in chapter four verses one to eleven we saw this incident where jesus was led out by the spirit into the wilderness. He had just been baptized and confirmed by the God, the father, that this was indeed the Messiah and his mission was to be redemption. And he had accepted it. And after that, he went into the wilderness and he got attacked by Satan. And I'm not going to go into all the details because we spent a whole Sunday on that, but suffice it to say that in this battle with Satan, we had a very clear picture that Satan was the aggressor and Jesus was kind of the victim. He came through it victoriously, but at the end of it, he was pretty much beat up and tired and weary. And we see that in verse 11 of chapter 4 when it says, and then the devil left him finally, and behold, angels came and ministered to him as to one who is tired and beat up from the battle. But in verse 12 through verse 25, the whole attitude changes because not any longer is Jesus the passive victim. The tables have been turned. Satan is no longer the aggressor. Jesus becomes the aggressor as in verse 16 his ministry begins and the light dawns in galilee of the gentiles remember that the beginning of his ministry how did it start it started as a light that dawned in galilee but then we found out in verse 17 that this light that dawned was not just some innocuous thing in galilee but that light was a kingdom and it was even more exciting than that because the kingdom had an army in verse 18 he walked by the sea of galilee saw two brothers simon who was called Peter and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea. And he said to them, follow me and I will make you fishers of men. And he began to gather his army. And the other good news to us was that the army that he was building was not the theologians who knew it all, not the religious aristocracy, but fishermen, common people. But it got even more exciting than that as in verse 23, we see that Jesus who came to preach the kingdom, came to do more than preach the kingdom, he began to demonstrate that his kingdom was not just one of words, but one of power. Verse 23. And Jesus was going about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom. But he didn't just proclaim it, he did it. He healed every kind of disease, every kind of sickness among the people. And the news about him went into all Syria. And they brought to him all who were ill, taken with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics, and he healed them. You really got to get the picture here. Remember, again, this is a frustrating thing for me because it's been three weeks since we've been here. I know that some of you weren't even here when we did do this, but one of the significant things of the inauguration of Jesus' ministry was that he began in Galilee of the Gentiles. Remember that? Galilee of the Gentiles. Not where the religious people were, but where the yucky people were, where the sinful people were. The downtrodden, the people who had a lousy self-image. They were really never going to be used by God for anything significant. And it was to them that he came. And it was fishermen that he called. And now, these downtrodden people who never really had a place are getting involved with this guy who is called the Messiah, who's walking around healing people of their diseases and casting out demons. I'm telling you, hot dog. It looks like we're finally going to come out on top. I'm going to latch on to this guy. We're talking power here. We're talking glory. We're talking status. I don't want to hear no more about Galilee of the Gentiles. We're going to be the ones that he really does use. And those grubby old Pharisees won't have nothing to do with it anymore. Wow, it's going to be us. We got a winner in this Jesus. Everybody likes a winner. We got a winner in this guy. And he's going to turn it all around for us. And we even know that this winner is going to be about God. It's not going to be like the world. And we're not going to be like those impotent religious guys. It isn't going to be about religion. It's going to be about power. And we're going to be casting out demons. And we're going to be healing sick people. And we're going to be raising our hands and speaking in tongues. And it's going to be incredible. The kingdom has come. And beloved church, the open door. I feel us in that same thing. But I tell you, the deepest desire we have is we want to be a what? We want to be a kingdom church, right? And that means we want to go beyond the impotence of religiosity and we want to understand the grace of God, but we also want to see the power of God. And we've talked about the gifts of the Spirit that are for today. And we believe in healing and we believe that power, there is power of God to cast out demons. And there's a lot of excitement. And a lot of us are going, yeah, this is it, the winners. We're going to be on that side and this is really neat. And boy, oh boy, where do I sign up? And you want to know something? That's exactly the response that was going on there. When something wowee zowie happens, everybody wants to get on. Where do we sign up? Verse 25 is exactly what they were saying. Where do we sign up? And great multitudes followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea. It wasn't just Galilee anymore. When something is a success, it draws a crowd. Hey, this is going to be great. Maybe we'll build a building with fountains and Cadillac. All in the name of God. He'll be great. In chapter 5 verse 1, "And when he saw the multitudes, he said, 'We finally got it going now.' And when he saw the multitudes, he did what church growth people would say you should never do. He withdrew from the multitudes. And he sat down with his disciples and opened his mouth and began to teach. are you doing? You got a movement going. You got people excited about all sorts of wowie zowie things. And then right in the middle of having them right in the palm of your hand, you go, wait a minute, hold it. You don't get it. You need to hear something else. And as he opens his mouth, I believe Jesus is saying basically two things. Guys, I got some good news for you, but I got some bad news for you. The good news, guys, is this. My kingdom has power like you don't know. And my kingdom is about authority, and it is about authority over sickness, and it is about authority over demons, and it is about power and glory, and it is absolutely boggling to the mind. And guys, I want you to know that I have blessing for you. Blessed are these, and blessed are these. And I have that for you, and that is my deepest desire for you. But the bad news is this, guys. It's not always going to come the way you think. And what you need to know from the very beginning about the kingdom that has come, the kingdom that I have brought, that is about power, and it is about authority, and it is about glory, and it is about blessing. It is this, that it is not a kingdom for the powerful and for the power hungry. And it is not a kingdom for the self-gratified and for the self-gratifying. It is a kingdom that will be realized and it is a kingdom whose power will be known by those who are weak and dependent and sad and mourning over their sin and hungry for righteousness. And if you've come here to seek the power and if you've come here to seek the glory and if you've come here because the wowie zowie thing is happening, you'll never know the reality of the kingdom that you seek. Because in my kingdom, blessed are the broken. It is to the broken that the kingdom belongs, and it is through the broken that the power flows. That sets the scene. And I think it sets the scene for us. We live in a day where we're hearing lots of voices. Lots of evangelical voices promising all sorts of spiritual lollipops. Oh, God will do this. And anybody here want to live forever? Say I do. It's a great song. Anybody here want to be broken? First? That's the scene. Let's start defining some terms very quickly. And I think very simply. Poor in spirit. I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about this, and I hope we can, by the Spirit of God, help to clarify this and buy some studying. Poor in spirit simply means whatever kind of poor this is, it is with reference to the spirit. It is not a physical poverty that is being exalted. There are other places in the scripture. In fact, in Luke, I think it's chapter 6, when Luke is delineating this teaching, he says, blessed are the poor, and he doesn't give the reference to the spirit. And there is other teaching about how rich people have a hard time entering into the kingdom. But the problem isn't against the riches. The problem that is always being dealt with is the internal condition of dependence. The problem with rich people isn't the money. The problem with rich people is that they have a tendency to get their life from the money and to depend on the money. And that's what they look to to make them okay. Poor people don't have any delusions about themselves. And they're open to getting dependence from someplace else. But this is dealing with people who are poor in reference to their inward spirit. Let's look at the word poor, though. It is a very significant word. In the Greek, it is the word tokos. And specifically, it means, wonderfully, a begging dependence. Isn't that something you all desire? I just can't wait to get like that. It means to be broken. And I think it is interesting, beloved, that the very first thing that Jesus establishes or wants to establish about his kingdom life is what? Is that it's for the big guys and for the grand guys and for the glorious. It is for the winners and for the performers, right? No, the first thing I want to establish about my kingdom is this, that it is for the beggars who have come to the end of themselves, who realize they are poor, who come to the point where they say things like this, Jesus, my only hope is you. That's what it means to be a beggar. That's what it means to enter into kingdom life. And those are the kind of people who enter into kingdom power. My only hope is you. I said at the very beginning that these are principles that I'm not sure can be taught. They need somehow to be caught. And I think Jesus understood that. And so in trying to describe them, he gave illustrations. Turn with me to Luke chapter 18. He gives an illustration of this principle and we can see it. We can look at it. It's a story that you're very familiar with. I've used this several times. Verse 9, Luke chapter 18, verse 9. And he also told... You all there? I hear pages rustling. Okay. And he also told his parable to certain ones who trusted in themselves, who trusted in themselves, that they were righteous and viewed others with contempt. Let me tell you about this. Two men went up into the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee. A Pharisee would be one who was content with himself. He had surrounded himself with all the wonderful things he did, and the reason he felt good about himself was because of his religious performance. And the other was a publican or a tax gatherer. And a tax gatherer would be a social leper. Nobody would want to be around him. Someone very aware of his sin. He did not fit up to the definition of what spiritual people are like. And the Pharisee that everyone looked at and thought was spiritual, the Pharisee from whom everyone got their definition of what was spiritual, stood and was praying to himself, God, I thank you that I'm not like him, swindlers or other people, swindlers, unjust, adulterers, who we wouldn't ever let in our church, or even like that scummy guy over there, that tax gatherer. For I fast twice a week, and I pay tithes of all I get. What was he looking to to tell him he was okay? The thing that he was looking to to affirm the fact that he was okay was the fact that he did these wonderful spiritual things. I fast twice a week and I pay tithes of all I get. Good for you. And again, not only was his definition of spirituality all the external things that he did that made him proud, but everyone else's definition of spirituality in that culture was of that kind of thing. And they would look at those kind of people and say, if I can only be like him, I'd be okay. And I'm afraid even in our culture, it's the same kind of thing. We have definitions of spirituality in people who are broken and hurt and hungry and aware of their sin because the only perception they've got of what is spiritual is very often coming from churches who are filled with self-righteous people have this perception of themselves that God could never use me but I got good news for you people. Blessed are you. Blessed are the poor in spirit because here's this guy. But the tax gatherer standing some distance away was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven but was beating his breasts saying this, God, be merciful to me, a sinner. I think it's significant that the very first dynamic that Jesus uses in terms of describing kingdom life is this one, being poor in spirit. And the reason I think it's significant, first of all, is because I believe that's how you enter the kingdom. I don't believe anybody has ever entered the kingdom unless somewhere along the line he became broken. He came to the end of himself and said basically this, Jesus, I can't do it myself. And if you haven't come that way, you need to consider the possibility that you never really did enter his kingdom. We offer lollipops to people. Again, what I said before, anybody here want to live forever? Just sign up here. Can I ask you a question? Of those two people, who would you rather be? Now, we know the right answer. Nobody's going to say, I would rather be the Pharisee. But in our spirits, In our spirits, if we're honest with ourselves, sometimes the image that we try very hard to project to people is one of adequacy, isn't it? It's one of being all together, of having it all done. And I go to seminars that tell me how to be better and look better. And the irony of all of that, as I pump myself up, even doing good things, is that Jesus comes along and says, you don't get it. Blessed are the poor in spirit. The one who is broken and knows they're broken is the one who comes dependently to me, and that is the person who owns the kingdom and the power of the kingdom will be known to him. I can illustrate it this way. One of the things that I delight in about our church is that our church is becoming more and more a safe place where broken people can come. Grace is here. And every once in a while, someone will stand up and share like in a communion service or something, and they'll begin to cry, and they'll begin to apologize as soon as they do. And you can tell there's this tremendous emotion, because God has done something in their life and dealt with them in a way that's very rich. And they'll say, I knew I was going to do this, and I really don't want to do this, and I was going to do this last week, but I didn't want to do it because I knew this would happen. And now I hear, I'm all a mess, and I don't know if I can say it. And they try to say it, and they stumble. And they sit down feeling like a jerk and feeling all stupid. And what you need to hear is good news. I got good news for you. Blessed are the broken. The thing we run away from the most, trying so hard to keep ourselves together and never show the fact that sometimes inside we're hurting and never let it down. The very thing we run from is the very thing that can set us free by letting it out and coming to God and saying, God, be merciful to me, a sinner. Let me show you another picture of it. You remember Jacob? Jacob's a good illustration of this because Jacob was like a Pharisee in that he was tough. Jacob, in Genesis chapter 32, was a self-sufficient guy. Nobody. I don't need anybody. And it talks about Jacob in chapter 32, wrestling with God. Remember that? And he wrestled, and he wrestled, and that's what self-sufficient people do. And I can do it, and I can do it, and I'm not going to yield. But then all of a sudden, God in his mercy, and in his grace, and because he loved Jacob so much, and wanted to use him so much, touched his side. Remember that? And he dislocated his hip. And now Jacob didn't have any fight in him anymore. You know what he was? He was broken. And all of a sudden, Jacob's whole relationship with his angel with whom he wrestled changed. Rather than fighting him, you know what he started doing? He started hanging on to him. I will not let you go. That's broken in spirit. That's broken in spirit. It is not a brokenness that is done to revile you or make you look wimpy or whining, but one that makes us dependent so that in that position, the real power and glory of the kingdom of God can be known to us and flow through us. 2 Corinthians chapter 12. And this is good. What I like about this is here we see Paul's aversion to the brokenness, just like us. I don't like to be broken Paul says in verse 7 something that's kind of funny almost he says because I know that I get incredible revelations and God uses me in unbelievable ways basically that's what he's saying to keep me from exalting myself there has been given to me a thorn in the flesh a messenger of Satan to buffet me to break me to sometimes humiliate me to keep me from what? exalting myself and depending on me concerning this thing I have asked God three times that it might depart from me. I don't like it. But God has said something to me and it's a truth about the kingdom I think Paul is saying here that I had to understand and I had to learn and I had to learn it the hard way but it's one I'm willing to submit to even though in my spirit sometimes I don't like it. What he said to me was this, my grace is sufficient for you Paul because what you don't understand is this, the power is perfected in your weakness and with that in mind he submits and says therefore gladly i would boast about my weakness i would rather boast about my weakness that the power of christ may dwell in me therefore i am well content with weaknesses with insults with distresses with persecutions with difficulties for christ's sake because what i've learned is this that when i am weak and when i am broken and when i am poor in spirit i become dependent and then when i become dependent god begins to move and then i am what strong paradox you know what though let me give what I think is the perversion of this particular dynamic you see some people hear this particular passage of scripture blessed are the poor in spirit and the poor in spirit never does become a real dependence on God it never does become a thing of absolute real genuine brokenness before god that is dependence on him so the power can flow it becomes kind of a whining thing and they take this poor in spirit thing and they try to put it on like they would a coat well you know the appropriate response is to be poor in spirit and so i'm going to be poor in their you know mealy mouth and kind of timid and weak and weakness is good and pious and kind of apologetic and wouldn't ever confront anything which is really an incredible diversion from the picture we see of the apostles who by the power of God and Paul by the power of God even in a position of weakness when he became dependent became bold I'm a pastor you know one of the things that I struggle with as a young man considering whether God really was calling me into the ministry was whether I could look poor in spirit enough, you know? Hello, everyone. You know, it's interesting as a study in the Greek is one of the things that helps us here, because there is a very specific word here used for poor in spirit, and there is more than one word in the Greek for poor. The word we're dealing with here that Jesus is describing as a brokenness that is dependent on God is the word tokos. The common word, however, for poor is not tokos. The common word for poor is penicros. Neat word. What it means is this. It is someone who is poor, but this poor person still manages to work it out, muddle through, and make a living. Do you get the picture? In a physical sense, let's get the picture. Penicros, someone who is poor, is someone who is poor. And they know they're poor, and they don't like their life, and it's really kind of yucky, but they muddle through, okay. And they kind of go to the garbage heap, and they rummage through there, and they get enough to eat, and they stick it in their mouth, and they don't really like it, but then they walk around going, yes, I'm poor, and isn't this nice? Now we've got that picture. The picture in a physical sense of tokos is one who doesn't even have the strength anymore to rummage through the garbage. I don't have anything to do. I don't have any energy left. I am totally dependent on someone else in grace and mercy coming in, picking me up out of the gutter. Nothing is left at all. In a spiritual sense, we've already defined tokos as one who is at the end of themselves and comes to a place where the only hope I've got is you. In a spiritual sense, Peronikos is one who is poor spiritually. One who, however, hasn't been broken. They're still rummaging through the garbage in their spiritual life. They're still trying to work it all out. And, oh yes, I know that I'm not very good and I'm kind of poor, but I'm doing the best I can and I'll just kind of keep muddling through and call that poor in spirit. That's not poor in spirit. That's just poor. you get it some of the people who are just poor but not poor in spirit are people who have never really come to Christ yet they certainly aren't proud Pharisees but they aren't broken beggars either and they are the people like I just described they say things like this well I go to church yes and I give money and I feel kind of poor and you know it says that blessed are those who are poor in spirit and that's certainly me because I'm really kind of a mush again they're not poor in spirit they're not broken they're not at the end of themselves even in their poverty the thing they're looking to to make them okay is their poverty do you get that? they're poor and that's what makes them okay they're not broken though they're not looking to God because as soon as they do and become dependent on him the irony and the glory is the power of the kingdom begins to be flowing through them and they don't look poor anymore God begins to move through them some of the people who look like this poor but not poor in spirit are some who are redeemed and they know of the grace for salvation and they have received that. But when it comes to service and when it comes to entering into the power of God for their daily living, they still muddle through and they try hard and they do their best and they work their fingers to the bone but they never enter into the power, they never enter into the blessing, they never enter into the impact, they never see boldness coming through there and they're always just good little Christians. They say, oh, very apologetic, oh, and that's poor in spirit. That's not poor in spirit, that's just poor. why I've said it a million times this morning not quite because those who are genuinely poor in spirit have given up all their pretense of trying hard and being good and hoping it's enough they've come to a place where they have said that there is nothing I can do and the only hope I have is him for salvation the only hope I have is him for sanctification. The only hope I have is him for service. And if he doesn't do it, it can't be done. Blessed are you. For you are possessors of the kingdom and you will know the power of the kingdom. How do you get broken? Five steps to brokenness. I just think, well, I'll just kind of mark it, set, go. I don't know how to answer that you know it's interesting it's very interesting the word blessed in another word study there's not a call this is not a call to be broken in fact it's a statement of a fact all I'm doing is Jesus says is I want to show you what's good and what's not I want to show you what's blessed and what's cursed in fact later he's going to say woe to you Pharisees who look good on the outside but you're like snakes on the inside woe to you blessed are you I'm just giving you the categories here and he doesn't even tell us how to get broken the only thing I know how to do is look inside have you ever been broken? have you ever come to a place in your life where you were broken? what did it take? how many right things did you do until you got broken? well to be sure beloved there was something of you involved I think there was a time when you said Lord I want to be used by you and I am tired and I am weary and I have been striving and I can't do it anymore and I am at the end of myself and I am willing to be broken. I am willing to confess my sin. This thing I've been hanging on to, this attitude that I've got toward a brother and I've hung on to it and hung on to it and it's been killing me. I'm willing to be broken. And yes, it says, Peter says, humble yourselves. So there is an element where my will is involved somewhere in this process of brokenness. But you know what I know most about me? The times I've been broken have been times when somewhere in a combination of my saying, God, I'm willing. But it was really God's grace that simply touched my life and broke my spirit so that I could again know dependence. But not to devalue me because his intention was to bless me and use me. And the very thing I run from with everything I've got And the thing I try hardest to be is together inadequate and sharp. And the brokenness when I feel like I'm failing, that I want to avoid, is the very thing when I yield to that and just acknowledge my inadequacy, that God's power begins to flow. And again, I feel like a king and a priest and a son and an heir and a servant who can be used by God who made me. See, I got good news for you who are broken. And I got good news for you who are sad. Blessed are you. Don't hold it back. Don't pretend you're not. Don't try to be tough. Let God break you so he can use you. But I got bad news for those of you who are still trying to do it yourself. You'll never know the blessing. You'll never know the power. You'll never know the glory of kingdom life. I don't think there's a person here myself included who doesn't want to see our church become what we've called a kingdom church but I hope what I've communicated this morning is the way we become a kingdom church is not to start talking just about healing and miracles and casting all demons it's about a group of people who are coming to God and saying Lord I'm willing to be broken I'm willing to look at my sin and I'm willing God to be put into position by you where I learn over and over and over again my utter dependence on you as my source. Can I give you one other little clue here about brokenness? The tokos here is a beggarly kind of thing. You know what I know about beggars? They ask. They ask. God, put me back together. God, heal the place I'm hurt. God, I can't do it anymore on my own. I'm tired. I'm weary. It's the spirit of the publican. It's the spirit of Jacob when he wouldn't let go. It's the spirit of Paul when he said it's in weakness and fear and much trembling that I come to you. It's the spirit of the twelve fishermen from Galilee who said, who are we? We can't be used. It's the spirit of Moses who said the same thing. I can't be used. I don't have anything to say. I can't do it. I can't do it. Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. Let's pray. God, my desire for us and our desire is your people. We don't have goals like let's get to be a big church. Our goal is not to be let's get to be a really neat place and where all these things are happening. God, we want to be a kingdom people. And God, we see ourselves sitting at your feet on a hillside right now, learning from you, our master and king. And some of us are scratching our heads this morning, maybe just still trying to figure out all of this, but we're going to stay here and keep learning. But some of us this morning are in that position of having heard good news, because they are hurt and they are broken, and they have come to the end of themselves, and the good news they've heard today is that that's okay. and that they could come and get help. And I pray for those who are in that position that they would indeed come and receive the blessing, your blessing, your touch, your healing hand. But God, there are some who still hang on to all their own striving. And I pray that they would simply hear the confrontation week after week after week. work these things in us by your spirit in Jesus name Amen Amen.
