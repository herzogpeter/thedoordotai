This question, whatever happened to this guy's heart? And a warning question, could what happened to David's heart happen to mine? For a while, it looked like David was going to get away with it. He was the king after all, and kings can kind of do whatever they want. They have the power and capacity to manage their lives and cover things up in ways that normal people don't seem to be able to. Verse 26, 2 Samuel 11, however, says that when the wife of Uriah, that is Bathsheba, heard that Uriah, her husband, was dead, having been set up to die in battle by David, though we aren't sure if Bathsheba knew that or not. She mourned for her husband. Verse 27, when the time of mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house and she became his wife. So it's holy now. They're married. Looks like he's getting away with it. The cover up is complete. He got what he wanted and everybody lives happily ever after. Then she bore him a son, it says in verse 27, obviously the product of their adultery, which tells us something in terms of even the time span here. She's now given birth. Some time has gone on. It's almost been a year since this thing began, which, believe it or not, actually tells us something more about David's heart, at least at this time in his life. It's this, that he's learned to live with this for a year. it's not good the end of verse 27 very significant word but but the thing that David had done was evil in the sight of the Lord no one else saw God did see which means among other things that David's not going to get away with this even though for a year it looks as though he is. The hammer is about to fall. Not because, please get this, not because God didn't love David, but precisely because God furiously loved David. Not because God's through with David, but precisely because he is going to continue to use David. David's sin is about to be exposed. was a little word about this before I move on. Lots of things are evil in God's sight that people seem to get away with. Indeed, it drives us crazy. The psalmist cries out, along with these kinds of expressions in the book of Revelation, how long, oh Lord, is evil going to triumph? How long is it going to happen where it looks like evil and evil people get away with it? Well, here's the deal. Eventually, they don't get away with it. We believe, and from Scripture, know that even if we have to wait for eternity, things will be made right. If not in this life, then the next. Justice will prevail. Evil does not, cannot, will not ever win. Ever. But, if you belong to God, if you're part of the family of God, by faith have been adopted as his child, have entered into even a higher metaphor of relationship than a child, we are the bride, he is the groom. If you have entered by covenant to that kind of marriage-love relationship like David had, the good news slash bad news is this. You're not going to get away with it now. indeed one of the signs beloved that you do in fact belong to god is that you don't get away with it whatever it is now he was 12 verse 4 says this or have you forgotten the exhortation addressed to you as sons and daughters this is obviously the the words of a father to his children children sons and daughters Hear me. Do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when you are reproved by him. Look me in the eye right now. That verse is saying, don't be wimping out on me and kind of sulk off into a corner. Do not grow weary here. For those whom the Lord loves, he disciplines. Those whom the Lord loves, he disciplines. Guess who wrote those words? David did. What do you mean? I thought you were quoting Hebrews 12. If you look at Hebrews 12 verse 6, Hebrews 12 verse 6 is a quote from Psalm 119. So how did he know that the ones he disciplines are the ones he loves? Because he had experienced that discipline. And eventually, he felt loved by that discipline. Now, when you experience the discipline of the Lord, the kind of discipline that is going to come on David right now, When you're in the middle of it, on the front end of it, it doesn't feel like love at all. The only way you see the love is if you get the long view and you look back on what really was going on. Because the fact is, the next verse in Hebrews 12 says, All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful but sorrowful. Yet to those who have been trained by it, affected by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness. You know why it's peaceful? Because you don't have to hide anymore. You don't have to cover anymore. There's no more managing. I think all of us rightly fear having our sin exposed. I just think it's a human thing. You're not odd in that. It's why we hide it if we still have a conscience about it. If you don't have a conscience about your sin, you don't care who sees, and it's just all out there. I suggest, however, that we fear not having our sin exposed. now I can't make you feel that way it's more something you're just going to have to understand I suppose or fear that if your sin is exposed not caring that it is exposed because you've grown used to your sin or you love your sin the apostle Paul in Romans 1 speaks of how God sometimes gives people over to their sin he gives them over to what they want after showing over time this is what I want I want this I want to embrace this way of living this lifestyle this belief God eventually gives them over to the depravity that they desire. And guess what happens then? No more conscience. No more conviction. God will not call you anymore. God will not move on you. No more discipline of the Lord. But that would be a sign. If the discipline of the Lord never came on you, if you felt no conviction of sin anymore, that would be a sign that you're not a son. That would be a sign that you are not a daughter, and that would be a very bad sign. And that is why in chapter 12, verse 1, the Lord sent Nathan to David with a parable. A parable designed, as we discovered last week, to expose David's sin, to break through his denial, to call him out of hiding and hopefully to bring about the kind of repentance that might heal his soul and help him recover his heart. I'm sure if you were here last week, you remember the story that Nathan told David about a rich man with all sorts of sheep of his own. He needs one sheep, just one sheep for dinner guests who are coming, but instead of using one of the sheep from his vast flock, he takes the pet lamb from a poor man living down the street, the only lamb he had, and uses that lamb to serve his dinner guests. Chapter 12, verse 5, then David's anger burned greatly against the man in the story. Because when you're blind to, or you're not dealing with your own stuff, your own sin, it's really easy to become indignant and incensed about everybody else's. Then David said to Nathan, Further, as the Lord lives, surely the man who has done this deed deserves to die. To which Nathan said in verse 7, Thou art the man, David. I'm talking about you. You are the rich man in the story who deserves to die. Then, in the story, in the text, the gloves come off. No more backdoor confrontation skillfully hidden in a parable. Verses 7 through 9, starting in verse 7, it says this. Nathan is speaking, thus saith the Lord. Now, Nathan was a prophet, but never in his life will he function more clearly and powerfully in the prophetic role of speaking the very words of God than he does right here. Thus saith the Lord. David, this is God talking now. And this is what God is saying to you, David. It is I who anointed you king over Israel. I anointed you. It is I who delivered you from the hand of Saul. I delivered you. It is I who also gave you your master's house, your master's wives, and the house of Israel and Judah. Three words, very powerful. I anointed you. I delivered you. I provided for you everything you need. And if that had been too little, I would have done more. I would have done many more things like these. And then the first word of verse 9 I find compelling. Why? Why? Why have you despised the word of the Lord by doing this evil thing? I want you to stop for a moment and kind of absorb what's going on here and even the anger of God here that is a bit disturbing. I think three weeks ago when we began this story, the word I was using, disturbing, this is disturbing. The anger of God. But I want you to notice something beyond the actual words of God to the energy and the emotion with which these words are coming. Now I may be stretching it here but I don't think I am Because I believe when I just kind of get into the feeling of those three verses That there is something in the anger of God toward David here That sounds almost intimate We don't normally equate anger with intimacy But the energy I feel coming off of those three verses it almost sounds like the way a spouse might express her or himself to an offending spouse when intimate love has been betrayed. Why? That why question is a question you can't answer. You have been pinned to the wall. I provided for you. I delivered you. I anointed you. I gave you everything I had to give you. If you wanted more, I would have given more. Why? There was something intimate that has been betrayed here that helps explain the anger of God toward David. I think further on that, a strange thought comes to my mind. It's this. It just could be that the scariest thing about God is the love of God. There's an odd thought. think that thought why would the scariest love of God sometimes be the scariest thing about God be the love of God here's why, because the love of God is real because the love of God for you isn't impersonal it's personal, because the love of God for you isn't distant it's in here it's based on covenant and because it's personal, God is incapable of being dispassionate because it's a personal love. He loves you. He loves me. Has entered into covenant with me and you because it's that kind of love. That kind of love is capable of being wounded when betrayed. We call it around here the wild love of God. Did a series on that years ago in the Ten Commandments. The wild love of God pursuing us. Passionate in his pursuit of us. The love of God is incapable of being dispassionate toward the people he authentically really loves. For our God is a jealous God. Well, that sounds like a bad thing. The jealousy of God is born of the love of God for you. I'm not willing to share you with anybody. It would be like two people getting married and saying to each other, take all the pictures of your old boyfriends and girlfriends off the dresser. That's unreasonable. No, it's not. I think some of us need to be reminded because I think we forget the kind of covenant the kind of relationship we really are in with God if you're in one with God keep him distant, keep it religious you will not feel this kind of anger of God because you're not in the love piece of God see, I think an awful lot of people and you could say, oh, this is absolutely the way it is in the world. It's the way it is in many churches as well, maybe even for some of you. For many people, I believe, the love of God is like a big, soft, benevolent grandma who you visit once a week, and no matter what you do, no matter where you've been, no matter how you live, what she gives you when she sees you is a great big hug. She pulls you into her bosom. You can't even breathe. Oh, Johnny, I just love you so much. you have an extra piece of cake. You get a great big hug and an extra piece of cake. Now, the grandma God is nice. And I think that's why a lot of people like her. By the way, my apologies to all you grandmas who do this very thing. And you know what, grandmas? Keep doing that. Keep giving us hugs and loving us no matter what. We all need somebody like that in our life. But I don't want you to be God because you're not. the grandma god is nice but here is the truth about the grandma god if she's the god I'm going to week after week she doesn't have a clue about me she doesn't see me all week long she's not partnering with me in my life I just go visit her on Sundays she doesn't know a thing about me we're really not doing life together I will visit her once a week and when I do, I'll get a great big hug and an extra piece of cake. It's why I go to church. You know why I go to church? For a great big hug and an extra piece of cake. And I make sure that I go to a church that will give me a great big hug and an extra piece of cake. A church that has no idea how I've been living, what I've been thinking, how I've been feeling. No idea. Just a great big hug and an extra piece of cake. I love no matter what. That is not the God that is talking to David in verses 7 through 9. Grandma God So if I'm sleeping with my neighbor's wife Grandma don't care Just a big hug and an extra piece of cake So if I'm stealing from my boss Grandma God don't care Just a great big hug and an extra piece of cake If I'm gossiping about People in my family or at work or at church and speaking words that undermine their life and their care. God and grandma God don't care. You just get a great big hug and an extra piece of cake. And we think that's the love of God. That is not the God, again, that is speaking to David in verses 7 through 9. And that is not the kind of love that David was experiencing. No, I'm talking about the love of God that came to Israel after the Exodus and said fundamentally this. Israel, I want to make a covenant with you. A covenant that could be best described as a marriage. The Ten Commandments being the wedding vows. Remember when we taught that years ago? Maybe some of you obviously don't. And it's an amazing story, really, and one that I actually forget in terms of the dynamic of it. In Exodus chapter 20, this is the part most of us are aware of. Moses went up to the mountain, got the Ten Commandments, came down. They were worshiping the golden calf. He threw the tablets down and broke the law, that kind of stuff. And we kind of see those things as laws, and they broke the rules, and God was mad because they broke the rules. But it was much bigger than rules that were being broken. These really were the wedding vows. And it wasn't until Exodus chapter 34 after they kind of worked out the kinks, if you will, in their relationship, their relationship being God and Israel. And if you want to see the war that that was, you know, they went to counseling for a while. From chapter 20 to chapter 34. In chapter 34, God comes back to Israel and says, I still, believe it or not, I still want to marry you. I still want to be in covenant with you. And so he brought the vows, Ten Commandments, back in Exodus 34. And it was as if Israel, the people of God and God, looked eye to eye and said, from this day forward, you and no others, I will take all the pictures of my old boyfriends off the dresser. to have him to hold. That's the kind of love we're talking about. In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul's favorite metaphor was seeing the church as the what? The bride of Christ. And Jesus being the groom. Now, the upside of that marriage metaphor is the romance. It's the intimacy. It's the sense that God is not just distant. There is going to be a partnership in my life. There's a vibrancy. There's a tremendous commitment on God's part to me and a tremendous commitment on my part to him. And it touches every button that getting married would touch, the capacity to enter into someone's life, to open up to someone's life, to submit to someone else, to be involved with them, to follow them. and with God as the groom all of the resources wealth and power are available to me as the bride he brings all of that stuff into the marriage I married a rich guy and the spirit of that is in verse 7 I anointed you I delivered you I provided for you and if that was too little I would have gladly given you more all of my resources have been at your disposal. We've been married, David. The downside of the metaphor is obvious as well. The obvious downside of this metaphor is that when this kind of covenant is broken, the pain is real, the wound is deep, the anger is intense. I think what we have in verses 7 through 9 is the anger of intimate love betrayed. Series of questions, really just fire them off. Is the relationship over? I mean if this was a marriage that's what's up, that's what's at stake are we going to stay together? Is the relationship between God and David over? The answer is no could it be healed? can it be healed? Yes is God going to give up on David? no will David ever recover his heart? Yes will it be quick and easy? no given the metaphor do you think we ever take our sin too lightly? yeah do you ever wonder if we even have a clue how we wound the heart of God now before I move to David's response which will reveal that he gets this that his sin was even more than adultery his response will reveal that before I get to that I want to give you another metaphor at work in the story that will help us more clearly understand what's really going on here why God responds the way he does it will help us understand his anger and why Nathan responds the way he does on even David. Here's the metaphor. In addition to the other one, David was a king. The second one that Israel ever had in other cultures in ancient times. Kings were often seen as deity. That's true in Egypt. It was also true in Rome. Caesar was seen as a god. When you're a god, you make the rules. When you're a god, you call the shots. You answer to no one. You have ultimate authority. you answer again to no one. But the kingdom that God was bringing into the world through Israel, using David as kind of a symbol of all of this, was a very different kind of kingdom. There was nothing like it in the world till now. It wasn't a monarchy. It wasn't a democracy. It was a theocracy. Theocracy, theos, God. God's going to rule. God is the king. In Israel, the king was not seen as God. The king was under God. Kings had great authority. Kings had great privilege. Kings had great power. But their power, authority, and privilege were only legitimate when they were under authority. Yes, David was a king, but David had a king. And when David lived as a man who was subject to that king in humility and in obedience, bowing, you know, kings don't bow to anybody. Yes, they do. It's the only way you can trust them. When David was living as a subject to the king who saw himself as a humble servant of that king and nothing more than that, when he was living that way, he was a great king. with all sorts of power, all sorts of authority. People loved him and served him with gladness. Put it together. See, part of the anger of God toward David's sin in verses 7 through 9 was not just in intimate love betrayed. It's more than that. It's fiercer than that. It's the anger of a king speaking to a servant in whom he has placed great trust, to whom he has given many gifts. And God in verses 7 through 9 is essentially saying this, who do you think you are? Who died and made you king? You're not the king. I'm the king. When did you decide, David, that you could do whatever you wanted? When did you decide that you could make the rules? When did you decide that you could break the rules? Verse 9, why have you despised the word of the Lord? Let me think. Why would you despise the word of the Lord? You must think you're bigger than the word of the Lord. You must think you're king. You must think you're God. You're not. Then David said, verse 13, I have sinned against the Lord. Which tells us he's beginning to get it. I kind of, in my mind, I kind of hear a generator. He's coming back to life. The lights are starting to come on. He's beginning to see what he has done. To say I have sinned against the Lord is to say I understand that I have done more than break a rule. To say I have sinned against the Lord is to say I understand. I understand the nature of this. And by the way, any kind of true repentance involves a deep understanding of what you have actually done. How many of you go crazy when you're dealing with your kids or something and you're confronting them? I'm sorry. And you go, sorry? That's not enough. Well, I said I was sorry. You have no idea what you did. To say I have sinned against the Lord says I understand I've done more than cross a boundary or make a bad choice. I've even done more than commit adultery. He's going to have to go and deal with his adultery and the murder thing. He's going to have to deal with that. But the core of his sin, he understood, was bigger than that. I've sinned against God. What I have actually done is betrayed the intimate love of God, having actually begun to believe that I am God, not humbly and obediently under God. And once I moved away from God, David's saying here, the adultery stuff was easy. Even murder was possible. The root sin was I left God. And before I make it right with Bathsheba, and before I don't even know how to make it right with the other murder thing, I gotta make it right with God and then maybe with his help we can go pick up the pieces so David says I've sinned against the Lord second part of that verse says this then Nathan said to David the Lord has taken away your sin you shall not die now I don't know how that affects you but you can see it on the screen but I see it in the text and this is a story that goes two chapters long and then it goes further on into the book of 2 Samuel and Chronicles and things like that. And there's this one little verse, this one little verse. David says, I've sinned. Nathan says, God's taken away your sin. You shall not die. First response I have to that was, that's it? That's all? That's kind of cool. I say, I'm sorry. He says, okay. Not quite, not quite. Make no mistake, beloved. When we confess our sin, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sin. Make no mistake, David's heart will be restored. God's grace will be lavished upon him. But hear me now. God's grace is not like a great big mattress at the bottom of a cliff that keeps you from hurting yourself when you jump off the cliff. The fact is this, beloved. If you jump off a cliff thinking that the laws of gravity don't apply to you, you are going to fall. And if you fall, you are going to hit. And when you hit, you are going to be hurt. Here's my point. There are consequences for sin that grace does not remove. So if you break the law, civil law, let's just say, if you rob a bank and bezel money from your employer, don't pay your taxes, is there grace for that? I promise you, you come to me or one of us or go to your friend or go to God and say, God, I have sinned. I promise you there is grace that is greater than all. Yes, absolutely, there is grace for that. But you're still going to jail. The grace of God will come into that place and empower you and fill you and clean you and help you go through your jail sentence. if you have sex with someone who's not your spouse is there grace for that when you come and say I have sinned against the Lord absolutely there's grace for that and we have seen that grace lavished on people here and you, some of you have experienced the amazing grace of God when you moved into things you didn't even think you were capable of yes there's grace but you still might lose your marriage and you still might lose the respect of your children and you still might get a sexually transmitted disease and you still might get pregnant from someone who's not your husband. And if you use, manipulate, and lie to people, is there grace for that? There's grace for that. Absolutely there's grace for that. But I'm still not going to trust you for a very long time. the word and first word in verse 14 after this little simple thing looks like everything's better now says your sins are forgiven you shall not die what's the word however let's take a quick look at the consequences that rippled out from david's sin verse 14 because of what you did the enemies of the lord will blaspheme god this one just this one's just incredible to me in other words let me just say it a different way the people who already hate God are going to use your sin David as proof that the kingdom of God is just a bunch of baloney it's just a crock let me ask you a question how contemporary is that reality have you ever seen that happen yeah you have that happens every time a church leader's sin ends up in the newspaper and you've been there I've been there, you see it on the news and it's like I can see myself kind of open in the paper reading the account of maybe somebody I even know and it's almost like I can hear all the papers opening all through the city and there's a murmur of cynicism and I I think, and it even serves as a warning, and it needs to be a warning, that for you to despise the word of the Lord, David, us, could cause the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme God. Let me ask you a question. Is there grace for that? Yeah. But guess what? God is still going to get blasphemed, even though you will get healed if you repent. Beyond that, one of the consequences, and you know this, it's part of the story that we usually, most people know about the story. The day be born of this adultery dies. Verse 10, it says this, the sword will never depart from your house, David. That's one of the ripples out of this. Why? Well, I even think there's just a natural consequence in that. Because in your violence, what you did, David, was you released violence into your family. It's what you did. Is there grace for that? Absolutely. And David's going to recover his heart, and there's going to be ripples out of his healing as well. But the sword never departed from his house. Two of his sons died a violent death. Absalom, we're going to meet him in a few weeks. Not sure when, it might be a while, but we're going to meet him. Pretty angry kid. I think that was one of the ripples of David's sin. Was there grace for David's sin? Yes. consequences still. Sometimes the consequences are simply a failure to experience what might have been. Oh yeah, look at verse 8 again. I would have added many more things, said the Lord. If you wanted more, I would have given many more things. Why didn't you come to me for what you needed? You thought you could get it from that woman. I would have given many more things. David, just to make that real specific, would not be able to build a temple. God was going to use David to build the temple. He was able to raise the offering for the temple, but he wasn't going to build the temple. It could have been. Is there grace for that? You bet there is, but he still is not going to build the temple. When I think of how sometimes our consequences keep us from experiencing what might have been, I think, of a friend. Maybe you do. Or maybe you can even experience these things in your own life. You don't have to go further than your own story. But I have a friend who was on a journey with me, a very good friend. Loved him dearly. Came to a critical point in his marriage, which, hello, all of us do. If you're struggling in your marriage, welcome to marriage. Came to a critical point in his marriage. And decided that he didn't want to press through and press into the issues that were in his marriage. And they were difficult issues, but by the grace of God, people can learn how to love their wives. And people can learn how to love their husbands. And people can humble themselves and press through hard issues. He didn't want to, so he didn't. He got divorced. Is there grace for that? Absolutely. The consequences for that? Absolutely. The consequences for my friend have rippled out for years into his children, into his ministry, and among the consequences that I see in this friend of mine's life is a failure to experience what might have been. One of the most gifted people I know. God use them? God even uses them. But I keep wondering what might have been if you'd have pressed into your own sin, if you'd have pressed into the pain of this immediate tension in your marriage. You might have even come out with a sweet old love. But you will never know. Let me close with two things to remember. One is the point. Good thing to remember the point. A couple of points. One is the scariest thing about the love of God might, I mean the scariest thing about God might just be the love of God. second thing is this that though grace is amazing and forgiveness is full though the joy of David's salvation would be restored and so can yours there are consequences for sin that the amazing grace of God do not magically remove part of the point of the sermon is I'm trying to spare you that after the point this is the second thing is the tension. I feel a tension in this sermon that I dare not release. It needs to remain tense. And the tension I feel can maybe best be likened to how a doctor might feel who is dealing daily with people's health issues, some of which are preventable. Certain heart issues are nobody's fault. It's just a problem you have with your heart. But some people's heart issues are because of what they eat, and they're incredibly overweight, and they have heart problems. Some people's lung problems have nothing to do with anything they're doing, but some people's lung cancer is because they're smoking two packs of cigarettes for 20 years. As a doctor, when people like that come to me, and they have lung cancer, and they're dying because they've been smoking for 20 years, I don't want to yell at them about their smoking. They're coming at me, and they're going, Doc, I've been smoking, and I got to stop it. I have the cancer. And I'm like, you ears! I'm not going to yell at you now. You know what? We're going TO get together and I'm going TO receive you and I'm going TO hold you and we're going TO say, oh, let's go to God. Let's just go to God. Let's go to God and let's get healed. I want TO stop the bleeding. That's what I want TO DO. And some of you who need to face your sin, we're not going TO yell at you. Nobody's going to yell at you. Come on. And we'll try to stop the bleeding now. And we'll try to bring the healing now. And we'll even hang on to you while you continue to experience some of the consequences, because you might lose your marriage, and God's going to hang on to you in that, and that's one of the tensions I feel with a sermon like that. I don't want to yell at you if this is landing on you, but there's another part of me that wants to yell, especially if you haven't started smoking. I don't care about smoking. That's the metaphor. If I just want to yell, oh, don't run any red lights. I feel like a father talking to my own kids and just going, you guys, you guys. In fact, if my kids came to me and they made a horrible mistake and it was really going to affect their lives, I would maybe be very, no, I would be very angry. I'd be angry. I would be angry. But my anger, it's like my wife's, when my wife has this gift, she has a way, when she's most angry with the kids, of yelling and crying at the same time that leaves them, That leaves them absolutely helpless. But you know what it is, don't you? That is the love of a mother. That is the love of a father. What are you doing? Why? Okay, now let's heal this. As I was preparing this, I always pray, God, I don't know how to close this. And it was like the Spirit of God said, Dave, you're going to know the time. It's time to shut up and just pray. And that time has come right now. I need to shut up and pray. and I want I want us to get quiet I just want us to get quiet there are times that I actually I kind of get a word about how to close and I was asking God about that and one was to stop and pray I'm going to do that in a minute the other was what dawned on me was that Nathan didn't tell David how to respond. The Lord spoke and David knew how to respond. I'm not going to tell you how to respond. God is dealing with you. You will know. I'm going to pray and we're going to be quiet. Holy Spirit, come. Holy Spirit, fall. Lord I do think that the scariest thing about you might be your love come and bring your love expose, reveal, call in Jesus name now in this quiet listen to what God is telling you about how you need to respond Amen. Thank you. I'm going to ask you to stand where you are and say simply this the altar team will be here obviously for anyone who needs prayer and some of you need to come some of you need to just be where you if God told you to do something do it let me speak this over you and we'll be dismissed then David said to Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said to David the Lord also has taken away your sin you shall not die go in peace God bless you as you leave you are dismissed Amen. Thank you.
