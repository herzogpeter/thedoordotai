The rest of you open up your Bibles to Matthew chapter 18. We're going to pick up our continuing study in the book of Matthew in the fifth verse of chapter 18. Matthew chapter 18 verse 5. As most of you know, we are in a section as we're going through this that started in chapter 16. It is going through chapter 20, so we find ourselves right in the middle of it. The section is a section designed by Christ to be preparing his disciples for his departure, his death is imminent, and also for the ministry that his disciples are beginning, going to begin as soon as Jesus physically is gone. Literally, this section from chapter 16 to 20 is the discipling of the disciples. The incident we're going to be dealing with is kind of a carryover from what we dealt with last week, but let me just read the text and then we'll get into it. Verse 5, Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me. But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it is better for him that a heavy millstone be hung around his neck and that he be drowned in the depth of the sea. That's a bad thing. Woe to the world because of its stumbling blocks, for it is inevitable that stumbling blocks come, but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes. And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than having two hands or two feet and cast into the eternal fire. And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than having two eyes to be cast into a fiery hell. See that you do not despise even one of these little ones. For I say to you that there are angels in heaven continually behold the face of my Father who is in heaven. As we dive into this text, let's pray before we do. Father, as we come to your word, I think it's important that we come like children. I think it's important that we, by your Spirit, come recognizing our absolute dependence on you to even glean from here anything of truth. And after even we understand the truth and even see how it needs to apply to us, our absolute dependence on you to have any real change happen. It doesn't come from knowing. It doesn't come from discerning. It comes by your Spirit, by the power of your Spirit. And Father, I pray in your name that you release your Spirit right now for understanding. I pray you release your spirit for breaking up hardness of heart, even in places we don't see it. And, Father, be converting us, be changing us to children who walk ever dependent on you for our very breath. And, God, as we hear this, what is really a warning, I pray that your spirit would bring it with all the power it needs to come with. And even where there's a warning, there's also a powerful protection in here. And Father, I pray that your little ones today would feel safe because of this word. I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. In order to really understand the text we're going to be dealing with this morning, we have to set the context. We have to go back a little bit and remember where it is we came from. This thing we're dealing with in 5 through 10 really began with an incident in verse 1 where the disciples came to Jesus asking a question. The question was this, who then is the greatest in the kingdom? If you were here last week, you remember that that question from the disciples revealed two things to us about the disciples. The first thing it revealed to us about them was that even though they were followers of Jesus, they were still at the core performers. They still had a grid or they still had a mind to earn their value, to earn their sense of meaning, to somehow work it out themselves. And it is from that perspective of earning your value and working it out yourself that questions like who is the greatest among the kingdom in the kingdom come from. I want to know how I'm doing. Yes, I know I'm in the kingdom, but I want to know how I'm ranking in the whole thing. The first thing it revealed was that even though they belonged to Christ, they were still performers. The second thing it revealed about them was this, that not only were they performers at heart, but they were keeping track of how everybody else was performing. They were doing an inventory on all the other 12 disciples, and they had a grading system. You remember that? They were not coming to Jesus asking a legitimate question. We really have confusion about what greatness means in the kingdom. We have already got an idea. It's said in Mark chapter 9 that they had been arguing among themselves who was the greatest in the kingdom, and the argument was because each one of them had a different opinion. Some people thought it was Peter. Some people thought it was John. Some people thought it was James. Some people probably thought it was Andrew. And we disclose the fact that we are very much that same way. At heart, we are still performance-based people. We're asking questions whether or not it's that exact question. How am I doing? How do I look? And we have a grading system. Who is the greatest in the kingdom? Maybe it's the missionary, the minister. Maybe it's the upfront person, the gift doer. Maybe it's that quiet person off to the side. And so it is they came to Jesus and wanted him to settle their argument by telling them who really had the right grading system and who really was performing the best. that question by the disciples became an opportunity for Jesus to make a major confrontation he took a little child in verse 2 set it on his knee and said truly I say to you disciples who think you're already in the kingdom and your biggest concern is who's the greatest here's a word for you unless you become converted that means to turn unless you make a major turn in your life and become like this child you aren't even going to enter the kingdom and after the shock wore off it turned to confusion and the question we dealt with last week was what were the qualities, what could possibly be the qualities of a little child that would qualify him or her for the kingdom and what are those qualities that that child has that I do not have? We began to look at several things. Maybe it's because they're so cute. Maybe it's their behavior and so I should make my behavior more like a child. And then we began to think of the behavior of a child and remember the Greek word was paideion and that indicated to us that this child was anywhere from seven years old to anywhere from a toddler age, which would be about three or four years old, up to seven years old. And so we picture a kindergarten or a preschool or a first grade child, and maybe it's the behavior we need to emulate. Then you think about the behavior of a child that age. They're always obedient, right? They're always compliant. They're very innocent. They're always appropriate, very submissive and yielding. The fact is that it can't be their behavior that we're supposed to emulate because a child sometimes is obedient. A child sometimes is submissive. A child sometimes is innocent and submissive and yielding, but sometimes a child is none of those things. And so it is as the disciples are looking at this child, they're trying to figure out what could it be about this kid that I need to be like. And what we landed on last week was this. The child's behavior is erratic, just like mine. The child's faith is erratic, just like mine. But that child is in a position that I am not, and that is this. that child is absolutely dependent on someone else for its existence. If I leave that child alone, it dies. And then we saw, as this kind of cycle went from shock, having heard Jesus say, you guys might not even be in the kingdom, let alone talk about greatness, to confusion, wondering what the quality was, it moved from that to resistance. Because when I see a child dependent, not self-sufficient, very vulnerable, Everything in my adult male humanity cries, no, I've spent my whole life becoming independent, self-sufficient, on my own. I don't like that. Jesus says, unless you become dependent on me, you're never going to come into the kingdom. You're never going to move in the kingdom. And so it's resisted. We even saw that in the beginning it was resisted. God is independent. We are created dependent. Our life was designed to be drawn from him. and in the very beginning our humanity rebelled against that and man and woman decided to get their life their own way. Jeremiah 2 verse 13 was a key verse for us and I want to bring it to us, bring it from last week into this week where Jeremiah by God's revelation said this to Israel I have two sins against you, you have forsaken me you were at one time dependent getting your life from me but now you have decided to dig your own wells and light your own fires and you're doing it on your own. And I got a word for you. All your efforts to do even godly things on your own leak. Your wells leak and your fires don't give light. The final word to the disciples and to us last week was what you need to do is humble yourself and be turned to the dependence of a child. And that happens when you recognize that all your digging wells and all your efforts to make it on your own and elevate yourself is simply dig in your own well and light in your own fire and those wells leak. Today the warning gets expanded. If I could categorize verses 1 through 4 in one little phrase it would be like this. Disciples, I'm really worried about you. You talk about God, you're doing the kingdom stuff, you're casting out demons, it looks real good, but this concept of childlike absolute dependence as God is your source, I don't see that in you so I'm real worried about you. Today that word becomes a warning. And it moves to this in verses 5 through 10. Disciples, not only am I worried about you and you're entering the kingdom in your eternal destiny, but I need you to know that I'm worried about the people you're going to come in contact with. I'm worried about the children that you're going to try to minister to. I'm worried about your eternal destiny, verses 1 through 4. I'm worried about your ministry, verses 5 through 10. Because if you continue on in the spirit of verse 1, if you continue on digging your own well and lighting your own fire, what you're going to do whether you like it or not or even whether you mean to or not, you are going to infect other people with that same spirit and you're going to get them digging their own wells and you're going to get them in the name OF GOD just like you lighting their own fires and you're going to get them performing and you're going to get them comparing and you're going to get them grading and you're going to get them asking questions like WHO'S DOING THE BEST? And literally you will pull people from childlike dependence on me and you will pull people from from panting hard after God as their only hope, and you will pull them from that to self-righteous performing and wondering who's the greatest. And I got a word for you, disciples. If you do that, it would be better for you to have a millstone hung around your neck, cast into the middle of the sea. I'm worried about you, disciples, if you maintain the posture of verse 1. I'm worried about your ministry, disciples, if you maintain the posture of verse 1. Three things I want us to see this morning. Number one, I want us to see parental protection. Verse 6, verse 7, verse 5 as well. I want us to see, number two, the urgency underscored of his rebuke here. The third thing we're going to get into is the promise from heaven, and that's in verse 10. Let's just get into this right now with the first thing. Parental protection. Parental protection. Verse 5. And whoever receives one such child in my name receives me. First thing I want you to notice here is the language. The language of this verse and the next is not theological. It has theological implications, but the language itself is not theological. It is relational. It's talking about a father and a son. It's talking about my relationship with my son as it relates to you. And God is the father, and the little ones are the ones who are dependently saying, My only hope is Jesus. And he has given you a word about his son, about his children. I want you to know, anybody who's out there, if you ever receive, and the word receive there simply means to accept, to embrace, to find pleasure in. If you out there ever find pleasure in or receive to your breast, as it were, or minister your heart to my dependent little ones, I'm going to receive you. Let's take that phrase and break it down just a little bit. You receive me, you receive such a little child that's a dependent one, In my name, it says. Receive such a child in my name. Little insight here. Again, this language is relational. It's not theological. What that means is, it doesn't mean if you receive a child in my name, like I receive you in the name of Jesus, that is not what it means. What you need to know is the child is in Jesus' name. Do you understand that? This is a father-son relationship. If I come to you, and I come to you in the name of my physical father, you know what that means? That means I come to you with my father's name. My father's name is Johnson. So I come to you in his name. Okay? What he's saying here is if you receive a child such as this who is in my name, who is my child, he bears my name, Christ, Christian, redeemed, Johnson, Christ, he's in my name. If you receive one of mine, you receive me. It's a relational statement. It's one that we can understand in the physical arena. Let me explain it this way. I had an experience with this because I'm a father just a few weeks ago. Every once in a while I get asked to speak someplace around the cities or a little bit out, somewhere like that. And what I try to do when I do that is bring one of my kids with me when I go. I feel real guilty when I leave, so it kind of appeases my guilt and I bring one of them and feel real fatherly. A couple of months ago I had an opportunity to speak at the Bethel College football banquet. It was Caleb's turn to come with me. He's our oldest son. I asked permission to bring him. The coach there, Coach Gennaro, made it real clear that that was just fine, and he was excited to have him come. And so I went, and I brought Caleb. What makes that evening memorable for me was not the evening that I had. It wasn't how they treated me. It wasn't what I said. It wasn't this incredible impact my ministry had on anybody there. It didn't have that much. And I don't even remember what I said. What made that evening memorable for me was how they treated my son. How the players came around him and acted like I wasn't even there, and they just kind of doted over him. And how the coach did the same thing, and they just paid attention to him. And it was amazing to me, because they didn't have to do that. And I noticed early on that they talked to him like he mattered. They listened to his rambling. And on Tuesday, this was on Saturday that I did this, and on Tuesday one of the assistant coaches came over to the church and put on my desk an old rickety pair of shoulder pads that they were going to throw out anyway and gave it to Caleb. That kid's going to Bethel. Now, see, I know that Coach DeNiro had ulterior motives in this. He's recruiting my son, which I think is a wise move. Because if he has as much talent as I think he's going to, it's good to start early on him. But that evening had an impact on me. Now, he's all excited. He wears those shoulder pads to dinner. If we let him, he'd wear them to bed. But you see where I'm going with this, don't you? See, there's this interesting principle. If you receive my son, my little one, you receive me. If you take pleasure in my kids, if you minister to my little ones, If you pour your life out or just show interest in those, because they're vulnerable, and they could get at that age pulled away real easy to some other dad, some other source, they could get pulled away real easy. And if I see people come around my kids and care about them, you receive me, and I like you. You're on my good side. This is a real relational thing. You need to hear the heart of God in this. When I see people take broken, hungry, mourning people who are saying, God, my only hope is you, and then I see people minister to them, receive them, Take pleasure in them. I like that a lot. I receive them and they receive me. That's just relational. But, whoever, and that whoever means whoever. I include the disciples of Christ. Okay, so that's whoever. Whoever causes even one of these little ones, broken, hungry, mourning, don't look real good, they're like a leper going, oh God, my only hope is you. If you cause one of those little ones who believe in me, they're getting their life from me, they're living dependent on me, if you cause one of them to stumble, what's the stumble? The stumble is not just to do bad things. The stumble here would be if you would cause them to come away from dependence on me to dependence on you or dependence on something else. If you would get them to dig their own wells, like you disciples or light their own fires, that's the stumble. If you would start getting them to do that and even do it in the name of God, if you would get my little children from this position to this position by your influence, you need to know it would be better for you to have a millstone hung around your neck and thrown into the depths of the sea. Millstone. First picture that came to my mind was as women would prepare bread and crush the grain in their home and they would have a millstone and they would crush the grain. As I got into the word and the etymology of the word, that wasn't the millstone. That's not the specific word. There's a specific word here, millstone in the Greek. And what it is is the great big huge millstone that's run around in a circle by a mule. Remember that? Samson had to do that millstone. Remember that? Great big huge thing. Weighs a ton, maybe two. And it would be better for you to have that two ton rock around your head, your neck, in the middle of the sea. It's even significant in the Greek in the depth of the sea. Again, it doesn't come out of the text, but what this means, the depth of the sea really means the depth of the ocean, way out there where nobody goes. It's as if God is going, I want my little ones to be dependent on me, and when you pull them away from dependence to performance, I'm going to just try to communicate to you how angry that makes me, and I'm going to think of the worst thing I can think of, the most fearful thing I can think of, and you need to know that's what I'm going to do. Jeff and I, I don't know if you know this, but I had a wedding last night that was planned months before we decided to go to three services. And so Jeff preached this sermon last night. It's kind of an exciting thing, kind of a fun thing. Some of you might be here this morning to find out who did it right. But we were kicking around some of these ideas and stuff, and we were trying to think, you know, if the real spirit here is God is just kind of, as a parental father saying, you better watch out if you mess with my kid, because that really is the spirit here. What would be the worst thing that we could think of? What would we say? And we thought what we would do is we would go, may the fleas of a thousand camels invade your armpits and may you lose the ability to scratch. That would be the worst. Okay, you mess with my kid. In fact, that's so bad it would be better if you had a millstone and thrown it into the middle of the sea. Again, what's trying to be communicated here from the Father, the heart of God, is that I'm going to take care of my kids. And if you pull them away from dependence, you're going to have to deal with me. But this kind of language doesn't really, it doesn't go, wow, boy, that's really heavy. It's kind of poetic. A millstone runner, and I can throw it into the depth of the sea. It would be better for you if you got run over by a train. It would be better for you if you got run over by a great big truck. Let me say it in a real personal way. You take one of my little children who are living dependently on me, hungry, broken, mourning, and their sanctified life is coming from my life, not from their performance. Their service is coming from my life, not from their trying to please you. And their salvation came just from me. It's all grace. And you take them and you get them over here performing and worried about circumcision and worried about all these. You do that to me, to my kid, and you pull them away from dependence. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. That's a little bit more cool, isn't it? that's what he means what that is is parental protection now a couple things here if you're a little child if you're here among us this morning and you're a broken hungry mourning person who's going I just love Jesus and I forgot how I don't know how to do that anymore I'm so wrapped up in all sorts of other stuff that's a good word you know what that means your father fights for you that's what that means and the people in your life who have called you away from dependence and simple purity of love and devotion to Christ and called you away from that and all of a sudden the Christian life began to be this incredible drudgery. That word is to them. I'll kill you. Because you're messing with my kid. My little one. Don't do that. And again, just like I can relate to receiving a son, I can relate to that other thing. You know, you could abuse me and you could say things about me and it would hurt me and I would feel bad and I would feel sad, but you mess with my kids, I'll kill you. That comes right from the heart of a father. It sounds real petty even. It sounds like, well, he's kind of angry. You got it. Yeah, that's the heart of God. That's the heart of God. You got to know that. Even God says this. Jesus said this, being reviled, he reviled not again, 1 Peter. And when they hurled insults at him, he said, this really hurts. I really feel bad. I want to weep before God. but he reviled not again. And right here it says, but if you mess with my little ones who are dependent and you call them away from that for in whatever way you do it, if you do it, I'll kill you. You will get the wrath of God. And if not now in this life, one day. What are some ways that people could come and bring a stumbling? In Pergamos, the church in Pergamos, as it was revealed in Revelation 2, there were some followers of a man named Balak. Balak, it says in Revelation 2, put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel. And the stumbling block that he put before the sons of Israel was immorality, sexual sin. And basically what it's saying there is this. Balak came into the church of Jesus Christ and said, Yeah, yeah, this God stuff's great. This God stuff's great, but if you really want to live, if you really want to get life, you can get life over here with sexuality and immorality. sexuality is good in the right context. Illicit sexuality. You can get life here. I offer you life, guys. Come on over here. Come and get it over here. God's great, but he can't give it all. Come on over here. Drugs, sex, all that bad stuff. Picture I have in my mind as I connected back to this imagery of a father and a child in a family relationship. As a father in my home, I have a picture of where I live, and we kind of live in the kitchen there, and my kids are all around me. And my kids are vulnerable, just like God's kids are vulnerable. They're living dependently, but they're easily pulled away. And his big Cadillac pulls up in our cul-de-sac. And you know what he's got? A little lollipop. And the door opens, and one of my little girls or guys walks up to him a little curious, and he loves mom and dad, just like you love God. But you walk over toward that lollipop, and it looks real good, and he offers it, and doesn't it look like it's for my good? He must really like me. He doesn't like you at all. He wants to get you in the car and abuse you badly. And that's exactly the sin of Balak and the kinds of things the world offers us. It looks like a lollipop. Come and get it. You can get life here. I'm going to be nice to you. And like children or like sheep, we wander away from this dependence and we go over here. When that happens to God's children, God has two responses. Number one, toward his children. You know what the response toward the children is? Why are you doing that? It grieves his heart. And he calls them back and we're going to hear a passage next time of Jesus going after the sheep that went astray. He goes after that little one and he chases after the car. And so he embraces his child even when he wanders away, but he's got a different attitude toward the guy in the car. Do you get the picture? The guy who offered the lollipop, who drew them away. I'll kill you. You are going to get the wrath of God. Whoever, even disciples. That's one way in which you can cause a stumble. You can offer life to someone who's getting your life from God in another place than God, and that's to stumble. There's another way, and it doesn't look as secular. or it doesn't look as slimy. That one's pretty obvious. People were caused to stumble in the Galatian church. Remember the circumstances there? Circumstances in the Galatian church were very pure stumbling. They were godly stumblings, not going after sexuality and immorality. The Galatian church was a church that was wonderfully saved. They were living a life dependent on Jesus. They were getting their life from him. And then a group of people called the Judaizers came along and said, this love affair with Jesus is wonderful, But if you really want to be a Christian, if you want to be a super Christian and grow in the Lord, you've got to get circumcised. And all of a sudden, the entire Christian life took on an external focus. Rather than childlike dependence and walking by the Spirit, all of a sudden, my value was maintained or affirmed by this external thing I did. And people started getting circumcised to prove they were okay. That was digging their own well. It was legalism. and all of a sudden people started getting their sense of value and their sense of joy from the right things they did not from the cross from all the things they knew not from the cross from the little forms they followed not from the cross and jesus says here i got a word for you whoever causes one of my little vulnerable dependent kids who were walking by the spirit to then begin to move over here and walk by the flesh, I'll kill him. I will come down your throat. People in Corinth, children, little dependent children, started getting their life from other things too. Started getting their life from people idolatry. Remember that? I am of Paul, I am of Apollos, I am of Cephas. See, what really makes me feel good and really makes me feel secure is that I am into the teaching of Paul. I am into the teaching of Apollos. I am into the teaching of Cephas. Paul came along when he heard that and he says, I didn't die on the cross for you. Did I do that? Get away from me. Get away from me. The stumble is where you're starting to get your life. Dig in your own well and light in your own fire. Could be a bad, immoral act. Could be a holy act. If you're doing it because it's your source of value, your source of life, that's the stumble. I want people doing what they do because they're independent on me. Verse 7, Woe to the world because of its stumbling blocks. For it is inevitable that stumbling blocks will come. You can't stop it. Say it this way. The world is R-rated, okay? It's an R-rated world. And if you walk out that door and you drive down the highway and you see the billboards and you turn on the radio, there's no way you can get around the messages that are offering you life from things other than Jesus. It's inevitable that stumbling blocks will come. And from time to time, my little ones are going to stumble. From time to time, you little ones. And I know it's the truth. I know if you just search your own heart, you even know in yourself that you live in this constant flow of like a child coming to your father and going, oh, I really, I'm living in that right now. I'm getting my life from Jesus. And then all the time, you'll walk out the door and you'll start getting it from people's opinion. Your sense of value will be that everybody likes you and you're going to have to choose that. I'm going to go start pleasing everybody or I'm going to come back here and just say, my only hope is you. My only hope is you. When his little ones stumble and start getting their life from other places, he grieves. because our Father knows that when we do that, we lose our joy, we lose our fullness, we lose, in essence, something of our humanity, what we were created for. And when we wander away, He comes and gets us. Sometimes He disciplines us, Hebrews 12. When we return, He receives us, but woe to the one. Woe to the flesh peddler over here, the legalist over here. Woe to the one through whom the stumbling comes. Woe to the Judaizers. Woe to the Libertines. Woe to anybody who gives anybody anything other than Jesus as their source of being okay. Let me underscore the urgency in verse 8. If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. This is an especially heavy word to these guys for a couple reasons. Number one, this is a word that he gave to the Pharisees back in chapter 5 of Matthew. Just because of that, this has got to be hard for them to hear. In chapter 5, he gave this word to the self-righteous Pharisees, and when he gave it to them, the disciples were in the background going, way to go, I love it when you rip the Pharisees' face off, it's great. Just like us. But you know what he's saying here? That word I gave to them, now disciples, it's for you. Because in ways that aren't maybe even as obvious as the Pharisees, you're getting your life from your performance. How good am I doing? Who's really the greatest in the kingdom? I'm really moving along here quite well, aren't I? I'm going into deeper things all the time. And all of a sudden, my sense of value is in the fact that I'm going into deeper things all the time, and it's not just that simple love for Jesus. And so this had to be along with the word in verse 3 where he said, you're going to have to be converted. this is another slap in the face, real hard one for them. You need to note as we try to discern what it actually means that this is not some wooden literalism. What I mean by that is if this was wooden literalism, the disciples and all of us would be little stumps. You know, I mean, cut your hand up, poke your eye out, there wouldn't be anything left. What it is, it's hyperbole, and that simply means it's an exaggeration to make a point, to underscore an urgency. What he's saying is this. Again, you've got to keep this word in the context of what he's saying. Disciples, people at Open Door, if your source of life and your source of meaning, your source of well-being is in the strength of your hand, if it's in the strength of what you do, if it's in the strength of what you know, if it's in the strength of all the places you go with your feet, all the things you do with your hand, all the insights you get with your eye, if what really settles you down and goes, you know, I'm really moving in the right direction, are all these capacities you have in your flesh. You need to know that it would be better if all your capacities were gone, if your capacity to speak went dumb, if your capacity to understand just got blocked, if your ability to work with people, if it all went away, it would be better because you had this tendency to get your life from those things. They're not bad things. Your hand is not a bad thing. Your eye is not a bad thing. Your insights are not bad. But all of a sudden, you cross the line and you start getting, you depend on that. That's your God. That's what you serve. And it moves you from simplicity. I get the same spirit when I hear Jesus saying to the rich man, you want to follow me? Sell everything you have. He's saying the same thing in a different way. The thing that really makes you feel okay settles you down, makes you feel like, ha, everything's going to be okay after all. Isn't the cross, because the cross does speak to you and me. You know what? No matter what happens, you leave here, this church folds, you lose all your money, I'm going to be okay. Why? The cross says so. Ha. What makes you go, ha, is your money. And you need to know something. It'd be better if you lost your money. Cut it off. It'd be better if you lost your ability. Cut it off. And to walk through life with nothing to do, nothing to accomplish, even for God, than to enter hell with all your functioning. the stumble isn't stumbling into doing bad things because the disciples were stumbling all over the place and they were doing great things they were wanting to know who's the best in the kingdom they were doing demons they were preaching the kingdom they were doing all good things you can indeed stumble into bad behaviors that we would categorize as bad behaviors but the stumble isn't the behavior it's in here somewhere it's the stumble is over dependence where you get in your life the alcoholic gets it from the booze the religious fanatic gets it from his church building and his church activity I have a picture in my mind of what's going to burn up in eternity Jesus through the apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians said some of your things are going to be wood, hay, stubble some are gold, silver, precious things and we've always had this idea that the gold, silver, precious things are the good things you did and that will last And the bad things you did will be, that's the Bema Seat of Christ in 1 Corinthians, I believe it's 1 Corinthians 6 that he's speaking of. And everything that's being brought to the Bema Seat are good things. All the good things I did all my life, all the sermons I preached, all the people I prayed for, all the sermons I wrote, all the whatever, and you add your list, are going to come to the Bema Seat. And you know what? Some of those things are going to be gold, silver, precious stone because they came from a position of dependence on God. And some of them are going to be wood, hay, stubble. They're going to go poof because it was all physical stuff. It was all my need or your need to look good and be there and get my life from what we do. Poof. The picture I have in my mind is that in eternity, those porno shops are going to burn up. And a lot of churches' buildings are going to burn up. They're all both going to go poof. And what will remain, what will remain is what happened in the body of Christ from the little ones, From the little ones who said, oh, God, I don't have the strength in my hand. I don't have the strength in my feet. I have a heart that says, yes, but I keep getting tripped up, and I need your power. I need your strength. I need your insight. I can't do it. Through the little ones, there comes gold. And I'm telling you, if anybody comes along and pulls my little ones who are living like this to over here digging their own wells, whether it be secular kinds of sin or spiritual kinds of sin. I'll kill you. Last word of promise from heaven. See to it, disciples, or anybody else, that you don't despise one of these little ones. the word despised there simply means to think little of to look down on think that could happen in the church again keep the context clear here keep who we're talking about little ones here it's not just little kids it's dependent people dependent people and broken people and hungry people don't always produce as much as the ones with the strong right hand they don't always produce as much don't always look as good some of what is happening in their lives as it relates to the kingdom is stuff you don't even see it's these intangible things and sometimes I think the real work of the kingdom the real stuff you never see it all the stuff that comes up around it even like this church is all stuff you don't know if it's God or not you don't know but don't despise my little ones because sometimes my little ones they look weak because they're dependent and they don't always have a lot of answers. And they're just saying, my only hope is you. Don't look down on them. Not even one. Sometimes they look stupid to you. Sometimes they're not real shiny. Sometimes they look naive. They keep wanting to just pray over everything. Why don't you just do something with praying? Okay? Don't do that. You know why? Well, I gave you one reason. and it would be better if you got a millstone and thrown it to the sea. But here's another reason why you shouldn't do that. See, there are angels in heaven. Continually behold the face of my Father. And I want to switch a little bit here in terms of my focus. Those of you who may be causing someone else to stumble, the stumble being move away from dependence on God and simple walking by the Spirit to your performance and digging your own wells, I want to move it now to those of you who are little children, who are sitting by breath. I just want to depend on Jesus. I've got a word for you. And maybe you've been in a system where you were caused to stumble because you got called to something else other than Jesus to perform and look good and dig your own well and get circumcised or whatever, to be okay. Get circumcised. I'm speaking metaphorically there. Hope you know that. Here's a word for you. Your angels in heaven continually behold the face of your Father. Their angels, our angels. We have angels? Yeah, they're real. Hebrews 1.14, it says, our angels are ministering spirits sent out to render service for the sake of those who inherit salvation. So there they are, pictured in your mind, our angels. I don't have a specific guardian angel, but I have angels. I have all the angels of heaven, and so do you. Myriads upon myriads of angels. And what are they doing? They're looking at the Father. Continually, they're looking at the face of the Father. So? Well, what's the Father doing? He's looking at his kids. He's looking at you, and he's looking at me, and the angels are looking at God. And God the Father looks at his little ones, and he looks at them stumbling, and he looks at them loving, and he looks at them as they're depending on him, and the fight is to keep coming back to faith, And the fight is to say, there is no life over there. And the fight is to say, there is no life over there. This one's harder because it looks better. But there isn't any life when they're coming here. But the Father's always looking at his kids, and the angels are looking at the Father. And you know what happens? God the Father from time to time says, okay, go now. And the angels come, and they begin to minister to the saints. They begin to minister to the little ones, and they fight for us. They fight for you. You need to know if you're a wounded little one who's been drawn away from dependence to performance, who's been drawn away from dependence to getting your life from some vile things in life they couldn't give it. The angels of God are fighting for you. We just got off a spiritual warfare seminar. One of the things you come away with after a time like that is an intense awareness, and it's necessary, that we are in a war, and that demonic things are very real, and we need to become equipped in doing that. you need to also be aware that we have ministering spirits who fight for us when God the Father sees people causing little ones to stumble he goes to war it's invisible, it's quiet it's behind the scenes, it's in the spirit realm but disciples you need to hear anybody, whoever if you maintain the posture that you're in right now, disciples who's the greatest in the kingdom? Digging your own well, lighting your own fire performing to get your value I'm worried about you I'm worried about your eternal destiny if you don't convert and turn and humble yourself and see that you're digging your own well there's nothing you're in trouble but I'm not just worried about you I'm worried about the people who come in contact with you because you inadvertently are going to pull them away from dependence too to start playing your own religious game, playing your little duty thing, and the life of God will be snuffed out in them, and then I'm going to go to war on you. You're a little one this morning. The words you need to hear is the Father fights for you. The myriads of angels are watching the face of the Father right now and just waiting for a command to come and fight for you. if you're one among us this morning and you're stumbling and maybe the stumble is you've begun to move over here and you love Jesus but for some reason you just started believing the lie that you could get life in immorality that you could get life in a bottle that you could get life with a pill and you began to do that and maybe you're on the front end of that so it's still feeling pretty good but maybe you're not and you're realizing now my well is leaking it isn't helping if you're a stumbling child and you've begun to do that you need to hear the voice of Jesus saying come unto me all you who are weary and heavy laden I'll give you rest I'll give you water maybe you didn't go that way maybe you're a stumbling little one who loves Jesus and you want to live dependently but you came over here and you bought the religious lie that you had to do this and you had to do that and you got into all these little performances and your value no longer came from Jesus and the cross and what it said about you, your value started being drawn from all your little religious performance and it just sucked the life out of you. You need to hear the same words that the guy over there hears, come unto me all you who are weary and heavy laden and I'll give you rest. But if you're one who because of your direction and your source of life is pulling people away either this way or this way from dependence on Jesus and from pointing just to Him as our only hope. It would be better for you to have a millstone hung around your neck to be cast into the middle of the sea. For the world is full of stumbling blocks. It can't be avoided. People are going to get their life from things other than God. But woe to the one through whom it comes. The bottom line, beloved, this morning is this. It's the same message we hear every Sunday. Our only hope is Jesus. Our only hope is Jesus. It isn't this church. It isn't Dave Johnson. It isn't Jeff Van Vondren. It isn't Dave Heinrich. It isn't your dad or your mom. It isn't the nice house you live in. It's not your kids being good because they're going to be bad sometimes. It's not your job. It's not your friends. Every one of those things are going to wither and die. our only hope is Jesus if you hear nothing else hear this a call back to this dependence become like a child let's pray Jesus even as I talk I can feel this impulse in me and it's in the flesh to just keep on talking to make sure everybody gets this and this is that's silly there needs to be the supernatural moving of your spirit that brings brokenness that makes us aware again of the ways the insidious of subtle ways that we dig our own wells and get our life from other things than God. And God, as your children, as your little ones, I pray that you would call your wandering sheep back today. God, just break the tyranny of our striving and our digging our own wells and lighting our own fires. I pray for those, too, who may be, even unwittingly, drawing people away from dependence by their influence and leadership. that Father, like the disciples, they would hear this word harsh, but they would also hear the tone even to them to stop it themselves. I pray, God, that you would just move among us and do your work in Jesus' name. Amen. Thank you.
