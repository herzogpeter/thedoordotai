Now, when Simon saw that the Spirit was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, saying, Give this authority to me as well, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands will receive the Holy Spirit. But Peter said to him, May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money. You have no part or portion in this matter, for your heart is not right before God. And now in 1 Timothy 6.10, the Apostle Paul to his spiritual son Timothy says this, Keep yourselves free from the love of money, for the love of money is at the root of all sorts of evil, and some, by longing for it, have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many a pain. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Let's pray as we go to this story in this particular text. I pray, Father, for eyes to see and ears to hear what I don't think we can hear, We can't see unless you, by your Spirit, help us see these things and hear these things, things, quite frankly, in my own spirit. If I'm honest, don't always want to see and don't always want to hear. We invite you into all of that. In Jesus' name, amen. He was introduced to us in verse 9 as simply this, a certain man. His name is Simon. Rather nondescript in this initial introduction of him, quite harmless. I'm sure he's just some guy, a certain man named Simon. Turns out he's more than that. If you've been with us these last few weeks, you know that. Simon is a celebrity of sorts in Samaria, clearly a person of influence such that it says in verse 10 that they all, that is, kind of the whole city of Samaria, from the smallest to the greatest, were giving attention to him. he kind of could hold court and draw a crowd saying about Simon that this man is what's called the great power of God, which is kind of an obscure reference to something that's rooted in Simon's involvement in this whole thing called Gnosticism, which we dealt with a couple of weeks ago. So when, in verse 13, it says that even Simon himself believed and was baptized and even continued on with Philip and the church, it's kind of a big deal because Simon's kind of a big fish. But he tipped his hand that maybe he's the wrong kind of fish, that there's something that smells kind of wrong about this fish. When in verse 18, he offers him money because when he saw that the Holy Spirit, as in verse 9, was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles' hands. He simply wanted that capacity. He wanted that power, so he offered the money like you do, because that's how things work. You have something I want, and you have something I want. I want the power. You probably want the money, so I'll offer you money. You give me power, saying, give this authority to me as well, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive this Holy Spirit to all of which, not just the event, but this way of thinking, what Simon is doing here, you want something from me, money, I want something from you, power, all of that is reflective of, it's consistent with what I called a couple of weeks ago, the spirit of the age, because what Simon is doing here is entirely consistent in his mind with how things work in the world, certainly with how they work in Samaria, even in religious context, with how people think it's just the spirit of the age. It's a funny, weird, maybe phrase. Maybe the easiest way to understand what I mean by that when I use this throughout this talk is this, that the spirit of the age is just kind of the general way of thinking, a general way of thinking and believing in the context of a people group. So there was a spirit of the age in Samaria, and kind of people, based on how that culture was, just had a way of thinking and believing relative to how life worked, what love was, what marriage is, what sex is, how money is, and what it's used for. It's just the spirit of the age. And in Samaria, the general way of thinking and believing was strongly influenced by this ancient form of Gnosticism, quite possibly founded by Simon himself. I told you a couple weeks ago that some believe that Simon was in some sense, at least, if not the founder, one of the founders of Gnosticism. And while there are many different expressions of Gnosticism, and they can be quite varied, the primary characteristic, particularly at this particular time in Samaria, was a kind of universal embrace of everything and everyone. So we've all got a piece of the truth, would be the universal way of thinking in Samaria, is a general way of thinking. We've all got a piece of the truth. Let's just throw it all in the pot and stir, is the general way of thinking and believing it was the spirit of the age in Samaria. And it's precisely with, it was precisely what the people of Samaria were doing. And this just puts a fascinating spin to me on what happened here in Samaria when in verse 12 Philip came preaching the kingdom of God. He came preaching the kingdom of God and he came preaching the name of Jesus Christ. And when it says they all believed and were all baptized, men and women like, and even Simon believed and he was baptized and even continued on with Philip. What was really happening here, at least for some, you know, it looks like everybody's coming to faith, what was really happening, and most notably, it was happening with Simon, was that they were simply doing in Samaria what they always did when something or someone of interest came through town. Because their primary way of thinking and believing was the spirit of the age, driven by this Samaritan form of Gnosticism was simply to embrace everything and everyone who came along and then to simply add it. It's really cool. I mean, you'd say, okay, that's a good thing. I'll just add that to what they already believed about life and how life works and love and what love is. And just add that to what they think about marriage and how that works and money and power and sex. So when Philip came preaching Christ in Samaria, they believed and were baptized and everybody's going it's a revival. Maybe. I'm sure for some, but what many were really doing there was what they always did in Samaria. They simply added what Philip said about the Christ to what they already believed and thought about life and love and marriage and money and power and sex. So they added Jesus to their Gnosticism. And their Gnosticism didn't change. They just added Jesus to it. And they added Jesus to their Samaritanism, and their Samaritanism didn't change. It just added Jesus to it. And I don't know if it's happening to you, but when I start talking like that, it doesn't sound as far away and weird as this story sounded when I first read it because it's the spirit of the age in this age too. So I'll embrace this Jesus guy. Of course. Yeah, Jesus. I love Jesus. says 76% of Americans. I looked it up on Google this morning. 76% of Americans, so, and the internet never lies. So, anyway. So I'll embrace this Jesus guy. I will. I'll simply add him to what I already think about life and how it works and love and what that is and marriage and what that's about and money and power and sex as well and I'll just add him to my consumerism and my consumerism won't change. I'll just add Jesus to it, and maybe thank him for whatever, but that's great, and I'll just add him to my capitalism and my Americanism too, so before you know it, and you don't know it when we do this, because it's the spirit of the age, you don't know it when you're in it, you develop a general way of thinking and believing that's rooted in and driven by this ancient form of Gnosticism, And Samaritanism and consumerism and capitalism is kind of a me-ism. You kind of make your own rules, quite frankly, is what happens. And all of that is why. Before we quit talking about this Simon guy in Acts chapter 8, I want to talk about money and power. I want to talk about the spirit of the age. I want to talk about the spirit of God. I want to talk about the spirit of Simon. I want to talk about the spirit of generosity and how they're all here in the book of Acts. They're all here in Acts chapter 8. And how the more I thought about it this week, the more significant these issues became in my mind. These issues of money and power, the spirit of the age, the spirit of God, the spirit of generosity, the spirit of Simon, and how right in the middle of great and authentic movements of God's spirit, while there's God's Spirit moving, right in the middle of that, there's almost always another Spirit moving. And so I can feel like there's kind of a fierceness on me today because this is about protecting the fidelity of the church. You need to know in the context of almost every great movement of God's Spirit, There's another spirit that's moving right in the middle of that because the kingdom of God, remember this, Matthew 13, 47, Jesus said, is like a dragnet. It's like a fishing net that gets thrown out into the sea, and when you pull it in, it's full of fish, fish of every kind, but not every fish is good for eating. Because if you eat this Simon fish, I believe I was baptized with you by that, you're going to get sick. The church is going to get sick. You need to know this stuff. And all of that is in Acts chapter 8. The multitudes who believed and were baptized look like a great revival. And Simon, who did the same, but with a twist, he's using money to get power. And he wanted the power to get more money, because if I have the power, Desperate people will believe I can heal them and deliver them, and they will give me money to do. That says the television preacher, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's just the spirit of the age. Indeed, I think when Simon heard Peter say, may you perish with your silver and gold. I don't want your money. I think when Simon heard Peter do that, I think he was stunned. Because to Simon's way of thinking, I kind of have a little sympathy for him here. Because to Simon's way of thinking, because he had a general way of thinking, it was the spirit of the age. This is just how it works in the real world. Come on, Peter, relax. Here's how it works. You give me what I want, power. I give you what you want, money. At least I assume that's what you wanted. You give me a service, and I will pay for the service. It's just how it works. Everybody knows this. I mean, I honestly can hear Simon saying to Peter, I mean, you do need to get funded, don't you? I mean, you got to get money from somewhere. Might as well take it from me. I have a lot. Because I'm just trying to help. So give me what I want, says Simon, which is power, my way. Give me what I want, attention, control. Programs that I prefer, and I will give you what you want. Applause. Attendance. I'll stay with you. I will continue on with you. Money. Maybe a lot of money, because I'm your biggest fan, said Simon to Peter and John and earlier to Philip. And while what Simon does here in verse 18 when we first read it, saying I'll offer you money for the capacity to give the Holy Spirit to people, while that sounds ridiculous, it leaves us shaking our head in disbelief that anyone could think or believe that with money you could buy spiritual power or authority because it's not for sale. The spirit of this is consistent with, and fits quite nicely into something we're very familiar with. It kind of consists, it's consistent with what I would call the consumer model that every one of us have been raised in. Well, we're being raised in it. We just were raised in it. It's the spirit of the age. It's the water we've been swimming in. It's the air that we've been breathing. But in some senses, if you think about it, it's kind of almost like a religion. It's a spirit of the age. It's just how things work, where you provide a service. In this case, it's religious service. And someone agrees to pay for that service. And as long as you actually do that service, provide that service, I will pay for that service. But if you don't provide this service, whatever it is, and I don't mean a church service, I mean this thing I do for you. And if you don't provide what I want you to provide, this kind of song, this kind of whatever, I won't pay. Or I'll just go where they do. and now you have some power because if you need money, I'll withhold the money and I'll get you to do what I want and now I have power. And it's all directly connected to money. This is weird to talk about this. I've told you this story before, a few times before, but years ago, early days here at Open Door, I think I'd been here maybe three or four years at the most. There were some people here and I know this is hard to believe who didn't like me very much. I know it's bizarre. Try to get your head around it. So they came up with a plan. They really did. And I've told you this story. They came up with a plan to kind of get rid of me. And their plan was to withhold their giving. And they were kind of the big givers and kind of the power people in the church. They were going to withhold their giving, give it to missions so that the general fund would dry up. It would be obviously my fault and they'd be rid of me. And it was very, you know, just allusioning to me and kind of painful to me, but I didn't have this paradigm on it. Here's what they're doing. I mean, reasonably, I mean, some otherwise reasonable and actually good people were using money to get power, to get control, and there it is, right together. Money and power. You give me what I want, and I'll give you what you want. you don't give me what I want. I won't give you what you want. It's the sphere of the age. And it's a little scary. I don't want to scare you, but I'd like to not be alone, because I've been scared all week thinking about this stuff. So be scared with me, would you? It's everywhere. It's like... A friend of mine named Kent Carlson, along with his friend Mike Luke and their friends of mine, they are pastors in California, wrote a book entitled The Renovation of the Church. He's got a chapter on consumerism that I went back and looked at this week. It's a fascinating thing. I'd read it a while ago, but knowing as I was talking about this, I kind of got back into it. And his appeal in the book, among other things, is this, at least begin to notice this because we don't notice that, and here I'm quoting him here, that for a very long time, without us noticing it, we've been trained in our country to be consumers. By the time our children reach elementary school, they are fully formed consumers. We talk about spiritual formation. By elementary school, they are fully formed consumers. They look at their lives from a consumer perspective. Indeed, speaking to North Americans about consumerism is like talking to a fish about water. It's an all-encompassing part of our daily existence, and usually too close for us to even notice its pervasive presence, so feel really bad. That's not the point. You should be aware of this, because we're not aware. Eugene Peterson, in his book entitled The Wisdom of Each Other, says further this, that if we are a nation of consumers, then obviously the quickest and most effective way to get those consumers into our congregations is to identify what people want and give it to them. Satisfy their fantasies, promise them the moon, recast the gospel into consumer terms like entertainment, satisfaction, excitement, adventure, problem-solving, self-actualization, whatever. No calls for discipleship, surrender, obedience, or sacrifice, because that would never sell. There's the monetary thing in there. It's just the spear of the age. This is just how it works in the real world. You give me what I want. I give you what you want. Back to Kent in his book, chapter 5, he identifies, does Kent, what he refers to as, and I'm quoting here again, the symbiotic relationship between consumerism and ambition. It's the best thing I've ever heard here in terms of even pastoral ambition, the symbiotic relationship between consumerism and ambition. The two go hand in hand. They feed off of each other. So as a Christian leader who is motivated by personal ambition, I can appeal to the basic consumer tendencies of the people I desire to be part of my church or ministry. Are you tracking with this? This is spooky. If I do this well, appeal to their consumer desires, I will be rewarded by their attendance, their support, and their allegiance, and my church or ministry will grow. Everyone is satisfied. Everyone gets what they want. So the lighted match of my ambition ignites the dry timber of their consumerism, and we have a raging fire, he says, that is very difficult to put out. So how do you put it out? One way. It's right in the text. Might be to say what Peter said. May your silver perish with you, Simon. Eugene Peterson, in his translation of the Bible, translates that verse this way. Peter saying to Simon, Simon to hell with your money and you along with it. That would work. He'd be gone. Hmm. You know, I don't recommend saying that because... But then, you know, dial back into the ambition thing. Especially, don't say that if you have to grow your ministry. You've got to have people stay. Then what you need to do is make friends with Simon. Give Simon a hug. Give Simon what he wants. He'll give you money. He's got lots of money. That's just how it works. In the real world, it's the spear of the age. and that spirit doesn't just go away quietly when God begins to move. You'd think it would, wouldn't you? It might go underground a little bit. God begins to move. It doesn't go away because over and over again in the story, and this is the warning, this is the thing that mature people need to get. We need to get it because right in the middle of any authentic moving of God's spirit, this spirit will raise its head again and again and again and it raised its head early in the story of the church, even before the Simon guy. I mean, the story in Acts 8 is pretty early in the story, but this thing raised its head earlier than that because there it was at the beginning in Acts 2, beginning in verse 2. This is Pentecost. This is the day the Spirit landed, first day, if you will, of the church, for there came from heaven the sound of a mighty rushing wind, Acts 2, verse 2, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. It was the wind of God, and when it blew that day, that day of Pentecost day, the people, it says in verse 7, were amazed, just like they were in Samaria. Amazed at Philip. There were signs and wonders. There were tongues of fire. Three thousand came to faith in one day, and everyone, says Acts 2, verse 43, everyone kept feeling a sense of awe as they continually devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship and to the breaking of bread and to prayer. And then, oh, you guys, to top it all off, it says in verse 44 that all of those who believed were together. Were together. They had all things in common, and they began selling their property and possessions. Nobody told them to. They just started doing this and were sharing with everyone as anyone might have need, and there was no one who had any need among them. So, what was that? Have you ever seen that without, you know, somebody scolding you or pressuring you or manipulating you? Well, I don't know what that was, except I know what it wasn't. I know what it wasn't, when people started caring for each other and giving and sharing so everyone had what they needed. I know what it wasn't. I know it wasn't the spirit of the age. I know that. And I know it wasn't the spirit of Simon because this is a different spirit. This kind of giving and sharing and releasing of mine and giving it to you. It's a different spirit. It's a generous spirit. This was, oh yeah, this was God's spirit. Released by means of the Holy Spirit. And what was released by means of the Holy Spirit was a generous spirit. So you can give without being generous. You can give to look good. This is released by the Holy Spirit comes a generous spirit. Indeed, it's part of how you know that you actually are in a movement that is being generated by the Spirit and not smoking mirrors because you're in this movement and you realize there's something happening here, but the spirit of Simon didn't build it. I've been in things where Simon's spirit built it because we got money, but it smelled funny, and we owed somebody. Have you ever been in a movement where what was being generated, you knew it was God? You just knew it was God, because this time it's a different spirit. It's a generous spirit, released by means of the Holy Spirit. There's a spirit of generosity, and it happens whenever the spirit of God begins to move. Zacchaeus, remember him? great story illustrates this I think quite well cruddy little character was he climbed up in a sycamore tree remember that you had to go to Sunday school to get that he's a tax collector by trade which actually meant he was kind of a crook he was used by the Roman government and the temple to extract taxes and most Jews saw tax collectors as traitors actually he was greedy and dishonest defrauding everyone he could routinely ripping people off charging more than was due. That means that just like Simon, Zacchaeus was using money to get power, and then he would use his power, the power he had as the tax collector, to get even more money. It was the sphere of the age. It's just how things work in the real world. But then God moved on him through an encounter with Jesus, because Jesus saw him one day and said, Zacchaeus, come down, which means, Zacchaeus, I see you, I know you, come down, we're having dinner, I even want you, and the result of all that was, he was, in the words of Brennan Manning, seized by the power of a great affection. And when he was seized by the power of amazing grace, the first thing that happened to this greedy grasper, the first manifestation of the spirit in him was that he got a different spirit. He got the Holy Spirit. What he got was a generous spirit. It was a sign. It was a wonder. Because the first thing he did was to give. He released. The things he had been grasping, indeed, in Luke 19, verse 8, he says to Jesus, Lord, half of my possessions. He didn't have to do that. Nobody told him to do that. Half of my possessions I will give to the poor, and those I have defrauded four times, I'll pay them back. That's a different spirit. He got the Holy Spirit, and when he got the Holy Spirit, it was a generous spirit. Indeed, he got the same spirit we see in Exodus 35. I like to see this in the Old Testament as well. Exodus 35, 36, they're building the sanctuary, and they're needing people to give. And so they yelled at him, no, they didn't. Something happened. The Spirit came, and people's hearts were so moved to do this that Moses had to issue a proclamation commanding them to stop. You give one more thing. Seriously, Exodus 36, verse 6 says this. Thus, the people were restrained from bringing any more, and then it says the people rejoiced. Wow! We've never seen this kind of thing, and they rejoiced for a number of reasons, I'm sure. But one was this. we weren't using money this time to get power. We've done that, but not this time. We weren't using it to get power, and we weren't using power to get more money. This wasn't, wow, a Simon spirit that built this thing. A different spirit built this thing. A generous spirit built this thing. It was a sign. It was a wonder. So many signs and wonders when the Spirit landed. Tongues of fire. Generous giving. Indeed, it was the kind of sign and wonder that you see when God, by the power of his Spirit, begins to authentically move, like he did in the beginning. Acts chapter 2, day of Pentecost, first day of the church, where one of the signs and wonders that caused people to marvel to continually be in this sense of awe was this consistent expression of generosity where they began selling their possessions, sharing them with all as anyone might have need. It was a different spirit. It was a generous spirit. It was the Holy Spirit. But then it happened. What I warned you about a few minutes ago, right in the middle, right in the middle, right at the beginning of this amazing outpouring of God's spirits. Acts chapter 2, there emerges another spirit. Bow, it's right there. Bang, it's there. And it's a Simon spirit. It's the spirit of the age, embodied this time in two people we met a couple months ago in the book of Acts, earlier in Acts, named Ananias and Sapphira. You remember them, who, like Simon, wanted to get in on the action. And the action was that so many people were generously giving that none among them had need. So Ananias and Sapphira decided to give, which is good. It's really good to give. Way to go, Simon. Way to go, Ananias and Sapphira. And what they gave, we don't know the amount. It doesn't say. It might have been a lot. Let's just pretend it was a lot. The point is, the amount doesn't matter. Let's say they gave a whole lot, more than anybody else. We don't know how much they gave. What we do know is this, however, that the reason they gave, the money that they gave, was not because they were generous, but because they wanted to look generous. Remember, they lied about how much they gave. They didn't have to give anything. And they sold the plot of land. And then they said, we're giving all, this was the whole amount. And it wasn't the whole amount. And they didn't have to give the whole amount, but they said it was the whole amount. Why? because they wanted to look generous. Put it together with Simon because while Simon offered money to get power, Ananias and Sapphira offered money to get a good impression, to create an image. Oh, they're really generous. They're really good people. They kind of get it. And that impression, I don't know, that we're generous, might provide, I don't know, just a little power, maybe a little influence, maybe a little, say, a little control as to what goes on around here, because I'm one of the generous ones, you know. Maybe they'll sing the songs I like if they know. And even as I say it, that's a different spirit. That's a, could have been more money than anybody gave them money. That's a different spirit. It's not a generous spirit. It's not the Holy Spirit. It's the spirit of the age. This is how things work in the real world. You know that. It's the Simon spirit whose way of thinking says, hey, again, this is just how it works. In the real world, you give me what I want, some attention, some control, a little influence and power and I'll give you what you want. I will pay maybe a lot because I'm your biggest fan. Which brings me now to two things with which I close. An observation and a question. Observation is this. That in the context of the kingdom of God in general and in the context of the church, indeed our church in particular, here's the observation. It's actually a principle. Why you give and how you give matters a whole lot more than what you give, how much you give. Because, I mean, you think through, if you give with a Simon spirit, you gave, and that's good, and you might have given a lot, but it's different. In fact, if you give it a Simon spirit to get, who gets the glory if you give it a Simon spirit? Simon does. Wow, you gave, wow. But if you give it a different spirit, you give it a different way, generated by the Holy Spirit, which created a generous spirit, that's a different spirit. And, you know, Jesus in Matthew 6 says, don't let your right hand know what your left hand do, and don't blow a trumpet when you give. Nobody knows even what you gave. So who gets the glory now? God. God really did do this. God really did help us do that because we know it was with a different spirit. Ironically, however, how much you give will radically be affected. Think about this. How much you give will actually radically be affected by why you give and how you give. Because if when you give, you give with a different spirit, and I think you know what this feels like. I think you do. Because we've probably done it both ways. I have. But how much you give will be radically affected by how you give. because if when you give, you give with a different spirit, a generous spirit, it was generated honestly by the Holy Spirit. It's, well, it's amazing how much joy you get in giving even more. The people in Exodus had to be restrained. Would you please stop? And when that happens, it's a sign. It's a wonder that God is among us, authentically moving among us. I mean, what if you knew it was God by the release of his spirit and not a Simon spirit that built a building that eliminated the debt? I mean, it's not lost. I mean, last week I stood here and kind of gave an announcement about some financial stuff with us. What if we knew? Because we do. When things like this get resolved, it wasn't because we hugged Simon. It's because we asked the spirit to come. You need to know that. We need to know all the way down to the ground because it's a different spirit and it makes a difference. Which leads to the question, how do we rid ourselves of and protect ourselves from, as a church, this Simon spirit? Kind of getting in there and getting its way. Well, in the case of Ananias and Sapphira, I think you know the way they dealt with that and they didn't have to do anything. God kind of nailed them, they breathe their last. Remember that? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to laugh at that. And again, you know, if they breathe their last, when they kind of show their little thing, you know, their little scheme, that's pretty extreme, but it would work. Simon Spirit's gone. By the way, it is kind of extreme. We kind of go, he killed him. You kind of get upset with God on that one. Actually, what it tells me is how this church is in its infancy. It's like a day old, and the Spirit has already raised its head, and God, it's like God's going, I'm protecting this baby. You will not get, I'm not giving you an inch. Later on, I'm going to call on the elders and other people, but this, God says, this one's on me. Anyway, anyway, sorry. In the case of Simon, after he finally figured out what he was doing, Peter's response again, you know, still a bit extreme. He says, using Peterson's translation, to hell with you, your money, and you along with it. Well, we're not going to do that either. Talked to the elders, and they said, no, Dave, don't say that. But we will say this. We will, and we'll say it gently and graciously, but what we'll say is this. Simon, keep your money. Yeah, I know it's a lie. We could use it. No, I don't want it. I'm serious. We're not shaking hands with you Sorry, sorry, sorry Because how we give This matters And why we give Matters a whole lot more Than what we give But ironically What we give Is profoundly affected By how and why we give And so we pray This is why we pray Holy Spirit come And fill us with a different spirit, with a generous spirit, with your Holy Spirit. I want you to stand with me as we close. Philippians 4, verse 8. Paul is talking about what the Philippians had given to him, and they had given with a different spirit. It was a generous spirit, and Paul just wanted them to know, and I want you to know the same. He wanted them to know that that kind of giving had an effect, not just on the finances, that kind of giving had an effect on God. That's why when we do offering, we talk about it being part of our worship. Indeed, in verse 18, Paul says this, when you give this way, the effect on God is this, that it is for God a fragrant aroma, smells good, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God. And so we pray, Holy Spirit, come and fill us with a different spirit, with your Holy Spirit, with a generous spirit. And all God's people said, amen. you
