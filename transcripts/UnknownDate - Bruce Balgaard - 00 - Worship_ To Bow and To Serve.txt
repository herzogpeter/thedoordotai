I had a friend this week ask me if I was preaching this weekend and I said yes, just not an open door. I'm on the road this week, ministering in a church in Indiana, near West Bend, Indiana, and encourage you to pray for me while I'm there. But the reason I'm making this video is I really wanted to be where you are. I wanted to be at home today, especially to be around the word that Bruce Belgard is going to be bringing. Most of you know Bruce. He's our pastor of worship. And a few weeks ago, we commissioned him. And the intent of this weekend's word that Bruce is going to bring is to bring not just his perspective, but it really has become our perspective as a church as to what worship is. But rarely do we get to address it as clearly as Bruce is going to bring the word today. Worship, as I think many of us would define it and understand it, is what we do when we come together and we sing. And what Bruce is going to make real clear is that that is certainly part of an expression of worship, but it is not the heart and soul of what it means to be a worshiping community. I'm very excited about the word that Bruce has. I just kind of publicly want to endorse it and invite you into it. And, Bruce, I want to bless you as you bring the word today. I know that you haven't publicly addressed our body the way you're going to do today, And it might feel a little bit weird to do this because it's videotaped. But I just want to pray for you and for the time around the word this morning. So let's pray. Father, first of all, I just thank you for Bruce. Thank you for the gifts that he has and the gift that he is. And I thank you also for the word that he has for us around what it means to be authentic worshipers. I pray a blessing on him. I pray that you give him great liberty in the pulpit today. and that the word he has would have profound effect on us. In Jesus' name, I pray these things. Amen. Welcome, Bruce. God bless you, Bruce. Thank you very much. Thank you, Dave. I'm talking to a video. And I want to thank you specifically for putting up with which I think was the world's longest interim. By the time it was all said and done, it was 19 months, which in what time you could birth two children, if you think about it. Not twins, I mean back to back. You could have two kids, so I thank you for your patience. You're going to find out today a bit why it took so long. You'll find out a little bit more of the story. But I want to back up and give you just a little snapshot of who I am. I brought some pictures along, and we're going to go to those, and you'll find out a little bit about me, starting with number one. That's me. I'm the one without glasses. Fashion was tough in the early 70s, wasn't it? It wasn't a good time. I was also caught between two generations trying to grow my hair out long like my older brothers, but still trying that comb-over effect my dad was using. I had not yet discovered shampoo. later on I did and I got my got my hair feathered right remember feathered which landed me a girl that's my wife Cheryl we were not married this is the 78 prom I'm a junior she's a senior we later got married but not until you know I tried a couple other failed relationships but I did marry her I've been married for 17 years and I'm blessed with an incredible family, Nick and Amanda, my son and daughter. I have not been in the church all my life. In fact, most of my adult life has been spent working in music stores and playing in bands. That's me, the goatee. That's me on the right looking suave in the tux band and in a trio. I have but one claim to fame, brush with stardom. I played one gig with a legendary drummer, Jeff Procaro, who's no longer with us, but he was a part of a very popular 80s group, Toto. It was in a drum clinic I got to play with him. Now, the good side of gossip is that that has grown to a story that I think I'm the founding member of Toto, last I heard. So, it was really just one short gig. In the summer of 96, I had started a business on my own repairing instruments and was looking for something steady to go along with that. And right about that time, an opportunity came here at Open Door to work part-time, and I gladly jumped at it. And that later grew into an associate position until May of 99, when Mark and Kim Johnson announced that they were going to go and do a church plant. He was the music minister here before me. And they offered the interim position to me. And here's where it got interesting. Keith Meyer said, we're going to do a nationwide search. And in fact, they did. But he said, I want you to consider it too, Bruce. And I wanted to consider it as well. Taking the job, that is. And he said, prepare your resume and also prepare for a series of interviews. And we'll need you to tell your faith story and your philosophy of worship. That's where I got the deer in the headlights look. Worked in music stores. Sure, I grew up in the church. Philosophy of worship. I should get me one of them. I should get me one of them philosophies of worship. I was imagining them all looking at me in the interview and me going, I like it. So I turned to my trusty Bible. You know that first Bible that you just fall in love with? I mean, it's full of highlighters on top of highlighters, and then you underline it and you put notes in it. It was given to me by my mother. It's the open Bible. It's a version of the New American Standard. It's just a precious book to me. I have other Bibles now, but when it really comes down to it, I always grab that open Bible, and I go to the back where there's this little teeny concordance. And I got to tell you that God has answered so many questions for me in this little teeny concordance. It's amazing, seriously. And so out of desperation, I just go there. I didn't know where else to go, and I turned to worship. What's cool is that next to every word is a quick definition. This definition, however, was so quick and so brief with two words, only two words, that I have never heard used in the context of worship ever. Well, I've heard them like fall into songs, but I've never heard them say that worship is, here's the words, bow and serve. Bow and serve. And that was it. I mean, singing didn't even make the list, you know? So anyway, it was impactful. I looked at the scripture references that it had in worship, And from that started my philosophy of worship. I made kind of a three-point deal, and it's what I teach in the membership class, and it's a good philosophy. But then they asked me to do this, to preach a sermon on it. Now, the class I teach in membership is a 20-minute, you know, 15-minute thing. And so I really wanted to do it up right for you all, and not just trust my little open Bible concordance. I wanted to dig into it. Here comes the Bible software. I do not have a Bible degree, but, bagoom, I got software. And it's really cool. It redeems that stupid thing we call the computer that, you know, really, just crank God's word into it. It's amazing what it does. And so I go to it, and I type up the word worship in its concordance, and it is an exhaustive concordance now. So every time the word worship shows up, I'm in the NIV version at this time, every time it's in the Bible it's on the screen so I count them there's 152 times that the word worship shows up in the NIV Bible now the other cool thing about this is that you go to the first scripture and you see the word worship is in red so you can see it there and you double click on it and here comes the Hebrew and Greek translation of the words cool really cool and what I found as I went through those 152 is what I bring to you today and as we begin let's just start in prayer Heavenly Father I thank you for this journey I really thank you for these people here at Open Door and I want to thank you for your word thank you for that open Bible and that concordance and Lord I thank you that your truth is wonderful and I just pray to bring it accurately what you're showing me to these people at this time. In Jesus' name, amen. Okay. You are going to see me attempt to say these words in Hebrew and Greek. And you are allowed to laugh. For some odd reason, my Hebrew sounds like I'm from Texas. My Greek sounds like I'm from Hawaii. I'm not sure why. You'll find out. And slowly people are telling me how these words are really said. I apologize for butchering them. I go to the first time the word worship shows up in the Bible. Click on it. It is Genesis 22, verse 5. It is when Abraham is asked by God to sacrifice his only son, Isaac. It says this. This is Abraham speaking. Stay here with the donkey, said to his servants, while I and the boy go over there, we will worship, and then we will come back to you. So I double-click on the word worship, and this comes up. Sha-caw with a southern accent Sha-caw to bow down bow, bow, bow, bow, bow I find that word bow remember that's the first word in my open Bible concordance to bow to depress, to bow down to prostrate oneself like before a superior in homage, before God in worship, before false gods before angels okay we need to stop here a little bit, bow we're red-blooded Americans we don't like to bow we don't say that word very often we left England because we were sick and tired of bowing to kings, that's why we're here we're Americans Webster's Dictionary defines bow this way, and I think we need to put this in our minds because it is not sure it's doing this because it says to bend the head or the body in respect but then there's more, in agreement it says and then this word, to submit or to yield. That's what Webster says. And I want you to now make bow synonymous with submit because I think it applies. So does agreement and so does yield. But I'm going to use the word submit. When we bow, we bend our bodies as a sign of respect. This shows that we will submit and yield to whatever we are bowing to. We will submit our will to their will and yield the power over our lives. It means that we are no longer in control of our lives, but we yield control into the hands of that which we are bowing to. We submit. Okay. Shaka. Next time, second word, my Bible quest in my Bible software. The second time worship is used in the NIV, it's when Moses is leading his flock of sheep up into the mountain. Boom, there's a burning bush. it's the presence of God he goes near the presence of God and God says I'm going to send you to Pharaoh you're going to send my people free Moses says I don't think that's a good idea you got the wrong guy God says I don't and here's the key this shows up a lot in this God says I will be with you it's an important part of this then God assures Moses in Exodus 3.12 God says this, that after you free my people, when you've brought them out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain. I double-click on that word. Albad, or abad is the correct way. And look at that. To work or to serve. Second word. To work or to serve. Now that's more familiar. We know what serving is about. to labor, to work, to do work, to work for another, to serve another by labor, to serve as subjects, to serve God. I think you get the idea. Webster's, again, just simply says that service is to work as a servant. We understand what that's like. So I double-click on the next 13 times worship comes up. They are all a bod, every one of them. So, so far, I haven't found anything else other than bowing and serving. The next time shakha comes up, it's used in concordance with Abad. They are put together. It's in the Ten Commandments. Once again, Moses. Commandment number one. This is in Exodus chapter 20, verses 3 and 4. First commandment. You shall have no other god before me. Second commandment. You shall not make yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above, or on earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not shakha, bow down to them, or Abad, worship them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God. God makes it very clear at this point that when it comes to Shaka and Abad, there is only one choice that is a good choice, that is. That's the Lord your God. Folks, I clicked on the majority of the 110 times in the Old Testament it comes up. You got one of two choices. There was one time that an Aramaic word, it meant fear, and the King James, it didn't even interpret it worship. So almost without any change, two options. I was amazed. Bow and serve. I'd never heard this before. We're jumping to the New Testament. 42 times the word worship in the NIV comes up, and I did look at every one of these. Instead of two options, there are five. Interesting. We'll bring those up. This is when I sound Hawaiian. Sebo mai. I think there's a fish I eat that sounds like that. Threskia, Eusebio, Proskuneo, and then there's two versions of the last word, Latria and Latriuo, but they're translated the same way. Their meanings are the same. Okay, more options. Let's see what we find. Sebumai. I look at that one. Let's pull that one up. To revere, to adore, devout religious worship. Nah, there we go. There we go. oh, that's a little more familiar. Why didn't that show up in my definition? Good devout religious worship, I was accustomed to that. So I find in those 42 times worship comes up that Sebumai comes up four times. Two in the same story found in two different gospels, once in Mark and once in Matthew. And I'm going to read from the one in Matthew. The context is a bunch of Pharisees trying to nail Jesus because they're a bunch of legalists, as they were always trying to nail Jesus. and he throws it right back at them and says this in Matthew 15. These people, as he talks towards the Pharisees, these people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship Sebumai, me, in vain. Their teachings are but rules taught by men. Well, that didn't get high marks. Next time it's found, it's in Luke, when Satan is tempting Christ to worship him, to Sebumaiim. that doesn't get high marks last time is in Acts when the Jews are trying to jail the apostle Paul so devout religious worship friends gets low marks so I move on to the next word Threskia once again a little more familiar ceremonial observance religious worship I only found it twice both in Colossians chapter 2 verses 18 through 23 Paul is trying to expose a people who claim to be Christians, but really they're just worshiping angels. He says this about them. They have lost connection with the head. Well, that doesn't get high marks. I move on, next word. Eusebeo, Eusebeo. To be pious to show piety. Now at first I thought, well, that's not going to be any good. Piety sounds like self-righteousness to me. But as I looked that up in Webster's, it just means to be devout, godly, holy, to revere. Obviously those things aren't bad things. but it's only found once in the New Testament. In Acts 17, it's the only one I could find, in the context of ignorantly worshiping idols. Out of five, three are down. None of them are spoken of positively. We have two left. Proskuneo gets 28 mentions out of the 42. 28 out of the 42. To kiss the hand in token reverence, there's also a connotation of a dog licking its master's hand to fall upon the knees and touch the ground with the forehead as an expression of profound reverence that sounds like a bow to kneel to lie prostrate to do homage or to make obeisance the word of obeisance is obey obey that's another synonym I want you to attach to serve the first time that word shows up it's in the New Testament it's the very first time that the word worship is ever used in the New Testament and it's when the magi come to proskuneo at the crib of Jesus kings coming to bow before kings these kings knew about bowing but they came to bow last word latria or latriul look at that I was amazed, friends, to serve or hire, serve, to minister, to serve God, serve, serve, serve, serve. Where is that used? Oh, how about Romans 12.1? Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in the view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God. This is your spiritual act of latria, service. Out of 152 times, 145 of them are interpreted either bow, which means to submit, or serve, which means to do work and obey. The other seven, I couldn't find one spoken of in a positive light. I had no idea how true those two words were. Unbelievable. And folks, I want to invite you to wonder what it means with me. In doing that, I got a picture as I wondered about it, and I want to share it with you. It's a story. I'm going to be the main character in the story. I will be playing myself for ease of recognition. Welcome, I'm Bruce, and welcome to my world. This is where I live. It is a desert. It's a dry and desolate place. It has very little hope. It has very little life. can't find love, no water it's a dry and arid place but I'm in control at least I think I am it's called the kingdom of me and it's where I live and I'm wandering along in my journey of life and ahead of me I see a green, green valley looks beautiful so I go on over there I look up or look down into the valley, excuse me, and I see that it's just plush and full of life. It's incredible. I later find out it's called the kingdom of God. Cool. I look down into the middle of the valley and there's this beautiful blue sparkling river. I later find it's called the river of life. And in it are people. And they're doing great. They're down there, they're swimming, they're going with the flow. They look a lot different than me. I am dry and parched and very, very, very low. But they look like they have hope. It's interesting. They catch me, my eye, they see me up on the cliff and they go, hey, hey, and I, what, what? You got to come in here. Don't be up on your desert. Come down, the water's incredible. I look down at them and I know that I don't look like that. No, no, no, no, no, no. Let's, you guys deserve that because you've lived your life right. And I know the mistakes I've made. And they go, no, no, no, wait. They cry up, go, you don't, you aren't getting it. We were equally as messed up as you. There is no way to earn entrance into this river. It is by the Son of God in this kingdom. The God who owns this kingdom, it's his son that makes the way. It's free. just jump but if you ever stood on the top of a high dive and looked down even though you know the water is deep everyone tells you it's not going to be you aren't going to get hurt there is some trepidation isn't there that first leap of faith and there's lots of excuses I'll do it tomorrow it's great don't do it tomorrow I need to go you won't be able to do it on your own You need the Lord Jesus' help. Just jump. Trust. It's a leap of faith, not by works. It is a free gift from God, but you do have to jump. Looks like it might not be safe. Oh, but it is safe. It's safer than you've ever been. It is being saved, in fact. So you jump. Oh, do you remember that? Do you remember when you first jumped in to the waters of baptism? them, wow, what a feeling. Isn't it great to experience life and love? To start to taste peace and joy that's authentic, that does satisfy? Unbelievable. Ladies and gentlemen, go back. Go back and remember. And I want to pause and say, man, if there's anyone that hasn't taken that jump here today, let me advise it. You don't know what you're missing out on. And there's tons of excuses. Just, I really invite you to come. There is nothing left to do other than say yes to the Lord Jesus Christ. Okay, but now we all remember that that is not the end of the story. There's some interesting things in the river. First of all, you notice there's a strong, strong current. Ooh, whoa. And that doesn't at first feel that safe, so you dig in. Get your feet down there. Ooh, people are zipping by you going, no, no, come on, come on, come on. You're like, I don't know. I can't see beyond the next bend. They go, I know, that takes a little getting used to. But if you trust, if you release your will into the will of God, you will experience life. If you bow and submit to the current, that's where you find healing. That's where you find joy. That's where you find growth in the kingdom of God. It's a journey, and you need to submit yourself to it. You need to bow to the current. And so the posture you take instead of stiff is bent. You pick your feet up, and you start to float. And you submit your will to the will of the Father, and you start to go in his flow, in his timing, in his purposes. And along the way, you have different times of digging your feet in, because that's a waterfall. You want me to go off the waterfall? And people go, I know, but just come, come, come, come, you'll see. And you go off that waterfall. It's a huge growth spurt in your Christian walk. And you land in water deeper than you've ever been in before. That is God's presence, and it is good. And you start figuring out how good it is and how much you can trust it. And you start getting good at bowing, and you get good at submitting. That's the first action of worship. But there's more. You go on the journey. The river widens. It deepens. And slows down. Comes to a stop. Still very deep. Still very good. You're lying there one day. Presence of God is so cool. Sunblock. All of a sudden you hear a voice. Bruce. Bruce, you can tell it's coming from the bank of the river. I've been out of the river. I'm now used to the river. I'm staying in the river. Bruce, the voice is very familiar. You finally look. It's Jesus, and he's on the bank. He's on the bank, and it's kind of confusing at first. And he goes, come here. And so reluctantly you... You know how you can stay in the water completely, even though your belly's on the sand, you're looking up at them? And he goes, stand up and get out of the river. And you go, wait a minute. I've been out of the river. I'm not going back to the desert ever again. And he goes, no, no, no, no, never again the desert. Never again the desert. I've saved you from that, and you never have to go back. But there is a different part of the kingdom of God you need to experience. And you go, that sounds good, Jesus, but what about the water? The water of life. I like to live. I want the water of life. He goes, trust me, you aren't going to be able to tell until you get up. Just get up. So finally you go, okay, and you stand up. It doesn't feel safe, but it is safe because something has changed in you when you made that jump and you didn't know it. But there's a spring of living water inside of you. And it is the water of life. It's the same water that's in the river of life. And it springs forth from you. And Jesus looks you in the eye and he goes, like he always did, follow me. I'm going to make you fishers of men. There's some people over here who need a cup of water so bad, and they need to hear about the river of life. They aren't going to hear about it when you're just hanging out. Follow me. And so you go, okay, and you walk arm in arm with the Lord Jesus, but then you go, wait a minute, what about the river? Should I say goodbye to it? This means so much to me. And he goes, oh, the river is always there to be entered into, and you have to enter it, Bruce. We'll be back time and time again. Every day is the best, maybe even every hour, or if you can do it to set aside time where you put away the distractions and you enter into the middle of God's presence. That needs to be a time that's very, very personal. And you pull up and you get into that presence of God and you pull your feet up and you submit again. And then you hear the voice of Jesus going, okay, it's time to go and serve some more. And you serve and that well is healthy. You need both. It's one of those other things. It's not either or. It's not dry land. It's not just river. It's both and. it's not just one word that is described worship there's two it's bowing and serving if all you do is serve and you never go back and get a drink for yourself you will dry up it's amazing where the other hand comes from the other hand is just as damaging it's called the waterlogged Christian you know you're just in the river I don't want to serve this is too nice someone else can serve and it is nice it is and it's tough sometimes to serve that's why it took me so long to say yes to this job I'll tell you a little story about that you knew that I was repairing instruments while I was working here part time well that fell apart for me it was a dream of mine, it didn't work out I'll tell you, when it stopped, it stopped and it was kind of hard on my pride because I was servicing about seven different music stores and man, they all dried up in like a month. And I noticed. And so I pursued another one of my dreams. I submitted myself to my dream. And I'm not saying it's, you know, I don't want to judge all that, but I'll just tell you that I started producing CDs. I did two projects while I was working here part-time. It just about killed me. I said yes to too much stuff. I wound up being way too busy. And I got so far behind on these projects that there was a time where I sat my family down and I said, Daddy's going to war. And I went and I lived in that studio until those projects were done. I have never worked so hard in my life. And it was not good. I made it through. God is so gracious. I made it through. But one night, on a drive home in my van, I picked up my feet and I went a little deeper in the river and I prayed this prayer. I said, God, I thought this was going to be good. And I still like making CDs, but I was doing my plans my way. And I said, God, how about you come up with the next plan? That was my prayer. A month later, this job got offered to me to do the interim thing. And I noticed. And I did like Moses did with the burning bush. I said, okay, fine, but me? You know me, Lord. But as I entered into this thing, I learned a lesson that 90% of ministry is showing up. I think that's a part of serving. Because I look at that and I go, I don't have things to give. And God says, I know. He knows. But he says, I do. And you have me in you as a spring. And if you just be obedient, it's going to work out. And it's just amazing what God does. It's amazing what God does. ladies and gentlemen these are the two actions of worship to bow and serve to submit and obey there's other things we can bow to money I'm sorry to say I've let money make a lot of decisions in my life they're like big billboards on the way back to the river I like to think about it you need a drink You're heading back, and all of a sudden, here's this big, money this way. You'll be in control. The world will be yours. Just try it. And so you're kind of, you know. All of a sudden, you're in the woods over here going, where's the river? I've served the idol of people's approval. How about that one? submitting our will to that which gains us approval. I found out quickly that those other people are very hard to satisfy, and their approval, unlike God's, absolutely needs to be earned. It's not good. Return to the river of life, found only in the kingdom of God. Wade into deep waters. Bow, pull up your feet. submit to God's will and obey him and serve him and what he would have us to do along the way. So what are we doing here? What is this about? This is river time, I think. That description of going back to the river time and time again, there's all kinds of different ways to do it. One great way, because we set it up once a week, is coming here. A bunch of other people. And we jump into the river together. and we do something when we're here that's really good. We do something in the river and that is that we declare things that are true. We declare it. Declaring is really, really good. It's part of how you get saved. Confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord. There's something about confessing with your mouth that's extremely powerful and believe in your heart that he was raised from the dead by Almighty God. I like to liken it to love you do it and you declare it if you don't have both of those elements it doesn't work as well consider with me a person that says I love you, I love you, I love you oh I love you they have absolutely no actions of love to go with it ever had someone like that in your life? all of their actions, no love words, oh I love you what's that like? it's offensive, isn't it? because it's a lie what's better? actions of love but no words of love, that's better people that would die for you but that never ever declare it that is better than the first but it is not the best it is called stoic Norwegian love laughter laughter laughter I can pick on my own, you know, lineage. It's something we struggle with. It is. What's best? Actions of love followed by declarations of love. Do it and declare it. Have you had those relationships where you know that this person would die for you, that loves you from their very core, and they look you in the eye, and they say, I love you. what naturally happens next anyone? you draw close you draw close and you hug same is true with worship if you have big declarations of worship but no actions meaning no bowing, no serving it's offensive what's better? lots of actions of worship but no declarations called stoic Norwegian worship. What's best? Oh, what's best? When we do bow and serve, when we trust God really and let go of our wish list, you know? It's like we get in the river and we're like, nice river, here's what I want, you know? Just fill these out and I'm sure everything will be okay. God does give you the desires of your heart. He does, but he does it his way. He does it his way. Because we don't know how to get there, and he does. So you submit. And you serve. And you declare. And when we get together and we do that, we draw close to God. And we weep in joy. It's the hallmark of open door, you know, being on the top bleacher and crying during worship. People, you don't cry because the music's good. You cry because God is good. Only God. God Almighty. God is so good. God is so good. That doesn't sound big enough, does it? After all that, God is so good. I want to say it bigger. God is so good. That's better. I'd still like to get it a little bigger. Jesus, you are so good. That was bigger. That was bigger. When you, when the people of God are bowing and serving, are submitting and obeying, and then they start declaring, music can help. Music can help. it's a really wonderful thing singing is heightened speech it simply helps us to say things bigger or quieter takes a whisper into a lullaby the use of melody, harmony, rhythms what we do here, believe me I could talk to you about music I know about music and it's wonderful other things can help other things can encourage us to enter that deep water in the presence of God like mountains I really want to encourage you to. There's so many things around us, God's beauty in creation. Go out at night when it's starry out and you can see into eternity and then start declaring God's goodness. Oh, you draw near. You draw near. There's so many ways that God, that the veil gets pulled back and we can come so close. And it's a precious, precious thing. We know it. It's something that we hold so valuable here. Hebrews 10, 19 and 22, we opened with it. Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the most holy place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, opened up for us through the curtain, that is his body. And since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near. Declare it. And folks, all those sermons that you've heard about proclaiming, ascribing. They all fit in here. They're good. They're good and appropriate. I want to end just by one example of this. A year more ago, we had a conference called the Relational Wholeness Conference. We held it at Colonial Church. It was with Desert Stream Ministries. This conference was designed for you to get in touch with areas that you have not bowed yourself to God. You've not submitted in areas of brokenness and relationships. And it was there to do, to obey and do the hard work of dealing with those things and realizing that might cause some actions out of us. And it was an intense time. And I think it was intense because people were gonna submit things they'd never submitted. They were gonna pull their feet off of the bottom of the river like they have never done before. And it was amazing. And the worship, we had several sets of it. It was amazing. But what was interesting is that people came up to us afterwards and said, whatever you're doing here, do that on the weekend. And we looked at each other and it's like, same people, same songs, a worse sound system. You know, what were we doing different? What was different was that I just feel that when you release and trust more, when you pull up your feet and you submit and enter even deeper water, and when you really, even though it doesn't seem safe, you go, Jesus, I will follow you. And you might say some things that are tough, but I'm going to obey. When you do that, and then you declare it, and music helps, oh, praise be to God Almighty. We draw near to God, people. This is creator of everything. The savior of our souls. What is worship? It's bowing and serving. It is submitting our will to and obeying the one true God. And then, declaring what is true. That's how you worship in spirit and in truth. And we draw near to him. And our lives are changed. Folks, let's find deep water. Let's pull up our feet and follow Jesus. And I'll see you here next week at the river. Why don't you stand with me and let's pray. Lord God, I want to thank you for your word. I want to thank you for my little open Bible concordance and whoever wrote those two words down. And Lord, I am grateful, so grateful for the kingdom of God. I am grateful for the river of life. And Lord, I do pray if there's anyone here that's been standing on the cliff and standing on the cliff of their desert, Lord, I pray that today would be the day that they jump. Lord, and that your goodness would surround them and they would begin the journey with us of submitting our will into the capable hands of the Lord Jesus Christ and eagerly doing your work and your service and love. Lord, build us up as your people. Teach us how to bow and serve you, holy God. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
