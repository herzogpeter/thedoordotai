Father, in what I and I know that we have discerned as a season in our church's life, that you have given to us for preparation, for things you are bringing us into, calling us into. Most obviously, we see the change in the things you're calling us to in physical ways embodied in our building. but deep within me in us is a sense that there's something much deeper going on relative to your stirrings among us. And so I pray as we unfold again today the word to us from you relative to our preparation as a people for what you're calling us to, that you would be strong in the word, and that by the power of your spirit you would provide what we don't have to accomplish what we in our flesh cannot do. I pray it in your name. Amen. We are, as you know, dealing with these issues by way of preparation for where we're going as a people. Three vital issues of life, money, sex, and power, and rightly ordered issues related to that. We're dealing of late with power, the issue of power. And in the context of that, we began some weeks ago to talk about what I began to refer to as the path to power. And that's such a path to rightly ordered kingdom of God, the kind you read about in the Bible, power, really does exist. But that this path to power, we need to understand, is an odd path, an unfamiliar path, a path actually not taken by many. even those who name the name of Christ for this path is full of paradox and what would seem like contradiction for if you're really on the path to authentic kingdom power it will often look and feel like the wrong path. For what we've discovered is that the path to power in the kingdom of God doesn't look always or feel always very powerful at all on the front end. Thus far we've examined several scriptures that speak to and illustrate this paradox of kingdom truth, but Philippians 2 continues, at least in my mind, to provide what may be the clearest, most succinct expression of this dynamic, for it's embodied in Jesus, who did not ascend to power by flexing his muscles, either physically or spiritually, or by grasping for power, but he descended into power by emptying himself, and taking on the form of a slave and then to, like a slave, do what slaves do. What slaves do is obey. And he became obedient, even to the point of death, even death on the cross. But it was precisely because he took that path of emptying himself, not grasping it for himself, of taking on the form of a slave, not of a king, that God gave to him the name, which is above every name. That at the name of Jesus, every knee will bow, every tongue confess on the earth, under the earth, in heaven, in hell. Every knee will bow to that name. I'm talking power. But it happened when he walked this path of emptying himself. And then to make it clear that this is not just his path but ours, we need to be reminded at the beginning of that text in Philippians, the Apostle Paul said, have this attitude in you which was also in Christ because that's the path to power. The point is that this path that Jesus took to power yielded real power. Power to heal. Power to redeem, deliver, and transform. Power to usher in all the supernatural realities of the kingdom of God that we want, but that the path to power is not about learning how to grasp and wield power. It's about learning how to walk the way of obedience, Philippians 2. It's about learning how to walk the way of a servant, Matthew 20, the way of the basin and the towel, John 13. It's the path of powerlessness like that of a child, Matthew 18, of brokenness and mourning we talked about last week in Matthew 5. Today, our examination of this path to power continues as we discover that this path to power also includes what I am calling this morning, holy hunger. Again, taken from Matthew 5, this will be our final week dealing with the Beatitudes. We'll deal with three of them in all, and this is the last and third today. Matthew chapter 5, if you have your Bibles, turn to that. Matthew 5 verse 6, where Jesus says this, Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness. They shall be satisfied. Which I think means, among other things, especially as it relates to this path to power thing, that the path to rightly ordered power in the kingdom of God is not about seeking first the power of God. It's about seeking first the life of God, the fullness, wholeness, to use the text's phraseology. It's about seeking first the righteousness of God, to which will come the power of God, through which will flow the power of God. Seek first the life of God. Matthew 6, Jesus, just one chapter later, said all that this way. Seek first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all the other things will rightly follow. You want to talk about rightly ordered power? Power is rightly ordered when it follows a seeking after righteousness. Let me remind you of the context of this beatitude so as to see its legitimate connection with this series on power that we're dealing with. As you recall, if you've been here with us the last couple of weeks, it all began in Matthew 4, verse 12, when John the Baptist was taken custody. It was as if the divine start of gun of history went off, mark the beginning of Jesus' ministry. For from that moment on, from the moment that John was taken custody, Jesus began, verse 17, to preach, saying this, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. In other words, the kingdom or the reign of God, the power of God is at hand. In other words, it is within your reach. It is something that in your real life you are going to be able to really experience. And in verses 18 to 22, we saw the initial calling of the 12. And then in verse 23, their first taste of ministry, marked by two things. Number one, Jesus was proclaiming the kingdom. Number two, he was doing the kingdom, which was designed to make clear that the kingdom that he was bringing was not just one of words, but it was one of power. For he was healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people, and that is power. Results of that power display, totally predictable. News about him spread, verse 24, and multitudes came, verse 25. After this demonstration of power, they were, and by they I mean Jesus and the disciples, the ministry team, were a smashing success. They had a tremendous following when right in the middle of that, Jesus did the strangest thing. In Matthew 5, verse 1, seeing the multitude, he withdraws. Why did he do that? Well, I think at least in part, it's because he knew they didn't get it. not just the multitudes didn't get it, but even the disciples who did not yet know or understand the deep things of the kingdom of God that give rightly ordered access to the power that he had just put on display. Now, please note this, and even give yourselves some room around this. It wasn't the disciples' fault that they didn't know the deep things of God yet. They were new to this. They were young in this. And because of that, Jesus, I think, went up to the mountain, and after he sat down with these disciples that he loved, with whom he was so patient, his disciples came to him. And opening his mouth, he began to teach them, saying, fundamentally this, I've got some good news and I've got some bad news. The good news is this, all that power you saw and are really jazzed about right now and would really like to get some of, he's real. And it's all for you, it is for my holy church. Bad news is the path to that power is not what you expect. Power is not going to come to who you think. It is not going to flow through who you think. You see, it won't be for those who flex their muscles and bark commands. And I just know, you guys, I love you, but I just know after seeing all that power, you're flexing your muscles and you're just ready to start barking commands. It's not going to come to those who look good and think they know how. It's not going to come to churches like the Laodicean church that he spoke of in the Revelation who saw themselves as rich, increased with goods, and in need of nothing. Doesn't it feel good to be in a place like... We all go to that Laodicean church. Doesn't it feel good to feel rich, increased with goods, and in need of nothing? That's the goal of my life, isn't it? How about you? Power's not coming to that place. Power of my spirit, the power of my kingdom, that all of you want, it's going to come to broken people who every day of their life are living in begging dependence, recognizing that their only possible hope to get anywhere near the authentic power of God is God. It's going to come to mourning people who quit pretending and quit hiding, who bring out here what's really going on in here, who are willing to walk into authentic repentance and godly sorrow, so they can receive amazing grace. And it's for hungry people, which like brokenness and mourning, on the front end doesn't look very powerful at all. Blessed are the hungry. Again, if it's a beatitude and it's in the Bible, you go, oh, that's really good, it's true. Who do you know who's hungry you think is blessed? I mean, I'm a very visual person, so the first thing that comes in my mind is some starving child in the Sudan. blessed are the starving. That doesn't look very blessed and it doesn't look very powerful at all. But what Jesus is speaking of here and what he knows is this. He's turning things upside down. Again, this is paradox. What he knows about the blessedness of hunger is that hungry people desire and it is out of the desire for a food that will satisfy that people get full. Word about hunger. Just kind of walk around this word a little bit and get a handle on it. I have a theory about hunger. I think I'm right. My theory is this. Everybody is. What? Hungry. Hunger is common to man. It is part of what separates us from the animals. Every human being on the planet, on this Sunday morning, go around the globe in your mind right now. Have you gone there? Are you back? Thank you. Every single person you saw has a hunger in their soul, a thirst in their spirit. It is a hunger and thirst for, among other things, meaning and value. Every single person in this room has a hunger for love and acceptance, happiness and fulfillment. It is true of the drunk on skid row. It is true of the corporate executive. It is true of the hooker. It is true of the housewife in Maple Grove. It is true of the Shiite Muslim terrorist. It is true of the Southern Baptist deacon. What separates us, beloved, is not that some of us are hungry and some of us are not. All of us are hungry. All of us are thirsty. What separates us is what we eat to satisfy our hunger, what we drink to quench the thirst of our spirit. And it is precisely there that the problems begin. Because most of what we look to to satisfy our hunger and quench our thirst doesn't work. It leaves us more hungry. It leaves us more thirsty. You know the story. I've referenced it often. It's one of my favorites, especially relative to this particular principle. Jesus met a woman at the well, and he knew something about her. And it was beyond the knowledge he had of her that she had five husbands, and the man she was living with right now was not her husband. She was just living with him. It's interesting in the text. It's John 7. Jesus says that to her. I know you've had five husbands, and the man you're with right now is not your husband. And her response is this, I perceive that you're a prophet. Well, that's good. That's good. You have a great perception. But that's not the deepest thing he knew about her. What he knew about her beyond that superficial reality was this. This woman's thirsty, and she is drinking things. She is eating things that have no power to quench her thirst or satisfy her hunger. And what she was using was relationship after relationship after relationship with a man. And he began to talk to her about a different kind of water, about a different kind of bread. We live in a culture that says, as you know, that what can satisfy your hunger and quench your thirst are things like success, status, money, even power. So if those things can feed your hunger, here's my advice to you. Go get you some of that. Success, money, status, and power. Eat it up. satisfied? Some of you to that say, no, not yet, because I haven't quite gotten the success, status, money, power, but I'm quite sure that when I do, I will be satisfied. Also, let me talk to you among us who are what most of us would call successful, status, full, powerful, money, full, satisfied? In droves, people are discovering that they're not. Prophet Amos said it this way, in his perception of hungry and thirsty people, and what the real problem was, said it this way, that the world is panting after the dust of the earth. In other words, what most people eat to satisfy their hunger, what most people drink to quench their thirst, is dust. And some people eat real fancy looking things, and some people eat real cruddy looking things. But Amos said, I think they're all eating dust. And here's a flash of insight for you. Dust doesn't do much to satisfy your hunger. At least you have something to put in your mouth and chew, but it will not satisfy your hunger or your thirst. See, there's nothing wrong at all, and we've said this before. With a house in the suburbs, two kids, one dog, two cars, a boat, throw in a snowmobile. But if you're using it to feed the hunger in your soul, you're going to be really hungry, see, because those things can't feed you. They're dust. There's nothing wrong at all with a successful career, a boatload of money, your name in the paper, your degrees on a wall, but those things can't feed you. They're dust. So here's the question of the day, not just for the church, but for the culture. What does have the capacity to satisfy the hunger of the human heart? To quench the thirst of the human spirit? Well, according to Jesus, the answer to that question in Matthew 5, verse 6, is righteousness. I have a question about his answer. And it's a question for you. What do you think of that answer? Well, Reverend Johnson, I think that's a very good answer, actually. Yes. You know, we are in church after all, and I kind of expect to hear things like that in church. So, yes, yes, we really should be more righteous, yes. Now, what do you really think of that answer? What does it stir in you? What does it do for you? does it ring true for you? does something in you go yes that or are you just willing to accept it as the thing we say in church? actually for me his answer raises another question I'm full of questions today I hope I have some answers around this my question around his statement of righteousness being that which satisfies is this Jesus what kind of righteousness has the power, the capacity to satisfy the hunger of the human heart? Which may strike you odd. I think it is an odd question. I mean, what do you mean, Dave? What kind of righteousness is he talking about? Are there varieties of righteousness? Actually, yes. Absolutely. There are varieties of righteousness. There are different kinds of righteousness. And the vast majority of them are dust. They are just as dusty and just as incapable of satisfying the hunger of the human heart as a house in the suburbs or five relationships with five different people or whatever other kind of dust people eat. For example, there is what the Scriptures refer to as the righteousness of the Pharisees, Revealed by Jesus in Matthew 5, verse 20, just a few verses after he said, the people who hunger for righteousness are going to be satisfied, just a few verses later, he says, makes this qualification. There are certain kind of righteousness that won't. In fact, I say to you, verse 20, that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven. So that righteousness isn't going to satisfy you. Why was their righteousness inadequate? Well, for among other reasons, their righteousness was inadequate because it was theirs. They were self-righteous. Let me put it this way. The food that these people ate and the water that they drank. And these people, by the way, and this is where it comes down to us who are sitting here, because these are religious people. These aren't the secularists who are out there, you know, feeding on all this evil things that the church always points at and yells about. No, no, no. These are people who are eating religious things. The food they ate, the water they drank to satisfy the hunger of their soul was how good they looked, how pious they acted, how much they knew, even of the Bible, how much they did. In fact, Matthew 6, one more chapter. Jesus tells us of them that these guys prayed loud and long. They gave a tenth of everything they had. They fasted twice a week. Actually, what Jesus said in Matthew 6 was this. When you pray, don't pray like them because the way they pray and the reason they pray is to be noticed. They don't pray to have communion with the Father. They pray to be noticed by you. And when you give, don't give the way they give. They give to be noticed. They blow a trumpet. See how much I gave? Where's my plaque? And when you fast, don't fast like they fast. They fast in a way that lets everybody know how holy they are. See, their righteousness was an external show of righteousness with no inner life of righteousness. And here's the flash, no news to us. External showing of righteousness without an inner life of righteousness is dust. It is just as dusty as any secular dust out there. It is absolute dust. Cannot fill. Satisfy the hunger of your soul. These people that I'm speaking of these Pharisaic types of people, are the people we spoke of last week in the context of mourning with all of their hiding and image producing. They are the people that Paul described in Galatians 6, 12 as making a fair show in the flesh, spending all the energy of their lives creating, protecting, projecting an image of righteousness that looks real good, but it isn't real. In fact, they've kind of created an identity for themselves out here that has nothing to do with who they really are on the inside. These are the people who really don't care about being good. They don't really care. I don't spend the energy of their life wondering, how would it happen that my heart could be so changed that I would become a kind, loving, righteous person? That's not where they spend the energy of their lives, on being good, kind, loving, and righteous. They spend the energy of their lives making sure they look good, kind, loving, and righteous, which means from time to time, they do a kind thing. They do a loving act. They do a righteous deed. You need to know, beloved, that these are the people to whom Jesus will one day say, as is recorded in Matthew 7, these haunting words that confuse some of us, depart from me, I never knew you. Does that passage ever bother you? It bothers me because then they protest. Remember, they go, yeah, but we did all this stuff. And Jesus says, what do you mean we? Who? Who are you who did all this stuff? You are a projection of an image. There is nobody there. Depart from me. I have no idea who this image you project, I have no idea who that is. Depart. It's interesting to me that all through his epistles, the Apostle Paul is quite adept at spotting and confronting this kind of person, the kind of person who is making a fair show in the flesh. And part of the reason that I think he's able to spot these people and call them out is because for a significant part of his life, he was one of those people. Indeed, it was his testimony. One of my favorite passages of Scripture, we've referenced it off in Philippians chapter 3. If you've got your Bibles, turn to that. It's his testimony. Where he says this, beginning in verse 4, if anyone had a mind to put confidence in the flesh, if anyone had a mind to spend the energy of their life making a fair show in the flesh, or to create an external image of righteousness, I far more. And then in verses 5 and 6, he makes a list of all the external things that became his image, his identity, that became the food he ate, The water he drank, verse 5, familiar passage, circumcised the eighth day of the tribe of Israel, of the nation Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews as to the law of Pharisee, as to zeal, a persecutor of the church, as to righteousness which is found in the law. Blameless. Now, the list he gives us there is not, in my mind, in terms of what we want to accomplish this morning, is not as important as how he is using the list he gives. See, the truth is this. I am not impressed at all that he was circumcised the eighth day. It doesn't move me. Wow, that's great, Paul. Big deal. Why is he putting this on his list? Nobody here is impressed. I could not care less, quite frankly, that he was of the nation Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews. But in his religious system, the emblems that mattered were on that list. The things that could provide you an external sense of authority and power and esteem were on that list. Kind of played around with this in the past. Nobody here, I just know for sure, there's nobody around here going, yeah, I'll circumcise the eighth day. Nobody here is doing that. And if you do, you're not getting any points. And I don't know if anybody's saying this, but this is kind of my best shot to get at this. I was baptized the eighth day. I got saved the eighth year, which really isn't a whole lot. I even know that, but if it took you until you were 16 to figure it out. I did it before you, so I got a little leg up on you. Of the denomination Baptist of the Church First Baptist. You know, I was in a town, I think it was Atlanta, where I saw a church called the Second Baptist Church. Who would admit that? You know, we were second. Anyway. Here's my badge. Here's my credential. I'm a five-hour-a-day Bible reader, a six-behavior abstainer from her. I'm a tongues talker. I'm a 12-time faller-downer. And on and on and on we go. These little emblems of success, esteem, righteousness, and power. Paul used them, not the ones I just listed, his, to create for himself a patchwork of an identity like a collage, what we call a false self, behind which, as he erected it and showed it to you every day, behind which he could feel satisfied. Blessed are those who are hungry. Forget that noise. Blessed are those who have created a wonderful image. They will be satisfied. Behind which he could feel secure and confident with this image he's created. Indeed, this image of his external righteousness was his food. This false self that he showed to the whole wide world was his water. Now, we have talked about this false self dynamic before. It's incredibly important, I think, to understand, and I am indebted to many authors for my understanding of this, people like Thomas Merton, Brennan Manning, but for what I'm about to share with you, I'm particularly indebted to our own Judy Haugen, for her work around the false self, identifying, importantly, two manifestations of the false self. And just as I give this to you, wonder about yourself and kind of wonder even where Paul is on this whole thing. The first manifestation of the false self is the competent false self, The second is the degraded false self. Let's look first at the competent false self. It works like this. In response to all the negative messages you and I receive from a variety of sources in innumerable ways, that we are irredeemably defective, that something's horribly wrong with us, and that we must earn love to get love, that we must earn acceptance and value to get our acceptance and value, the competent false self in you and I rises up and says, okay, then I will earn it. And you know the way I will earn it? I will earn it with my competent behavior. And if it's in the context of the church, I will earn my value by doing religious behaviors. Setting into motion an almost frantic drive to acquire external emblems of success, esteem, security, and power. For Paul, it was being circumcised the eighth day of the nation Israel of the tribe Benjamin. What's it for you? For the disciples, we have been with them for several weeks on this issue of power. For the disciples, it was needing to know who is the greatest. Remember? He kept coming up to Jesus. Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? It's me. I just know it's me. Based on what I've been doing, how I look, the image I've projected, it's us. It's our church. I just know it's us. Based on how big we are. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You know, when we ask that question, who then is the greatest, we are demonstrating it's like our pants are down and we don't even know it maybe your zipper is a little better whatever I'm going to get away from that analogy sorry because what you're demonstrating what you're telegraphing to the world is that when you ask that question that is a competent false self question the competent false self who's getting okay from how they look asks, how do I look? Peter's competent false self was showing when at the top of his lungs, he declared how capable he knew he was when the prophecy from Jesus came that when the shepherd goes down, the sheep are going to be scattered, and he said, ah, you don't know me. I can be faithful. I won't deny. I am competent. Beloved, it was in fact his competent false self, not Peter. Peter did not need to be destroyed, and he wasn't going to be destroyed, but that competent I can, I will self needed to be obliterated. And it was when he hit the wall going 100 miles an hour, hitting the wall being his utter failure. By the way, it's usually what exposes the competent false self. We fall into sin. We end up doing the thing we said we'd never do. We end up not doing the thing we said we always would. And when the competent false self is exposed or stumbles, that leads then to the second manifestation of the false self, and that is the degraded false self. The degraded false self is like the competent false self in this respect. It focuses on the externals as well. But unlike the competent false self that feels good because of its positive behavior, The degraded false self believes and accepts all the negative messages that you really are irredeemably defective. And the reason they accept the messages is based on the same thing, their external performance. Only their external performance is horrible. They've failed. They denied him. I guess I really am irredeemably defective, and that false self identity is unconsciously but very rarely embraced as who I really am. And that person may go to church their whole life, but they never enter into the amazing grace of God and real righteousness. Take all that, let's go now back to Paul, Philippians 4, Philippians 3, verses 4 through 6. In verses 4 through 6, Hebrew of Hebrews stuff, he is describing there his competent false self, from which he drew his confidence, security, power, esteem it was his food, but then he got a gift from God. A gift that when he got it, I'm sure felt much like what Peter felt like when he hit the wall. Didn't feel like a gift at all. For it came in a very painful way, as gifts like this often do. On the road to Damascus, you know the story. God literally smacked the apostle Paul, whose name at the time was Saul, upside his head, knocked him right off his horse and blinded him so he could see that this righteous looking false self he had spent so much energy creating had no power to feed the hunger of his soul, satisfy the thirst of his spirit, it had no power to protect him it had no power to keep him, that in all of his external competence and religious splendor that he delighted in showing the whole wide world. He was in fact a cardboard cut out of a man. He had a shiny but paper thin veneer that for a while had even fooled him. See he even had begun to believe that that's who he really was but now he was going through what all false self people go through when they are exposed. the horror of being exposed as not being as big as you looked on the inside, actually quite small. Somebody who's big on the outside must have a lot of resources. When all the veneer is stripped away, not a lot of resources. And with that exposure, the dismantling of his competent false self as being weak and worthless, there came to Paul what comes to us some choices and for Paul and for you and me at these moments of truth these are choices that shape the direction of the rest of our lives choice number one the apostle Paul could shift from living out of the competent false self that felt good because he was doing so well to move over to living as the and embrace the degraded false self that feels irredeemably defective because it doesn't do very well at all My cover is blown. I really am irredeemably defective. A total loser. I guess the best I can do is accept that's who I really am. This person is kind of the victim their entire life. Choice number two is a choice that a number of especially competent, competent false self people choose. And that is after hitting the wall or going through some public failure that reveals that what you got going on isn't maybe all that great. You suffer through the momentary humiliation. Go underground for a little while. Maybe leave the state. At least go to another church. But then begin to pick the pieces back up again of your shattered false self and rebuild your image. Redouble your efforts, work harder than ever to recreate the image. But there is a third choice, beloved. It was the choice of the Apostle Paul. And it is the choice I implore you to take. And it is the choice that I desire to take and find myself needing to take it almost every day. The third choice is this, to repent and believe that the gospel is true. and that maybe, just maybe now I don't know if this went through Peter's mind when he hit the wall or Paul's mind when he got knocked off the horse, I wonder however, because this goes through my mind especially when there's failure that just shows that it's not as great as it looks I wonder if maybe, just maybe, there is a kind of righteousness that isn't just about managing my image out here, but rather a kind of righteousness that really can change me in here. Listen to the hunger of the Apostle Paul for that kind of righteousness, not the kind that creates the image. I did that all my life, says Paul. The kind that might come inside and do something new in here so that out here is a real expression of what is in here. Listen for his hunger for that kind of righteousness in verses 7 and 8. But whatever things were gained to me, whatever things I used to use as my food and drink, I count them as loss for the sake of Christ. More than that, I count all things to be lost and see them actually as rubbish in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I've suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish in order that I may gain Christ. Let me give you my paraphrase of verses four through eight. Paul's saying this I used to spend all the energy of my life constructing, projecting and protecting an image that ultimately had absolutely no power to feed me had no power to quench me satisfy me, protect or secure me it was dust that's verses 4 through 6 but oh how my ambitions have changed and the energy of my life redirected no longer do I spend the energies of my life investing in making sure how I look out here. No longer do I spend my energies trying to make you think well of me. Now I want to spend the energy of my life coming into an intimacy of knowing and pursuing Jesus in here. What I hunger for now is that I may know him more and more and more. And that I may be found in him. That's in verse 9. Look at what he says here about righteousness. that I may be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from my performance of the law out here, but now a righteousness that comes through confidence in Christ, a righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith that produces something real in here. We need to get this. Paul's liberty came, and his passion was ignited when he realized it's not just about doing righteous things out here. It's about becoming a different kind of person in here by placing confidence in Christ who can create in me the very righteousness that belongs to him. Understand this well as well. That this hunger for intimacy with him and desire to be found in him with the righteousness that is born of him does not come without effort. It comes with a redirection of effort. From working hard and spending the energy of my life to look good and create an impression that is favorable to now working hard. And you know what? It is hard work. It is my work. And it is your work. The work now is this. I work hard to open wide my heart. And my heart wants to close up so often I get afraid. To open wide my heart to the life and the love of God. To open wide my heart, that's my work, to open wide my heart to the voice of God, to the spirit of God, to the truth of God, to the amazing grace of God to the transforming power of God. Have I obtained it yet? Well, Paul says in the 12th verse, no, I haven't obtained it. But I press on, press, work, work. Just redirected effort. I call it holy hunger for what is really holy, for what is really whole and righteous. A holy hunger to intimately know him, love him, obey him, Become like him. A little side note about this kind of hunger. This kind of hunger for God actually increases your capacity for God. In fact, it's kind of like the physical analogy. When you feel hungry physically, your hunger stirs you to eat. And when you eat food, it goes in your stomach, and if you eat enough, it stretches your stomach, which gives you capacity to eat more. and so you eat more and your stomach stretches and then you get hungry and you eat some more and then you get fat and now this is where the analogy breaks down. One of the reasons hungry people are blessed people is that the very hunger for God, the very hunger and pursuit of God increases your capacity for God. You see for me, I'm not talking about Paul anymore. I'm talking about me. it's not just about being saved and as the pastor here it's not just about getting you saved are you saved? have you signed up? I care about that it's for me it's not just about knowing I'm going to heaven when I die I like knowing that and I want you to know that it's just about so much more than that see I want to know him it's about intimate knowing and that intimate knowing that's my energy now Not about making sure you think I'm cool or holy. Not my energy is about intimate knowing. But I need you to know. I want more than that. I want a bit greedy. There's a holy kind of greediness, I think. I want more than just intimate knowing. I want what the Apostle Paul says. Here's my passion that I may know him. And then what does he say? And the what? And the what? And the power of his resurrection. Jesus, I'm sitting on the hill with you here. And you just did the power. And now you're telling me the path. And I will walk that path. but I am not going to be embarrassed about saying I would like to see that power too. I'm hungry for that. What's the next thing he says? And the fellowship of sufferings. There's some path and stuff again. Being conformed to the image of his death. What's that about? Obedience. See, I want the whole enchilada, folks. Have I obtained it? You see, you know why I have so much freedom to say no I haven't because I really don't care about the image. Here's the truth. I have not obtained it. But you know what I know about me? I really want it. I'm really hungry for this. And I'm hungry for you to be hungry for this. Did I tell you that a few weeks ago in prayer I got a picture? and it's about the power of God coming to us and moving among us God is preparing us for something that I cannot articulate yet but words like this holy hunger are part of our preparation for what he's calling us to and what I believe he's going to do Do you have something in your mind? I really don't have anything specific and that's good because then I won't be disappointed but he's going to give that too. Give me a break here. A little overdue. Yeah, thank you. So he says, thank you for finally doing that. Beloved, there is a path to power that yields real power. But as the Spirit of God has been revealing to us these weeks, it's an odd path, an unfamiliar path, a path that many won't want to take. It's full of paradox and what looks like contradiction for the path to power in the kingdom of God doesn't always look or feel very powerful at all in the front end. For the path to power is the way of the servant. It's the way of the basin and the towel. It's the way of obedience unto death. It's the way of powerlessness, brokenness, dependence, mourning, and hunger. Holy hunger for what is really holy and righteous and whole in here, not just out here. But guess what? When the life of God comes in here and my holy obsession becomes, bring your life to me. Expand your spirit in me. Guess what happens? The righteousness of God in here shows up out here. In fact, if it doesn't show up out here, It isn't in here. Please note this one thing as I close. There is a promise in this text that is wonderful, and it's the promise I take great hope in as I, like you, stumble through this journey of faith. The promise is this, that those who really hunger and thirst for the kind of righteousness I'm describing, not out here, but authentic, in here, born of God righteousness, the promise is this, they will get it. Where do you see that? I see it right in the verse. They will be what? Satisfied. See, satisfaction doesn't just mean I'm going to be satisfied. No, I'm satisfied. I'm going to sit on my couch. No, the satisfaction is that if you're really hungering and thirsting for life, if that's really your hunger, you'll get it. You'll get it. If that's what you want. If that's what you hunger for. So here's my question as I close. What do you want? the doors of the kingdom and everything in it are open wide to you and me the question is do you want it what do you want what do you hunger for my final word is this if today you're eating dust maybe it's time to change your diet maybe it's time to repent and believe that the gospel is true and that maybe, just maybe, there is a kind of righteousness that isn't obsessed with what people think, but it's born of God on the inside that makes you a different kind of person. Let's pray as we close. Continue to do, Father, by your Spirit's power this work of preparation among us. As you call us to walk this path to power. And as in my mind I see these as foundation blocks that we're laying for what you're calling us to and going to do among us. I pray that we would be faithful to lay these foundation blocks well. So that rightly ordered power can be among us and put on display for the glory of God. I pray this in your name. Amen.
