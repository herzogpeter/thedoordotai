Let's pray as we go to the Word. For words of life that call forth life, I pray. In Jesus' name, amen. A couple of weeks ago in what we've been referring to for several months now as a journey of the heart, we began to discuss what it looks like and what it means to have a generous heart. As embodied in David, whose life has been serving as a kind of guide for this journey of the heart, we saw his generosity first a couple of weeks ago in 1 Samuel chapter 30 toward that starving Egyptian in the middle of the desert, this person that he could have so easily passed by, ignored, not even seen, and no one would have blamed him. He had problems of his own. Remember the story? 1 Samuel 30, the Amalekites had invaded Ziklag, a little refuge community that David and his men had begun to call home. The Amalekites burned Ziklag to the ground, captured all the women and children, which were these men's families, and took them away captive in the desperate process of chasing these Amalekites down, trying to reclaim their lives and their families, David and his men in the middle of the desert on their way to something far more important, see this guy starving on the side of the road. This guy, this Egyptian, who under normal circumstances would have been seen as an enemy. Egyptians and the Israelites didn't really do really well. Remember that little tiny 400-year slavery thing was kind of under their craw. Under these circumstances, this guy on the side of the road was a bother. We've got problems of our own. Sorry about yours. Good luck with your life. See you later. But they stopped. Gave him water to drink, fig cakes to eat, two clusters of raisins. Their generosity, we pointed out, was not manifested so much in the amount that they gave. They didn't give that much. But in the fact that they noticed this guy at all, we said it this way. David had generous eyes. generous eyes that had the capacity to see people who are easy to ignore the least and the lost and generous hands as well that beyond mere sentiment that feels bad for the starving egyptian on the side of the road acted on what it was prompted to do so david's generosity was first of all toward people who desperately needed it. Secondly, a couple weeks ago, toward people who didn't deserve it, namely the 200 men left behind at the Brook Besser. Remember them? Having hit the wall physically in chapter 30, verse 10, they couldn't continue on the rescue mission to bring back the women and the children. When the 400 who did continue went into the battle, then returned victorious with not only the women and children, but with the spoils of war. It says in chapter 30, verse 22, that the wicked and worthless among them refused to share, particularly the spoils of war, saying, my paraphrase, we did all the work. If we share with them, there's less for us. They don't deserve it. And they didn't. David's response, verse 24, my paraphrase, everybody gets the same. For as his share is, David says in verse 24, who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who stayed up, who stayed by the baggage. Why? Why did David respond that way? Well, what we said was this, because David remembered something that these wicked and worthless ones had forgotten. What David remembered was this, where they were from. And where they were from was a debt they couldn't pay. According to 1 Samuel 22, verse 2, we have some history on these guys, for they were a ragtag, distressed, in debt, discontent bunch of vagabonds when they first came and met with David. They had no home, they had no help, they had no hope in the world. But now, 1 Samuel 30, verse 23, David says, with what the Lord has done for us, considering where we're from, how he has kept us and delivered us how can we be anything but grateful and from that gratitude be generous to these 200 who you think don't deserve it it's not about it's about being generous and then with that little story we got a pretty significant clue as how generosity is formed in the human heart for generosity begins with the gratitude that remembers that at one time we were separate from Christ. Ephesians chapter 2 we were excluded from the community of faith strangers to the covenants of promise having no hope and without God in the world but now with what the Lord has done for us how he has kept us and delivered us we who were formerly far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ how can we be anything but grateful and from that gratitude flow generosity. Generosity begins with a gratitude that remembers we had a debt we couldn't pay. Generosity begins with a gratitude that remembers that though he, that is Jesus in 2 Corinthians 8, 9, that though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor in order that we through his poverty, that we through his generous giving of himself, of everything he had, that we might become rich. And when I throw that verse in there, it makes this issue of generous hearts clearly central to the gospel that we preach and profess to believe. For this issue of a generous heart is, in fact, the heart of God. Stated more clearly, It's the kind of heart God has. For God has a generous heart. Making a generous heart, one of the primary indicators, primary revealers that you have given your heart to God, that you are getting your life from God, it is one of the primary revealers that you are engaged in an authentic relationship with God, thereby becoming more and more like God, who is, among other things, extravagantly generous. Luke 19, 9. Jesus declared this, speaking of Zacchaeus, today salvation has come into this house. Why did he say that? What did he see that prompted him to declare salvation has come into this house? Here's what he saw. He saw a greedy, grasping, consuming, lying thief become a generous person. not only did Zacchaeus stop stealing that'd be good we'd be satisfied with that that wasn't what happened to Zacchaeus he didn't just stop stealing he started giving generously Luke 19 Zacchaeus says this half of my possessions I will give to the poor whoever I've defrauded I'll pay back four times causing Jesus to declare today salvation just came to this guy the kingdom just landed how'd No, he's got a generous heart. That's how I know, says Jesus. Making this issue of a generous heart that we have stopped for two weeks around on this journey of the heart, one of the primary indicators that you have given your heart to God, that you are getting your life from God, that you are engaged in an authentic relationship with God, becoming thereby more and more like God, who is, among other things, extravagantly generous. Now, David was marked by this generosity his whole life long. We see it in his youth. We will see it in his age. In fact, it is my opinion that the primary reason why right in the middle of some pretty significant flaws in David's life, David was called a man after God's own heart because he had the kind of heart God had, an extravagantly generous heart. So let me tell you some more stories of David that speak to David and reveal the generous heart of David, but not just the generous heart of David. These stories will also reveal to us, one right after another, the generous heart of God. For David's generosity is a reflection of the generous heart of God. First story, 2 Samuel 9, chapter 9, verse 3. If you have your Bibles, turn to that. It's the story of Mephibosheth. Mephibosheth, say that 10 times fast. I've been practicing it all week. Picks up in verse 3 with these words. Then David said, is there not yet anyone of the house of Saul? Verse 1 says it this way. Is there yet anyone left in the house of Saul alive to whom I may show the kindness of God? Just pick up that little thing. The kindness, not just generally, but specifically of God. Let me give you some background here just so you know where we are in the story. When this story ensues, David is at a very different place than we have been with him heretofore. We have kind of been for several weeks with David in the caves running for his life. The years of doing that, hiding from Saul's murderous intent, are over in chapter 9 of 2 Samuel. Saul is dead. David's kingdom is now established. His wealth is beyond measure. His power is unquestioned, but his generosity is still the same. From his youth until his age, this generous heart continues to manifest itself. If there's any change in his generosity, it's that it's grown in its intentionality. Here he is intentionally. I mean, I kind of see him with a cup of coffee going, hmm, I wonder if there's anybody anywhere to whom I could show the kindness of God. Notice, however, where he's looking to dispense this generosity. To someone from the house of his enemy. That's where I like to spend the kindness of God. Is there anyone out there from the enemy camp to whom I could show the kindness of God? Pick it up at the end of verse 3. And Ziba said to the king, Ziba, who had been a servant of Saul, now a servant of David, said, there is still a son of Jonathan who is crippled in both feet. So the king said, where is he? And Ziba said to the king, behold, he is in the house of Maker, the son of Emile in Lodabar. Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Mekir, the son of Emile from Lodabar. And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David and fell on his face and prostrated himself. and I just want you to know that there are several jokes right there, but I'm busy reading the Bible. So I'm moving on. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he said, here is your servant. And David said to him, don't be afraid, for I will surely show kindness to you for the sake of your father Jonathan and will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul, and you shall eat at my table regularly. Verse 11 at the very end then says, So Mephibosheth ate at David's table as one of the king's sons. Come back in your mind to the beginning of verse 7. It says this, And David said, Don't be afraid. Why would he say that? We'll explain that. Let me tell you the rest of the story. Kind of give you some background to the story. You have to go back to 2 Samuel chapter 4. In 2 Samuel 4, Mephibosheth was five years old. The news came that King Saul, his grandfather, and Jonathan, his father, had been killed by the Philistines on Mount Bilgoa in the Battle of Jezreel. Panic, according to 2 Samuel 4, 4, was immediate and total. The Philistines were ruthless. Everybody knew that. There would be no mercy for anyone in Saul's house. Worse, David's guerrilla band was at large and growing in strength. Not knowing what to expect, they expected the worst and ran for what they thought was their lives. They knew what to expect from the Philistines. They weren't quite sure about David, but they didn't know David's heart. And the talk about David in Saul's house kind of gets some perspective here. It had been 10 years of Saul chasing David. And if you grew up in Saul's house, there wasn't a lot of flattering speech about David. They had no reason to expect mercy or grace from him. In the panic to escape, Mephibosheth's nurse grabbed him, ran out of the house, fell down, dropped Mephibosheth, breaking both his ankles. Neither one of them mended properly. He ended up a cripple for life. Get the picture. Mephibosheth grew up from five years old till chapter nine, when he's at least old enough to have had a son. He's got a son named Micah in chapter nine. So he grew up in a faraway place called Lodabar. far away from the king, not knowing the king at all. Sure, he'd heard stories of the king, and even stories of his amazing generosity, what I would call his amazing grace. But he'd heard other stories as well, especially in the house that he grew up in, accusing David of being the cause of all of his problems and all of his pain. So who do you trust? What stories do you believe they're conflicting and they're constant, cut off from his inheritance? having to conceal his true identity. Indeed, I think his identity in some sense was even hidden from himself in chapter 9, verse 8. When he comes to David, Mephibosheth says, why should you regard a dead dog like me? A little self-image problem there. Probably use some therapy. You're not a dead dog. You're a live dog. Anyway, that's why I'm not a therapist. I'm just not very helpful. Mephibosheth living in this faraway land not knowing the heart of the king not knowing what to expect hearing conflicting reports was never able to step into the fullness of who he had been created to be not as a son of the king forget about that he'd never been able to step into the fullness of who he had been created to be as a human being then comes the word king's looking for you you can't hide anymore in this far away place how would you feel? I mean, a little nervous? What does he want? There's no real way to know. The reports, as I said, have all conflicted. Some say the king is cruel. Others say he's kind. Who do you believe? Some say he's weak. Others say he's weak. Some have even wondered if he exists. He's been in such a faraway place. We don't even know he exists. Others say he does. Some say he's capricious. Some say he's Just no idea what to expect. First words out of David's mouth to Mephibosheth are these, verse 7, don't be afraid. For you have heard conflicting reports about me, and I want to make clear my intentions to you up front. I will surely show kindness to you. My intentions are these, to restore to you everything you have lost. I will invite you to my table. I will include you in my family. So come and eat the bread and drink the wine. And you will come to life. And so Mephibosheth, verse 11, ate at David's table as one of the king's sons. Question. Do you hear the story? Do you in that story? Hear the gospel story. Before it was culminated in Christ, David was living the gospel. David's generosity to Mephibosheth pointed to the gospel, demonstrated the gospel, prefigured, if you will, the gospel. David, we've kind of been saying this all through this story. David was living in the kingdom of God. before Christ came along. He was living out the kingdom of God. In fact, it's as if through this story, God is saying what he's always been saying and continues to say to Mephibosheth. Use in your mind Mephibosheth as a type. What he's been saying to the Mephibosheths, if you will, of the world. And the Mephibosheths of the world are men and women in exile, humanity in exile. The Mephibosheths of the world are his lost creation since the fall. And what God has been saying and always is saying to the Mephibosheths of the world is this. I want you back. You've heard a lot of conflicting reports about my heart and about what my intentions are. Here are my intentions. I will show kindness to you. I will restore you. I want to invite you to my table. I want to include you in my family. Don't be afraid. For you have lived for a very long time in a faraway place cut off from the king. You don't know his heart. You've never heard his voice. Your impressions of me are hearsay and mostly wrong because most of what you've heard about me says God to Mephibosheth and I assume there are some Mephibosheths here. Most of what you've heard about the king, about God is wrong and you've heard it from people who don't know the heart of the king. And I'm going to step out and do something rather bold and it might sound odd to you. While some of you have heard things about the heart of the king from people who don't know the king, I'm here to tell you that I do know the heart of the king. Now that might sound real arrogant to some of you but I know that I know and I know the heart of the king and you may even be sitting next to somebody here this morning who also knows the heart of the king and not only that this is going to send me right over the edge in some of your opinion but I've heard the voice of the king I know the voice of the king and I'm not that weird because I don't hear voices but I know the voice of the king and I know what he says you know what he says and I know what he's saying to you if you're a Mephibosheth here today I know exactly what he's saying to you he's saying this don't be afraid you've heard some lies about me says the king to Mephibosheth and he says it eternally you've heard some lies about me because here are my intentions surely I will do kindness to you here are my intentions to restore to you everything that you have lost since the fall those are my intentions I invite you to my table I want to include you in my family so come and eat the bread and drink the wine and you will come to life so how do we reach these Mephibosheths how how do we find them well David in order in trying to find Mephibosheth sent servants out looking go find him now be in the bigger story than David's story be God how does God find the Mephibosheths he didn't send servants he sent his what son who is called who? The son of who? David. David sent his servants to find Mephibosheth. God said, I'm going to do better. I'm going to send the son of David. I'm going to send my son. And when I send him, I will send him with a mission to, among other things, clear up the misinformation about who I am and what my heart is. And he will come with a message and among the things he will say in his message. He will say this, don't be afraid, Mephibosheth. Mephibosheth of the world, you have nothing to fear from me for I will surely show kindness to you. My intentions are these, to restore you. I want to invite you to my table, include you in my family. So come and eat the bread and drink the wine and you will come to life, says the son of David to Mephibosheth. so do you see why I say that the generous heart of David speaks to and reveals not just his generosity but it speaks to and reveals the generous heart of God for extravagant generosity is the heart of God it's the kind of heart God has let me just let that sit there for a minute and go over here and talk about this from a slightly different angle. When it comes to evangelism, we talk a lot about our need to understand the gospel, the facts of the gospel, and because that is important, and it is important, we train people, we prepare and coach people with the information that they have to have about the gospel with right answers so that when you're asked questions, you know what to say. And I think those things are very important. I really do. But what I want you to see about David in this story is that he didn't just understand the gospel. He didn't go to a class and take notes so he would know what to say to Mephibosheth when he came. David didn't just understand the gospel. David lived the gospel, and his living of the gospel began with a question. It's a very simple question, and it's a question that will help you and I enter into living the gospel as well. The question was this. One day, scratching his head with a cup of coffee, just wondering out loud, even asking for help from his friends. Is there anyone out there to whom we could maybe show the kindness, not just any old kind of kindness, but the kindness of God? Started there. So here's the deal. Want to share the gospel? Want to enter into the gospel story and be like a David who is spreading that gospel truth? Want to share the gospel? Well, before you start preaching, and I'm sure for preaching, kind of, I do it. Before you start talking, and I think we need to use words, but before you preach, before you talk, start loving. And before you start worrying about what I'm going to say, just start wondering. See, anybody can do this. I wonder, is there anyone out there whose path I might cross today at work or at school, on the bus, to whom I could show the kindness of God, to whom I could show the heart of God? It doesn't mean you won't use words. I'm telling you where to start. Anybody and anybody can enter in at that level. Let me make this as simple as I can. Some of you are going to go out to dinner after church and you're going to fill all the restaurants in this area. Maybe not, but a lot of you are going to do that. And if you don't, you'll do this some other time. Just make this real practical. Ask yourself that question. In fact, let me tell you, do something really hard. Don't pray for your meal. You know, I grew up, we prayed for our meal. I prayed for our meal. We do that. That's fine. But I remember as a kid, we would sometimes go out. I was a pastor's kid, you know, and we would go out with people. And my parents didn't do this, but I would every once in a while be with somebody, some Christian, and they would pray for them. It was almost like they would wait for the waitress to see. They're there. Hello, Lord, we thank you. You know, and they'd start to pray. So the waitress saw it, thinking, oh, this is our witness. They're going to be so compelled by us. And that never happened. I never had anybody come back. I noticed you prayed. Would you please tell me? Never happened. I was a little teenager. I was always hoping the waitress wouldn't see, you know. Don't take your Bible from your car and put it on your table. You know, maybe they'll ask me. Don't talk real loud about theology or going to church. Don't do that. In fact, don't put any display on it. In fact, before you even go in the restaurant, just sit in your car and pray. Pray in your car. This real simple thing. Lord, help us as we go in here, restaurant, shopping mall, wherever, help us be aware of anyone in there to whom we could maybe show the kindness of God. I said this a couple weeks ago with an assignment like this. I'll say it again. I dare you to do that. Because you know what? If you just take a pause before you go into your work week, and you just say, God, give me eyes to see. We talked a couple weeks ago about asking God to give us generous eyes. Show me someone to whom I could show the kindness of God before I start preaching to them. He will. He will. And another little help for you, If you really want to show the kindness of God when you leave the restaurant, don't leave a trick. Leave a tip. All the waitresses start clapping. Anyway. Are you saying you don't think we should have a verbal witness? I absolutely think we should have a verbal witness. But this is where David started. This is where you enter in to show the kindness of God. And as you show the kindness of God and you really start to love people, you will buy that kindness. maybe someday find the opportunity to use words and say something maybe like this, oh, by the way, I know the king, and I have heard his voice. And no, I don't hear voices. I know his heart, though. And you know what? He sent his son, and he's looking for you. And you've heard a lot of conflicting reports, but I'm here to tell you, since I know his heart, I know his intentions, and his intentions for you are very good. So don't be afraid. He will show kindness to you. He will restore you. He is inviting you to his table. He wants to include you in his family. So come and eat the bread and drink the wine and you will come to life. By the way, you know how this kind of generous heart begins? You know how you get a generous heart like that? It begins when you give your heart to God. when you give your heart to God you begin to get your life from God you're experiencing then an authentic relationship with God where over time you become more and more like God who is among other things extravagantly generous it's one of the primary indicators that you know God second story comes a little bit later in David's life. 2 Samuel 24, David wanted to build an altar to make an offering to God, but the place he wanted to build the altar belonged to someone else, a guy named Aruna or Arauna. It starts with an A. So he went to Arauna and offered to buy the place to which Arauna said, verse 22, I'll give it to you for free. Verse 22, look, the oxen for the burnt offering, the threshing sledges and yokes of oxen And for everything, it's yours, just take it. To which David said in verse 24, no. But I will surely pay it, pay for it. I will surely buy it for a price. And then these incredibly wonderful words that reveals the generous heart of David. Where he says, for I will not give to God that which costs me nothing. Now, those words reveal not only the generous heart of God, but once again, the flow of the story and David's generosity, those words also reveal the generous heart of God. Because that's the kind of heart God has too. I will not give what costs me nothing. God, who gave everything he had, it cost him everything. For he was slain, Revelation 5 verse 9, and did purchase for God with his blood. The currency he spent was his very life. He gave everything. He gave everything he had and purchased for God with his blood, men and women from every tribe and every tongue and every nation. He went looking for Mephibosheth and spent everything he had to find. I'd call that extravagant generosity born of love. Generosity, a little principle about generosity is the normal outflow of love and the apex of that outflow is sacrifice. Think about it this way. You can give and not love. In fact, some people give to you to try to get you to believe that they love you when they don't. You can give and not love. But you cannot love and not give. You can't do it. It isn't love. Pharisees gave. Pharisees, those poor guys, there were some very good Pharisees, but they've kind of become the poster child for religious hypocrisy. and they are and they gave the pharisees did and they gave a lot more than most i would say they tithed tithe meaning to give a tenth of something they tithed everything right down to dill and mint and cumin jesus said when he was accusing them of their hypocrisy once in matthew 23 dill mint and cumin little seeds you get 10 i'll give one to god that's like we were just it wasn't coming from love though they were paying a bill they were doing their duty they were keeping a rule they were covering their religious bases which an awful lot of people who go to church do when they give they well i'll just cover the base there well i'm covered with that but generous but a generous heart born of love says erwin mcmanus isn't measured by how much we give but by how much it cost us to give it. The same action, McManus says, the same contribution may be of significantly different value in relationship between two different people. For one person to give $1,000 is extraordinary if all they have is $2,000. But it's chump change for somebody who's got a million. David's heart. It's his heart, you guys. I will not give to God that which costs me nothing. There was no rule about that. That wasn't law. That's a heart thing. That's a love thing. That's a God thing because that's God's heart. I will not give what costs me nothing. Story is told of a guy that comes up to a pastor and asks, is this a grace church or is this a law church? The pastor says, it's a grace church. We're all about grace. Good, says the guy, obviously relieved because I was afraid you were going to press me to tithe. Oh no, says the pastor. This really is a grace church. See, the law says don't commit murder. Grace says love your enemy. I'm calling you deeper with grace, not to less. Law says don't commit adultery. And everybody who doesn't commit adultery feels really good that they don't. The law calls us to and frees us from lust. The law says pay your tithe. And some people do. Grace calls us to and frees us from greed. So we become beyond faithful givers. Generous. And I'm telling you, it's way beyond a tithe. It's almost like we're going to have to yell at you about a tithe if we think you don't have any love. Because grace calls you to way more. This, by the way, is why the giving patterns of a church, of our church, really tells you something about the spiritual climate of the people. It tells you something about the heart. It's why the giving patterns of the evangelical church in America really tells you something. And when I read the statistics from people like George Barna, who say that the giving patterns of the evangelical church are incredibly low, like 3% people give of their Christians. It tells you something about the church, the spiritual vitality of the church. It tells you something about their heart. you know I just love the evangelical we're always yelling about oh there's such a problem in the world there's such a problem in America I don't care about America I care about the church and we're in trouble I don't care he said he doesn't care about America email Scott about that he'll handle it Catch the spirit here. This is where I'm going. This is where I want to go. For me, this is where I want to call you. David said, I will not give to God that which costs me nothing. I'm not just paying a bill. I'm not just paying a bill. That was his heart. Last story. Near the end of David's life, 1 Chronicles 29. If you have your Bibles again, turn to that. I'm just going to be there very quickly. where is it? oh there it is I went to seminary 1 Chronicles 29 again he is at the near the end of his life it's actually going to be the last thing David does of any significance and that's what makes this poignant he's leading the people in the giving of gifts to build a temple he's not going to be able to build a temple he is going to just raise the offering for so this temple that he's kind of raising the funds for is a temple and this is significant to me that he will not see. He will never enjoy it. He will never minister in it. So in building it, it's kind of like leaving his legacy. But please catch this. The legacy that David is going to leave in the building of this temple is not the temple. The legacy that he is going to leave is the generosity that built the temple. Look at verse 1 of chapter 29. It says, Then King David said to the entire assembly, My son Solomon, who alone God has chosen, is still young and inexperienced, and the work is great. For the temple is not for man, but for the Lord God. Now with all my ability, David is speaking of himself, I have provided for the house of my God, the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, the bronze for the things of bronze, and so on. Verse 3, and moreover, in my delight in the house of God, this is all coming from his heart, the treasure I have of gold and silver I give to the house of my God, over and above all that I have already provided for the holy temple, namely 3,000 talents of gold. And then he goes on and lists the things that he's given. The end of verse 3, however, an amazing thing happens. Now, before I tell you what happened, just note this. David has demonstrated this generous heart his whole life. This is the end of his life. He is not here being generous in a manipulative ploy to get everybody else to be generous. It's not why he's doing it. And when you do that, you're being manipulated. It's not what he's doing it because he's generous. It's real. But the amazing thing, the wonderful thing that happened was this. This time his generosity was contagious. The people caught it. Look at verse 6. Then the rulers of the fathers' households and the princes of the tribes of Israel and the commanders of thousands of hundreds with overseers over the king's work offered willingly as well. And for the service, for the house of God, they gave 5,000 talents and 10,000 derricks of gold and 10,000 talents of silver and on and on and on. In verse 8, and whoever possessed precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the Lord in the care of Jehiel the Jehoshaphat. And the night. Then the people rejoiced because they had offered so willingly. For they made their offering to the Lord, their God, with a whole, what? Heart. And King David, here it is, end of his life, get this, end of his life. And King David greatly rejoiced. I see him in his age here. Greatly rejoicing, why? Because the temple's being built. That's important, but it's secondary. What he was rejoicing about was he was looking at his people, and he saw the same spirit that's been on me since I was a shepherd. it's on them the same spirit that has been in me to give it all away it's in them too it's as if I think what made David's heart rejoice was this looking at his people extravagantly give what went through his mind was this they get it and guess what that's the heart of God as well who when he sees his children little boys and little girls young men, old men old women, young women beginning to move into a lifestyle of extravagantly giving looking around wondering to whom they could show the kindness of God as if God steps back in delight and says the same spirit that's on me the same spirit that is me is on them the spirit is in them how do you know well they said these magic words and they waved their hands a lot no the way I can tell the spirit my spirit's in them and on them is because they're extravagantly generous that's how I can tell that's how I can tell today's salvation has come into this house it's as if God says they get it and King David rejoiced greatly. I think God dances a jig. I think God dances with joy. They get it. They get it. They're giving their life away. They're my kids. Let me close with this question. How do you get a generous heart? I've already answered it. It begins when you give. your heart to God. When you begin then to get your life from God, having entered into an authentic relationship with God, becoming more and more like God, who is, among other things, extravagantly generous. But what if you don't know God? What if you are a Mephibosheth? And I would be surprised if there weren't a few Mephibosheths among us this morning. You've been living in a faraway place cut off from the king. You've heard some rumors about the king. Some say he's good, some say he's not. Some say he doesn't even exist. He's been so far away from me. You don't know his heart. You've never heard his voice. I'm going to say something again that might make you feel a little weird, but I'm just going to stand as someone who is before you that I honestly can say, but I know his heart. I know the king's heart. And I have heard his voice. And again, you may be sitting next to somebody who knows the king's heart and knows his voice. And I know his voice so well, I know for sure what he's saying to you today. And I don't know how to make you hear it, but this is what he is saying to you, Mephibosheth. Don't be afraid. I will show kindness to you. My intentions, I will restore you. I now invite you to my table. I will include you in my family so come and eat the bread and drink the wine and you will come to life today I'd like us to pray as we close just everybody bow their head and close their eyes just out of respect for what God may be doing among us and then I'm going to pray in just a moment. But I just want to speak to whoever is here who may be in Mephibosheth among us. First thing I want to say to you is there's just nothing I'm going to do to embarrass you. There's nothing I'm going to do to... It's just not the intention here. I'm not going to single you out. I just want to tell you some things. If you've been living far away from the king and you don't know his heart and you've never heard his voice but something's getting through this morning and it sounds like truth and maybe you'd like to come to the table where the bread is and where the wine is and where the king is and become part of this family a couple things that you can do in just a few moments we're going to dismiss and there's going to be some men and women surrounding this platform we'll just be standing here and you can come and you can talk to them and they would love to tell you how to come to the table how to come to the king and how Jesus made a way for you to do it. But you know what's even easier than that? Some of you came with a friend who knows the heart of the King. You're sitting right next to somebody. And I just want to so encourage you, press you, call you. If you want to know how to come to the table, just at the end of this, just kind of look at him and just go, I'd like to know more. Bring it up at lunch. It's not that hard to do. In some ways, all you need to do is want to do it. Accept the invitation. Show up. Say, God, here I am. I want to be your son. I want to be your daughter. My ankles are broken and I can't walk. And I want to come into the fullness of who you've made me to be as a human being. And he'll do better than that. He'll make you a son. He'll make you a daughter. He'll set you at his table. Holy Spirit of God, I pray for the Mephibosheths among us that they would hear something far beyond my human voice, that they would hear your voice that is saying down the corridors of history the same thing. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. I want you at my table. Just come. I pray for those Mephibosheths to have the courage, the strength to come, and if they're too crippled to come, that they'd poke their friend who will carry him to you. and Father I pray for the rest of us who do know your heart and we've heard your voice but some of us have wandered away too and this issue of generosity this generous thing is just dried up in us so I'm not even going to pray for generosity first I'm just going to pray for a visitation of gratitude of remembering that we had a debt we couldn't pay and Jesus gave everything he had. May we be people more and more in this journey of the heart who reflect your very heart of among other things extravagant generosity. And all God's people said, Amen. The prayer team will be here to meet anybody who needs prayer for anything.
