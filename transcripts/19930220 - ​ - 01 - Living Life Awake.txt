Hi, I'm Carolyn, and I'm glad to be here today. And you guys look really relaxed. It's like, wait a minute, I'm giving the talk, and I'm back there working on my notes, and you guys are getting the massage. This does not make sense. I really wasn't nervous about this talk. This is something I've cared a lot about for a long time. If I can get this done. I've thought a lot about this topic for years. It's really important to me. but last night I wasn't nervous until last night and last night my mom flew into town about a week ago and that was great I was supposed to be traveling this week and I didn't but she was going to be there to help out and then Thursday night my dad came into town so he's there and then night before last my brother from northern Minnesota called and asked if he and his wife and their three kids and their dog who's kind of strange could come to town too and stay at our house so we had this house full of people So last night I thought, I really need to work on this talk. I mean, I'd started it before last night, but I thought I should work on it. So I went out to McDonald's, and I thought, well, I'll just work on the morning talk, and I'll go over this. I'll give myself an hour and go over it. While I was working at McDonald's, I was eating my ice cream cone, and about after 50 minutes, I'm done with it. I wasn't just done with this morning's talk. I was done with both talks. I'd gone through the whole thing. I thought, geez, I've got all this material, and I go through it in 50 minutes. So I went home, and my husband said, talk slowly. You guys know my husband Michael talks slowly And that's when he's nervous he talks like that So I thought easy for you to say What I want to talk about today is living life awake I believe that for most Christian women We've got a lot of problems living life Living life fully, life that feels abundant I believe that for most of us the problem is not that we lack a love for our God. I don't believe it's that we lack devotion to our Savior. I don't think it's that we need more discipline. I don't think it's that we need more commitment. I see some of my friends here. And you know something? I know something about those friends. I know something about me. I know something about my sister-in-laws, who I love dearly, and I've heard them talk about their love for God. You know what I know about them? They love God from their toes. It's from their toes. They love him passionately. They might be disappointed in where they are as women. They might be disappointed in where they are as individuals. But they love their God. When you talk to them about God, and you ask them how dear Jesus is to them, they weep. They weep. It's not a question of how much we love God. We love God. Sometimes it seems like there's only a few dying embers there left of the love for God. Sometimes they need to close in the walls and protect themselves. And sometimes it doesn't look like abundant living. And sometimes it doesn't look like they're more than conquerors. But they love God and they've closed the walls because they don't want those last embers to go out. Do you ever know what that feels like? Those embers are so important, and God's more important than anything. and you just have to shut out the walls in case a wind comes along. And it doesn't look that great, but you love him. And I know their embers are hot. It's not about loving God. And when people go towards my friends and go towards my sister-in-laws and urge them to love God more or have more devotion or get more committed, I want to scream at them. That isn't what it's about. What I do know is they might have a misunderstanding about what it is to live this life. I do know they believe some lies about who they are as women, who they can be as women, who they are as individuals and who they have any potential to become as individuals, how this life is supposed to be lived, what a treasure they are, and what incredible resources are available to them, what abundant life God called them to. I know that's true. I earnestly believe that the way that Satan normally works in our lives is not the bad things that happen to us or the sad things or the hard things. He might have something to do with that. I don't know. It doesn't seem important to me. It might be important, but it doesn't seem important to me. The way that I believe that Satan primarily works in our lives is that he tells us lies. He gets us to believe the lie, and then he robs us of the knowledge of who we are as women. I'm not supposed to do that. Who we are as women, who we are as individuals, and what this life is all about. He lies, he gets us to believe the lie, and then he robs us. That's how I think Satan primarily works. He lies to us about who we are as women. We hear it from everywhere. It probably started in your family. You probably heard it at school. It got repeated at church. You'll hear it in the media. You'll hear it from your friends. We'll reinforce it to each other. We'll tell each other lies about who we are as women, what we have any possibility of growing up into, who we could become, what kind of power lies in this female person. We've told each other lies, and we've believed the lies, and we've realized that we can't go on. We can't go any further than that. And we've been robbed of a knowledge there's power in knowledge we need to know that we've been robbed of the knowledge of who we are who we can become and we've been robbed of some of the tools that we need to be able to go out and live this life as more than conquerors we've been lied to about who we are as individuals it probably too started in our families it was not always with bad intent we need to know that if we're just looking for the bad guys out there who lied to us we're never going to see the lies a lot of times it was people who loved us and they believed the lies. That's why they told them to us. But we've been lied to about who we are as individuals. You know how that goes? It goes, who I am, I might be different, but the things that are different about me aren't that neat. But now Sue over there, do you see what's different about her? That's neat. Now if I could only be more like Sue, I'd be neat. I'm not that special. I might be a little different, but the different part is the bad part. So don't embrace it. I've been told lies about me from my family, from me. I've told myself lies. I've said I wasn't acceptable. I've heard it at school. I've heard it at church. I'll get it from the media. That what is valuable and what is good is something out there. And I just need to conform to that. Be less me, be more like that. I believed the lie, and I got robbed of the knowledge of who I was and the tools that would make me be able to live this life. I also got lied to about what life was about. You know something funny? I thought life was supposed to be easy and fulfilling. Who told me that lie? It's a lie. Life sometimes is fulfilling. It is never easy. But I received that lie, and I based all of my decisions and my perceptions on that lie. Guess what? Life was always frustrating, always disappointing, very unfulfilling. I had other lies told me about life. But I heard the lies. The lies got repeated. Gradually, I started to believe the lies. And because I believed those lies, I was robbed of the knowledge of what it was to live. And then I lost the power to gain access to those tools that would let me live as more than a conqueror, to live life as an adventure. So we've had lies come at us, and the lies have robbed us. The battleground is for truth. The battleground is about regaining ground that we've lost. We gave away ground. It wasn't all stolen from us. We've had some of it stolen, but we also gave it away. I've given away ground that I had, and I just handed it to someone else for whatever reasons. Maybe I didn't want to be responsible. But we've lost ground, and the battleground is to go on to this truth and gain back the truth about who we are as women, who we can be as individuals, who we are. as individuals, and then what life is supposed to be like, and how we go about living this life. I know we're all at different points in our lives. The friends that I see here, I know they're at different points. And those of you who I don't know, I know that you've gone through different points in your life before you got a new life. I know that there were different lies that you believed and maybe some truth you regained. We're all at different points. We've got different points of power and lack of power. but I know one thing I know we all fall short of the stature we regained by Christ's death I know none of us have taken back all the joy that Christ regained when he died for us and resurrected I know that none of us have access to all the peace that we were given I know that none of us has the personal power that we were given as new creations children of God renewed creations. I know none of us have access to the personal power that Jesus spent his life in coming down here, went through all that he went through, resurrected to give us back, and we haven't taken it. I know that about us. You might be at a different point than I am, but I know that about you. I came out of the background where some of this and some of the lies were more blatant. When I was in recovery, or whoever gets out of recovery, but I've been going through all this, all this stuff looked really subtle. It was like, maybe you won't see this, but this is what it was. My husband's going, you call this subtle? And I look back, and it wasn't subtle. It was very blatant. The lies that you were told or the misperceptions you had about life might not have been as blatant as they were for me. You know one of the lies the enemy gave me was that I was the only one who heard this kind of lie. because the lies were so big for me I was raised in a really conservative church the lies that I heard were so big that I got this screwed up because of those lies and these people didn't hear lies like that that's a lie you guys heard lies too didn't you okay we all heard lies you heard different lies than I heard you believed some you didn't believe others but we're all damaged by lies maybe your lies weren't as blatant that would be great but they were all there I know friends who come from other subcultures I've heard people tell their story the lies were all out there what I want to do today is step out together as women do you hear that? step out together as women you might have a neat ring not step out to do some little thing but to step out together as women to do something powerful to regain some lost territory, to say this was our land and we're taking it back. Let's step out together today as women and together say, confront those lies with truth. To confront fear and say we don't want part of it. God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind. That's our God and that's what he says to us, not the fear part. And let's take back the powers which he provided for us, which will make us more than conquerors. I have a few verses that have meant a lot to me on this journey of mine. I'm not adding them to give authenticity to my talk. My talk is authenticity without that. God's been through this talk. It's anointed with his truth and his love and his enlightenment. But you know what? There's a lot of power in his word. And these truths I have held on to, it's like I'm dragging in the dirt, but I got the end of the rope, and I'm not going to let it go. These have had a lot of power for me, and I think we can get a lot of power and a lot of comfort when we're dying on the vine and say, God, I'm holding on to this. You promised this, and I'm going to believe you. I don't look real good down here, but I'm going to believe you that you're going to keep that promise. I'd like to share those verses. I press on that I may lay hold of that for which Christ has laid hold of me I go running it's one of the joys that I have and when I run I always say that verse I press on that I may lay hold of that for which Christ has laid hold of me he laid hold of me for a purpose and I'm going to hang on to that rope that I can lay hold of that for which Christ has laid hold of me. Do not be conformed to this world, but get transformed. How? By the renewing of your mind. Make it new again. By the renewing of your mind. That you might know what is good, that you can know what is acceptable, that you can know what is the perfect will of God. Now, it's high time to wake out of your sleep. Now your salvation is nearer than when we first believed. Let's no longer be children, tossed to and fro, and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness by which they wait to deceive, but speaking the truth in love, that we may grow up into all things, who is the head, Christ. Stand fast, therefore, and the liberty by which Christ has made us free. Don't become entangled again with the yoke of bondage. Let's pray for a minute. God, we come to you, daughters of the kingdom. I thank you that you look at us and you have an open embrace. I ask in Jesus' name, you give us eyes to see what you have to see for us to see. Give us ears to hear truth, God. Ask you to anoint this place with your spirit of freedom. And we take your word and claim this power. And quote Paul, I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to us the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of you. I pray that the eyes of our understanding be enlightened, that we may know what's the hope of your calling, what are the riches of the glory of your inheritance in the saints, your daughters, and what is the exceeding greatness of your power to us who believe, according to the working of your mighty power. Amen. Okay, the topic is living awake. I'm discovering what it is that keeps a woman asleep. Like I said, I've thought in these terms for 15, 20 years. It used to haunt me. I mean, as a 15-year-old, I must have been a frustrating 15-year-old to be around because this drove me crazy. I couldn't understand where there were no women that seemed awake. I'd look and I'd look and it's like they'd look awake. Nope, they're asleep. And I just keep looking and no one seemed awake. And I'd look at men and they're awake and they're doing things and they're passionate about things. And the women were asleep. What keeps women asleep? And I thought, well, for me, I've thought in these terms for a long time. These terms are dear to me. They've got a lot of history. But for you, it might be you've thought about these things, but you've thought in really different terms. Or it might be that this hasn't been an area that you've thought a lot about. You've had passion about a lot of other things. So I wanted to define this term, and I thought, well, what would be like some diagnostic questions to find if a woman's asleep or not? And I thought, what was true of me? And I've got several questions. Do I wait for someone to come rescue me? When I get in trouble, do I want someone to rescue me? Do I value others' opinions more than my own? Do I value others' lives more than my own? I didn't have this in my notes, but a scary thing happened to me. When I was pregnant, I found I was taking really good care of my body. I got better nutrition, all the other things, way better, while I was carrying that baby. You know why? I had this valuable life inside of me. Then I had the baby and went back. It's like, you still have a valuable life inside of you. Funny thing. Do you value other people's lives more than your own? Do I have trouble knowing what I really believe? Do I have trouble expressing what it is that I truly have passion for? Do I not know what I have passion for? Do I spend more time living by rules rather than living my life? Does my life look too much like everyone else's? Ever feel that? Do I have a sense that how I live is not truly alive? Do I base choices on how it will look to others? There's a lot of other things that I'll show you. I mean, I could just go on and on. But there are two options. For a lot of you, I think you'll recognize parts yourself in those questions. For others, if you don't recognize yourself in any of that, there's two alternatives. One thing is, you might have escaped it. I don't know how, but you might have escaped it. There are lies all out there. They start when you're two, and they just keep coming at you and coming at you, and they're from everywhere. They're from everywhere. And somehow, you might have escaped the lies and the power and what they do to you. The other alternative is that it might be that you've been living passively for so long that you don't even remember what it was to live alive. Like the poor person who's done without for so long, who's been robbed from so long, they don't even know they're poor. So hang in with me if this feels like it doesn't fit and just consider these things. Most of us have believed lies. We've submitted to fears. We've accepted a passive role in our own lives. I was in a group this summer with several women who were looking at some family issues. And one of the things, a statement that came to me about myself was that for a number of years, I'd been a passive participant in my own life. What a scary thing. There were many sources, and like I said, they weren't all bad people. A lot of times there were people who loved us, people who thought they were nurturing us. like a mother who's giving her child bad food. She thinks she's nurturing the child. She might be poisoning the child. That's what happened. Lies to me are like inaccuracies on a map. We're on a journey. It's not going to be a short journey. You really need a map. We're going to be on this one for years. The more lies we have, when we get a lie, we put it on our map. I put Detroit and San Francisco. It's probably not going to be that important. I'm probably never going to go to San Francisco. And who wants to go to Detroit? Okay, I get another lie. I'm sorry, is anyone from Detroit? You know what I mean then. Okay, so we start adding different bad pieces of information. Then someone takes a legend that says this is how big 10 miles is, and they add a zero. That's 100 miles. Maybe not that important. Whoever measures that anyways, you know, and your fingers kind of get lost anyways. okay the more lies you bring in our maps start getting real inaccurate you need to know where you're going you need to know how long it's going to take to get there you need to know the dangerous roads you need to know the safe roads you need to know that your navigational equipment's working and if you've got the whole thing embedded with lies you can't trust anything and you're just going to think well this feels right you know what living's like when it just feels right you're probably not headed in the right direction you're probably going to end up in Kansas who wants to go to Kansas okay there's lies that keep us asleep some of the lies there's lies about women there's lies about us as individuals there's lies about life there's thousands of lies out there but I just want to look at a few of the lies about us as women lies we believe about us as women some of the sources there's some real blatant sources and then there's some innocuous sources that you'd say oh it's not really going to matter that much I want to look at those first okay let's start out with the fairy tales we were told when we went to bed okay here's me at you know three years old I say mommy tell me a story what story do you want to hear I want to hear about Snow White okay this story is about this girl she's kind and she's wonderful and she's beautiful okay what happens to Snow White okay there's this jealous woman who's going to betray her and so what does Snow White do because she's got this woman coming after her how does she take care of herself she runs away she runs to the woods okay once she runs to the woods does she have anyone who helps her out yeah a bunch of little old men okay do the men keep her safe well, kind of, but then after a while, this crafty, evil, ugly woman can come and get her. What happens? She goes to sleep. Does she have any way of getting herself okay, getting herself out of the problem? No. One way. A man will kiss her while she's asleep. They won't have a relationship. He doesn't get to know her and he decides, I really like this girl. She's got a great personality. What a character. She's got vision. He sees Snow laying there and he kisses her. And then what happens? She lives happily ever after. Okay. You know, that's just a fairy tale. Okay, the next night. Mom, will you tell me a bedtime story? Okay, I've got another one. It's called Sleeping Beauty. Okay, Sleeping Beauty. We've got a girl who's with her mom and dad, but there's another jealous woman. Okay, that's who's going to betray her. What do they do to take care of this girl? They have her hide. She hides out. Who takes care of her? Some supernatural creatures. She's got some fairies to take care of her. What happens then, though? Is she safe? No. The bad woman finally gets at her. What happens? She goes to sleep. I told you this is a big thing. She goes to sleep. And then what saves her? A man. He comes and kisses her. And she wakes up and she lives happily ever after. It's Thursday night. Bear with me. Cinderella. Mom, tell me about Cinderella. This is a good one. Okay, there's this beautiful girl. Her dad keeps her safe. The dad dies. He can no longer protect her. So then what happens? There's a bad woman. She's ugly too, by the way, and she's got two ugly daughters. There's kind of a theme to this. Okay, she's got two ugly daughters. what happens? She has a horrible life. Does she have any way of defending herself? No. Who takes care of her? A supernatural creature. Very godmother. Gives her a pretty dress and all that kind of stuff. She goes. Does she have any way of pursuing this? Taking care of herself? No. What saves her? The prince finds her. And he marries her. She lives happily ever after. It's not just the old stories. These stories are not harmless. They're still happening today. You say, well, those are those stories, and we all know when we hear them, that's just Cinderella, that's just Sleeping Beauty. It's still happening. Does anyone have Little Mermaid? Think about this. Okay, we've got another victim who is willing to give up her gift so she can get a chance to get a guy. She's got this wonderful gift. She gives it away to who? A jealous woman. An ugly woman. Okay, then what happens? She's told she can break the spell. She could get her gift back. How would it be? She has to get the guy to kiss her without talking to him. Seduction with no relationship. Sound familiar? Okay, then what happens? She seduces him. He falls in love with her, and she's saved. Who saves her? Her dad and the prince. She lives happily ever after. What lessons could we learn from these tales? Even last Saturday morning, I'm sitting, I'm listening to, my kids are watching James Bond Jr. Have you heard the song on James Bond Jr.? It's like this guy, I'm not going to sing it for you, but it's this guy, and he goes on adventures, strives for justice while he's rescuing the girl. I mean, this guy is incredible. I mean, he's going out, doing these wonderful justice things, He's having adventure, and in his free time, he rescues the girl. The girl can't even rescue herself. I mean, she doesn't have a mind for justice and adventure, but she can't even rescue herself. It's all over the place. What lessons could we learn? One, girls seem to become victims of some regularity. Beautiful girls tend to be kind. Evil women are ugly. Women are in trouble if there's no man around. They seem to have no ability to rescue themselves. Women's troubles will be over if they can find a handsome prince. Physical beauty is what it takes to attract a man. And passivity works. Some of you will doubt that these harmless little fairy tales have any effect. You think that as a child you realized that it was just the fairy tale and you didn't really believe it? Well, maybe you were a very astute child. But explain to me why we have so many women today walking around as victims who have no way of knowing how to rescue themselves, who think that if they can just find the right man, they'll be okay, who look at other women as the enemy, who think if they're beautiful enough, they'll attract men. If they're ugly, there's something wrong with them. Why do we have all those beliefs out there? We have a society full of women who fell for the romance fantasy. We heard it and we fell for it. It's not true. They think that all they need to do is to hold out until some handsome prince or some knight comes along and kisses them to wake him out of their slumber. Somebody's going to have to get the word out that a kiss from a prince isn't going to be able to wake him from their slumber. Even if they do marry the prince, the troubles aren't over. They're just going to have new troubles. Men aren't the answer to our problems. They might make a nice diversion. They can be wonderful companions. But it was never supposed to be their job to make us happy, and they have no idea how to make us happy. Do you agree with that? We can enjoy men a lot more if we're able to enjoy them for who they are and not for what they do for us. But even that isn't our job. Even that isn't our job, to enjoy our guys and not make them feel too pressured about making our life happy. My primary job is to live awake, to live free, and to be alive. Whatever else, that's my job. It's time to leave the fairy tales behind. It's time to think about it before we read it to our daughters, to our sisters, or to any other girls who are listening. They are not harmless. What would it look like if we had a room full of women who did believe the fairy tales? I think it would look pretty familiar. That's just one of the ways that we get lied to. That's one of the innocuous ways. Subtle. There's other ways. What other lies are out there? Where are the other sources? One of the sources that's more obvious is our cultural customs, like our North American way of doing things. There are customs that we adapted to as children that impacted how we viewed ourselves as part of a female gender. To me, I found it helpful to identify these customs and to look at them in light and to find out the source of them. It's easier for me to confront a lie with truth if I know how stupid the source of the lie was. So that's what I do. Okay, when I was a little girl, I was in grammar school, and we'd get recess time, and all the kids would run out of the building, we'd go to the playground, and we'd got swings and slides and jungle gyms and monkey bars and teeter-totters, all this stuff. So, everything's great. There's one difference. The boys are dressed for the occasion. I'm 30-something, 38. And so I grew up, until I was in high school, we had a dress code. Girls wear skirts or dresses. the boys had shirts and jackets and pants and play shoes and they were all ready and they went out I'd have on a skirt or a dress have you ever tried to go across some monkey bars in a skirt and have boys below you and they would say I see London, I see France I see Carolyn's underpants I stopped going on monkey bars and so did a lot of my friends early lessons in passivity early lessons in knowing what my place was as a girl. It might not seem that important, but they're little lessons. There's a cumulative effect here. My girlfriend and I, Joanne, in fourth grade, decided we could go against the system. We really liked doing gymnastics on the slide and stuff like that. So we started wearing ski pants. We were in style with little stirrups, and we started wearing ski pants under a skirt. We thought, great, we found a solution. Guess what the school did? They made a rule against wearing ski pants under your skirts. Another little reinforcement. It's not a big deal. It was another reinforcement. You know something about me? I love sports. I lost it a long time ago. I'm recapturing it. I love sports. They robbed it from me. I was told it wasn't for me. And I believed it. And I'm starting to capture back things in me that I don't remember since I was nine. There's a cost in all of this. Our daughters now have the option of wearing more appropriate clothes. I'm thrilled. But there are other customs that are out there to rob our daughters. Sometimes because our customs were even more blatant. I mean, those things are so obvious now. You look and you go, you know, who was thinking? Who was the stupid person that made that rule? But there are other things out there that are going to be limiting our daughters. One thing, there's studies that have been done, and it shows that school curriculum much more reinforces male intelligence. There's seven kinds of intelligence. It reinforces male intelligence. We have bright girls in our school systems who feel they are not smart because school is not oriented to measure that kind of intelligence. They're getting restricted. They're being pushed back. They're not allowed to excel in the areas that they excel. we're told this is how you excel it's linear thinking maybe some of us have that, great some of us don't there are repercussions of this what about church how did we misperceive what it was to be female one of my favorite songs that I have I mean a lot of the old hymns, I love some of the old hymns but my favorite hymn, and we sing it in open door is Be Thou My Vision Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart, not they else to me, save that thou art. What an incredible thing. I could hold on to that one song, and that would be it for me. And I can sing with tears coming from my eyes, Thou my true father, and I thy true son. Guess what? I'm not a son. Now, this is the kind of thing that people say, well, you know, it doesn't matter that much. We all know what it means. You know, you're God's child, it's son. We have to use a gender. It's a cumulative thing. I'm his son. I'm not his son. I'm a woman. Think of a 16-year-old in our church, a 16-year-old guy singing there, and he's singing, Be Thou My Vision. And he's singing with tears in his eyes, Thou my true father, and I thy true daughter. Does that seem weird? It's weird. and you know sometimes just for me I sing the right word because I need to remember that God values me that I'm a female I don't have to be a male for him to value me thou my true father and I thy true daughter that fits for me and I'm okay if we say those words different sometimes that's okay I need to remind myself though not rob myself of realizing what a beauty it is to be a woman and that God doesn't wish I was a man that's not in his heart he's thrilled that I'm a woman I'm his true daughter another thing that happens you know I get hurt too or saddened when people minimize this and it's like well you know that's kind of a women's lib kind of thing or feminist kind of thing it doesn't feel like that to me and it feels a lot when women minimize sexual harassment I know some women are flattered by sexual harassment but it's inappropriate And I think just because this has not been something that might affect someone or hurt someone, I think we need to respect the fact that there's some damage being done. It's just subtle. This isn't one of the big areas. If I was going to crusade on this, I would not work on the hymns. I'm just saying, there's this little effect. Another thing that happens in songs at church is our echo songs. We used to do this a lot as teenagers, you know, high school, junior high, and all that. Echo songs. Who says the truth? The men. Who echoes it? The women. They say the true thing. They say the real thing, and we say it again. They say the true thing. They hear from God. We say the same thing. You know what? This is not a big deal, but you know what? Whenever there's an echo song, I sing with the men. I do. It's not to make a big deal of it. But I hear truth from God, and I can say it. I don't need to echo what they heard. They hear great things. That's wonderful. But I hear great things from him, too. And I don't need to be an echo of what they heard. If I'm only an echo, I will not be my own voice. We will have lost a voice. We need to hear from the women. They are not the men's echo. We have lost an enormous part of the body of Christ because we're willing to be an echo, and we're doing the men a disservice and our children a disservice, and we're robbing ourselves of our life. I feel kind of strongly about that in our Christian culture my introduction to what I could expect to be as a Christian woman was Mother's Day sermons and I would listen to some rigid thinking man who was very well meaning and who I probably loved and cared about and he would tell me what a wonderful thing it was as he looked out into these women that they were such wonderful helpmates. Helpmate. Think about this. Helpmate. That's who you are. How does that feel? Are you single? How does it feel to be a helpmate? I guess you're kind of without a job. Okay? What if you're divorced? Helpmate. Okay? I didn't do a very good job. I'm a failure. Helpmate. My husband's died. I don't have anything else to do. as a woman with husband, help mate. That's my job. Michael's doing a good job at living his life. My job is to help Michael live his life. He's doing his life. I think he'd like me to do my life. I think he'd like to come home and find someone who's living their life. I don't think help mate is what it's about. There's some wonderful things it is about. This is just one more of the ways that we got lied to. And I think even more damage sometimes was done, when it was done by people we loved? Because it's so much harder when you're looking at a man that you respect, you grew up under, you know his wife, you know his kids, and he's saying these things and it's like I don't want to be critical. Jeez, okay, help me. That is a wonderful thing. God would be honored. God's not honored. We're sacrificing our identity to try to support something over here. That's not what it's about. I think if we're married, I think our spouses would like companions. I think it works really good if you stand side by side, and you look ahead and you talk to each other about your journey, and you wish them well as they're going out on their day, and they wish you well on your day. But it's not about me waiting for his life. It's about going out and living life. How else did we misperceive what it was to be a woman? Let's talk about puberty. I felt this was an important thing to address. Not that it's a real fun thing to address, but I think it had an impact. I think, and this, for me it had a very, puberty was a real strong point that it's like, I remember me before puberty, and I don't remember me showing up very much once it set on. Okay, me at 11. I'll let you see me at 11. I didn't wear a bra, and I loved it. I got to play all the time. I had no desire to ever become a woman. It had no appeal to me. Okay. There's a lot of things that happen at puberty. There's changing moods. You're changing skin. All these things are coming on at you. But you know what? For the boys, there's a lot of positive things that happen. They're getting taller. Their shoulders are getting broader. Their voices are deepening. They're sounding like their dads. All kinds of things that have positive connotations. The Jewish culture celebrates boys becoming men. They take a 13-year-old boy and they throw the bar mitzvah and they celebrate. Think about it. A 13-year-old boy. Think about a 13-year-old boy you know. Does it look much like a man? No, it doesn't. But you know what? They celebrated the fact that this boy was becoming a man. They celebrated. It was a wonder, and it is a wonder. They should have celebrated. What about the girls? Don't celebrate it for the girls. Go back to me at 11 years old. I was free. I was still me. at 12. So, we've got a problem. I started developing. What happened when I started going through puberty? I needed a bra. To me, it felt like an identification mark. I loved it under my shirts that I had this for my T-shirt. It said that I was a girl and I didn't want to get the strap. Why? I don't know. It identified me as a target, I felt. I got a teen girdle to hold up my nailings. See, I'm dating myself with some of you because I don't even think we had pantyhose in because I had those stockings that went like this. And then I got this teen girdle that it came down to here, and you had to hook it on, you had these marks all over your legs. And it was holding your stomach in and holding your bottom in. A 12-year-old girl. How many 12-year-old girls do you know who need their stomachs pulled in and their bottoms pulled in? I didn't, but that's what it was there for, and I knew it. Okay, I got my period. They told me it was called the curse. That was good news. I found out that I need makeup to make my eyes look bluer. I needed mascara to make my eyelashes look blacker. I needed blush to make my cheeks look pinker. I needed a perm because my hair was too straight. My friends straightened their hair because their hair was too curly. In TV, it said I needed Tab and Fresca so I wouldn't get fat. In magazine ads, the models for boys would look pretty much like the guys that I knew. You know, they're pretty trim, pretty average looking. The female models also looked a lot like the boys that I knew. None of us look very much. Remember Twiggy? None of us look very much like those bottles after we entered adolescence. There wasn't a lot to celebrate here. A lot of things I know have changed since we were adolescents. And I'm kind of pulling you guys into my category, but that's okay. But some things haven't changed. High school girls still spend three days getting ready for the high school dance. They don't do it learning to be clever. They don't do it reading. They do it so they can look pretty. some things haven't changed. They do it different. There wasn't much celebrating. And what about for survivors of sexual abuse? They now had some physical characteristics that made them an even more visible target for men who would not respect their boundaries. A lot of women, for some, after years of being ignored by their dads and brothers, they started getting noticed for the worst possible reasons. There's not much to embrace, not much to celebrate. And if I was to believe TV, I was soon to become ready to be able to get my wash cleaner with Tide, get rid of those embarrassing rings around the collar, disinfect my house so I'd have no household orders, take care of midriff bulge, and bear children for some successful man who wouldn't be caught dead doing any of these things? Why would we ever want to embrace becoming women? The prospects didn't look real good. How else was my view of life affected? What other lies have we believed? What are the sources of these? Other women in our lives and heroes that we had. I'd like you to think for a minute. Think back. who were your heroes when you were growing up? Not just the women that you wanted to look like or all that. Who stirred your spirit? Who made you cry and think, I want to be like her when I grow up? Or was your spirit even alive at that point? That's okay. Did anyone stir your spirit? You know what? Almost all of mine were men. I talked to my friends, and almost all of theirs were men. the people that I saw out there living life they were men the people who were doing anything passionately holding on to justice, doing adventure climbing the mountains, they were men and the women were safe at home making a nice cozy home base and they said they were fulfilled and I didn't think I could be what or would it even have an effect if all the girls, heroes were men what would it look like I had three exceptions that I found along the way that I could usher into my Hall of Fame. But they all seemed to pay a really high price for the status that they got. The first name is Elizabeth Elliott. This woman lived with passion. She loved truth, and she lived valiantly. She still is living. she paid a price her husband was massacred by a tribe of Indians in South America she and her daughter lived in the jungle for years she married again, her husband died of cancer she paid a very high price I felt God when I heard her talk she stirred my spirit and I loved her for that and I owe Elizabeth Elliot a debt but she paid a very high price for it in school I learned about a woman named Sojourner Truth. She was an African-American woman. She'd been a slave, and she stood up and at the risk of her life said the truth in what slavery was doing. She said it brilliantly and clearly and stood for justice. How did she get to be like that? How did she get so brave? How did she get so spirited? She survived slavery. Who knows what she had to survive. The third woman that stirred my spirit, her name was Dr. Helen Rosevere. I heard her at a conference. And it was kind of like, do you ever have that feeling like, you know, I talked about Elizabeth and Mary. And when Mary walked in the room, Elizabeth, she said the baby in her leaped. She had a spirit leap kind of thing. That's how I felt around when I heard about these women. My spirit leapt. It's like, a woman, she's alive. Dr. Helen Rosevere. She was a physician, and she was a woman of courage, a woman who loved truth, and she lived passionately. Dr. Helen Rosevear went to Africa, and she was kidnapped and gang-raped as a virgin by some African soldiers. She paid a very high price. She survived it, but she paid a high price. One thing, too, I just want to step away for a second. I feel really strongly about these things. They seem really important to me. It feels like life and death, and I might tear up or cry. I want you to know I'm okay with that. Sometimes I get frustrated because it's like I hear men talk about really important things and they don't cry about it. That's their problem. I'm a woman, and some of these things I feel very strongly about, and I might cry. And it'll take me a little bit to recover. I'm okay with that. I've brought napkins and everything up here. But that's part of who I am. And if I'm going to talk about these things that are important and know how much pain I've gone through and how much you've gone through and how much some of my sisters have gone through, I might cry about it. But let's be okay with that. The women seemed strong. They seemed to talk and walk with God. And they paid an incredible price. It made me fearful of God. I thought that if I were to walk like that and to embrace God like that, I thought I would probably lose a husband if I ever had one. I would probably lose my children. I believed it. I believed it, and I went after God. And every time my husband was home late, I knew what had happened. I lost him. That was part of the price. But I loved God, and I couldn't imagine not going after him hard. That was a lie. the men seemed to gain access easier Eric Little, the guy from Chariots of Fire, he was in my Hall of Fame I thought he was great, I know he died on the mission field, he didn't have to do that to get into my Hall of Fame what he had to do to get into my Hall of Fame was the fact that this guy knew that when God made him he made him fast and he knew he was supposed to go to the mission field and he knew that's what he had a heart for but he knew that when God made him, he made him run. He made him fast. And when he ran, he felt God's presence. And I love that guy. And I said, you're my hero. You know who you are. You listen to God. You didn't listen to what they said. He made you run, and you ran, and he made you fast, and you felt his presence. They seemed to get in pretty easy. I had a lot of other men who were in there. I'm not going to mention them. but do you think it would have an effect for a young girl if almost all of her heroes were men what was the lie the lie was that God has a higher standard for women and that to get to be one of his chosen people I was going to have to go through a lot way more than a man ever would what's the truth I'm not sure what I think is the truth is that few women have boldly pursued God. I don't know why. I don't know why. Maybe we've done it quietly. And the great crowd of witnesses that it talks about in Hebrews, is it? I'm going to find out who was up there. And I believe there's women up there. But I think there are a few women who boldly pursued God and held on to him. And when he called for passion, they lived passionately. And when he called for boldness, they lived boldly. And I don't know if they thought maybe it wasn't feminine. I think it's really feminine to live boldly. I think it's really feminine to live passionately. It just doesn't look like what maybe we thought it looked like. But it isn't a truth that God has a higher standard for us. He wants me in that inner sanctum just as much as any other man. And he's not going to demand more from me. And if my husband dies, I'm not going to believe that it was God who took him. I refuse to believe that lie, even if circumstances all point to it. It is a lie. And I'm going to confront lies with truth. My God loves me. He's for me. It saddens me, too, when women who succeed begin to emulate men. I work in corporate America. I work around a lot of very successful women. I'm not one of them, but I work around them. No, I'm successful. I just have my own definition. Now, I work around a lot of very successful women. Many of the women who achieve, though, begin to address and carry themselves more like men. I don't know why they do it. In a way, I do know I think it's partly for protection. They want to be able to keep achieving, and they're afraid if it's noticed that they're women, they won't keep going up. I also think they believe a lie that says it isn't strong to be feminine. That's a lie. It's strong to be feminine. It's different than masculine, but it's very strong to be feminine. I was worried about not having enough material. I'm in trouble. I've got way too much. Okay. Michael is right. You just need to talk slower. Okay. One more thing and then I'll let us have a break. What keeps women asleep? We know there's a lot of lies about women. Just who we think we can become is women. Okay, we're restricted by becoming women because that's all you can be. There's also other lies out there. It's the lies we believe about ourselves individually. The biggest lie is we don't know what a treasure we are. You know what I know about each one of you? You're a treasure. God made you unique. You're a treasure. but you don't believe it or you might not believe it as fully as God believes it. Why? There's some lies out there. One thing is we have way too many role expectations. Many of us are never going to find out who we are because we have so many roles that we're trying to fulfill and so many requirements that we've set for ourselves that we're never going to figure out what a wonder we are. I was making a list and I think it's a helpful thing to do about what roles I take in life, I have in life, I'm a daughter to my father, I'm a daughter to my mother, and I've got different expectations on those roles. I'm a sister to my brothers, I'm a sister to my sister-in-laws, I'm a friend, I'm a wife, you might be a girlfriend, I'm a co-worker, I'm an employee of a company, I'm a supervisor over someone else, I'm a house cleaner, I'm a budget keeper, I'm a keeper of the car, I might be on a team, we've got all these roles. Sometimes make a list of these roles, and under each, Start writing a list of expectations that you have of yourself for each of these roles. For many, our lists are long, and we often, without any discrimination, add to that list anything that church, school, society, friends says that we should do to fulfill that role better. We thought it was enough to keep our house clean, then we found out we had to disinfect it too. So we just, okay, disinfect the heart. We thought that was enough. Then they said it has to smell good, so then you start doing carpet fresh, all this stuff. We indiscriminatingly add things to our list that have absolutely no meaning, maybe. It might be good, but it's the indiscriminating part that's important. Men's lists are usually shorter. Okay, I wanted to give an example of a mom's list, a possible mom's list of how to put the kids to bed. Okay, first of all, you have to have a healthy snack. No TV during put-down time. They have to get a bath. They have to get a shampoo. You have to dry their hair, totally. Don't want to get them cold. Brush teeth Go to the bathroom Wash up Put the towels away Flush the toilet Did I say that? Story to each child Listen to each of them tell about their day Clean pajamas Kiss goodnight Prayer On time That's a list of what one's mom's expectations could be for herself for an hour Get tired thinking about it? One hour Dad's list might be a little shorter for many husbands their expectations for the same job would be do not lose any of the children before bedtime and have them all locked up securely before the twins game starts and the wives get mad at the husbands for not doing it right okay if someone said to you you're going to another country you're supposed to be in charge of taking care of these people's kids and they say there are two ways to do this job they give you the wives list or the husbands list and they said you get to pick Which would you choose? We have made choices. We have decided to do it the hard way. We need to remember that. It is okay to do it the hard way. But you need to know you chose to do it the hard way. Embrace the choice. Let it reflect you. Let it be consistent with you. Let how you put your kids to bed. Let how you maintain your car. let how you do your job reflect you let it be your choice of how hard that job is going to be you know that list I gave you that was pretty much my list when I first had kids of how I thought I was supposed to put them to bed that is not how I always put them to bed sometimes I would stay there but that's how I thought that was my list of how I expected to just be a good mom for one hour that's how I had to do it and then Michael would come along and he'd do it really easy and I got really irritated with him because he got to make his own list of how to put kids to bed. I didn't make my list. I was using my mom's list. That's how my mom thought you should get kids put to bed. So you know what I did? I thought, I'm going to make my own list. You know something about my list? It's an awful lot like my mom's. I don't do it like Michael because that isn't how I want to put my kids to bed. But you know what? When I put my kids to bed now and I have some of these routines that I do, it's because I value this. And the values that I have as Carolyn are reflected in the way I put my children to bed. This is reflective of me. This is me living my life. And I'm okay with it. I'm responsible for this choice. I'm not living up to what my mom thought I'm supposed to be or supposed to do and mad at everyone else because they're not obeying someone else's list. This is my list. We need to take responsibility for our choices. And I want to clarify something here. I think it'd be easy to misperceive that for a woman to live awake, there's very traditional women over here, and there's feminists over here, and there's a lot of women in between around either ends. It'd be easy to misperceive that for someone to live life awake, they would look like a feminist. They might, and that would be great. That's how it looks on them. They might also like to bake cookies and homeschool their children and decorate their home. That's how it would look on them. It is not a matter of how it's going to look on you. It's going to look as unique as each one of you are. And you are unique. You might not know it, but you are unique. It's going to look different on each one of you. Your life choices are going to be reflective of you. So it's not going to be a matter of traditional liberal. It's going to be a matter of you making the choice. An awake person can look radical. They can look traditional. What they have in common is that an awake person will not allow another person to steal their life. Hear that? An awake person will not allow another person to steal their life. They will live the life they choose. They will accept the consequences of their choice. The more demanding the expectations we put on each role, we need to realize the less we'll be able to live life with abandon. That's going to have a consequence. If you have really long lists for everything, it's not going to be a real abandoned life. It might be you. It's not going to be abandoned. You need to realize there's that cost too. I need to realize that if I decide that my standards, who I am, is to clean the house and disinfect it and make it smell good, I'm probably not going to be able to meet my girlfriends for lunch very often. if I decide that I want to be an exemplary employee at my office and I take on every single extra project that's available to me and work overtime I might not spend much time in my porch during the artwork that I love there's going to be consequences it's your choice you've got to live the life you choose I think another lie that keeps us from being who we are is we believe there's an ideal standard up there to live up to. And the goal is to become conformed to the ideal. Conformity is never the goal. Please believe that. Conformity is never the goal. Women seem incredibly susceptible to conformity. Look at women's styles. Why do women's fashions change so much? Because women are willing to change. Look at men's fashions. That's why men can keep wearing that white oxford button-down shirt for 20 years, they won't buy it. It's like, why do I need a new outfit? Women fall for it. They buy the new stuff. They say that stuff doesn't work anymore when it's perfectly good. Someone somewhere said and described what the ideal woman would look like. And women have been madly and unsuccessfully chasing that since that time. It was probably a man who said what that woman should look like. Who would know what the ideal woman should look like. You and God can know what you should look like. That's all. You and God. It's a matter of personal revelation. The standard is not out there. Let's contest the precept that there is a standard to live up to. All you need to do is to be true to yourself. That's the standard. The goal should never be to look the same. We don't need to fear uniqueness. We don't need to fear uniqueness, and the goal should never be to look the same. Who are you? Are you a great thinker? Are you a great writer? Are you compassionate? Are you irate? Are you a shopper? Who are you? Do you know? I'd love to know. It's exciting to find out who women are. And each of you are very different. whatever it is I hope you can find it and embrace it because it's you and it should be embraced I've got a sister-in-law who I love her name is Jillian she's in the process of waking up for that I respect her mightily she's paying a cost Jillian is like a wonderful splash of color to me she was raised conservatively and yet she hasn't been able to keep herself within the structures of that she creates beauty wherever she is Jillian wears her hair lopsided, she adds purple she has red toenails, she loves mahogany and linen colorful, she reminds me of Paris Jillian is a movable face that's what she feels like to me wherever Jillian is life seems more colorful to me life seems more exciting I even feel more exciting when I'm with Jillian and that's not me but she has that effect on me what if each of us caught a glimpse and then a picture and then a sure vision of who we are what if we're all that exciting what if we're all that different what a wonderfully rich community we'd be. I think when each of us becomes as unique as God made us to be, each of us will leave a trail, a unique wake behind us. None of the wakes will look the same. When we've been in a place, it might be that scared people feel more safe. It might be that sad people are lightened. It might be that we spread anger behind us, good anger, that says, look at what's happening out there. We can't wait. We have to address it. Maybe it's anger. Maybe in a place where there was no love, there'll be love. Maybe there'll be laughter. Maybe there'll be joy. Each of us, as we go through life, is to leave a wake behind us. What's your wake going to look like? It's not something you have to do. You have to let yourself. I leave awake behind me. It's starting to look more and more like me. It didn't used to look like me. I could give you a list of people that I had set as standards for myself that I thought were cool and I was trying to look like them. And so it kind of looked like a bad version of them. It's starting to look like me. I think of snorkeling in a Caribbean coral reef. God's so creative that he couldn't even stop his creativity when it came to the earth and the sky. Down there in the ocean, where few people would ever go, he went crazy. We've got coral and pink, and we've got weird fish, all different shapes, all different colors. It's spooky, it's exciting, it's sharp, it's dangerous. That's the kind of God we had. I hope we're brave enough to recapture our diversity. If we are the crown of his creation, do you think he got more diverse down there than he did with us? I think we're that diverse. I think we're that exciting. It really could be a celebration. We could stop buying new wardrobes each year. We could stop all going to the same stores. Not all of us would go to the Gap. I'd go to the Gap. The rest of you would go to other stores. Thank you.
