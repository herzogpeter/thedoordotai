Today's scripture reading is Luke 1, 46-55. And Mary said, My soul glorifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God, my Savior, for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on, all generations will call me blessed, for the Mighty One has done great things for me. Holy is his name. His mercy extends to those who fear him from generation to generation. He has performed mighty deeds with his arm. He has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts. He has brought down rulers from their thrones, but has lifted up the humble. He has filled the hungry with good things, but has sent the rich away empty. He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful to Abraham and his descendants forever, just as he promised our ancestors. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you guys. And thanks, you guys. Very good. Actually, quite famous words are those words that were just read and with them, these words filled with exultation and great joy, we enter into this fourth week of Advent. These words, the Song of Mary is what it's known as, also the Magnificat, usher us into this fourth week filled with exultation and great joy. But the Advent theme didn't begin with exultation and great joy. That's not the rhythm of Advent. Advent actually has a beginning and an end. It begins someplace and it's going someplace and where it began is where it's kind of ending or coming to some sense of fulfillment today because the rhythm of Advent begins not with exaltation but with a longing, with a profound sense of ache. And if you've ever been able to access that ache, that something is wrong in your life, in marriage, in your church, in the world, you've entered into the beginning of an Advent reality because the ache is for just that, for things to be different, for things to be better, for things to be made right that are not right in the world. So the cry of Advent in the first week is what the cry of God's people has always been throughout the ages. Restore us, revive us, O God. Make your face to shine upon us, come down to us, and save us is the song you sing at the beginning, the first week of Advent, and that actually was the text we had, Psalm 85, which says all those things, revive us and restore us. But then, almost in response to that longing of the first week of Advent, there comes a voice that marks the second week of Advent, and it's the voice of one crying in the wilderness. And that's another phrase that we're fairly familiar with, because the voice of one crying in the wilderness is indeed John the Baptist. We've heard this story before, and what the voice is saying is this, the restoration you desire and are longing for, the reviving of your soul and you as a people is on the way, but you need to get ready, is what the voice says. So prepare ye the way for the Lord, which is why the second week of Advent comes around and we kind of sit around that one word, repent. Because part of preparing is to turn, to return to God and to your identity as a people, to your mission as a people, and repenting is exactly what they were doing. In verse 5 of Mark chapter 1, when it says that the whole Judean countryside was going out to him, and him, that is the voice, that is John the Baptist, that is who he is, and all of the people of Jerusalem were going out to him and being baptized by him. In the Jordan River, they were confessing their sin, they were turning to God and again, remembering who they were and why they were here. And in the middle of all that, they were getting what they wanted. They were being restored. They were being revived. And when the people of God are revived and restored, they suddenly remember like awakening from a slumber. They remember who they are. It's all about identity. As a people, they remember that. And they remember why they're here, which is about purpose and mission. And as it turns out, when the people of God in any generation at any time in history remember who they are and why they're here, it turns out to be really good news, but not just for them. It is good news for them because you come back alive. But it's really good news. This was last week for the poor and for the oppressed, for all who mourn and those who grieve, which introduced us last week to the third week of Advent and to Isaiah the prophet, who in Isaiah 61 said that when the Spirit of the Sovereign Lord comes upon the people again, because they've been revived and restored again, the first thing that happens, and it's a sure sign of real revival, whatever you think revival looks like, the real sign, at least one of the real signs of revival, is that the people of God begin to see again. And what they see that they couldn't see when they were in their slumber are, among other things, the poor and the oppressed, all those who mourn and those who grieve, because they've reconnected first to their identity as a people and to their mission as well, which brings us now today to the fourth week of Advent and to Mary, who in this text, this text that I would refer to as this Song of Mary, in this song, Mary is, I think, connecting the dots. She's connecting all the dots. Having been perplexed, kind of think back to when Mary first heard from the angel about the Spirit giving life to her. A baby would be born to her, but she wouldn't be with a man. This is going to come, yeah, whatever. And the idea that she was going to have a child with a man, being with a man who she hadn't had relations with, but she also wasn't married, lots of perplexity about this, lots of disturbing things. This word was even a frightening word, but now she's connecting the dots. In the beginning, it's beginning to dawn on her what's actually happening here, And it's because she's connecting the dots that she's so excited. Because Mary herself, and I'll into this as well, it's part of her excitement. When you think back to Isaiah 61, when the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, it's good news for the poor. Part of the good news for Mary, and the reason for her joy, is Mary herself is part of the marginalized poor. She's a peasant girl, living under the oppressive regime of Rome. I have a feeling if you lived where Mary lived, everybody, when you're around that Roman thing, and it was everywhere, you kind of walk with your head down. You didn't want to be noticed. You didn't want to be seen because it would be bad for you. She is part of the marginalized poor that Isaiah is speaking of in Isaiah 61. So when she exalts, or erupts rather, into this exaltation of joy, this doxology of praise, she's doing it for a number of reasons. One is because this is good news for the poor What's going on inside of me What God is up to right now Is going to be good news for people like me And people like my family And people like my people This is going to be good news And I'm one of those poor people But also Luke 1.48 says She's excited because He's been mindful of me This is another reason for her exaltation That he can use people like me. So she's thankful. That's part of the reason she's so joyful in this song she's singing and not a little bit surprised and filled with joy for he, look at verse 48, I think it's on the screen, for he has had regard for the humble servant, the humble state of his servant, and he didn't have to have regard for me, I think is part of what is affecting her. It's what's dawning on her, because he could have chosen anyone. Now, you and I might not think that, because Mary, we think, was very special, and she was very special, but in her real life condition, she doesn't perceive anything special about herself. So when she says, he's had regard for me, he's been mindful of me, very aware that he chose me, but he didn't have to. He could have chosen anyone. But behold, next verse says, behold, which speaks to surprise at the end of verse 48, actually, from this day forward, all generations are going to call me, are you kidding? Blessed. The word behold, fascinating, literally means holy moly. That's what it actually means from the Greek. got a bigger laugh last night you're a little slow literally, behold me you've got to be kidding me I mean, it's me, God I'm Mary, I'm 15 she was 15 years old I couldn't be less impressive I couldn't be less powerful yet God the mighty one has noticed me, she says he has had regard for me has done great things for me so she's grateful and she's surprised but there's more because eventually as these dots for her begin to connect she's starting to remember some things that she's always known. Have you ever done that? Like you have what feels like an epiphany. It's like, and it feels like the first time you ever saw that and after you see it and you say it you realize this is weird I'm saying something I've always known. This isn't new but it feels new right now. That's what's happening to her as she starts remembering things. She's always known because she has always known the scriptures. which could be another story in and of itself because Mary is a 15-year-old girl living in Israel in Jerusalem, in Nazareth rather and 15-year-old girls didn't learn the Torah only boys were allowed to do that so if she learned the scriptures you got to wonder where it came from maybe from a father or a mother who didn't care about the rules and said this child needs to know the Torah maybe, I don't know she just kind of hung around the synagogue and stayed on the other side of the curtain and just listened all the time and absorbed it all, but she knew the Scriptures. And among the things she knew and among the things she remembered were the things where the Scripture said in places like Psalm 34, where the Scripture said in places like Psalm 35 and Psalm 103 and Psalm 17, and 118 and 132, where those Scriptures, by the way, and those Psalms are all Psalms that she directly quotes in this song that she just sang that you just heard because what those scriptures say is that God is always doing these things and God is doing what he always does because God has always extended this kind of mercy toward those who fear him, toward those who reverence him. Indeed, verse 50, look at it on this screen. He's done that for generations. For his mercy is upon generation after generation toward those who fear him. She's quoting Psalm 103 verse 17. So while it's true that some things are happening to Mary right now that are very much out of the ordinary, kind of strange, actually disturbing, even frightening, there are actually other things that are beginning to add up for her, that are beginning to make sense to her, sound familiar to her, because God, she says in verse 51, has done mighty deeds by his arm before. And indeed, notice in that verse, she's speaking in the past tense. She's thinking back on the ways of God and his moving among the people of God, indeed all people of the world, because he's scattered those who were proud in the thoughts of their hearts before. He's done that before he's brought down rulers from their thrones, Before he has exalted the humble, filled the hungry with good things, and even sent away the rich empty-handed, which is a fascinating thing to think about because the rich have it all. And for them to ever be empty-handed, he's done that before. What a miracle is that he's done all of that before. But what's blowing her away, and this is the connecting of the dots for her, What's dawning on her is that the Mighty One is going to do all of that again. He's going to do all that. He's done this before. He has exalted the humble. He has brought down the proud. He's done it before. He's going to do it again. And this kind of sends her over the edge. But this time, you see, he's going to do all that through, ah, it's crazy, me. 15-year-old peasant girl. And it's not just me, it's this life that God planted in me that's growing in me, that's going to come from me, which makes her response in my mind move just a little bit from exultation and joy to more a sense of wonder. Because God is going to do it again, so here we go again. We've seen him do it before, he's going to do it again, and we're going to get to see it. And it's why Mary sings this song, My Soul Exalts the Lord. and my spirit rejoices in God, my Savior. But to really get what Mary got, I think, to really feel what Mary felt, I think we need to know what Mary knew. We need, I think, to see what Mary saw in real time, in her real life. Because we read these verses quite distant relative to what was actually going on in life. And in the distance, these words that Mary sings in this thing called the Magnificat can become quite sanitized. And kind of fit for Sunday school, but not for real life. Because according to the song that she's singing, rulers are brought down. That's kind of a big deal. According to her song, the rich would be empty-handed, and they would be empty-handed in real time. The proud will be brought low. The humble will be exalted in real time, in real life. So who were they in real time, in real life? Who were the rulers and the rich and the powerful and the proud who might have been in Mary's mind, again in real time, in her real life? Anyone specific? Or are you just kind of talking generally here? Is this kind of metaphor here? Yes, he does that. Or is she thinking something closer? Anyone specific? Actually, I think she is indeed absolutely. Absolutely she is indeed one chapter later. In fact, it's actually just a few verses later from the Magnificat. We read in Luke chapter 2 beginning in verse 1 these words that kind of tell us what she might have been thinking, what kind of ruler she might have had in mind, because it says this, Luke 2, verse 1, that it came about in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census be taken and a tax be gathered from all the inhabited worlds. And you heard the name right there, Caesar Augustus, because Caesar Augustus would clearly be one of those guys. Because he's one of those rulers, he's one of those powers, those proud in the thoughts of their own mind, without a doubt that's him, that would have loomed very large in Mary's mind as being one who was indeed proud in the thoughts of their own mind, verse 51. Presenting himself did Caesar, not only as a king, but as a god, and that was really kind of in the face of the Jewish faith. you think Yahweh is, it's me, would say Caesar. Indeed, he had temples built in his honor. We've talked about this guy before. Prayers and sacrifices were offered in his name. Songs like praise choruses were sung in his honor, praising him as, among other things, the Savior of the world. See, we kind of thought there was another one. Now, before Jesus even came, he was being declared or declaring himself to be the savior of the world. They actually called him the prince of peace. We've talked about this before, the prince of peace. Remember that, the Pax Romano, the peace of Rome, but the peace that was procured by Rome was procured by violence and terror, by pushing people down and keeping people out. They would simply slaughter anyone who disagreed with them. And so when everyone is dead who disagrees, we have peace. He's the prince of peace, but it's obviously speaking of a different kind of kingdom, is obviously, is Caesar actually the embodiment of what we actually talked about last week. And I hope you remember it, because what we talked about last week was this thing called systemic sin, where you have a system, and there's all sorts of systems. We talked about political systems, economic systems, there are religious systems, there are family systems. In Caesar's case, it's a political, economic, even a religious system. Caesar had a religious system. I promise you, when people are oppressed and when people are enslaved, you've got a religion that is saying it's okay. Whatever the religious thing was, well, Caesar's God, and so what he says goes. So there is something systemic here in Caesar's political, economic, and violence system that uses its power to systematically push people down, keep people out, to marginalize, oppress, control people. Last week we saw how Egypt did that in the context of God's people enslaving them. That's institutional sin, if you will. It's systemic sin. We saw also how Solomon did it, which was part of the sad story because the people of God as slaves in Egypt were set free. They discovered once again their identity, who we are and why we're here. And it resulted in wonderful things in the world. When Solomon comes along, however, he's... It's all going full circle because they forgot who they were and why they were here. Because now they have slaves and a light is going out. They've forgotten who they are and why they're here. And when I thought of that last week, I thought horribly. We did that. America did that in the early days of our history. We don't like to talk about that. When ironically we thought of ourselves as a Christian nation, what really is ironic, we used our power politically, economically, religiously, because I promise you there were Bible verses that said it was okay to have slaves, and we did. It's called systemic sin, institutional sin that holds people down, keeps people out, oppresses, marginalized, controls people. When Jesus touched the leper and ate with sinners, he was not just doing a nice thing. He was confronting a system, systemic sin. It was a religious system, and we know the religious system Jesus was confronting because it was a religious system that pushed people down. It used its power to keep people out, to marginalize them, to oppress them. So Jesus, in touching the leper and eating with sinners, was doing a symbolic gesture that prophets often do to confront that system and say, you keep them out, not me. I'm letting them in. I'm inviting them in. I'm touching them. I'm eating with them. In Ephesians 6, verse 12, I find this fascinating. When Paul talks about rulers and powers, this is a fairly familiar text to us. Whenever we're talking about spiritual warfare, people go to this passage. For we wrestle not, remember this? We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers and rulers of the forces of this world. When Paul talks about rulers and powers in Ephesians 6, when he talks about world forces of darkness, spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places, he's not talking about individuals as we individually fight with demonic presence. He's talking about systems. He's talking about political systems, economic systems, religious systems that are using their power systematically to marginalize, oppress, and control, to push people down, to keep people out. And if you've ever been, well, you have, because we live in this world that is dominated by these kinds of systems. It might give you a chill to know those systems. How come they're so powerful? They're demonically empowered. That's why. They're worldly forces of darkness. They're spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places, demonically empowered. I just made you feel better about Christmas. I know I ruined your day. Well, Caesar's clearly one of those guys. Part of that kind of system embodying all of this. Indeed, when it says in Luke chapter 2 at the end of verse 1 that a census would be taken and attacks would be gathered from all the inhabited world, all the inhabited world was Caesar's kingdom. Indeed, the whole purpose of the census, We'll kind of get a kick out of this, but it gives us insight into this guy. The purpose of the census was to tell Caesar how vast his kingdom really was. So it's ego-driven. I just want to know, how big am I? Let's take a census and we'll count it. I guess we're up. Keep having babies would be the thing he'd want. The purpose of the tax would be to empower him to not only support his kingdom, but to expand his kingdom. Most of the money would go to armies because it's a violent system as well that holds people down and keeps people out. So when this king sends out a decree, just speaks the word, I don't know, let's do census, let's take a tax, the whole world in the inhabited earth begins to scramble. Everybody starts running. Each one to their own village, it says in verse 3 of Luke. to including this young peasant girl named Mary and Joseph her betrothed who, because of the decree, would leave Nazareth and go to Bethlehem because that's where Joseph was from, Nazareth, because Joseph was from the house of David, so Nazareth was his hometown, and so it is, says N.T. Wright, I love this, in his book Jesus and the Victory of God, because this story is all about the victory of God in the face of all the powers that you think have the power, Jesus in the victory of God has a different story. Nanty Wright says this way, this king named Augustus just speaks a word in Rome, just lifts a finger in Rome and 1,500 miles away in an obscure little province, a poverty-stricken young couple, begin to undertake a hazardous journey, all on the whim of a king. So it's real obvious who's in control, Caesar. It's real obvious who has the power and who doesn't. It's real obvious who is the ruler and who isn't, and it isn't. A 15-year-old peasant girl, give me a break. In fact, Mary herself would go, I know, it's me, it's Mary, 15. But that's when things get interesting. And that's when the kingdom of God and the upside-down reality of the kingdom of God starts moving before people know it's moving. Because unto us a child is born. It began to be another song Mary sang. Unto us a son is given, and it is given and it is born in this obscure little town that Caesar promised has never heard of. But it's a town that just happens to be mentioned in an ancient Hebrew prophecy that nobody knew how to find, and I promise again, Caesar had never heard of it. This ancient Hebrew prophecy in Micah chapter 5 verse 2 about the coming of a king with a different kind of kingdom. Micah 5 verse 2 says this, out of you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, too little to be among the clans of Judah. I like that. You weren't even big enough to be part of the clan. Nobody knew you. You weren't big enough to play with the big boys. From you, insignificant place, shall come forth the one to rule Israel. And he says, verse 4, will stand and feed his flock in the strength of the Lord. In the majesty of the name of the Lord his God, and his name shall be great to the ends of the earth. Caesar is great. This name will be great to the ends of the earth, so that now what we have are two kingdoms colliding. We've been talking about that before we entered Advent. We talk about that all the time. These two stories are colliding. So you've got Caesar, whose kingdom is vast, whose name is great. Everyone agrees. And when he speaks a word, issues a decree, everyone starts scrambling. And because he does issue the decree, a young man named Joseph and a young girl named Mary begin a journey to their hometown. And a baby named Jesus is born in Bethlehem, not Nazareth, where he would have been born if Caesar would have just kept his mouth shut. But now he's born in Nazareth, thus fulfilling a prophecy from Micah chapter 5 that Caesar never heard of, and if he had, he wouldn't have cared. But everybody else watching the story goes, what's going on here? And it just makes you kind of wonder if as Mary was treasuring up these things in her heart, connecting some of the dots, wondering, whoa, whoa, is this what I think it is? pondering them it says in verse 19 of Luke to in her heart to wonder if she ever found herself singing softly under her breath sometimes my soul exalts the Lord as she ponders this life in her that's growing in her and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior for God has done mighty deeds before he scattered the poor or the proud before. He has exalted the humble before. He has brought down rulers before. But he's doing it again. So my soul exalts the Lord. He's doing it again. I don't want to tell anybody, but he's going to do it all again through me. I'm 15. But not just me. He's going to do it through this life in me. And then there's Herod. We talked about this guy before as well, who according to Matthew 2, verse 1, because according to Matthew 2, verse 1, Jesus was born in Bethlehem. It says in Matthew 2, verse 1, he was born in Bethlehem in the days when Herod was the king, which might be confusing because I just got done telling you Caesar was the guy. Well, he was the guy. Herod was the king under Caesar's rule. Caesar had appointed Herod to be the king of the Jews. So he was a Jew being the king of the Jews, that is Herod. He was actually thinly a Jew. He was an Edomite and he was deeply resented by the Jews. But he was their king under Caesar's rule. And while Herod wasn't the most powerful ruler in the world, he might have been the wealthiest. And he came into his wealth the way Caesar came into his with a crippling taxation of the people that he governed, which is now speaking to another kind of system. that systematically uses its power to hold people down, to keep people out, to oppress and marginalize and control people. It's an economic system this time. And this economic system, with this crippling taxation, created something in the culture. What it created was a very small group of very wealthy people and a very large group of very poor people. And Mary was in that poor people group, a peasant is the person. who she was and all of this speaks once again to this issue of systemic sin but this time as i said it's economic it's an economic system that uses its power to systematically push people down keep people out marginalize oppress and control these things aren't just irritating these kinds of systems are demonically empowered. These are supernatural forces, world forces of darkness, spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places that are empowered. That's why they're so scary, and that's why it takes so much. How do you change that? It got so bad in Israel. I'm back to Herod now and his oppressive taxation. According to Josephus, a delegation from Jerusalem actually went to Caesar to complain about Herod. Here's what they said. They accused Herod of reducing the entire city into helpless poverty. While he was building hot tubs in Masada, people in Israel are starving. Now, there's a story behind that, and it's kind of fascinating, at least to me, because the real reason that these people in Jerusalem sent the delegation, The real reason they were so angry at Herod involved this legendary story about King David. The story was this, that when David was running from King Saul for his life, remember that season of his life, it says that he was in these caves and he would hide in caves for a very long time. But the legend was that he hid in the caves of Masada. Herod believed that. So in an effort to further assess or to further assert his authority over the people of Israel, He publicly declared this, that if their greatest king David lived like an animal on Masada, I will live in Masada in luxury. So he did by building a three-story temple in Masada, on Masada, that mount is there, in the middle of the desert. It still stands today. Some of you have been there. I have been there. It's still impressive today. You go there and it's like, wow, how did you do this in the middle of the desert, complete with Italian columns of solid marble, hot and cold water for cold baths and hot tubs. And the top or the roof of this great palace was a pool that was large enough for boats, which is large enough, pretty big. And as I put all that together, you just need to know that the world in which Mary lived was that world. That is what she saw, and that is what she heard, and that is what she felt, And that is what she knew when this song began to rise in her, as she connected the dots of what God was beginning to do about how the proud would be scattered, about how rulers would be brought down, about how the rich would be sent away empty-handed, about how systems of injustice that politically, economically, and religiously push people down and keep people out. When she's thinking of that and now singing about all that in her song, this Magnificat, she's talking about real people. They have names. They're actual stories and actual systems, which makes this song, actually, kind of dangerous. To be talking about rulers that way, if it's just kind of general, okay. He's talking about Harry. She's talking about Caesar. this is dangerous even subversive because rulers and kings particularly the kind that use their power to keep people down and keep people out don't like songs like that indeed this is fascinating to me just google this it's you can you can get even more information on this if you'd like but in the last century no even even sooner than that uh more recent than that since 1947 till now there have been three countries who have actually banned the public recitation of the magnificat which is weird. Wait for that in Sunday school. And countries go, you can't say that. Why? It is kind of weird because nobody ever banned away in a manger, as far as I know. I thought that was much funnier than, there was nothing from you. But the ban is true, actually. During the British rule of India, when they were trying to keep the people quiet, especially near the end when people were getting kind of sick of this rule at the end of the 1940s in 1947 they banned the recitation publicly of the Magnificat in the 1980s that's pretty recent in our lifetime Guatemala banned it and so did Argentina for similar reasons here's the reason because it gave hope to the impoverished masses the change was actually possible and that God cared about the poor who knew that maybe God cares about this that maybe Maybe this is a spiritual issue as well. So here's Mary. As a 15-year-old peasant girl, couldn't be less significant, couldn't be less powerful. Mary, who we normally envision as the very essence of meekness and docility, not gently suggesting in the song, but she is boldly proclaiming that the Herods of the world are going down. They're going down. And that is really good news, particularly for the poor and all who mourn and those who grieve. But seriously, for Mary to be singing this song, who cares? Seriously. Again, it's Mary. She's 15. She's in an old woman's house. I don't know if you know that, but just before this Magnificat, Mary had gone to be with Elizabeth. She ends up being there three months. So she's in this old woman's house. So if I'm the king hearing about this subversive song from a 15-year-old, I'd go, knock yourself out, Mary. Sing away. Well, I think she did sing. I think she sang a lot. This song, I think she probably sang it to Jesus. I mean, picture she's a mom, okay? Now she's got this baby. I think she ever was just looking at this little kid said, my soul exalts the Lord. And my spirit rejoices in God, my Savior, because God is going to do again what he's always done. He's going to exalt the humble. He's going to bring down the proud. Spirit of the Lord is on you. Spirit of the Lord is on you. I want a spirit of the Lord is on a little baby like this one. It's going to be good news for people like us. It's going to be good news for the poor. Okay, take that scene that maybe happened and maybe it didn't. I think it did. Fast forward it now to Mark chapter 11, where we come to this fascinating story in the life of Jesus and his disciples. It's one of my favorites involving Herod in one of his palaces called the Herodian Palace, which is one of his most opulent and fabulous. it was amazing but this one the Herodian was built on a mountain with big deal well it's a big deal but the big deal about this particular palace was that the mountain upon which it was built didn't exist before Herod came along because Herod built a mountain to put the temple on which is kind of a big deal and that thing exists as well today so with that in mind enter now in Mark 11, Jesus and his disciples at the spot on the Mount of Olives where you could easily see the Herodian Palace. Just over, just right over there, just over kind of Jesus' shoulders, the Herodian Palace is in the background. When Jesus says to his disciples in Mark 11, 23, in the context of being able to see this mountain and the palace and all that it represents, he says this, if you have faith, you could say to that mountain, be cast into the sea and it will be done if you have faith you could say to that mountain be cast into the sea and it will be done and people have been talking about mountain moving faith ever since and using it in a variety of ways but it wasn't just some mountain that Jesus was talking about because he was literally talking about Herod's mountain the one they could see with their eyes in that moment and it wasn't just talking about Herod's mountain it was bigger than that He was talking about Herod's system, which is a system that uses its power to systematically push people down, hold people out, oppress, marginalize and control people. But I have come with a different kind of kingdom. And I'm calling you into that kingdom, disciples. They were following him. they weren't still quite sure I'm calling you into a different kind of kingdom, a different kind of system, you guys. And if you want to be part of it, it's going to change things, and it's going to cost you as well. But this system, kingdom, doesn't push people down. It lifts people up. It doesn't keep people out. It invites people in. And indeed, the kingdom that I'm bringing is really good news for the poor. And all who mourn and those who grieve, for the spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon me, is what Jesus said. Remember this? I think we talked about this last week. The ministry of Jesus was just beginning. His baptism had taken place. He'd spent the 40 days in the wilderness. He comes out of the wilderness and goes to his hometown, Nazareth, where his mother is and his family and Joseph. And he goes into the synagogue on this particular day, as was his custom. The scroll is handed to him, and it's the scroll, Isaiah 61. And he opens the scroll, and he says these words, The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me, and he has sent me to bring good news, particularly to the poor, and all who mourn and those who weep, and somewhere, I don't know for sure, but I think somewhere, maybe just outside the door of that synagogue, or maybe she was crouched down at the open window on the side of the synagogue. I see Mary listening to Jesus say those words, and she's smiling the way a mother would smile when she'd be thinking. I know where he got that. He got it from me. I sang that over him every day. Every day I sang that over him. Maybe even in the moment she herself was softly singing as she heard Jesus step into his mission, I wonder if she softly sang, my soul exalts the Lord. And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior because God is going to do it again. but he's going to do it not through me he's going to do it through him which means that everything is being turned upside down from that moment on in what Dallas Willard refers to as the great inversion where the first will be last whatever that means and the last will be first oh yeah right where the humble will be exalted in this kingdom of inversion and the proud will be brought low and it's where this crazy inverted kingdom, that's the place where 15-year-old peasant girls named Mary are told that she would bear a son conceived by the Holy Spirit and she would call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from themselves. He will save his people from their sin, which means among other things this, that the kingdom of God is turning all of our ideas about who has power and who doesn't, upside down. Turning all of our ideas about what God does and doesn't do, upside down. He turns all of our ideas about who counts and who doesn't count, upside down. Who makes a difference and who doesn't, upside down. Because now you just never know what God might do. You just never know who God might use. because he might use a 15-year-old peasant girl. Are you kidding? Named Mary. Or a locust-eating, camel-hair-wearing hermit named John. Or maybe even, ah, you. Nah. You. Or maybe even me. Or even better, maybe even us. Because we are a people. of God's own possession. Sometimes we forget who we are. And when you forget who you are, you forget why you're here. And we go into an exile of some kind. Sometimes as individuals, we go into exile. We go far from home. We leave the God we love. We forget our identity. We get disconnected from our purpose. sometimes as a people. A church can do it. But over and over again, the people of God, somewhat you remember who we are and why we're here. And when you do, among the things that happens when the people of God remember who they are and why they're here, they get their song back. And their song sounds something like this, my soul exalts the Lord. My spirit rejoices in God, my Savior, because what God has always done, he's doing again. He will do it again. And he's going to do it through us. So let me just end the way I ended last week. As we continue through this Advent Christmas season, as you walk out the door, open door don't forget who you are don't forget why you're here but you will and when you do just remember who you are remember and why you're here and when you do you're going to see somebody you didn't see you're going to hear something you didn't hear and and you're going to get your song back. That'd be a good thing. Just praise, we're dismissed. Stand with me, would you? Help us remember who we are and why we're here so we can see what we need to see and sing the song we need to sing. All God's people said, Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed.
