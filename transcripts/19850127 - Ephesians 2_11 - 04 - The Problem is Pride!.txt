Open your Bibles with me to the book of Ephesians, the second chapter, the 11th verse, and our continuing study in the book of Ephesians. Ephesians chapter 2, verse 11. Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who were called the uncircumcision by the so-called circumcision, which is performed in the flesh by human hands, remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now, in Christ, you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall by abolishing in his flesh the enmity, the strife, which is the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that in him he might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace. Let's pray. Father, it happens every Sunday when we open your word, an overwhelming sense of inadequacy as we come to break it. And Father, I thank you that your word is alive. It's living. And right now, its purpose is to pierce and to divide and to get us to see the things that need to be changed. And Lord, we call upon you to be our teacher so that work in our hearts may be performed with power in your name. Amen. The book of Ephesians we have learned is a book about being one in Christ, what it means to be one in Christ. It's a book about being joined together as one body, the church. It's a book that tells us how we are to be functioning as that one body. And this particular text, verses 11 through 15, is introducing us to this very theme, unity in the body of Christ. Last week, we started in chapter 2, verse 1, and we began to discuss this fabulous miracle that we call salvation. This fabulous miracle whereby God himself takes people who are spiritually dead, cut off from God, unable to respond. We called them death walkers, spiritual zombies. And by the work of Christ on the cross, he gives them life. From death unto life. That's the work of salvation. That's the work of salvation that every one of us are very familiar with. But I want to tell you something else. That there's another work of salvation, theologically. Part one, work of salvation is what? from death unto life, unto good works. Part two of salvation is this. Theologically, the unity of the body. The result of the life that he gives is that the barriers that divide people have been demolished. Barriers. I want you to look at the text. Therefore, remember that formerly you, he's speaking to Gentiles, you the Gentiles of the flesh, who are the so-called uncircumcision, In verse 11 here, he is speaking to the Gentiles, and he is reminding them of something that was part of their past before salvation, before Christ. It was simply this. Socially, you were alienated. You couldn't have fellowship with the people of God. There was a cutting off. There wasn't fellowship. Social alienation. Social separation. And you were cut off by the so-called circumcision. This is something that's a physical thing. It has nothing to do with the heart. Verse 12 goes on and talks about another kind of alienation. Remember that you were at that time separate from Christ. Not only social alienation and separation, but spiritual separation and alienation. You were separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. Look at those words. They're kind of pierced. They're kind of scary. I don't like them. Separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth. Strangers, aliens, no hope and without God. They were hopeless because they were godless. We've just given a definition of despair. Quite a picture of people being cut off from God. Strangers and aliens. People being cut off from each other. Not knowing how to relate. Not knowing how to be open. Not knowing how to be real. So we're all just playing games and our whole lives are defined by the definitions. Defined by the distinctions between us. but now in christ that was my life i was cut off from god i was cut off from you but now in christ something's changed you who were formerly far off you've been brought near to christ first of all spiritual reconciliation but more than that he's broken down the wall between the groups and he's made them one that's the answer to the social alienation not only am i one with him not only is that enmity broken down, but now my enmity here has been solved. It's been healed. And this is the gospel. But now in Christ, you who were formerly far off have been brought near, for he himself is our peace. He abolished in his flesh the strife, and the purpose was so that in himself he might make the two groups, and that's what life is. It's always in two groups. It's them and us, that he might take them and us and make them one, a new man in Christ, thus establishing peace. The barriers have been demolished. You know what? This is the gospel. This is the good news. What the good news is all about, what the gospel is all about, is barriers being broken down between God, between man. Been abolished. He's made the two into one. It wasn't long ago I was reading a story, and we hear stories like this from time to time from missionaries who come back from the field and they tell us stories that are just heartwarming and they're real. And sometimes we snicker at them, but they are very real. And it's really the illustration of the gospel and what the power of Christ really does. But they'll be talking about two tribes. And the ones I was thinking about were tribes that I heard of. They were called the Sengas and the Tembukas. Sounds like I made them up. I could have. You just make up any weird name and it's a tribe from Africa. The Hulcumongas. They were the Cucamongas, okay? Whatever. But their source of joy all of their life was that the fact that every day the young warriors would leave the village and go and bloody their spears in the bodies of people from another tribe. And these missionaries, and the one I was reading about was talking about the Sengas and the Tembukas and how they did that, and their source of joy was their victory. Their source of joy was the blood and the spear. Their source of joy was their separation from each other and their distinction from one another. And then he would be telling the story about how these two groups, he would be serving communion, and now because they met Christ, they were serving communion. On one side was the chief of the Sengas, and on the other side was the chief of the Tambukas, and they were together, and that's what Christ does. The barriers have been demolished between me and God and between me and you. But the problem is this, and let's not play games. Even though positionally in Christ, those barriers have been broken down all too often. it seems like we spend an awful lot of time building them back up doesn't it building up the barriers between people to build up walls to maximize our differences to delight in division to self-righteously pat ourselves on the back because we're separating ourselves from people who aren't as spiritual as us you know they don't do it like us they aren't quite as insightful as us it's like the joke i think you've all heard it I'll pick on the Baptist because that's my background it's the fact that somebody just went to heaven and they're getting a tour I don't know how theologically correct this is going to be but it is going to be funny so it's worth it but they're taking a tour of heaven you know and they're coming to this one place and there's a great wall and it's surrounding and it's a big circle and inside there's people and they hear noise but the instruction is this be quiet because I want you to know something behind that wall all the Baptists are there and they don't think anyone else is here And it does sound kind of funny But I believe that kind of thinking You know the reason it's funny is because there's a grain of truth in that, isn't there? We are about that We are about building walls And I believe that breaks the heart of God You know why? The reason he came was to break down the barriers And then we have believers making distinctions And wanting to be better barriers. They're nothing new. They're nothing new. In fact, the gospel, this message right here, and the reason he is making such an effort to point this out is because the gospel came into a culture that was just all about barriers. Again, they defined themselves. They found their identity in their difference, okay? They found their affirmation of who they were by saying how different they were from everybody else. And the gospel was something totally alien to them. This was strange that I would unite myself with somebody who was different. This is crazy. It doesn't fit. The barriers were all over the place. Divisions between slave and free. Six million slaves in the Roman Empire alone. And the barriers were imminent. You could just see them. There was nothing new. The slave would resent the owner, and the owner would look down their nose at the slave. And there There were divisions. There were divisions all over the place. Divisions between men and women. Incredible barriers. You think that there are problems and strife between men and women today with the women's movement and things, you don't know nothing. It was terrible. Unthinkable for a woman to do anything independent from her husband. She would believe what he would believe, and that's why it makes a lot of sense when that Philippian jailer got saved and believed that he went home and his whole house believed. Why? automatically the woman would believe what the man believes. You can't possibly have an independent thought. Christianity comes into that and says, hey, there are no distinctions between men and women. There are no distinctions. I want to tell you, people choked on that. They sure did. In 1 Corinthians 7, one of the problems they were dealing with was that a woman had become a Christian and her husband hadn't. And very often in the early church, one of the big problems they had to face was that women very often were responding to the gospel their husbands weren't and what happened would be that the husband would leave because he had become the laughing stock of the whole community. Because essentially the woman had to believe what the man believed. Divisions, barriers. Greeks and barbarians. Cicero wrote that there's two classes of people. Greeks and barbarians. Those are the only two. The Greeks believed that they had the language of the gods and nothing else could compare and every other language to them just sounded like bar, bar, bar. Just a bunch of mush. A bunch of gobbledygook. and that's where they got the name Barbarian and no one else could be quite like them and there was divisions and barriers all over the place and maybe the greatest was between the Jew and the Gentile and the greatest problem between the Jew and the Gentile was very simple, it was this they hated each other's guts they couldn't stand each other verse 11, we talk about them being in quotations they are called the uncircumcision friends, this was a term of derision of defamation we see David facing Goliath remember what he called him you uncircumcised Philistine. There was nothing worse that he could say about them. The term of the risen, there were barriers. To a Jew, a Gentile was something less than human. To a Jew, Gentiles had been created for the purpose of fueling the fires of hell. Sounds pretty rough, doesn't it? That was the barrier. To a Jew, it wasn't lawful to aid a Gentile woman who was giving birth to a child. You know why? Because then you were aiding and abetting, bringing a Gentile into the world. to just make it worse. So he couldn't do that. If they were going to die, they died. That's fine. For a Jewish boy or girl to marry a Gentile, you know what the family would do? They would have a funeral. In fact, in some Orthodox families today, they do that. Barriers. Rabbinic writers tell us of an incident that kind of illustrates this barrier. It goes something like this. There was a Gentile woman who came to Rabbi Eliezer and she confessed that she was a sinner and wanted to be cleansed and wanted to be righteous. And she wanted admission into the faith. and she said simply this rabbi rabbi bring me near i want to be close i want to know god and the rabbi said to her no you cannot come and he shut the door into her face barriers divisions alienation separation enmity and the funny thing is after a while in judaism these people of god who had been chosen of god the funny thing about them is that after a while their whole structure of religion was built on their separation, wasn't it? We can see that. We could go back and do a study, and we can see their whole structure was being built on how they were different and how they were separate and how they wouldn't touch anyone else. And they really liked it like that. Made them feel good. Boy, isn't it a good thing we don't see anything like that today? Isn't that great? I want to tell you something, and I want you to listen very closely. I want to use Israel right now to illustrate to us just how much we are like that, and let it hit your heart, and let the barriers be broken down. It scared me, and it scares me even now as I bring to you the parallels between Israel and the church. Listen to this. Originally, God chose Israel. We all know that. And he chose them to be separate, didn't he? He chose them to be distinct. He chose them to be different. He chose them to be a holy nation, didn't he? And we might think with Richard Wolff how out of God to choose the Jews, but nonetheless he did, and he did. In Amos 3, verse 2, we see them being called a special nation. But I want you to also know this, that God called them out, and he made them distinct, and he made them different, and he made them separate, and he made them special, not so that they would be a bucket into which God's favor and grace would be poured, and it wouldn't go anywhere else. The reason God made them distinct and different was so that they would be a channel to the whole world, so that God could demonstrate his love, his glory, his favor to the whole world. And it was supposed to go to Israel from them through them into the world to bring the world to himself. But what happened? Israel walked away from that, didn't they? They lost their vision. They lost the purpose for which they had been chosen. And they thought themselves to be a bucket into which... Look at how great it is. God's showering all these blessings upon us all. We really are something, aren't we? The reason he chose them was so that the world would see the mark of God upon their lives and be drawn. But the problem is that God perverted, and instead of being a distinction, instead of their distinction being a channel, it became a wall. It became a barrier. And they gloried in their distinction, and they celebrated their distinction, and they became aloof and they fiercely kept their rituals and they fiercely kept their ceremonies and they felt so good about themselves. But it was dead. All that was left was a shell. There was nothing left. There was life. It was lifeless. I wonder if that sounds familiar. Again, it sounds in a scary way very familiar to me as I think of the parallels. We are the church. We are the church and we have already learned in Ephesians that we've been chosen, haven't we? We've been called out. We are a holy nation. We are a royal priesthood. We are a new kind of family. We are distinct. We are distinct. We are supposed to be distinct, aren't we? We're supposed to be different. Come out from among them and be separate. And touch not the unclean things, says the Lord. We are to walk a different walk. We are. We're supposed to talk a different talk. We are. We're supposed to walk in love. We're supposed to walk in light, not darkness. We're supposed to walk in wisdom, not in the futility of our minds. We're supposed to walk in the spirit. We are supposed to be different, but the problem is this. Like the people of Israel, we forget very easily the purpose of our distinction, of our difference. And we use it very often to build walls instead of being a channel through which God can reach the world. And we get puffed up with pride. And we celebrate our distinction and we glory in how different we are from the vermin, you know. and instead of being on our knees we get puffed up with pride and looking down our nose at people who don't say it like us and don't do it like us and don't see it like us and we become a little group with our own little lingo and our own little deal and our own little code and our own little rules and our own little bumper sticker and our own little radio station, and if you buy into our own little lingo and our own little deal and our own little code and our own little rules and our own little way of saying it, then we'll let you be part of the group, unless you do. But if you don't, it's us four. No more. Shut the door. And if you disagree, and if you see it a little differently, and if you have some sort of pain or frustration that you don't know how to deal with, in the name of Jesus, we'll cut you off too. And we're building walls and we're making barriers and we're doing it all over the place over and over and over again you know this problem almost destroyed the early church in case you think it's a new thing like like we're the only ones who ever did this it almost destroyed the early church in acts 15 i remember when i preached through acts what a glory it was to see the things that were happening and how the spirit of god was moving and touching and great works were happening and the word was simply this. Your doctrine is going all through. You're filling Jerusalem with your doctrine. It's incredible. And it was said of them that they were turning the world upside down. Incredible things were happening. And there was a unity and there was a community and they cared about each other. And the gospel was spreading. And all of a sudden in Acts 15, something happened. The Judaizers came in and says, oh, you know, this is all wonderful, this Christian stuff. But all of a sudden now, you're taking it out to the Gentiles. We've been told all our lives that they're idiots. They're jerks. We don't talk to people like that. And if they're really going to be Christians, if they're going to come in, they've got to be like us and they've got to perform our little ritual and our little code and be circumcised and become a Jew, then they can become a Christian. And it was as if sand was just thrown into the machinery and it just came to a grinding halt and you can feel it. If you're reading through Acts and you come to that 15th chapter, your heart just goes, something's wrong. The freedom is gone. You remember Peter, our good friend with a foot-shaped mouth, who forever and a day was saying things wrong and out of sync. And yes, even after he was filled with the Holy Spirit, he made mistakes. In Galatians chapter 2, in fact, I want you to turn there. Galatians chapter 2, we see an incident where he really fouled up and his heart got cold. Peter knew that the ceremonial law was over. He knew that the distinctions had been brought down and the barriers were over. And he had gone into Galatia and he was having a wonderful time with the Galatians. They were Gentiles and they were eating the same meat and they were having good fellowship and the communion was sweet and it was open until something happened. Some Judaizers came. They were called the party of the circumcision. They were a bunch of Christians who were walking around saying, it's fine if you're a Christian, but if you really want to be a Christian, you've got to do this, and you've got to do this, and you've got to do this. And it came into this area, and basically there was a lot of racial problems, basically, between the Jew and the Gentile. We've already talked about that. And they came into this group where Peter was just having a wonderful time of fellowship, and they came with their kind of stifling attitudes, their barriers is what they had. And Peter kind of got sucked into it. In verse 11 of chapter 2, it says this, But when Cephas came to Antioch, Paul is speaking, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. Why? He let barriers be put up between people, between Christians. For prior to his coming, to the coming of a certain man from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles, having a great time. But when they came, he began to withdraw, and he held himself aloof, as if he were better, because he was afraid of the circumcision, the party of the circumcision. And the rest of the Jews joined him in this hypocrisy with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by this hypocrisy. But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of all, if you being a Jew live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews? And on and on and on. What happened? Barriers were built. i wonder if we can't even catch a glimpse of how these kinds of things must break the heart of god and again the reason it breaks the heart of god is the reason he came was to break down the barriers that in christ there would be no distinctions there would no longer be classes or casts or differences or uniqueness romans 1 14 talks about there is now there's no distinction. There's no distinction. Colossians 3, 11 says, In Christ there is no distinction. In Christ there is no Jew, nor Greek, nor bond, nor free, nor Synthian, nor barbarian, nor circumcision, nor uncircumcision. All of those things have been done away. You're not a Jew, you're not a Gentile, you're in Christ. I'll never forget the story that I heard from a guy named Anthony Campalo. Tremendous speaker. Just captivating. And he was telling of a time when he was speaking in a revival in the hills of South Carolina. And in that area, the roots of racism had run deep. The barriers were evident. And he was in a kind of church that was very big, and it was kind of old, and it was in a town that was kind of small and didn't even warrant a church this size. But as he sat down, he couldn't see the congregation because there was a great kind of thing built here. You know, you can see the big structure in your mind. And as he stood up, he was amazed to see that as he looked out over the congregation, It was almost totally integrated, 50% black, 50% white, and they all were sitting together. And he preached a sermon, and as he went back after the service, he started talking to this pastor who didn't really look very refined. He looked kind of like a hillbilly, and he talked a lot like a hillbilly. And he asked him, he says, what is going on here? What's the big, you know, what's the difference? How'd you get to be that way? And he looked at him, he said, what way? What are you talking about? He said, well, come on, don't, you know, mess around with me. I looked out over your congregation. You have half black and half white. They're all sitting together. That's just not done. And he says, how did that happen? He says, well, it started about 20 years ago when we had 15 members in our church. And the pastor died. And so them deacons, they come to me, you know, and they says, hey, buddy, there ain't nobody else around here, so you're going to have to preach. So that means they got to let me say what I want to say. So I started preaching. And down here in Southern Carolina, you know, we don't do all this fancy exegetical stuff like you do. I just opens up my Bible, I put my finger down and I go. And my first Sunday in that pulpit, I put my finger down on Colossians 3.11. It said, in Christ there is no Jew, nor Greek, nor bond, nor free, nor Scythian, nor barbarian, nor circumcision, nor uncircumcision, nor black, nor white. All are one in Christ. And I preached that morning how we got to love each other. And those deacons, they pulled me aside And they said, hey brother, we don't want you preaching like that And Kampala said, what did you do then? He said, I fired them deacons You're not going to deke, you won't be a deacon Barriers, walls We see them 2,000 years ago and we see them now, what we need to discover is why. Why is it that when Christ came to break them down and make us one and bring us peace, why do we feel so compelled to build them up and to divide and to separate, not only from the world, which we're supposed to be a channel to, but from each other? And I've got to be honest, this morning that's what I'm really concerned about, the divisions between and in the body. I almost hate addressing this with this answer because it sounds too simplistic and take it with that, that I think it's a bit simplistic, but I think it comes to the core of my heart as to why the barriers are built. I believe that the fundamental, at the base, at the core, of the disease that builds barriers between believers and the outside world and rips the heart out of unity is the problem of spiritual pride. I think it was pride 2,000 years ago that separated the Jew and the Greek, and I think it's pride today that separates us as believers. My need, and I have a need, to feel superior to you. It's built into me. You know, the reason I drink Pepsi is because it beats the other's cold. It's better, you know, and it's got to be better and everything is built on that. My need to feel superior to you. See, I don't feel good about myself unless I'm better than you. And so I look for all sorts of things that would indicate to me that I am better than you and a little more spiritual and a little more caring. see it goes something like this well we may all be Christians yes I know we're in Christ I know that we may all be Christians but I'm a better one we may all be Christians but I'm a Baptist that may not work here that may think I'm less but again there you go we may all be Christians but I'm Alliance we may all be Christians but I'm Fundamental we may all be Christians but I'm Charismatic We may all be Christians, but I don't play with cards. I'll find something. We may all be Christians, but I don't chew gum. I'll find something. See, I have this need to be better than you. I have this need to be superior because I don't know who I am unless I am superior. In some way, I find something. And it's all pride, and it builds up the walls, and it separates. And in a real way, it undoes what Christ did when he saved us. and that gives me chills. You know, as we begin to play this game of superiority and having to find something that would indicate to me that I'm better, before you know it, before you know it, what happens is that all these external things that I look at that would indicate to me that I'm really better, you're a Christian, but I'm better, those external things become the focus. Those are the things I look at more than anything else and those external things begin to be the things that affirm my faith. Let me explain. Instead of the affirming factor in my faith being simply this, that I am in Christ and that I'm a new creature in Christ and I am accepted in the beloved and that I am forgiven of my sin and that I've been bought out of the marketplace, instead of resting in that and believing that that is true of me, what really affirms my faith are those areas in my life where I feel superior to you. And it's been happening for 2,000 years and the problem is pride and when it comes it builds walls and divides and destroys. You see, I'm superior to you. First of all, because maybe of something I do. Something I do. There's something I do that makes me superior to you. And I set up this whole system of little rules and little do's and don'ts that would indicate to me and the rest of the world how much better I am than you. It's called legalism. Asceticism, same kind of thing. And I want to say something very quickly that the real problem with legalism within Christianity has nothing to do with the behavior that you've decided to do or not to do. That isn't even the issue. The problem with legalism goes far deeper than that. It's an attitude. It's an attitude. What God has led you to do in your spiritual life, in your Christian life, or not to do, to abstain from, is something that's between you and the Lord, and he is going to lead you into those things. Praise the Lord for it. It's an attitude that damages. The damage that I see in legalism is simply this. It alters the focus. It alters the focus. from Christ and simple and pure devotion to him to some external form of behavior. Legalism does this. It alters the focus from Christ to a ritual. The focus is altered from Christ to a rule that I keep. It alters the focus from Christ to a tradition that I observe, to a liturgy that I perform very, very well. It alters the focus from Christ to talking like you, to walking like you, to looking like you, to thinking just like you. The focus is going through some religious motion. Maybe that religious motion for some of you in years past has been crossing yourself. This is some religious motion that I go through, whatever it may be, that affirms me. It tells me, I've really got it, you see, because I do this. I don't do this. I go through this motion. I do this ritual. It's wonderful and that becomes the thing that tells me i'm okay and it isn't enough to see what god has already said about me that i'm okay and so i set up all these rules and it builds walls and we have barriers and really the problem is pride romans 14 is all about this problem i want you to picture this it's really kind of strange kind of funny we can laugh at ourselves by looking at romans 14 the church was growing and some neat things were happening jews and gentiles were being converted together and what a joy it was people were free they were open the lord was blessing and nobody was thinking about the distinctions but something happened like this just think of this it's great predominantly it was a gentile church so a jewish man comes in and he gets saved and he comes to church and a young couple a gentile a couple, Butch and Emily we'll call them, okay? Is that Gentile enough for you? And they see Yosef over there, the Jew. And they see him over there and they say, Ah, isn't that great? Yosef is coming to our church. Let's have him over for dinner. Wonderful. They step in trying to create unity. So they have dinner. They have him over there watching a football game for a while and dinner comes on and they put the thing on the table and what is it but a nice, big, juicy ham. Oh, we got problems. Oh. and Yosef looks at that and says what is this offense to God? What are you doing? This is, I don't, you call yourself a Christian? And Butch and Emily are thinking, hey, you know, Peter came and he preached and he said that all things are clean and the blanket came down and all the meat was okay, nothing, there was no distinction, it's okay, isn't it? We didn't know. Yosef, this freedom stuff is getting out of hand, you know. We better make some rules. We must do something. And what they begin to do is to build walls. That's what they begin to do. And they begin to build barriers. And what started out as an attempt at unity is now resulting in discord. And before you know it, the Jews resent the Gentiles because of their freedom. And the Gentiles resent the Jews because they're so uptight. And the Jew feels more spiritual because he doesn't. And the Gentile feels more spiritual because he does. And the Jew feels like the Gentile is getting in cheap and they talk about cheap grace a lot. And the Gentile looks at the Jew and says, you don't understand grace. You don't understand forgiveness. You're a bunch of idiots. And the Jew looks at the whole thing and says, we better make some rules. What we'll call them is standards. What they are is barriers. And they help me feel superior and pretty soon the church splits and in the name of Jesus nobody talks to anybody. But pastor, we have to have standards, don't we? You bet your life. Verse 11, verse 10 of chapter 1 is all about that. Chapter 2 is all about that. The reason he saved us was for the purpose of good works. We talked about that and I guarantee you when we get into Ephesians 4 and 5, we're going to be talking about the walk of the believer. And it's one of holiness and purity and honesty and godliness. We have been made alive for the purpose of becoming do-gooders. Yes. but we do not focus on rules and and codes and little things that would indicate to me that i'm more spiritual than you and at the very core of that is pride i would have you see jesus forget the little rules and all the little you i just would have you see jesus the author and perfecter of our faith who for the joy set before him endured the cross and despised its shame i would have you see who you are in christ that you've been accepted in the beloved one and you know what when you realize you're accepted you know what happens you become more accepting don't you when you don't really think you're accepted you don't feel good but when you really know you're accepted it's easier for me to accept you because i know i am and when you really know you're forgiven and we bathe ourselves in that all of a sudden i can be more forgiving i'm not as rigid because i know i stand before him clean so neat i don't deserve it but i do and he forgives and he forgives and now i can i can be more forgiving i would have you see that you know what when you know who you are in christ that you've been redeemed that you've been bought out of the marketplace that you're a child of the king you know what i'm not going to have to badger you to live the life you're going to be dying to do it you're saying oh i want to be who he wants me to be and the spirit of god is going to be working those things in your life but pride says i got to have something i can look at that would tell me that i'm better than you and so i get this whole structure of rules and and little things that would indicate that to me it's wonderful and divides i'm superior to you because of something i do because of something i know makes me feel superior because of something i know the early church had a problem with this with the gnostics i'm not going to go into it very deeply but basically the gnostics would say something like this sure we're all christians but you really don't you really don't have the full thing because you don't know the things that we know and the reason we're really better christians is because we really want it more. We've striven to understand the deeper things. And they would hear a young Christian stand up in a congregation possibly and they would be talking of simplicity and purity and love and devotion to Christ and they'd go, oh, how naive. They think they're going to save the world. Well, we'll have to get them aside and let them know that when they know what we know, then they'll be. Isn't it wonderful that that isn't happening today? That is happening today. I went to seminary, folks. I went to a Christian college and I'm speaking to some of you young people right now who are going to Christian colleges. You know, it's an incredible thing. How we at seminary and in our Christian colleges, we just get enamored with esoteric thoughts, don't we? Oh, it's so wonderful. And all those peons at my church, they don't know anything of this. They're so ignorant. I'm going to be such a more useful servant than we hear somebody stand up and talk about purity and simplicity and in a simple way talk about their love for the Lord and we think, oh, you know, when they know what we know, they won't talk so simplistically. You see, they don't know Greek. They don't know homiletics and hermeneutics. That's a lovely word, isn't it, hermeneutics? Nobody knows what that means, do you? I'm going to have them out next week. But all of that is an attempt by me to look at me and say, see, it tells me that I'm better. It affirms me. Is there something wrong with knowledge? No. Because I think the more we know, the more you love. I really believe that. We talked about that before. Paul's prayer was that they would know who they were. And we need to have knowledge. There's nothing wrong with that. I want you to go to school. I want you to go to seminary. The problem isn't knowledge. The problem is pride. The problem is pride, and it builds walls. And it did 2,000 years ago, and it does today. Something to find that makes me feel superior. I feel superior because of something I do, something I know, something I've experienced. I feel superior because of something I've experienced. This is what I'm going to hit right in the face and go with it. Maybe I shouldn't when I'm here so soon, but that's okay. I think we know each other. It has to do with the attitude that we believers have with other believers, and the other believers are believers called Pentecostals or Charismatics. And the theological differences that we might have are things that maybe at one day we'll talk about. But you know what? those theological differences, whatever they may be between me and any other believer, those differences maybe will never go away, the differences. It goes something like this. They talk about a special blessing. Some of us say no. They in their services have a lot of emotion and a lot of noise and things like that. And we say, no, no, no. They talk about speaking in tongues and some evangelicals say no. That's of a different age. You know what I want to say is this, that those differences, that those differences in opinion are not the barriers that are between us sometimes. Those differences of opinion can always be there, and I can still have unity. Where disunity comes is when pride comes in. That's where the barrier comes. The barrier comes like this, when I say, I feel superior because I speak in tongues, and that affirms me. But that's what they do. See, what we do is something different. I feel superior because I don't. You know, they do, so they feel superior. We don't, so we feel superior. But it's all the same thing, isn't it? The barrier is pride. I've got to look at something and say, this thing indicates to me that we're better. And the barriers are built. Friends, I want to close with this, and please get it. The problem is not that we disagree within the body. It's okay to disagree. We're always going to disagree. The problem is not Jewish and Gentile. The problem is not between the circumcision and the uncircumcision. The problem is not slave or free. The problem is not a matter of what you do or what you don't do. The problem is not between black and white. The problem isn't whether you're black or white. It's not whether you speak in tongues or you don' t speak in tongues. The problem is pride. The problem is pride, and that's what builds the wall, and that's what breaks the heart of God.
