Well, I'm going to share with you just before we go to the table today from two Psalms, and we're going to read it in a minute, from two Psalms that are two Psalms that I often go to in my life. Psalm 130 and Psalm 131, and we're not going to have time to get through all those Psalms to kind of exegete all this. I'm just going to pay, we're going to pay attention to just a couple of verses. But these Psalms are places I go when I need to repent. Psalm 130. In fact, that zero at the end of Psalm, when I feel like a zero before God, I go to Psalm 130. And when I think I'm number one, Psalm 131, and I tend to get caught up in me and even really good things like sanctuary church stuff, I'll become independent of God and lose my dependency, that childlike dependency, and start striving. And you know, I always end up at Psalm 130 when I'm not 131ing all the time. Depending. Repentance and dependence. Now, I've actually even begun to use this in my golf game. Golfers, you know that golf's a lot like life. A lot of failure there, right? Out on that, a lot of failure. And so I have these balls in my golf bag marked Psalm 130. Mercy. Mercy. Just the word mercy, Psalm 130 on there. And most people think, what is that? Never mind, it's between me and God and my golf game. But then I have a very few balls that are marked Psalm 131, not proud. Because you see very often, I'm not very often on that golf course. Am I that relaxed and I'm doing that good? And when I get there, I'm going, oh, Lord, help me not be proud. You know. It hasn't really helped my golf game. But it has really helped my coming to God. David, we've been on this journey of the heart with David. And Psalm 131 is of David. Some people think because of the language that's in both of these psalms that they're both of David. They're called, one of them of David, they think both are of David. They're also called Song of Ascents in your Bible. And they were songs that the Israelites would sing on their way to Jerusalem to prepare themselves, to meet with God. and so on this journey of the heart I need these psalms desperately because I find my heart I don't know about you like the hymn writer said prone to wander you find that? prone to wander and say okay Lord I'm just going to break your law I want to follow that I'm just going to do it and in rebellion I do that just because I want my way or even around good things I'll just leave that dependency and begin to get full of myself and so I need those two Psalms because I'm always turning away. In fact, I had a car one time. Early in ministry, we were very poor and could hardly afford to do, have you ever been in that place? You may be there right now and you can't afford to. In fact, it got so bad and I wasn't aware of it, the lug nuts on one tire started getting loose and my tire actually fell off. Now that is a frightening experience, I'm telling you. But that's what happens to us, you see, Because until we get to heaven and God seals that heart completely. He's sealed it now for him, for heaven. But until we get there, we're always going to be prone to wander, Lord. I feel it. Prone to leave the God I love. Why? Take my heart and seal it. Seal it for your courts above. Now, as we read these two Psalms, if you just practice this, and you keep turning to him, turning from sin, many times as you sin, same sin, you are going to develop a practice of repentance. And that's what Psalm 130 is about, a practice of repentance that leads to Psalm 131, a practice of dependence. Let's read these, and just before we do, pray. Lord God, we just thank you for this table that you've set for us today. And we'd ask that as we read your word, and that as we come to this table, and you are present to us, Lord God, we just pray that you would shine on us with your love and your grace, and you remove any obstacle so that we, Lord, in spite of our sin, in spite of ourselves, might be able to receive your grace and know that you are here waiting for us to love us, and just like a child, that we might be by you. We ask this in your name. Psalm 130. It's going to be on the screen. Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord. O Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy. If you, O Lord, kept a record of sins, O Lord, who could stand? But with you, there is forgiveness. Therefore, you are feared. I wait for the Lord, my soul waits, and in his word I put my hope. My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning. More than watchmen wait for the morning. O Israel, put your hope in the Lord, for with the Lord is unfailing love and with him is full redemption. He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins. Psalm 131. My heart is not proud, O Lord. My eyes are not haughty. I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me. But I have stilled and quieted my soul like a weaned child with its mother, Like a weaned child is my soul within me. O Israel, put your hope in the Lord, both now and forevermore. Great Psalms. We need them because we have in our hearts that basic tendency to turn, don't we? And God has set this table before us to remind us of Christ's paying the penalty for our sin and that whenever we turn away, we can always turn back. In fact, it says in Acts chapter 13, verse 22, that David, who did a lot of turning back, you remember in his life, he sinned. David was a man after God's own heart, and Paul describes him as one who will do everything God says. Now, you and I both know that David's record was not a perfect record. Did you do everything God said? No. In fact, Dave Johnson and I have talked, and the staff have talked about Dave, and he said David was a real mixed bag. And what a gift it is that we have. We see his life and we see the different ways that he followed God as he slew Goliath with that great faith in God. But then he turned sometimes. He turned into sin and committed sin of adultery with Bathsheba and then to cover it up in his turning away and staying away from God, what did he do? He set up the murder of her husband so he could cover up his sin. But that wasn't even the greatest sin of his life. Because, you know, the greatest sin of David's life was when he counted the troops. The sin with Bathsheba is accounted in the book of Samuel, but not in the book of Chronicles. You have two accounts of David's life. Two times in the book of Samuel, 2 Samuel 24, and then in 1 Chronicles 21, two times we have the account of David's counting the troops. And it was the sin of his life. The consequences of that sin were graver than the consequences of his adultery and his murder. And this sin of pride, of counting the troops, was something God hated. We'll see in a minute why he hated that. But that counting the troops, you may say, well, what's such a big deal about counting the troops? Well, you see, God, well, he even has a book in the Bible. What's the book called? Numbers? And it's all about counting. It's God's command to count the troops to take the land. And it's also God's command to count the Levites so that they would know how to rotate them through in the care of the temple. So the act of counting wasn't the sin. It was the sin of the spirit of pride. And the reason it was so grave was because here was the most powerful man in that nation doing what the book of Deuteronomy warned Israel its king should not do. And that was beginning to see this amassed force and wealth and success as not coming from God but coming from David. That's how hard he fell. Now God hates the sin of pride. He hates it above sins of the flesh. I think that should be good news to some of us who think that if we fall into sexual sin or other sins of the flesh that we've committed the unpardonable sin. You see, pride is the sin that God hates because pride is the sin that we commit before every other sin we commit. It's the sin of turning away from God's command that's for our good. It's the sin of turning away from dependency on God and the beginning to go our own way. And he hates pride because it doesn't just stop there usually. We usually stay away and try and cover it up or stay away and try and clean up our records so that we can come back to God and say, see, there's more good parts than bad parts. We don't live in this psalm that says, oh God, with you there's forgiveness. You're not a record keeper. But you know, we are record keepers in our pride. And so God hates that. But you know why he hates it the most? It's because it keeps us away from him. Because the sin of pride is that sin that keeps us from turning back to him. Now I want to make a clarification here. When we talk about pride, it's okay for you to say, I'm proud of you. To be genuinely proud of someone, that's not a sin. all right not at all so we're not talking about genuine appreciation we all know the difference between the parent who is cheering for their kid on the field and they're proud of them because they're proud of what they're showing their abilities and what they're learning and the parent who's living through that child that's that's the kind of pride we're talking about for me I'm I'm everything's about me it's not about others it's not about God it's everything's about me. And pride gets us in that place of kind of being stuck within ourselves. In fact, a great illustration of this is one that my dad, who I think a couple weeks ago, you saw him here on the platform at one of the services. He was a preacher. I'd heard his preaching all my life. And he would tell this story, preacher's story, kind of a corny one, so forgive that. Don't tell Dave, I tell the corny preacher's story. But have you ever tried to run away from home? You ever turned away from home? When I was in grade school, I would threaten that. And my dad and mom tried to use this reverse psychology. Parents, don't do this. But, oh, we'll help pack your bag. Well, that would scare me. You know. Oh, they're taking me seriously. Now, when I got to junior high and senior high, you see, just don't do that because it doesn't work. And then you've got to switch it, though, to, we're going to call the police, and we'll get you back home. We'll find you. But this little boy in this preacher's story decides he's had enough. He's not getting his way. He's going to go out on his own, little grade schooler. Heads out the door, starts going around the block on his way, turns, keeps on making these left turns, comes back towards the entrance of the house there at the sidewalk, keeps on going, and keeps walking around the block. And pretty soon a policeman who's over there notices the little boy doing that, and he says, I've got to find out what this is all about. He goes over and he says, son, what are you doing? He says, well, I'm running away from home. He says, well, you're not getting very far. And he says, well, I just got a problem. My mom and dad said I can't cross that road right there. Corny, terrible. But you know, it illustrates the real sin of pride. When we think of pride, don't think of somebody real conceited. Think of yourself whenever you turn from God. And God hates that turning from him. Why? Because he loves us so much. That he knows that when we make that turn, we have that, the enemy's gonna come and he's gonna speak to us and he's gonna say, keep turning, keep going and kind of tell you, you can't come back home. He hates that. He hates the sin that helps, that where we turn away from him and stay away from him and when he calls us back to him, We now are blind and lost. We're in his universe. We can't cross the street. There's nowhere to go. God's so big. Hell is within God's grasp. It's people who've just said, my will be done, not yours. C.S. Lewis says there are two kinds of people, people who in humility have learned to pray, thy will be done, and know that's the best for them. And those who in pride continue to turn away from God, and God finally says to them with a broken heart, thy will be done. ooh that's pride and God hates that he hates it because he loves us now the reason God hates pride so much is because ultimately it blinds us it blinds us to his forgiveness the psalmist kind illustrates that psalm 130 I love the psalm because it takes me right where I'm at walking around the block, refusing to come home. Now the anger that I've had in my heart, I put on God's face, and I lose my sense of his smile. I think that door is closed and bolted from the inside when that door is open, and there's a feast waiting for me. And Jesus had his own version of this runaway story called the prodigal son. And in his story, the father isn't at home. The father's where? Out on the edge of the property saying, come on home. Come on home. While the son's coming home, having realized his folly and going off on his own and leaving the father's riches and love, and he's coming home just begging to be a slave, hoping the father, when he knocks on the door, will even come to the door. See, God hates sin because of that blindness that comes on us because of that. So what do you do when you're in that place? I love these psalms because when you cry out of the depths I cry to you oh Lord out of the depths I cry wherever you're at you may feel like God has locked the door but you heard the story you heard that he really isn't there he's out in the corner praying, waiting, running to you when you come home oh Lord hear my voice let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy you see it's not that God isn't hearing it's that we have grown dull and blind to his grace and then it's like the psalmist has an aha moment if you oh Lord kept the records of sin oh Lord who could stand but with you there is forgiveness I think David had that aha moment when he counted the troops now in that story of his counting the troops he sent his general Joab to go count the troops Joab said I will not do it may the Lord multiply the troops a hundred times over Joab knew what was going on God has given this increase not you David and David said, nope, I want you to go number those troops. So he goes out, he numbers the troops and kind of in a passive, resistant way, comes back and doesn't finish the numbering, comes up with 1,600,000 troops. That's a lot of troops, okay? But he didn't number the tribe of Benjamin and I think it was just his way of saying, David, this sin is so abhorrent to me, I don't want to participate in it. And it may have got David's attention. And just like the prodigal son, eating the corn with the pigs, came to an aha moment about his sin, where he was lost. I think David, all of a sudden, I've got 1,600,000 troops. I know I have more than that job. Why didn't you complete the count? And his pride and self-centeredness, he was blind to how lost he was. And I think God gave him one of those aha moments when all of a sudden he remembered standing before a Goliath, a giant. And his trust was what? In not even a suit of armor, but just five stones, and not even those stones, but that the hand of God would slay that wife, and he remembered that childlike trust. I'm not proud, Lord. I'm just a little kid with its parent. And he had that aha moment. Our problem is that in pride, we often get stuck. And if we've sinned in a way that makes us feel like a zero, we don't think that God will forgive us, and we lose the sight of his grace. And we can even come to the place of reverse pride where we say, you know, God, you can't forgive me. Are you there today? I've sinned too many times. I've fallen too many times, and I can't even get up because I'm so low. I'm so deep down. Or we can sin continuing to shake our fist like David was at Joab and shake our fist at God and say, I will not admit my sin because we're too proud to admit how far we've gone. Well, the word today is the way to get out of that. If you're having an aha moment or if you're looking for an aha moment because you know you need to come home, is to come to this table. Now, this table doesn't save. But you see, this table, every single time we have it, every month, it's full of bread and the wine or the juice of God's love. If you come here and this table's empty on a communion Sunday, it's not communion. This table is always set because Jesus wanted to remind us of the fact that he died on the cross for us, and he was the one who not only left his home, but he came right down to the depths of our sin and pride. And in the most prideful act of mankind, we put him to death. on a cross, and he put to death our pride so that we could come home to him. Some people think that Jesus died in terms of his physical death. What was the physical thing that happened in his death? And we know there was that death he took for us. But physically, many are beginning to believe because of the flow of water and blood from his side when the sword was put into his side of the spear, that he really died of a ruptured heart. His heart literally broke over you and me. That's the kind of God who's waiting for you to come just, just come back home. In fact, he's out on the block. He's looking for you. He sent his agents of grace. I want to close with a story. Many of you, well, I can't believe that there isn't anybody who hasn't been aware of the, in the back in the 80s, I believe it was, the Jim and Tammy Baker show and the whole scandal. that happened around that. And if there was somebody you were going to point to who had a bad record in America, you could just point to Jim Baker. He was scorned by the world and by the church. He went to prison for his sin of adultery, but mainly his sin of pride is what the world charged him with, of taking people's money. And in good intentions, he started right here in Minneapolis. Jim and Tammy did right at a Pentecostal seminary. Good intentions and lots of good ministry. It went south. It turned in pride towards Jim, towards Tammy. Jim went to prison, and in prison he had an aha moment. He saw how far he'd fallen. He's written a book called I've Sinned, which is interestingly the words that God always lands on on David's lips when he would turn back. The heart that turns back keeps coming back. I've sinned. God lands on those words. And trouble was, he was so scorned, he didn't have any friends. His wife left him. Now, his son, Jay Baker, hadn't left him, but Jay was very confused during this time as a high schooler, his dad in prison, the scorn of the nation. How would you, you know, wasn't that tough? Jay would go to churches to try and find help. In one particular church, this is what he found, he went to a youth group. The youth pastor was preaching a sermon on sin, and his dad was the prime example. Afterwards, Jay came up to the youth pastor and said, you know, you're talking about my dad. I'm his son. And God forgive that youth pastor, but he said to him, you know, your dad deserved it. That's not our God. And some of you today, you may have been wandering around that house and there's even been the church who've been casting aspersions on you telling you the door is closed. Well, this table says the door is open. Now, Jim Baker, when he came out of prison, God loves us so much, hates our pride, and will stop us in our tracks, but he loves us so much that he sends his grace, he sends his son, and for some of us, he sends people like Joab, people like Nathan the prophet, even to trick us kind of into repentance because he loves us so much. Nathan had to trick David into admitting his sin with Bathsheba. Well, guess who God sent to Jim Baker? Maybe some relative who felt sorry for him. Well, he came out of prison there, and the only people to meet him were two people, a couple, an older couple, and they had a wallet full of money, and they had a telephone number. And they said, now I know, everybody, there's nobody who's here for you, we're here for you. And they did it at great risk to themselves because anybody who was a friend of Jim Baker got cast with all that slur. But Billy Graham and Ruth Graham were there. That's a pretty good God thing there, huh? Well, you know, he sent his son for you. And today, maybe this message, this psalm, this table is your call to come home. Come home. Table set. I'm gonna ask the altar team and the worship team to come, our communion stewards, and we're gonna go to the table. Lord God now as I just thank you for this grace that is set before us as we just praise you and thank you Lord I pray for those who can't even believe it right now who've been wandering around that block so many times and maybe even kicked at by some people who in their own pride wouldn't offer grace Lord we thank you that there's no sin to which we can fall into that is so deep that your arms don't go lower. And we ask today, Jesus, just as you said, Father, forgive them in that place of paying for our pride. Today, Lord, people, come home and find forgiveness. And we ask this in your name. Amen. Amen.
