Holy Spirit, we thank you for your presence among us. Help us dial into, help us dial into what is always true, but we're not always aware of your life in us, of your life and your breath and your word in this place. And I just pray that even that moment of recognition and quiet would help us hear what you're saying. Pray it in your name. Amen. Matthew 5, verse 1 says this, that when Jesus saw the multitudes, he went up on the mountain, and after he sat down, sitting down, by the way, a very rabbinic thing to do. We're in this series on Jesus as being a rabbi. Sitting down was what rabbis did, which is kind of what I'm doing, as you can see, this morning. And they got it wrong again. Oh, geez. Anyway, I, anyway, forget it. Because I'm the rabbi, and that's a big joke, and it was going to be funnier in the next service. Okay. And he went up on the mountain, and after he sat down like rabbis do, his disciples came to him, and opening his mouth, he began to teach. He began to teach, actually, what some people refer to as the greatest sermon ever preached, the Sermon on the Mount, beginning with what has become known as the Beatitudes, the Sermon on the Mount, a teaching that actually we did here, I did here, 21 years ago. And we've revisited it, we've kind of touched on it from time to time over the years. But it's a series, it's a place in Scripture that I knew when we began this series on the rabbi, we'd have to revisit again if we were serious about coming to know Jesus as our rabbi and following his way because the Sermon on the Mount, more than any other singular place I know, embodies, kind of holds and reveals the fundamental message of Jesus relative to the kingdom of God. It's called the Sermon on the Mount. I suppose it could be called the Sermon on the Beach, or a sermon in a field, or the sermon in a boat, but it happened on a mountain. It says that Jesus went up on a mountain, which to you and me, and quite frankly, until I kind of did some more study on this whole thing, I never saw that as being significant beyond helping me kind of visualize, oh, it happened on a mountain. And I kind of see Jesus sitting on the side of some hill or mountain. But to a first century Jew, that phrase would have stirred up some other things. And it's a language, a phrase that's very intentionally used by Matthew. because the images that would have been invoked would have involved a guy that was kind of significant to first century Jews, Moses, who also went up on a mountain. Remember that? His mountain was Mount Sinai, and he went to Mount Sinai to get from God the ten great words for life, the ten commandments, which, as most of you know, we spent quite a bit of time this last spring and even halfway into the summer dealing with examining the Ten Commandments, referring to the Ten Commandments often as the law that Jesus loves. In fact, part of the rabbi series was trying to get into the reality that Jesus wasn't a Christian. I know that was odd to say. He was a Torah observant Jew. His whole perspective of God and his kingdom came from his understanding in a human level of the Old Testament. Torah being law, Ten Commandments kind of being the centerpiece of all of that. And he saw the law, the Ten Commandments, as being a life-giving part of God's redeeming his people. I think you remember the context, very important. As we bring it back and connect it to the Sermon on the Mount in some interesting ways. Having lived as slaves in Egypt, for 400 plus years, God called his people out. With a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, God delivered them in Deuteronomy 5. And he delivered them from Egypt, from the only life they had ever known, slavery. So having lived as slaves for 400 years, that's the only life they knew. They didn't know how to live as free people, as redeemed people, which is what they were now in Exodus 20. So when in Exodus 20, God gives to Moses on the mountain the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments were not given, and this was a really important paradigm shift for some of us. He was not given as the 10 things they needed to do in order to get God to love them. I am already the Lord your God, Exodus 20, verse 1, who has already redeemed you. This was the redeemed community of faith. He was giving them the law as a means by which they could actually stay free and learn how to live as free men and women and step into the fullness of their destiny as the people of God. You are already redeemed. You've been set free. Let me help you with some little baby steps in learning how to stay free. Put God first. Let's just start right there. Accept no substitutes. Revere his name. Observe his day. You ought to really be good if you started here. Don't murder. That's a good start. Don't steal. I called it kindergarten. Just kind of starting with God's people, bringing them into learning how to live as free people. but by the time Jesus came along, the people of God were living as slaves all over again. And not just to Rome, which would be the obvious slave master, like their forefathers were in bondage to Egypt and the Pharaoh. Now they were in bondage to their own religion, odd thing, for the law designed by God that we studied for months around here some months ago, designed by God to help his people live in freedom and step into their destiny. That same law had become defiled and reduced to a list of rules and religious regulations that produced death, not life, produced slavery, not freedom. So when Jesus goes up on the mountain, he's revisiting all of that. It's as if he's refashioning this law. And in some ways, Jesus is being presented by Matthew intentionally as the new Moses, which is what God's people at that time were looking for, Messiah, a new Moses, who, like Moses, would redeem, deliver, and restore those things that had been lost. And he would do it not by abolishing the law that Moses brought, but by fulfilling it. We talked about this even in the context of the Ten Commandments. Matthew 5, 17, right in the middle of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says, Do not think that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets. I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill. Which means to show you what it looks like, to kind of bring to fruition and give you a picture of what it looks like when this law I've given you is really lived by the power of the Spirit, full of grace and truth. you see it's more than just not murdering people it's about dealing with your anger it's not just about adultery it's about dealing with your lusts see what i see jesus doing in the sermon on the my analogy is is i see him re-digging the wells that moses had dug in the ten commandments let me explain that analogy just a bit. It comes from the life of Abraham in Genesis chapter 26, and I want us to see it. In fact, I want us to bring it into this study we're going to do over the next several weeks, months, however long. Because when Abraham finally settled in Canaan, having come from Chaldea, among the first things Abraham did was dig some wells in the valley of Gerar, four wells, and I'll even named them, Essek, Sitna, Rehoboth, and Beersheba. Wells that produced, obviously, water for his livestock, for his crops, for his family. Water that produced nourishment, get the symbolism of it. It produced refreshment. It sustained life. It is a symbol of life. Water and wells are life-giving things. But when Abraham died in Genesis 25, those wells dried up. from just misuse or lacking use. They weren't being tended. So when the Philistines came along and saw these holes in the ground, not knowing what they were or valuing them or understanding their potential, they simply filled these holes up with dirt and garbage, old rusty bikes, junk. Just filled them up. Until Isaac, the son of Abraham, dial into this too. You don't know the whole story. don't have time to unpack it all, but it wasn't Ishmael. This was Isaac, the son of Abraham, born of faith and born of promise, returned to the valley of Gerar in Genesis 26, and he re-dug the wells of his father Abraham. Genesis 26, 18 says it this way, then Isaac dug again the wells of water, which had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, for the Philistines had stopped them up after Abraham's death. And when Isaac's servants dug in the valley, they found there a well flowing with water, with nourishments, with refreshments, with things, something that would really sustain life. See, the picture I have, and I want you to have it, in the Sermon on the Mount is that's exactly what Jesus is doing. He is re-digging the wells that Moses dug. Wells that In Exodus 20, in that season of God's dealing with his people, had produced for them some real fresh water, a brand new way of living as free men and women. But over the years of use and misuse of this law, these wells, the wells had gone dry, filled up with the rubbish and dirt of empty religion and dead works and stifling legalisms. So Jesus comes along and, in effect, is saying this, we're going to re-dig these wells. but we're going to dig them deeper and we're going to take them further than Moses ever did or quite frankly ever could because it's not just again about murder it's about anger we're going to go deeper because that's where the water is and it's not just about loving your friend that's a good thing we're going to talk about learning what it means to love your enemy because that's where the fresh water is but to get to that fresh water we're going to have to dig a little deeper, which leads to another analogy, another picture that I want us to bring into the study, but also prepare us for the table and the tables that we're going to go to in a moment. Again, this analogy is from the life of Abraham, the well digger, because what I want you to see here is that his digging of wells as kind of his life work in some sense is standing in significant contrast to the culture that he lived in at the time. Let me explain that. Abraham came from Chaldea. Chaldea was a place that was known for, among other things, its ziggurats. Weird words. Ziggurats were huge religious edifices. Picture that in your mind. Monuments that they built to their gods, to appease their gods sometimes, to honor them, to reach their gods. Think of the Tower of Babel, which happened right in the context of Abraham's life. I actually have a picture in my mind of these monuments looking like the Washington monument. But the bottom line, and what I want you to get about this symbolically, is this, that these edifices, these monuments, were visible, they were external, and they were very impressive. I mean, who built those? Wow, would be kind of the response. Then after settling in Canaan, Abraham, we're told that he went to Egypt, at least for a period of time in Genesis 16, where this phenomena of the pyramids must have struck him. Picture Abraham looking at the pyramids. I mean, his response would be what yours would be even today. Wow. And the dynamic of the pyramids is this. They were external. They were visible. They were very impressive. But in a very real contrast to those two places that were kind of etched in his mind, the ziggurats of Chaldea, the pyramids of Egypt, Abraham built a different way. This is very significant. He built a different thing. He built a different direction. In fact, the energy of Abraham's life was not about building up at all. He dug down deep. Abraham dug wells. Deep columns into the ground. A kind of reverse column. picture that in your mind. Reverse columns that from a distance didn't look impressive at all. Indeed, you couldn't even see them from a distance until you got up close. And even then, sometimes when you got up close, people wouldn't notice them as having value necessarily. The Philistines certainly didn't. Looks like a hole in the ground. Yes, fill it up. See, Abraham didn't leave a monument. Listen to this. He left a source. Think about your life. Think about our life. Think about, and I do think about this as a church. What are we going to leave? Big monument? We're going to celebrate next week. We have a building. Is that where we're leaving? I hope we're leaving more than that. He left a source. He left a source. He left what Eugene Peterson calls an emptiness that becomes a fullness. Jesus early in the Beatitudes says, blessed are the poor in spirit. Poor in spirit speaks to emptiness. What good is that? That speaks to a fullness. An absence that becomes a presence. But here's the deal. See, if as a church we really do the Sermon on the Mount well, and I don't mean I preach it well. I hope I preach it well, but that's not what I mean. If we as a people enter into this Sermon on the Mount, if we follow the rabbi into these deep places, when we're done, we may not have many monuments to show for it. Not many ziggurats or pyramids because the Sermon on the Mount won't help us build ziggurats. If that's what we're into, it won't help us do that because the Sermon on the Mount is not about building up big monuments, external, visible, very impressive. It is all about digging down deep. It's all about a kind of life in here that may not always look that impressive out there. There's all these paradoxes, and we're going to get into the teaching of Jesus that is full of great reverses, because if you've got water flowing in your life, if there's water flowing in this place, thirsty people seem to be drawn. Interesting. In Jesus' day, religion, even among God's people, had become all about building ziggurats. Can't relate to that, can you? Religion had become all about building big monuments, things that would impress people and cause people to say, wow, the temple system would be one example of that. But even on a personal level, it was all about looking good in Jesus' day. Think of the Pharisees who prayed, and when they prayed, they prayed loud and long so everyone would hear and Jesus confronts it in Matthew 6 right in the Sermon on the Mount. And when they gave, they gave in such a way, particularly when they were giving alms to the poor, that they would be noticed and getting their name on a plaque was very important. Indeed it was as if their very lives had become white columns and steeples, ziggurats, if you will, that looked quite impressive at least from a distance. But there wasn't any water. There wasn't any life. Indeed, Jesus said of the Pharisees and those who embodied the religious system of the day that they were whitewashed sepulchers, looked good on the outside, full of dead men's bones, death on the insides. So the Sermon on the Mount is not about building up external monuments that make you look good, that are visible in impressive white columns and steeples. It's all about digging down deep. It's all about a kind of life in here that will actually produce some pretty good water and good fruit out here. I promise it will. It does. But that process, you guys, of digging down deep can at times be quite difficult. You know it's true. Like digging a well in the Valley of Garar, it doesn't happen fast. Picture it being even in a desert. It often gets quite hot times that you want to quit and you wonder if it's worth it. You wonder if you're making any progress. You wonder if you're ever going to have any real water because sometimes you dig and the dirt that you just dug out falls back in and you want to quit. So here's the deal as we begin. To do this well, this going down deep, I think we need at least two things, and this is where it ties in with what we're doing this morning. First thing I say, we need some friends. See, this thing of digging down deep and doing internal work, it's not just my task, and it's not just your, this is not an individual thing. This is our journey that we're going to take as a people. We're going to do this together, and that's at least part of why we have these tables today that we're coming to. It's not just your individual, We're doing this together. The second thing that occurs to me about what we need to go down deep like this and dig wells in the desert like this, is to do that job, you're going to need some nourishment. The kind that is provided by Jesus himself, who said of himself, I am the bread. I am the bread. And I am the water. I am the bread and I am the water that you need. So come and eat. One of the pictures I have of us coming to these tables today is at the beginning of a day where there's a lot of work ahead. You start it with a really good meal. Now, Al Shuck, who's always goofing around, said, you know, if this is the meal, you get a cracker and a little, it's not much of a meal. No, no. Kind of a chintzy meal here. Please dial in. Please dial in to the symbolism of this. You're taking a cracker. It speaks to the life of Jesus, the life who is the bread, who is the water. So come and eat and come and drink. It's strength for the journey with Jesus at the center. Al, I just want you to come and give us some instruction for how we're going to go to the table. Thank you.
