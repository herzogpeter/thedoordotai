Let's pray as we begin this morning, by time in the Word. I desire, Father, this morning is simply this, that you assist me to proclaim. I pray that in Jesus' name. Amen. Last week in what we've been referring to as our waiting room discussion, We talked about the importance of character formation in order to handle well authentic power. Thank you. My note also appeared on the page. Samson was the biblical example we looked to last week of someone who had incredible power, authentic anointing, but lacking the character to carry it. He did incredible damage, not only to people around him, but to himself as well, which raises a question I want to deal with today. It's this. Is it possible for people to change? Not just, you know, for a little while with New Year's resolutions to kind of change this behavior or that for a little while, but the kind of change that speaks to a formation of character that obviously will affect behavior. Is it possible for people to change? People like Sampson. People like you or like me. Some people answer that question, no. This is the way I am. Take it or leave it. What you see is what you get. People can't change. Don't expect it. This issue of whether people can change is a very important question, actually, because if the truth is that you and I aren't capable of much transformation, really, then we should quit expecting it, quit preaching it, pressing for it. or just setting people up to fail, to be frustrated and disappointed. Let that question sit there for a little bit. We'll walk around it a little bit more later. But let me ask you another question now. It's in some ways going toward the same thing from a little different angle. This question is this. What do you suppose is the potential of a human life that has lived in full cooperation with and submission to the guidance, wisdom, and power of the Holy Spirit. When Acts chapter 1 verse 8 says, you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, does that power include the capacity to really become a different kind of person, to experience a very practical, noticeable level, authentic transformation of character. to answer that question that second question what would the potential of a human life be if they lived and surrendered to the spirit of God all the time to answer that I would like to reflect this morning on the role of the Holy Spirit and the power of the Holy Spirit particularly in the human life of Jesus Christ himself because in my view the human life of Christ is revealed to us the pages of the New Testament, the Gospels in particular, is the prime example of what it might look like for a human being to live their life in full cooperation with and submission to the Holy Spirit of God. For the fact is this, Jesus did what he did, said what he said, went where he went, loved the way he loved, lived the way he lived, by means of the Holy Spirit of God, by working his human life. I want you to notice the emphasis you might have already on his human life. I want to talk a little bit about the humanity this morning of Jesus. It's very important to get to that. I need to do a little teaching here. I'm going to put on your thinking cap for a moment. We're going to be in the classroom for a bit. Historically, there have been two heresies related to the identity of Jesus. The first word I think pretty familiar with is that Jesus wasn't really God. that he was and that he is a great teacher, possibly, a good and moral man, a prophet, possibly, of some kind. Some would even go as far as to say maybe even a miracle worker of some sort. Those kind of people seem to come along, but not God. Now, when you hear that perception of Jesus, who do you normally associate with holding that perspective? Anybody come to mind? Liberal theologians, the culture we live in pretty much holds that view. We try to make Jesus less than God, and we get really, really flustered with that perspective, and we're kind of citing that one all the time. They're wrong, they're wrong, he's God, he's God, okay, that's right. Second heresy, in fact, relative to who Jesus is, is just the opposite of that. It's just that he wasn't really human. First, that he wasn't really God. Second heresy, that he wasn't really human. We're not as familiar with this one as the first one. We studied this particular heresy at some length when we went to the book of 1 John. Well, over a year we spent in 1 John. So that was the heresy, if you recall, that John was dealing with and confronting in his first epistle. Some of you might remember the term dosicus. Dosicus were the perpetrators of this heresy. See, the word dosetis comes from the Greek word dothel, which means to seem, which means that Jesus wasn't really human. He was God, but he wasn't really human. He just seemed to be. Yeah. Some of you hear that and you think, well, that's wrong. The dosetis is wrong. But what's the danger of thinking that? I mean, the really dangerous one is that Jesus wasn't God. The thing about him is he's not seeming to be human, but he really got that. That's wrong, but kind of okay. I'm not going to leave anybody terribly. So let me tell you what's wrong about it. Let me tell you what's wrong about it. What is the reason? About it. If Jesus wasn't really human, if he was only real God, then whatever else Jesus was or wasn't, he wasn't like me. He wasn't like you. I don't think he was like you. He was a guy! Well, I don't think he was like you. If he wasn't like me, at a very significant level, then the prospect of me becoming like him, I mean really like him, really doing what he did, really saying what he said, living how he lived, and serving the way he served, and loving the way he loved, is more than a stretch, it's kind of a joke. Instead of a joke, why? He's God. And I'm not. So, you can never be my savior. In fact, I own him as my savior. And that's why we did in worship. We just adored the fact that he saved us. But he could never be my model. He could never be my mentor. Not really. He's God. Now who do you generally associate with? With having your perspective? I mean when I first asked myself that question, and I first asked myself that question, and I asked myself that question, and I asked myself that question, and I thought, "Who did I associate with?" Nobody! I mean I have docentism, docentist? I don't even know any docentism, I've never heard the word! Just again, take a little deeper, and when you do, you may discover what I have discovered, what I believe in it. Because I think that many of us, many of us who don't know it, you're a little bit different. This way, many of us I think hold this rule. I think there are people passing churches this morning who heard this rule. Not consciously. We just need to write on a text. Jesus is fully God. Jesus is fully man. He would write that down. Anything other than others is wrong. But functionally, the thought of me really doing what is good, living how he lives, loving how he lives, observing the way he serves, is actually kind of a core thought if you think about it. And then we go, a nice sermon topic, certainly something you would expect in the church. But in terms of how functionally it was not very realistic, after all, he was God, not at all like me. Not at all human like me. And then there was a kid, um, growing up in church, you know, all about Jesus and he was still a God, he was still a man. You know, all these beautiful loving people like I've ever been. Trying to come to grips with my mind with what Jesus must have been like. You know, to see him, and the, you know, when I was a little kid, I didn't even, just down here at the same time. And I didn't have any business, and I'm telling you about it, trying to come to grips with it. A few days wonder if it's like Superman! Yeah! Yeah! I didn't know, but I was becoming a......abdose- This is a weird thing, I don't think they're gonna give me that kind of similar. But if you want a good point, essentially,...dose-face and abdose-face, then think about Superman in a minute. This is weird, I just gotta look at Superman in a minute. Superman, Superman, you may remember. And by the way, the version I have in my mind is not just a reason I'm in color,...but we want to...it's the black and white version, so you gotta go there with it. Oh, really? He doesn't look human, but I love him. He just seems to be human. That is, Superman is a strange thing, so he can become another. So, it's power to the ability, so I've been on this as well as them. Not only can I say this by heart, but I can see... I can see the speed and blow, and I can see the... Okay, so after they were spinning the bullet, they're powerful, and they're welcome, what is it? If you don;t you know what? If you're not a thing. It's something that's a big deal, and this is from the bottom, I know! This guy just got sent me down there, I just got it, I just got it. Let's not bring me back up for truth, just to come out. You're embarrassing man. Hey! Hey! I love you too, I love Superman! I love you too, but I love you too, but I love you too, Superman! I wanted to be nothing. I wanted to be able to thrive. I wanted to be invincible. I wanted to stand in the corner with my hands on my lips by people firing guns at me and saying... You know, you know, big story with a movie The Matrix, and it's why I......this guy does like this, the best somebody that he does like this, you know, to godism. It's in there. Much better. You survived a movie, you survived a movie, you started things like this. But I think, he's a drama country, and I don't know what I'm doing now. I think it could have been more different than Supermanian, G.P. and 20. Not a lot of attention, but it's a lot of attention that he talks to. I think it was to describe himself on the phone, but to describe his human persona isn't real. He's a real Superman. He's a keen to be human. I do remember something that you don't have to turn around and say, "It's too fast to God and tell you not to tell you." And you just said that about you! Like, if anyone who's just grown up at recess, he's just wanted himself to be better than God. You know what I mean? But no! It's a drive-in a lot! I do remember something that that's probably why the people with the body who's just a good system is, There's no reason to do that, because they're not. In fact, you don't forget about all this illness, um, you know, at the 10 year old, there's something about supernal instinctively lying here. Because you know, a lot of the consensus guys about superhuman instinctive bodies, BOOM! You're a f*ck of a 10 year old boy, you're getting beat up with me, right? They're really not the same. I could admire Superman, but he could never be my role model. He could ask me, but I could never be like him, because Superman was not human. He was a strange people from another term, with a bird even tied as 5-year-old bird. No, no one ever taught me this intentionally. But as a kid living as an adult, into my adulthood, living into my wealth of faith, a serious wealth of faith, unconsciously, I related to Jesus that very same world. He could rescue me, He could save me, and I was very good. And I remember my impression of my own discipleship when I was 17, 18 years old. I became really grateful that He served me. And God didn't represent a picture of my son and my death son and they needed amazing birth. And I can't even remember what I thought was the hardest level of discipleship, where it worked if I could do it for my life. And that's how the very thing I found to hear is that you know what it means. You can rescue me! And I'm so glad you rescued me! But I could never be a life son and not really. But what do you mean? It's often about being flesh-like and just, you know, I don't know. I've got to sit, but I've heard about the entire fight. They talk about it all the time. But who you couldn't? You're the guy. You're the same speaker from another point of the power I couldn't do. I'll be on both of them, I don't know, and relations or IPA or any of them. And the same person, just a bunch of them. Jesus loves his enemies. You don't. It's not that I'm glad you did it. Thank you God, but you did it. I wouldn't have been told if you didn't. But, either we really think that's possible for people like you. You? To enter into a kind of life that would live something like that, you know? Now Jesus has died, but He wasn't human. And if the question in the middle of life is to mention just this unreachable, "Thank you, God!"...but not like me. So this is what I have to do with it. And other things, precisely because of the prayer that I am speaking of this morning, the Bible has given me a question of the following systems, and making this come over and over again. again, that Jesus was a real human being. I don't know at the point that he was a God as well, but that he was a real human being. There's a point made all over his pictures. That he was a human being, and that he was a right to live in power that belongs to him as God, Philippians 2, and that he was a real human being, that he was a human being, in other ways, Philippians 3, and a Hebrew structure too. And it's because of that, the thought that he became a real human being like you were in that movie, That he does not sympathize with our listeners. Because we have been sent to them everything. Just, first truth, not, life, life, love, without sin, Hebrews chapter 4, and Luke 252, except there was a little boy growing up. He grew in wisdom and stature. Which means that life will arise and he is another one thing. We had asked questions, even in the middle of 1924, '46, in the church, because there are things he didn't know. Speaking of the language at the end of the age, he said, "I'm not there, and now no one knows, not the angels, not even the son, only the father." Sometimes we have a single song that probably must read up in this, to reveal the perception. Christmas is generally a wonderful song. But William Andrew, one of the lines of William Andrew says, "The cattle are lowly, the poor baby works, but little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes..." How many of you don't know there's no crying he makes babies? Little Jesus just says, "But Jesus doesn't cry." "Well, I mean, where's God?" "Well, you're talking to God." "Well, you're talking to God." You said, "God wouldn't cry." I mean, actually, Jesus made that in the angel in my home, he was both an animal born with him, and said, "I mean, I'm a little bit of something, I'm a little bit." But our global and cruel, it took full of Mary in person. He's a truly human human, not human, just human human. More than that, the more I can all of them. And that's the Sir Michael Pierce Browning version of the Waving Nature, "The Trinity's Great Open Door." Because at that same time, he just changes the word this way. He says, "Listen to me, Jesus is holy and high that there is comfort to me." That literal word Jesus, "He cried, that's not it." A very good creator, George Edwards, in court. And Thomas is a day that continues to the whole world. This is very important. You can't do to go to first from Superman, but here's the deal: Unlike Superman, he just really got tired. Although Superman, he just got really hungry, and really thirsty, and really hungry, and really sad. He felt real good, and he had real tears, and felt real pain, but he did not drop out of the snow. In fact, those males went right through his hands and right through his feet. And that spirit here, God, quite easily, thanks to the image. The life in the middle of all that human justice. This Jesus is a different kind of life. not by a different kind of God, and a different kind of compassion and courage, and a different kind of joy, which depends on different kinds of things, that one, than what my joy often is dependent on. It's a different kind of peace, and a different kind of power, as long as we're talking about power. And it is that light that he invites you into. And you're into. It's called kingdom. At the beginning of this ministry, he said, "You don't mind on your stoneness yet, but when you look at me and you see my life, and how I live it, dependent on the spirit of God, you just need to know that kingdom of heaven is your name right now." Get this. I'm going to say it's going to be the same thing as I'm going to say it. Jesus did not come just to provide a way by which we can have our sins forgiven. He did, of course, do that. But He did more than that. He did not come, and this might not live in some of this, He did not come and do what He did simply to procure for us a deal. A deal that I fear is like, "Maging deer in fiction, many, many circles all across my country this morning." And it's the only thing people hear. Here's the deal: You play the magic words, you play the magic words, you find the magic words, you watch the magic words, you have to turn it off. And that's the whole deal, it's not the whole deal. So you can't make it possible for ordinary, once in a while, human beings like you and me, not only to experience forgiveness of sins, that's part of the deal. But you did what we did, so that ordinary people like you and me could actually experience a different kind of life. Here's... here is... time... of life. So right in the middle of all our human stuff, all your human stuff and my human stuff, right in the middle of our disappointment and our discouragement, right in the middle of our temptations, right in the middle of our kids and our jobs and our marriage and our marriage and our own needs, we could begin to take them to a different kind of life, a different kind of love and joy and peace and power. I'm a little bit clever. This is a question. We've got to get to it. How? How? It's a nice stop. It's a saying, God, it's a nice stop. If Jesus was really so human, then how did He do what He did? How did He say what He said? How did He do what He did? How did He love and live the way you God done live? Answer. This, by the way, is another answer I think many of us would get right on the text, and it's different. But here's the answer: how he did what he did. He did what he did by means of the same resource that actually was available to you, and he bid it by means of the Holy Spirit of God. And he bid it by submitting to and cooperating with that Holy Spirit every moment of death. It's like Christian life was a dog not only doing that stuff, but showing what's up. Jesus didn't live the way he lived, it just showed up. Jesus spent three years with his disciples, and just couldn't convince them that he was God. He convinced them that he was God, and that wasn't something. But he was showing them a different way to live it, and then to get the call of an insulin. These are three years, these disciples, and anyone else who paid attention, get an important and personal picture, view, of what a human life might be. But it's still surrender to and cooperate with the Holy Spirit of God. Because it's so hard to hear that we do. So when you change the understanding of the nation, you guys, you're here to look at the here. And I just did not have stopped doing that shit. Here's the difference. As the Father has sent me, just the same way the Father sent me, I want to tell you. And I would then say, "Come on, Father!" And He said, "When the Holy Spirit comes on you, you are the deep power." That I have come to be much, much more than what's been given again. I have come to do that, but I have come to do this much, but I have come to make you a different kind of person, and that is the gospel that you preach. So, come back to the question I wanted to be finished, and keep the kids. But if they think, if the most that we can expect is to be from God, and that's why I keep going to a church, I really, and I'm always going to be horrible, so just learn something else and listen to our faith. If that's the best we can do, and you believe that, if that's all that is, you don't understand the gospel. You don't understand what Jesus wanted to do, and what He wanted to do, and provide. What Jesus and His relationship with the Spirit is going to be here. If you give a picture of how dependency does from the Spirit and humanity, the chapter 4 verse 1 says, "Jesus, hold on the Spirit, but you could be hold of the Spirit." Jesus was hold of the Spirit, to turn from the Jordan, led by the Spirit into the Jordan, to the world, to take away the words of Jesus personally, and the striving, the submitting, the planting, and the leaving, and the wish for the Holy Spirit. That's what my future is stronger, but because that the Spirit grows them into the world of heaven. This is where I think that Jesus is in the mission place, first of moving at the Spirit, to still grow them, and Jesus said, "Well, further." I feel about that I notice in my own attitude, but I've had my attitude that you couldn't come with it to do it. You couldn't come with it to do it, and through the several other spirits, you know how you can. The spirit submission. Jesus, hold it up! There's an adventure that the Holy Spirit is about, and by the way, that he is from here to time, a certain heart and huge end, that the invitation into the life of the kingdom, into the relationship with Jesus Christ, is an invitation into the adventure of the lifetime and his adventure with the Holy Spirit of God. That every moment of every day, Jesus interacting with the Spirit of God as a duty and cooperative in a partnership between himself and the Spirit. It's not God, so that's an interesting thing. You've heard this person and you've said, "Wow, that's an option." He's a church, but I do nothing by my own initiative. And if he was only told his dad, he doesn't take care of his community, I just go on doing what I do, being dad. I do nothing, he said, that night on the Mississippi. And by telling dad, he's been buying himself to that type of mother. I told him that I choose the capital, I don't know what the capital is doing, I don't know what the capital is doing, I don't know what the capital is doing, it's just that I'm not going to do this. "Hey, what's the other thing to do?" Just find out how it's done. And this is the mission to the center of the world. But in the center of the world, you're talking about Muslims so long. Now how did you know what the problem is doing? Something that they cooperate with, but rather burn and then just try to get involved with, like that's a bit awful. No! How often? Right in the middle of the world, I don't know if I can actually do that. But what would you do with that? Jesus was with God. He was people crazy. He was a solitary church. He was a martyr. He was really listening to the church. He was certain that the Father is good. That's how I knew. That the Father is good. There's only one occasion that I was going to the doctor. And the doctor just......is that the doctor... He was doing all his mess and stuff. And at the end of the day, he would just drop off himself and just......publish the father, the father, the father, the father, the father, and just listen and do the father....and he would come back and feel that... I wonder if you do this!...I did it here. I'm not going to leave you. I don't want to say anything about this product. I don't even understand it....How you gonna have to buy this?...I have no idea how you can buy this product. The Lord is here to live in the world. The Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry. The Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm going to go. I'm sorry. Thank you. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go.. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go.. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go... I'm going to go.. I'm going to go. Thank you.
