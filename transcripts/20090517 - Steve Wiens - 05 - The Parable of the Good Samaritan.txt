That we would move past fear and past contentment, past comfort, to go where you go. Amen. Well, I'm thinking of putting up a fence in my backyard. And the primary reason that I'm thinking of putting up a fence in my backyard is because I have three sons. And we want to be able to let them out to play in the morning without worrying that they'll be in Rogers by dinnertime. Fences are good, and the reason why fences are good is that they keep us safe by keeping us in. We like fences because they remove all doubt of where I should be and where you should be. If I stay on my side of the fence and you stay on your side of the fence, then we can be cordial and polite. And we can have a relationship as long as you understand that I am not going to weed your garden. Because that is your problem. Because it's on your side of the fence. Jesus grew up in a system where a huge fence had been erected in between Jews and Samaritans and the fighting went back and forth according to Josephus the historian when Jesus was just a child around 9 AD some Samaritans desecrated the Jerusalem temple by scattering bones within it during Passover and again it went back and forth between Jews and Samaritans. Growing up Jesus was taught that the people on his side of the fence were holy and set apart. They were God's chosen people but somewhere along the way God's chosen people missed their calling and instead of being set apart to be the light of the world and the salt of the earth, they instead used their calling as an excuse simply to be set apart, apart from others. Samaritans were offspring of Jews who had intermarried with Gentiles, so Jews thought of them as impure and to be avoided. On the playgrounds where Jesus grew up, it's very likely that he heard kids call other kids Samaritans when they wanted to make fun of them and use terms of special derision. At synagogue on Saturdays that Jesus went, it's likely that every once in a while he heard passionate sermons about steering clear of Samaritans. His parents even might have told him to watch out for those people because you don't know what those people might do if they wander on our side of the fence. Stay on your side of the fence, Jesus. And hopefully, hopefully they'll stay on theirs. Here's the thing, though. Jesus was just never very good at doing that. In fact, every fence that he came across, He did everything in his power to knock it down. And this really bugged people. At least some people. Bugged one guy so much that he had to ask Jesus about it. This guy was an expert in the scriptures. He knew them backwards and forwards. And that made him an expert in arguing the scriptures as well. And so when he started an argument, it was so that he could win the argument, which, if you start arguments, that's usually your purpose. So when Jesus got alone, this expert asked him a question that was designed to expose where it was that Jesus put up his fences, or more specifically, where he failed to put up a fence. Well, Jesus could hold his own in an argument, so instead of answering this expert, he asks him a question instead that's designed to expose where it is his fences are. Well, what's in the scriptures? Jesus says, you're the expert. How do you read it? Predictably, this guy's answer was right on the money. It was dead on right to love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and to love your neighbor. It was the Shema that every Jew recited every morning upon rising, and then when the sun went down again. You got it, Jesus says. You're right. Now go do it. But then the guy pushes it. He leans in and he says, well, who's my neighbor? Who is it that I should love? Believe it or not, I get emails every once in a while from this guy. I've got nervous murmur right there. No, I do. He's heard one of my talks and he's decided that I'm on the other side of the theological fence than he is, and he usually has written me because he doesn't like what I've said about Jesus, or maybe what I haven't said about Jesus, and according to this guy, I'm on dangerous ground, and I'm taking other people with me, so he writes me off and fences me off. So I do what you might do. I classify his email as junk, and I fence him off. You know these types, right? You can't get through to them. You're not going to email them back and convince them that they've misunderstood you, or that you're actually right. They'll never change. And so I push it. Who's my neighbor? I asked Jesus. And so Jesus tells me a story that ends up really bugging me. It's found in Luke 10, verse 30. I'd like to read it to you. A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers. And they stripped him of his clothes, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead. The priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by the other side of him. So too a Levite, when he came to the place and saw this man beaten, half dead, he passed by on the other side as well. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came to where the man was, and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him, bandaged his wounds and pouring on oil and wine. And then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him there. The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. Look after him, he said. And when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense that you may have. End of story. Then comes Jesus' question to this expert in the law, this teaching pastor. Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers? And the teaching pastor replied, without even being able to say the word Samaritan, the one who had mercy on him. Jesus told him, well, go and be like that guy. Now if this story doesn't bug you, then you don't get it. The point of this story is not just to make sure that we're the kind of people who help others in need, though we would do well to do that. But the point of the story, as you think about the way in which the expert in the law thought about Samaritans, goes way deeper than simply being a person that helps others. It's about ruthlessly exposing where it is that you have built your fences and where it is that you try to justify yourself as having fulfilled the obligation of God when he says that you are to love your neighbor as yourself. Because according to Jesus, you're not permitted to build a fence that allows you to define when it is that you've loved enough, nor does it permit you to choose whom you will love. According to Jesus, if we are to follow him, we refuse the right to reject anyone. Here's the sad truth about me and maybe about you. Even though Jesus was always tearing down fences, we're always trying to figure out where we can rebuild them in ways that we can justify ourselves. We catch Peter doing this in Matthew chapter 18, verse 21 and 22, and then it says this, Then Peter came to Jesus and says, Jesus, I've got a question for you. It's really important. How many times shall I forgive someone who sins against me? I mean, should I do it seven times? And Jesus says, seven would be great, but 77 times would be even better. What I love about Jesus' answer is that I can guarantee you that there are people that say, okay, 77 times. It'll be tough, but I can do it. I can see this crotchety old married couple sitting on a port somewhere down in Florida on rocking chairs. And the husband says something kind of mean to his wife. And she says, that's number 65, mister. No more. Well, let's go back to the email guy. Let's assume the next time I get an email from him, I decide, okay, no more fences. I'm not allowed to choose who my neighbor is and who isn't. And I'm not allowed to classify an email like that as junk. Not allowed to build a fence that says when I have loved him or when I have loved him enough. So the question that comes up to me is, how do I do that in a way that's not just pretending? Because I can really pretend. I mean, I can fire off an email back, oh, thank you, email guy, for your poignant concern. You know, and I can really try to mean it. but I would probably add something stupid in a PS like but you're on number 65, mister. Well, the parable of the good Samaritan challenges me to ask this question. Do I believe that it is possible that email guy might actually help me? is it possible that email guy might actually save my life or do i believe he would never do something like that he never could do something like that as i mentioned jesus was taught growing up that samaritans weren't his neighbor that they didn't deserve to be loved or even liked and then it was perfectly okay and even expected for Jesus to build a fence up around himself and them to keep him safe and to keep them out. He was told to avoid Samaria at all costs. So if you were Jesus and the law in your heart to love your neighbor was greater than the law that you've been told to build fences, how would you start to actually love a Samaritan in a way that wasn't pretending? I think you might have to actually get to know a Samaritan. And you could have to spend some time on the other side of the fence. And so in John 4, 4, which precedes the well-known story about Jesus' interaction with the Samaritan woman at the well, which many of you know, we read this very interesting sentence. Now he, that is Jesus, had to go through Samaria. Question. Have you ever wondered why he had to go through Samaria? Because if you're going to get from Galilee, or from Judea all the way to Galilee, Judea was in the south, Galilee was in the north, and Samaria was in the middle. If you were a typical Jew, you would take a well-worn path around Samaria. Many Jews did this so that they would not even become close to coming in contact with the Samaritans. So it isn't true that Jesus had to go through Samaria. But here's the deal. To get where Jesus was going, he did have to go through Samaria. To get where Jesus was going, there was no other way than to go through Samaria. He knew he couldn't pretend. He actually had to love his neighbor. So he had to go through. So what's Samaria like? Samaria is the place where you're the one who's different. Samaria is the place where you have to ask for help because you can't read the road signs. Samaria is the place where your answers don't work anymore in Samaria all your prejudices that maybe you didn't even know were there rise to the surface those of us who choose to go to Samaria go there because it's in our mind that we're going to help but when Samaria gets in us we realize that we are the ones who need the help. You can go to Samaria without letting Samaria get inside of you. I went on a missions trip several years ago, and this isn't true about all missions trips. This was just true about this one. But I went to the south part of the United States into some areas of pretty extreme poverty. And I remember being surprised by it and even shocked by it. But there was nothing in me that went down there that didn't know that I was there to help. And there was no one there that had any confusion about my role. I was there to offer my resources of time and energy and money in order to help. And when I left there, I felt a little better about myself for having helped. But Samaria didn't get inside of me because I didn't leave my resources behind. I have a friend who spent a week in Samaria a couple Januaries ago he decided to, in January spend a week on the streets in Minneapolis downtown Minneapolis and he had to learn the rules for how to survive and he had to ask for help from people that normally he would walk right on by he tore down a fence and went right through it he literally set aside his resources and became homeless. Think of yourselves the way Christ Jesus thought of himself we read in Philippians 2. He had equal status with God but didn't think so much of himself that he had to cling to the advantages of that status no matter what. Not at all. When the time came, he set aside the privileges of deity and took on the status of a slave becoming human. Having become human, he stayed human. It was an incredibly humbling process. He didn't claim special privileges. Instead, he lived a selfless, obedient life. And then he died a selfless, obedient death. And the worst kind of death at that, a crucifixion. See, Jesus understood that in order to get where he was going, he had to go to Samaria. but you don't have to go through Samaria. In fact, there are quite a few reasons why you shouldn't go through Samaria, but I guess it all depends on where it is that you're going. Many of you are on Facebook, but if you're not, you need to understand that there's this cool feature where you can join groups of people who rally around a similar cause than you do, And that cause might be your high school graduation class, or maybe it's a certain movie that you love. Sometimes it's protesting something like mindless reality TV. Other times it's endorsing something like your favorite American Idol contestant. But the point of joining these groups is to find and rally around other people who think like you do. These groups are awesome because they function like a fence. you can make sure that those who think like you will continue to influence you, and that those who don't think like you won't influence you. Now let's imagine that Jesus was alive today. One thing we know for certain is that he would be on Facebook. So question. what kinds of groups do you think he'd join? What kinds of friends do you think he would have on Facebook? What kinds of posts do you think would end up on his wall? And when you clicked on his Facebook profile, would you be offended by what you found there? By the groups that he was part of, and by the friends that he had, and by the wall posts that you read? In what ways would the existence of Jesus and the way of Jesus really bug you? Well, if I took a look at your Facebook groups, and if you took a look at mine, you'd get a pretty good idea of where it is that we were going, right? So question, where are you going? Perhaps one of these three parables will help you discover where it is that you're going and also paint a picture of where you could go. And if you click on the message tool this week when it comes out tomorrow, I've added a little extra where you can kind of get the background of the inspiration behind where these parables came from. But remember, they're parables. Parable number one. A college student went to Brazil to study religious grassroots movements among the poor. But one day he came across a set of apartments that were nicknamed the Beehive because they were so tiny and stacked one right on top of the other and right next to each other. He was invited into the home of one of the families who lived there. This home was not bigger than eight feet by eight feet, and mom, dad, and kids all slept inside. And when he went in there, he was offered a small cup of coffee, sweetened with sugar. And he didn't want to drink it because he knew that it probably meant a tremendous sacrifice on the part of this family. But he drank it because he knew it would be incredibly rude not to. And when he drank it, their quiet generosity, their simple joy, and their amazing contentment rocked him to the core. This college student returned home. He didn't go back to Brazil. He got married, had kids, and when his family grew to the point where his three-bedroom house could not house him anymore, he had to move to a bigger house because his now big family couldn't possibly fit into something that small. You don't have to go to Samaria. In fact, there's lots of reasons you shouldn't. Parable number two. A large suburban church was vandalized for no apparent reason. Holes were punctured in walls, the carpets were destroyed, and the sound system was completely destroyed. Its leaders estimated the damage in terms of hundreds of thousands of dollars. A neighboring church sent a card registering their condolences for this terrible hate crime. But some leaders from the Hindu temple just a few miles away called, wondering how they might be of help. They offered the use of their building at no charge to this church. They told him that the parishioners had taken up an offering to go toward the repair of this church. They offered to pray for the leaders of this church that they might receive what they needed from God. And so the leaders of this large suburban church, which has been vandalized, told the leaders from the Hindu temple that they'd need to set up a meeting in order to decide whether or not they could receive the help given from Hindus. you don't have to go to Samaria in fact there's lots of reasons why you should not parable number three an American Christian medical doctor found himself in Beirut in the summer of 1982 when Arabs in Beirut were attacked by sea, air and land by the Israeli army the doctor's job was to be on triage duty to decide who was past the point of help and to decide who needed immediate help. But like all other Americans living in Beirut in the summer of 1982, there came a point where they were ordered and invited to evacuate because it was too dangerous. But this American Christian medical doctor decided to stay. One day an Arab walked by a bomb which had been dropped but hadn't gone off. He read the words, made in the USA, emblazoned upon this bomb. Then he looked at the medical doctor with his blonde hair and blue eyes. And he read upon this medical doctor the words, made in the USA. So he asked the doctor a question. He said, doctor, two bombs were dropped on my village. One was sent to do great damage. The other was sent to do great healing. But I am confused because they come from the same place. The doctor smiled and said, well, which bomb had the greater impact? You don't have to go through Samaria. In fact, there's lots of reasons why you should not. I guess it all just depends upon where it is that you're going last question so if I put up this fence to house my boys and to keep them safe how will I teach them that there will someday come a time that they will have to knock it down please stand for the benediction farmer went out to sow his seed and as he was scattering the seed some fell on the path it was trampled on and the birds ate it up and some seed fell upon the rock and when it came up the plants withered because they had no moisture Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. But still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop a hundred more times than that which was sown. When Jesus said this, he said in a loud voice, Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear. as you go go in the way of Jesus amen amen have a great weekend everybody Thank you.
