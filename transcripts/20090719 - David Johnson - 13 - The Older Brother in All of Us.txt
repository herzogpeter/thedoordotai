Well, if you've been with us in our recent dealings with Luke's gospel in the 15th chapter, you may recall a couple weeks ago, that in response to the grumbling of the Pharisees and scribes, and they were grumbling in Luke 15, verses 1 and 2, because Jesus received sinners and he ate with them as well. In response to that, in Luke 15, Jesus told three parables designed to explain why it was he received sinners and ate with them as well. And his wife, or doing that, you may recall, talked about it a couple weeks ago, was rooted in the character of God, or the kind of God God is. Because, turns out, according to the parables, God is the kind of God who doesn't mind doing the dirty work. Remember this? Of a lowly shepherd who will gladly remove his royal robes and go traipsing through the mud to find and then bring home the wandering sheep. So God is like a lowly shepherd, according to the first parable of Luke 15. But he's also like a crazy woman. That was the second parable in that chapter. Who treats lost coins as if they had infinite value. So she lights the lamp and she sweeps the floor and she just won't stop sweeping until she finds that which is lost. But God is also like, according to the third parable in Luke 15, a waiting father who had two sons. Two sons. One of whom squandered everything he had. In fact, the father's inheritance is what he squandered. all of it on loose living, it says in Luke 15, 13. He just wasted it all like the fool that he was. He's called the prodigal son. And while in the story, and as we kind of interact with the story and know the story, the prodigal son who wasted the inheritance is actually a sympathetic figure that many of us who know the story find ourselves identifying with, especially if we've ever wasted something valuable like our lives. And when you come to your senses, having wandered away and maybe done it on purpose, you feel the weight of what you've done and what you've lost, and you start to wonder, can I come home at all? And because of all those things, because he does go home and he does repent and the father receives him, there is a sympathy toward this prodigal son figure and an identification, I think, that all of us have if we've ever wandered away from home. But what I want you to consider this morning is that in real life, if we actually knew this guy that we refer to as the prodigal son, in real life, most of us wouldn't like him very much, especially if you can kind of put yourself a little more sympathetically into the role of the older brother. The older brother who didn't squander his inheritance in a far-off country. the older brother who stayed at home working in his father's fields, which, by the way, is where we find him, this older brother, in Luke 15, 25, when he heard about the party being thrown for his idiot brother, who had embarrassed the family, who had broken the heart of the father. The older son watched his father weep when his brother left, who had created all sorts of work, I'm quite sure, no doubt, for this older brother when the younger brother went away. I mean, seriously, who do you think's going to cover for this guy when he's gone? When he's off having a high old time, who do you think picks up the slack of my younger brother's absence? The older brother, that's who. The responsible brother, the stay-at-home brother, who in the story gets cast as the bad guy, who doesn't rejoice, who is kind of incapable of rejoicing. When the prodigal comes home, he won't go to the party. And quite frankly, if you were here a couple weeks ago and you heard how I handled the text, I cast him that way too as the bad guy and lumped him in. And I think it was appropriate in the text. I lumped this older brother in with the grumbling Pharisees who were incapable of rejoicing. It was the whole point of all three of these parables because they were incapable of rejoicing when lost sheep were found or lost coins or lost sons were found. and in the story, this older brother is clearly not who you want to be. He's the bad guy. He's the grumbling Pharisee or scribe, but let me ask you a question. As I try to spin this thing an entirely different way, how many of you find yourself at least a little bit identifying with the older brother, and it's not because you don't get grace. You do get grace, and it's not because you're incapable of rejoicing when lost things or lost people are found. You are capable of that, but you know the younger brother and he's a jerk. He cost us a lot. Can someone just say that or do we have to keep pretending that he's the hero of the story? It was weird when I put this together this way. This week, I remember years ago I was in high school and a 16 year old kid I kind of dialed back to this and there was something that happened in our family I'll never forget it kind of marked me but I had an older sister five six years older than me and when I was a sophomore in high school she did kind of this prodigal daughter thing and and when she acted the way she was acting it was very public and and the public thing was exemplified or magnified rather by the fact that my dad was a pastor so everybody knew and it was very embarrassing and very hurtful for kind of everybody involved. And I remember as a 16-year-old kid watching my two other brothers, younger than me, and my other older sister as well, and watching my parents and myself paying a pretty high price in the family as she went off having all sorts of fun, I guess, is what that was about, such that when she came home, some of us, I know you're going to be shocked at this, but some of us were less than thrilled when she came home, and not quite ready to kill the fatted calf. We were a little more ready to kill her. Now, it didn't help much that she really wasn't repentant when she first came home. That came later, but when she first came home, the chip on her shoulder was fully intact, so her coming home that initial time didn't last long, and that's kind of a cycle. A lot of you understand and know, but here's the question. What if she was? I mean, repentant. Came back the way the prodigal son came back, recognizing if I could just be a slave in my father's house, that'd be good enough for me. Because that raises a question. And the question is this. How does the proverbial older brother find grace to authentically rejoice when the prodigal comes home? to authentically rejoice when the prodigal comes home. But the prodigal isn't just this mythical person. It's someone you really know. Let me say it this way. Let me say it this way. How do you find the grace to rejoice when the grace being given is being given to someone that you're not sure deserves it? And theologically, well, grace, you don't deserve grace. No, no, no, no, this has got to stay in the realm of how we really feel about real people. We're just supposed to act like nothing happened. Well, to answer that question, to enter into it, I think we're going to need to have a little grace for the older brother, at least a little patience for the older brother who was struggling with this very thing. How do I give grace to this idiot brother of mine who's caused all this pain and just let it go. So we'll cut him some slack. By the way, something that the father in the parable back in Luke 15 actually did. In verse 28, it says that after the son was angry at the party being thrown for the prodigal son returning, the father goes out to his son, entreating his son, inviting him back. You see that there at the end of verse 28? then reminding his son, now verse 31, that son, everything I have belongs to you. And I'm aware that you've always been with me. I'm paraphrasing this now, that you didn't leave me. I'm aware that you're not the one who embarrassed me the way your brother did, and I want you to know I'm grateful, is what I read between the lines in those texts. But you need to see and understand something very important, that the love and grace I have for your idiot brother does not diminish the love and grace I have for you. This is not a zero-sum game. But at this particular place in his life, the older brother didn't see it, and he couldn't understand it, at least not at first. All of which is why today the word I want to bring is directed to and is appealing to the older brother in us all. I want us to dial into the older brother spirit in us all. And I want to do that by means of another parable. This one is found in Matthew's gospel, the 20th chapter. If you have your Bibles, open to Matthew chapter 20, beginning in verse 1, where Jesus says these words, that the kingdom of heaven is like, and he's going to make this comparison, which is characteristic of parables. It's like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard. And he went out about the third hour later on and saw others standing idle in the marketplace. And to those, he said, you too, go into the vineyard and whatever is right I will give you, I will pay you. And so they went as, well, again, he went out about the sixth and even then the ninth hour and did the same. And about the 11th hour he went out and found others standing. And he said to them, why are you standing here idle all day? And they said to him, because no one's noticed us. No one's called us. No one's hired us. And he said to them, you too, go into the vineyards. Well, when evening had come, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last group to the first, which is weird. And when those hired by about the 11th hour came, each one received a denarius. And when those hired first came, they were kind of doing the math. And they thought that they would receive more because each received but, but each of them received what they were promised, just a denarius. And when they received this, they grumbled. There's that word again, that grumbling word that we saw in Luke 15 is characteristic of the scribes and the Pharisees and also the other brother here. Here they are, grumbling at the landowner, saying, These last men have worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day. Can you at least understand the grumbling and complaining? Now, the parables, the parallels between those two parables, the prodigal son parable in Luke 15 and this one in Matthew 20, I think are fairly obvious on the surface. The older son of Luke 15 is like the day laborers here who were hired first. So like the older brother, they've been there in the field the longest. They're kind of the oldest, and they've clearly done most of the work. So when those who don't seem to deserve it because they came later to this work in the vineyards, when they get the same as them, it feels like the ones who came later are actually getting more than them, which isn't fair. And the grateful joy that these early morning hired people felt earlier in the day when they were first hired. Because they did feel joy. They did need the work. They did need the money to live. All of that gratitude is entirely gone. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself in the story. So let's just back up as I try to help you get the picture of what's going on in this parable. and how it does parallel the prodigal son story, the older brother dynamic. Because the story begins with and features a landowner who owned an estate with a beautiful vineyard. Picture that in your mind's eye. It's not hard to do. It was actually a fairly common thing, a common site in Palestine. Palestine was actually divided into two kinds of terrain. There were the plains, and then there were the mountain slopes. And one of the interesting things about vineyards in Jesus' day They weren't always built on the plains, which is where you would think they would be, but often they were built on the mountain slopes, which adds kind of to this picture here because what that means is this, to work in the vineyard of the landowner is going to be an enormous amount of work because to make the vineyard work for things to grow on a mountain slope, you're going to have to terrace things, which means the moving of dirt, lots and lots of dirt, and the moving of rocks to build the terrace and build up the walls, and all of that is done by hand, and it's really hard work, obviously, and the heat in Palestine is considerable. It's called the scorching sun. We've been out here all day. We've been out here all our lives, and when the rain comes, it washes all that work away, and it feels like it wasn't worth anything. The picture is this. Working in the vineyard of the landowner is lots of work, and it's hot work, and sometimes it's frustrating work to plant and to prune and then to pray for things to grow that you can't make grow. All you can do is plant it and prune it and pray that life comes. And all of that is why, because it was such hard work, the landowner goes out early in the day, verse 1, to hire these laborers, known in Jesus' day as day laborers. It's important to get a picture of who they are. Because in Jesus' day, like in ours, there were different rungs in the economic ladder. At the very top of the economic ladder were people of wealth. And one of the things that marked someone who had wealth was that they had land. They owned land. To be a landowner was a mark of wealth. And it was a mark that very few had, but this landowner had it. Beneath that, and there were many more levels of wealth and poverty than I'm going to mention here, but beneath the landowners, there were permanent workers. And permanent workers would be permanent workers for the landowners. And what that meant was, while they didn't own the land, they had some security. They had steady work, and there was stability in their lives. And then below them, again, there's more levels than I'm mentioning here. Below them, though, were the day laborers, who some historians claim actually had it worse than slaves. Dial into this a little bit, because slaves, not a good life at all, and the people who own slaves don't care at all about the slaves, but they would be financially, a slave owner would be financially invested enough in a slave to really know. I've got to keep this guy healthy. I've got to make sure he's fed. And so in that regard, slaves would be aware that they have a place to sleep tonight and they have food on the table tonight, even if it's not very good. But a landowner or a day's laborer doesn't have any of that. They were entirely dependent as they're sitting in this marketplace waiting for someone to notice them, waiting for someone to call them out and give them the proverbial denarius, which is a symbol of life. I get to live. It's a resource I need to take another step, entirely dependent on the graciousness of the landowner. So when in verse two, the landowner sees these guys in the marketplace and calls them and promises to pay them, they are absolutely delighted and relieved and go into the vineyard of this landowner with gratitude and joy, feeling really good about the landowner, and saying all sorts of really nice things about the landowner. He is gracious and compassionate, full of compassion, and full of mercy, and abundant in love. And on the song goes, worship songs all day long about the landowner. Now, you might have this picture in your mind as I kind of describe this person that way, because in some ways, I think these early morning hires can be seen as analogous to newly redeemed people. You ever been around somebody who's just got kind of bought out of the marketplace? And they really did have a sense of their own desperation and their need for God, and they discover God, and God discovers them, and they are incredibly grateful and eager, actually, to get into the vineyard and begin to do the work of the vineyard. In fact, they're so eager, they're really quite obnoxious. You know what I'm talking about. Because I just got called out of the marketplace, they would say, And this denarius just feels like life to me and hope to me. And it feels like grace to me, but it's early in the day. Speaking of life, just six o'clock in the morning is when these guys came. And when they came that time, they were very grateful. And in the language of the parable, you're young. In the language of the parable, it's early. So the early morning hires are not just analogous to newly redeemed people. Dial into this. They're analogous to people who were redeemed early in their life. Because you came into the vineyard early in the day when you were young, indeed, to be in the vineyard all day from 6 o'clock in the morning to 6 o'clock at night, and those would be the hours that they worked, is to be in the vineyard kind of your whole life. So you were kind of born in this vineyard. it's kind of the only thing you've ever known which really is characteristic of this older brother when the party was starting he was in the field why? because that's where he'd been all his life he didn't know anything else so you were kind of born in this church or in the church or in this life with God the thing and while you're grateful and you love the vineyard, you do over time you have to admit you're not quite giddy like you used to be at 6 o'clock in the morning, like you used to be when you first came in and this denarius was the most amazing thing you'd ever heard about or seen. See, part of the problem is this vineyard work is hard work, and you've been in it all your life. Indeed, some people have paid a very high price for their work in the vineyard. As interesting as I just kind of began to think about that, the Apostle Paul came to mind. as he was invited into the vineyard of the master by a gracious landowner called God. He said, come, work in my vineyard. And he said, okay, I will. He's so grateful to do it. And he gave and he moved rocks and he dug dirt and he confronted that which was wrong and called people into the vineyard himself and he lost everything he had. It cost him a lot. And I thought of Peter and other disciples and other men and women of faith throughout history and people I know and people you know. I hope you can think of them now who gave everything they had. And sometimes the rains would come and look like it washed it all away. And some people would work in the vineyard for certain seasons and it felt like all they ever did was plant or all they ever did was move rocks and they never saw the vine even come to fruit and never saw that their labor made a difference. And people like that have been in it for a long time. Because working in the vineyard is kind of hard work and in that context can sometimes lose your joy and your sense of gratitude. And the denarius, nah, it doesn't look like that much. Come back to the parable. Because I need to roll it back a little bit. Because when at the third hour, the third hour is 9 o'clock in the morning. They begin, the first hour is 6. 9 o'clock in the morning is the third hour. It says in verse 3 that the landowner goes, out again. And it's still pretty early. Stay dialed into that. So you're still kind of in your life and in this journey in the vineyard, still kind of young. And he that is a landowner, in verse 3, saw others standing idle in the marketplace, which doesn't mean they were indifferent to the work. It doesn't mean they were lazy. They wouldn't be in the marketplace if they weren't looking for life, if they weren't looking for resources, and they weren't desiring to survive. And to those, the landowner, verse 4, says, you to come into my vineyard and I'll give you what is right. In other words, I'll take care of you. You can trust me. And if you're one of the early morning hires when this particular thing is happening, I think you're pretty grateful that they're being invited into the vineyard along with you for at least a couple of reasons, partly because I think at nine o'clock in the morning, It's early enough for you to still remember what that marketplace felt like. It's still early enough in the day for you to remember what it felt like to be helpless and hopeless, to be totally dependent on the landowner's generosity. But the other reason you'd be grateful that they're coming into the vineyard is because they're gonna help. We won't be alone, and we need all the help we can get to prepare this soil and move these rocks and repair the breaches that the rain has washed away so as to produce the sweet wine that is the product of this landowner's vineyard that the world so desperately needs. But then, at the sixth hour, which is noon, and then again at the ninth hour, which is three o'clock in the afternoon, the landowner does it again. And maybe it was then. I don't know. around noon or maybe later around three having been in the vineyard and in this scorching heat of the sun all day maybe it was then that the proverbial older brother type felt the very first twinge of I don't know resentment could that be? I love the vineyard and I'm grateful to the landowner but at noon you start getting tired and at three you're even more tired and new ones are coming in and i'm grateful but i'm tired can you relate a little bit to that church fathers actually had a word for this we've talked about this before it's a latin word acedia and it speaks to literally the plague that strikes at noonday. Think on that. The plague that strikes at noonday. When I was in college, I worked construction, pouring cement all day long in Chicago, 95 degrees all day long. And I remember, this is weird, when I first heard this phrase the plague that strikes at noonday. Physically, I can relate to that because it's 6 o'clock in the morning when you first get to work. It's still pretty cool and you have all sorts of energy and you get to work and you pace yourself because you know it's a long day. But noon is a weird time. You do get a break, but it's a weird time because you've been in the sun a long time, and you don't have the same energy you had when you got here at seven, but you're not near done. You still have a long way to go, and there is this thing that can settle in on you that makes you wonder if you can keep on going to the next phase of the day. Well, the plague that strikes at noonday is not an analogy of work in construction. It's a picture that speaks to midlife. And if you are at midlife, you know about the plague that strikes at noonday. Because you've been in this marriage a long time. And you've been in this life and in this job a long time. And, you know, the energy you had at the beginning of the day when you just graduated from college and all the positive things you knew were going to happen, some of them actually happened, but you just don't have some of that same energy, but you're not and you're done because it's only noon. And you can get hit at noonday with this what's the use kind of feel. It's a universal thing. And I wonder if it was part of what formed the older brother. And it gives me a little more sympathy for him. Well, add now to all of that this. As the landowner is bringing in these new recruits, if you will, at noon and at 3. These guys who are showing up at noon and 3 are showing up with lots of pep and lots of energy, like you had when you were young, 6 o'clock in the morning. And they come with new ideas as to how we might terrace the vineyard a different way and a better way. And they sing different songs in church. They kind of show up, this next generation shows up, they kind of show up pretty sure that they can terrace the whole mountain by the end of the day. And they're wondering why you haven't. Do you feel anything at all? Anything at all? I just love these guys. You know, when I was running this one in my mind, I immediately thought of David. This is a story I told a couple years ago when we were going through the life of David here at Open Door. and we came to that story of David and Goliath and I don't remember, I don't know if you remember what I did with that, but you know, it was the story of David and Goliath and so you know the story. But I remember, it was the first time I'd ever read the story of David and Goliath where I felt some sympathy for the guys that David was yelling at when he showed up. Do you remember what happened? David was just a young guy and he'd been tending the sheep and he was told by his father to bring lunch to his brothers who were on the battlefield and they had been on the battlefield for a very long time, facing giants like Goliath for a very long time, 40 days, every day, every night, all day, all night, in their face, big giant. David shows up, what's the matter with you? Just wanted to smack him. And he came, David came, with a lot of authentic faith and energy, the kind you need if you're gonna bring a giant down. So David, at one level, wasn't wrong at all. But I remember when I did that, we kind of backed off the whole David story, and I had a little word for the Davids among us. It was this. David, a little respect and a little patience for the war-weary soldiers who've been in this thing every day and every night for 40 days and 40 nights. Just slowed down a bit. But then I had a word for the war-weary soldiers who've been working in the vineyard since they were kids. And the word to them was this. What would you give to have that kind of faith and that kind of energy again? Could you at least hang around it? Could you at least not quench their energy and their passion and their vision? Or will you become the older brother? because it's in pivotal places like this that the older brother syndrome is formed in people like you and in people like me. The older brother wasn't a bad guy. The older brother is in you. He's in me. Back to the story. Verse 6. At about the 11th hour, the 11th hour is 5 o'clock, So the day ends at 6. He goes out again and found some more who were standing and waiting and wondering what to do, totally dependent on the graciousness of the landowner. And the landowner in verse 7 said to them, you too, come on in. Come into the vineyard. And if you're paying attention, you'll notice something here very revealing about the landowner. It's this, that the landowner's top priority is not just the work. And older brothers sometimes think that. I think that. But it's not. The work matters. The vineyard work matters. But this, bringing these people in at the last hour, reveals the work. It's not the thing that matters most to the landowner. I mean, these people coming in at the 11th hour are not going to be any help at all. and build. There's no time! This thing reveals that the top priority, the passion of this landowner, is that he just wants people in his vineyard. So you two come right now like the thief on the cross to whom Jesus said, today, you will be with me in paradise. In other words, taking that story and applying it to the parable in Matthew, 20, he's saying to the thief, thief, I'm going to give you the same pay as I give the Apostle Paul. The Apostle Paul, who worked in my vineyard for a very long time, and it cost him everything he had to do it. But what did it cost the thief? Nothing. What did the thief do? Nothing. What did the thief deserve? Nothing. What did Paul deserve? A parade. At least. Well, if Paul were to answer that question, what did you deserve, Paul? And I don't mean if we could get to his real heart, it wouldn't be the same. I know the theologically correct answer to that question. But Paul, what did you deserve? I believe that his honest answer would be nothing. You need to remember, Dave. Remember my story, would say Paul? It was grace. It was all grace. Indeed, Dave, I didn't even have the nobility of what some of you might associate with a seeker who seeks God and then he finds him and I was a seeker. That's how I found him. I didn't even have that kind of nobility. I wasn't seeking God. I was fighting God every step of the way. I was apprehended by God and it was all grace. Trust me on this, would say Paul. see the grumbling spirit that's embodied in the older brother the Pharisees and scribes and the day labors of verse 11 is among other things a forgetful spirit it's not evil but it's forgetful and among the things that those people and sometimes we have forgotten are these number one we're all just day laborers folks every single one of us there are no big shots here in this vineyard there is no star system here in this vineyard the apostle Paul is no more redeemed or regal than the thief on the cross they both get the same measure of grace they get the same pay see I sometimes think that we get this picture that there's going to be big crowds in heaven around people like Paul and Peter and the Billy Graham types well I think in heaven there will be a big crowd but they won't be gathered around Paul or Peter or Billy Graham they will be gathered around the throne and all the big shots as it were will be looking at the lamb and they will be pointing to the sun and they'll be worshiping and weeping and laughing and singing. And part of what they'll be singing is this, it's all grace. Indeed, I feature in heaven, maybe one day meeting someone like Peter, for instance. And I don't know if it's gonna, but I have this weird picture that when we do meet someone like Peter and we actually hear him talk and hear his story, it will dawn on us in ways then than it doesn't now that it really was grace because Peter's an idiot. And we'll kind of find that out then. Just kidding about that. Actually, the point of that is this. We won't be impressed with Peter. We'll be amazed by grace. And by the God of all grace, who is embodied in his son, Jesus, who manifests to us amazing grace. And if there is any envy in heaven, weird thought, you might actually hear a twinge of it from the thief. The thief who might just say something like this. Oh, you guys. I came to love him late, but oh, how I wish. I could have worked in his vineyard like Peter and Paul because I had to carry dirt for him. I had to move rocks for him. I had to done anything for him. So here's the question as I close, particularly to the older brother in all of us. Can you remember when you were that grateful for the landowner's gift of a denarius life and of the privilege to work in his vineyard? Maybe for your whole life. Let's pray as we close. Lord, help us to remember by the power of your Spirit, I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you as you leave. You're dismissed. Thank you.
