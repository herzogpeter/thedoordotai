As you've gathered, one of my hobbies is a study of Yiddish humor. There are just so many wonderful stories in the Yiddish tradition, like the story of Izzy Schwartz. One day, Izzy Schwartz said to Yahweh, Yahweh, is it true that for you a million dollars is just a penny? Yahweh said, yes, Izzy, that is true. Yahweh said, true that for you a thousand years is just a minute? Yahweh said, yes, you see, that's true. He said, Yahweh, give me a penny. Yahweh said, certainly, it'll only take a minute. you heard about the evangelical pastor who said to the rabbi rabbi why is it that you rabbis always answer a question with a question the rabbi looked at him and said so what's wrong with that there's a scene in chapter 11 of Luke where Jesus appears to be exhausted from the ministry he's up to here with people wants to be alone so he steals away from the crowd in search for a quiet place to pray within a short time the apostles notice his absence they set out in pursuit they come around a little turn in the Kidron Valley they almost stumble over Jesus he's on the ground, mute, motionless, utterly absorbed in prayer. They'd never seen a man pray as Jesus prayed. There was a peace that flowed out from him, touched them. They wanted to pray as Jesus prayed. So when at last he arose from the ground, one of them asked, Master, John the Baptist taught his disciples how to pray. Would you teach us? At that moment, Jesus of Nazareth revealed to women and men of all ages the true face of God. He said, when you pray, you are to say, Our Father. Our Father. Familiar words. Maybe so familiar, they're no longer real. Those words were not only real, they were revolutionary to the 12 apostles. Many prophets and just men had longed to hear those words and never heard them. Isaiah, greatest of the prophets, began his ministry with a vision of Yahweh, seated on a high and lofty throne, surrounded by a choir of angels, chanting, Holy, Holy, Holy. But Isaiah never heard what the apostles heard that day. For Ezekiel, Micah, Zephaniah, Jeremiah, Amos, Hosea, Joel, for every Israelite, Yahweh was the holy, strong, immortal one, a personal, stable, faithful, relating being not fickle or capricious like the Canaanite gods, who were often identified with the forces of nature, wind, fertility, and fire and so forth. No, Israel knew a stable God. He was like the Rock of Gibraltar in the wind of changing events. For the average Jew, God had a face, a bit of a den pad perhaps with a touch of kindness, something like Charlton Heston or Matt Dillon of Gunsmoke, Pursuing the kid and the child over in the country, through the desert, right into the heart of Mexico. Unrelenting dependability. Israel knew that she was not the hunter, but the hunted. And yet no Jew ever dared to pray in the sense that Jesus taught, our Father. This is the revolutionary revelation of Jesus Christ. Pagan philosophers like Plato and Aristotle had arrived through human reasoning at the existence of God. and they called him in vague, impersonal terms, the uncaused cause, the immovable mover. The prophets of Israel had revealed the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in a warmer, more passionate manner. But only Jesus revealed to an astonished Jewish community that God is truly Father, that if you took the love of all the best mothers and fathers who have lived in the course of human history, think about that for a moment. If you took all the goodness, kindness, patience, fidelity, wisdom, tenderness, strength, and love, and united all those qualities in a single person, that person would be a faint shadow of the love and the mercy in the heart of God the Father addressed to you and to me this moment. We catch a beautiful echo of this teaching in chapter 8 of Paul's letter to the Romans where he writes, The spirit that you have received is not as of old the spirit of slaves to govern you by fear, but rather a spirit of adoption that allows you to cry out, Abba, Abba, dear father. American child psychologists tell us that the average American baby begins to speak between the ages of 14 and 18 months. Regardless of the sex of the child, whether it's a little boy or a little girl, the first word normally spoken at that age level is da, da, da, daddy. a little Jewish child speaking Aramaic in first century Palestine, the time of the historical Jesus, would at that same age level begin to say, Ab, Ab, Ab, Abba. Do you see why the revelation of Jesus on the nature of God is so revolutionary? Why no Christian can ever say one form of prayer is as good as another or one religion is as good as another. What Jesus Christ is teaching his people is that the God in whose presence Moses had to remove his shoes because he was standing on holy ground, the God from whose fingertips this universe fell, the God beside his beauty, the Grand Canyon is only a shadow, the God beside his power, Hurricane Andrew, was nothing, Jesus says we may dare to address the infinite, transcendent, almighty God in baby talk. With the same intimacy, familiarity, and reverence is a 16-month-old baby sitting on his father's lap calling Dad, Dad, Daddy. Do you believe this to the point that you pray this way? Or have we gotten into what Jesus reproached the Pharisees for? You people multiply words, believing that by the sheer multiplication of words, you're going to win a hearing. Is your own personal prayer life characterized by the simplicity, Childlike candor, boundless trust, the easy familiarity of a little one growing up in his daddy's lap, knowing the daddy doesn't care if the child falls asleep. He starts playing with his toys. She starts talking to his little friends. Because the daddy knows the child's essentially chosen to be with him for that moment. Is that the spirit of your interior life coupled with the profound reverence that Jesus says are the hallmarks of authentic Christian prayer? I was giving a day of renewal in Trenton, New Jersey. I arrived the night before I stopped at a convent to visit two nuns who were friends of mine directly across the street from the convent is a synagogue the rabbi and the nuns were in cordial terms that night there was a bar mitzvah at the synagogue the rabbi invites the nuns over to the dinner since I'm visiting he invites me to tag along too well reluctant as I am to accept a free dinner who I wander over there's the rabbi sitting at the head of the table you know the little yarmulke skull cap thick black beard, black suit, white shirt, tie there's the rabbi's wife, his children, the nuns, myself midway through the meal the rabbi's four-year-old son got bored with the adult conversation finished what he had in his plate to eat and he gets up and he wanders about 15 feet away from the table and then he lost his bearings didn't know where he was minor panic, turns around spots his father at the head of the table goes running as fast as his little legs would carry him two feet away from the table he flung himself on his father's lap and he shouted, Abba, Abba. Jesus says this is the true posture of Christian prayer. A little Israeli child sitting on his father's lap, plucking his beard, calling Abba, Daddy, my Daddy. I'll never forget a retreat I gave in the Midwest several years ago. Large one, 7,000 or 8,000 people. Each night after the service, I went to this room for counseling, for healing prayer. One night, the line ended about 1 o'clock in the morning. I was exhausted. Went right to bed. 2 o'clock in the morning, rap at my door, a squeaky little voice saying, Brandon, can I talk to you? I get dressed. I open the door to a 78-year-old nun. Come on in, sister. Have a seat. What can I do for you? She began to cry. Little frail woman. Her whole body was just shaking with a sobbing. I felt helpless, utterly powerless. Finally, when her tears subsided, I asked her, do you want to talk about it? She said, I've never told anybody this in my whole life. It started when I was four years old. My father would crawl into my bed with no clothes on, and he would touch me there. And he told me to touch him there. He said that's what the doctors told him we should do to know one another better. when I was nine years old my father took my virginity and by the time I was 12 I knew about every kind of sexual perversion he'd read about in a dirty book she said Brennan do you have any idea of how filthy I feel I have lived with so much hatred of my father and hatred of myself I only go to the communion table when my absence there would be conspicuous I prayed with her for about 20 minutes for inner healing Then I asked his sister, would you be willing for the next month to go off to a quiet place every morning, sit down in a chair, close your eyes, upturn your palms, and pray this one phrase over and over? Abba, I belong to you. Abba, I belong to you. It's a prayer that's exactly seven syllables. And seven syllables corresponds perfectly to the rhythm of your breathing. You inhale on Abba, exhale, and I belong to you. At the outset, of course, you just say it with your lips. But then your mind becomes conscious of the meaning, and most importantly, in a figurative sense, you push your head then into your heart so that now, Abba, I belong to you, becomes what the French call un cri de coeur. A heartfelt cry from the depth of your being, establishing at the beginning of each day who you are, why you're here, where you're going. So pray, you can pray, driving your car, sitting in a classroom before a computer, sitting in church, frying an egg, watching TV, lying in bed. When you do this, I mean literally hundreds of times a day without moving your lips, and it becomes syncopated with the rhythm of your heartbreak, then you can, as Jesus says in Luke 18, pray all day long and never lose heart. I asked the old nun, would you try it? She said yes. Two weeks later, I received the most moving letter I've ever gotten in the ministry. This old woman described the inner healing of her heart, the complete forgiveness of her father, and inner peace she'd never known before. And she ended a letter this way. A year ago, I would have signed this letter with my real name in religious life, Sister Mary Genevieve. But from now on, I'm just Daddy's little girl. That is not sloppy sentimentality. That is a woman daring to pray with the simplicity, childlike candor, boundless trust, easy familiarity, and deep reverence that Jesus said would stamp the prayer of a disciple. Because of this central revelation of Jesus, and by the way, that great Lutheran biblical scholar, Yorker Mieramius, says the four-letter word, Abba, A-B-B-A, is the primary, most important revelation of Christ in the entire New Testament and has opened up the possibility of undreamed of, unheard of intimacy with God in prayer. If you were an Orthodox Jewish father going to work today, your children this morning would gather in the doorway, tug on your pant leg, and say, hurry home tonight, Abba. Imagine the shock and the scandal that Jesus caused when he went through Judea and Galilee. and invited his listeners to address the infinite transcendent God in the same colloquial form of address that their own children amused with him that very morning, that Jesus no doubt used with his foster father Joseph. Abba, Abba, I belong to you. Because of this central revelation of Jesus, no disciple of Christ can any longer picture God merely as the supreme being, whatever that means anyway, or the great hangman in the sky, or the invisible honorary president of outer space, or a celestial gas, or a genial George Burns, or a Dutch uncle, or a policeman in the club who's going to bat us over the head every time we stumble and fall. We cannot picture God as a niggling customs officer directing through our moral suitcases to set out our good deeds in bed. Because God is Abba, a whole new climate pervades the prayer life of a Christian. And Paul insists in Romans the climate is not one of fear and trembling, but rather one of loving, giving, and caring. Yes, caring for God. As John writes in his first letter, it's not that we are merely called God's sons and daughters. We are, in fact, God's sons and daughters, not by divine nature as Jesus is, but by divine adoption. and the Holy Spirit is important to our hearts that we too might cry, Abba. In Galatians 4, Paul writes, The proof that you are sons and daughters is the fact that God has poured forth into our hearts the spirit of his Son which cries, Abba. You're no longer slaves but sons and daughters, and the fact that you're sons and daughters makes you heirs of the kingdom by God's design. Now, if you really believe this, that the Abba of Jesus loves you unconditionally as you are, not as you should be, if you truly believe he loves you beyond worthiness and unworthiness, beyond fidelity and infidelity, if you honestly believe you've only checked in to the Hotel of Earth overnight, that you're en route to the heavenly Jerusalem, you're going to drink new wine forever at the Messianic banquet table, if you really believe that you are a child of your Abba and an heir of the kingdom of God, then in the words of John Powell please notify your face we could start looking like we're saved huh like we're going to the kingdom remember 125 years ago the atheist philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche reproached the group of Christian women he said, yuck, you make me sick. When their spokesperson asked why, he said, because you redeemed. Don't look like you're redeemed. You're as guilt-ridden, confused, neurotic, frightened, adrift in an alien environment as I am. I'm allowed. I don't believe in anything. But you people claim never save you. When are you going to start looking like you're saved? My friends, I didn't come way up here from the tropical weather of New Orleans to the tundra of Minneapolis. to mince words or beat around the bush or indulge in wishful thinking. My name is Brennan Manning. I'm a son of my Abba, and I'm going to that kingdom. The greatest gift I've ever received in my life from Jesus Christ has been the Abba experience. I can only stutter and stammer about the overwhelming power, And I mean specifically freedom from the fear of death. When I was notified last October 4th, ironically, the Feast of St. Francis of Assisi, that I had prostate cancer and didn't know how far it had spread. I mentioned last night my brother's been the hero in my family. I'm not a rock at all. I was astounded by the absolute freedom from fear. Not only the absence of fear, but I mean a genuine sense of homesickness. to penetrate the inner apartments of eternity where my Abba has promised me a very special place near to him. Freedom from the fear of life. Freedom from the fear posed by that awful threat of your own malice. Today you're going to betray Jesus. He said, no one knows the Son except the Father. And no one knows the Father except the Son. and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. A real relationship with the Abba of Jesus is always the sign of a life of mature Christian prayer. Jesus said, I'm the way, the way where? The way to the Father. I'm the truth. I share with you only what I receive from my Abba. I'm the life I pour out through the Holy Spirit, the very life I receive from my Abba. When I wake up in the morning, I prop a second pillow into my head, And the first word spontaneously out of my mouth are Abba, I belong to you. When I lay my head in the pillow at night, the last whispered word is Abba, I belong to you. When I ask myself, who am I? What's my primary identity, my coherent sense of myself? I never think of evangelist, of author, or husband, or father. I'm Abba's child. I am Abba's child. That's the most coherent sense I have of myself. Do you remember that scene in Luke 15 where the Pharisees are really strung out because Jesus is hanging out with turkeys, with riffraff, with ragamuffins, with the rabble or nothing about the law? They say, Jesus, you claim to be a prophet. Why do you associate with all these moral failures? And Jesus said, I'll tell you why. Because I know what my father's like, and you don't have a clue. Let me tell you a story. and Jesus proceeds to tell the parables of the prodigal who returns home to a joyful acceptance. For me, the most moving sentence in the entire Bible is Luke 15, 21. And while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and he took pity on him. he ran to him the only time in the Bible it ever says that God ran he ran to him in the Jerusalem Bible translates it he clasped him in his arms and kissed him tenderly that's the only Abba I know this broken down drunk Brennan Manning sleeping out in the beach in Lauderdale under the bridge until the cops caught me in doorways a drunken bum, a derelict the whole fabric of my moral life collapsed and when I came home it was my Abba running, stumbling tearing down the road. And the warmth of that embrace, that tender kiss. this is the God revealed by it in Jesus Jesus said he who sees me sees Abba You know, biblical scholars today speculate that the 148 times Jesus used the word Father in the four Gospels, he never once used the word Father, which is the English equivalent of the Greek pater. He always used the word, the Aramaic word, Abba. Why then do we find Abba only four times or three times in the New Testament? Once in the Gospel of Mark and then twice in Paul's letters to Romans and Galatians. And the biblical scholars are speculating that the word Abba was still too threatening. it was too intimate to first century Christians who had been raised in the Jewish tradition of you never even pronounced the sacred name of Yahweh under penalty of blasphemy and death. Once a year, the high priest and the Holy of Holies prostrated in the ground with incense, dared to whisper the sacred name of Yahweh. And then Jesus came and said, When you pray, you're to say, Abba, may your name be held holy. Abba, I praise you. You've hidden these things from the wise and clever and revealed them to little children. I think you and I have heard from the time we were this yay high that the whole purpose of the Christian life is to become Christ-like. As William Penn said, to be like Christ is to be a Christian. If this be true, then it surely is, then it is essential to understand that the central, most important theme in the personal life of Jesus Christ, the theme that lies at the very heart of the revelation that he is, is his own growing intimacy, trust, and love of his Abba. The inner life of Jesus is totally Abba-centered. You cannot turn a page of the gospel without hearing Jesus saying something like, My food is to do the will of whom we send me. I do nothing on my own. I don't know what I see my Abba doing. Jesus, your mother's outside. Who's my mother? Who's my brother? Whoever does the will of my Abba is my mother, my brother, my sister. Abba, I praise you. You've hidden these things. They're wise and clever. Reveal them to little children. Abba, glorify your son. Your son might glorify you. Abba, forgive them. They don't know what they're doing. This is the inner life of Jesus, growing intimacy, trust, and love of his Abba. and that relationship reaches its flood tide in Jesus' passion and death. We know from chapter 10 of John that Jesus knew himself to be a hunted man. There was a warning out for his arrest, and that's what gives the heavy sense of foreboding to the Last Supper scene. Finally, Jesus leaves the upper room. He goes out to the Garden of Gethsemane, where he gives himself over to the burden that he's been carrying. Apparently that night, it was revealed to Jesus fully what it was going to cost him to fulfill his mission as servant of righteousness over sin, And that awareness filled Jesus with such a sense of dread and terror that in the words of one theologian, Christ was like a trapped animal in the garden clawing for some way to escape. He sinks to the ground, and as Luke notes, his beads of sweat become drops of blood. At that moment, Jesus begins to pray. And what is the first word that arises spontaneously, pre-reflectively from his heart? Abba, literally, Papa or Daddy, Abba, if it's possible, let this cup pass me by. But let it be done your way, not mine. Jesus surrenders anew in trust, obedience, love to his Abba, rises from the ground, no longer in his sense of being a trapped animal, but completely at one with his father. He goes forward to meet his accusers. Now, following Luke's narrative, Jesus is taken from Gethsemane to the house of the high priest Caiaphas, who sends him to his father-in-law Annas. Annas sends him back to Caiaphas. Caiaphas sends Jesus to punch his pilot. Pilate sends him to Herod. Herod sends him back to Pilate. Pilate sends him back to the death sentence, and Jesus is led out to Calvary. The death of Jesus Christ on the cross is his greatest single act of trust in his Abba. He plunges into the darkness of death, really not knowing what lies on the other side, confidently that somehow, someway, his Abba will vindicate him. Jesus' voluntary disengagement from life is his greatest act of trust, hope, confidence in his Abba. It wins for him and every one of us fullness of life. The word he had spoken 20 years earlier to his mother in the temple. Didn't you know that he must always be where my father is? have brought him to this. How differently Mary must have heard that word as she stood at the foot of the cross. But now Luke leads us into the moment in Jesus' life that is more shrouded in mystery, denser with misunderstanding and incomprehensibility than any other. Jesus, the eternally beloved Son of the Father, the man whose life simply doesn't make any sense except in terms of growing intimacy, trust, and love of his Abba is abandoned. by his Abba. Sin appears to have its sway over the entire world. For the first time since he was a little boy, Jesus seems, feels himself to be without the sustaining presence of his Abba, and in the inner bleakness of forsaken aloneness, in the desolation of abandonment, in a scream that may have split the sky, Jesus cries out, Haley! Haley! Lama Zabak Dali! My God, my Father, why? Why have you forsaken me now? John of the Cross says it will never, ever be given to any human heart to understand the depth of desolation, indescribable loneliness, unbearable forsakenness that lie behind Jesus' cry, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani. I would repeat, I am speaking to the central, most important theme in the personal life of Jesus Christ, his growing intimacy, trust, and love of his Abba. And here on Calvary, even this, the felt experience. Once again, the felt experience of his Abba's presence is handed over in the final foolishness of love. That might be very well to remember. The next time you attempt to do a bend in quiet time, the word, silence, meditation, the worshiping community on Sunday morning because suddenly it's become so dry, so arid, so empty, so desolate. When your prayer life is desolate, you're in the company of some very great men and women of prayer. In fact, you're in the company of Jesus himself. Now, here's what I'm getting at. From what follows in Luke's gospel, there is no indication that Jesus ever lost trust or hope or confidence in his Abba. In fact, from what follows, it appears that the first ray of Easter light fell upon the cross on Good Friday. It is the considered opinion of the man who, in my mind, is the greatest biblical scholar in the world today, a Frenchman named Pierre Benoit, teaching at L'Ecole Biblique in Jerusalem, one of the great centers of biblical scholarship in the world. By the way, to meet Pierre Benoit is to meet a transparent window into Jesus. I had the privilege of living with him once in France for six months for the little brothers of Jesus. He lives a very poor life, a very simple life. And you'll often see him walking around with a pail of water in his hand and a towel over his shoulder. And when you ask him, what are you doing, Pierre? He says these are the tools that Jesus left his servant community. He literally washes the feet of every, because so many people in our community and friends wore sandals. And he's a brilliant biblical scholar, writes and speaks 11 biblical languages, has published over 30 books of exegesis, hermeneutics, in the Old and New Testament. And after 42 years of praying over the passion narrative in Luke's Gospel, Pierre Benoit believes that the Abba of Jesus spoke to his son as he hung naked and nailed to the wood, with the spit dripping down his face, his body bathed in blood. And Benoit believes the father spoke to Jesus in the words of the Song of Solomon from the Old Testament. Come now, my love. My lovely one, come. For you, the winter is past. The snows are over and gone. The flowers appear in the land. The season of joyful songs has come. The cooing of the turtle dove is heard in our land. Come now, my love. My lovely one, come. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice. For your voice is sweet and your face is beautiful. come now my love my lovely one come the father calling Jesus home to an intimacy of life and love that defy description where every tear is wiped away where there's no more mourning and no more sadness and Jesus seems to hear the voice of his father because his last word on the cross is a response from the powerful profound intimacy of his own heart Jesus cries out Abba, Abba I'm coming I'm coming home into your hands I commit my spirit into your heart. I commit my heart. Abba, it's finished. It's consummated. I'm coming home. And the torn, broken, lacerated body of Jesus Christ is swept up into his father's own final loveliness. Let me close by sharing with you why Benoit's insight is so meaningful and so very personal to me. Since I moved to New Orleans in 1982, I've gotten deeply involved in the only leper colony in the United States, which many of you may know is in Carville, Louisiana, about 20 miles beyond Baton Rouge and about 70 miles from where I live in New Orleans. I've been there many, many times, and every time I go over a healing service, I go from room to room visiting the lepers, or as they're medically called, the victims of Hansen's disease. By the way, leprosy, or Hansen's disease, is the least contagious of all contagious diseases in the world. No government employee in Carville has ever contracted leprosy from a patient in the 89 years it's been open. So there's nothing really heroic about hugging, embracing, kissing a leper, provided you can move beyond the often grotesque physical disfigurement that the disease has caused. On one of my visits, I'm skipping up the front steps, and a government employee came running toward me and said, Brennan, can you come quick and pray with Yolanda? She's dying. I carry the holy oils with me for anointing. I clipped to Yolanda's room on the second floor, and I sit down in a bed. This is a woman, 37 years old, who five years earlier must have been physically one of the most stunning, beautiful creatures that God ever made. I do not mean just a pretty woman or a cute woman or an attractive woman. I mean that kind of blinding physical beauty that would cause a man or woman to stop in the street and go, wow. Yolanda has the largest, most translucent, and most mesmerizing brown eyes I've ever seen, set in this exquisitely chiseled face with high cheekbones, long black hair down to a slender waist, a striking bust. Now the ravages of the leprosy have taken their toll. Her nose is pressed into her face. Her mouth is severely contorted. Both ears are distended, and she has no fingers on either hand, just two little stumps. Two years earlier, her husband had divorced her because of the social stigma attached to leprosy, and he's forbidden their two sons, boys 16 and 14, to ever go visit the mother, and the boys, terrified of physical abuse from the father, have dutifully obeyed. So Yolanda was dying literally, an abandoned, forsaken woman. I anointed her with oil, I prayed with her, and I turned around to put the top back in the vial of oil when the room filled with a brilliant light. It would have been raining when I came in. So without looking up, I just said, Abba, thanks for the sunshine. Maybe that'll cheer her up a bit. I looked out the window. Still raining, still dark, still overcast. I looked at Yolanda, and if I live to be 200 years old, I will never find the words to describe what I saw. Her face was like a sunburst over the sand days. It was like a thousand sunbeams streaming out of her face, so brilliant I literally had to shield my eyes. I've got to tell you this. guys my age ordained to the Catholic priesthood in the early 60s, we were trained. You never, never, ever get emotionally involved with people in ministry, especially with women. You're going to get so caught up in their grief, their loss, their pain, you're going to lose your effectiveness. So always maintain a certain kind of clerical wall, this kind of priestly detachment, so you can step back and give out these words of spiritual wisdom you told the people are dying to hear. Well, I have been victimized by a lot of that garbage, and it really was. But then you've got to remember, too, back in the early 60s, Catholics were not a biblically oriented people. In fact, when I was in grade school and high school, we were discouraged by the priests and nuns from reading the Bible. We've got our sacred editions. I'd ask, why shouldn't we read the Bible? And they said because of the danger of private interpretation. Remember 500 years ago, an Augustine monk named Martin Luther read the Book of Romans? walked out the door of the monastery, never came back. So, private interpretation is a very dangerous thing, so leave the Bible alone. So what we had was a biblically illiterate Catholic community in the early 60s, before Vatican II, and so I didn't know anything about the Jesus who wept over his city, who wept over his friend Lazarus, who did not pass through this world without emotional engagement, who was deeply caught up in his people's joys. You know, he sang their wedding songs, drank at the wedding feast of Cana, laughed, cried, but didn't go through with that emotional engagement. Well, God's been setting me free a lot of that uptightness. But with Yolanda, I still had a bucket of it. And here's the one about to jump out of her skin with joy. And in my most detached clerical voice, I said, Yolanda, you look very happy. she said oh father the Mexican American still has a slight accent she said oh father I am so happy I asked will you tell me why she said yes the upper of But Jesus just told me that he would take me home today. I don't know. Oh, Jesus. I don't do good with this. I know what to do. What did the Abba Jesus say to you, Yolanda? This is what he said, Byron. Come now, my love. My lovely one, come. For you, the winter is past. The snow over and gone. The flower appear in the land. The season of joyful song has come. The cooling of the turtle dove is out in our land. He said, come now, my love. My Yolanda, come. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice. your voice is sweet, your face beautiful but then he said come now my love my lovely one come six hours later her little leprous body was swept up into the father's own final loveliness later that day I learned from the staff that Yolanda was illiterate she'd never read the bible any other book in her whole life you know my friend on a given day at a specific hour probably when you least expect it the Abba of Jesus your Abba standing on the eternal shores is going to gently beckon to you come now my love my lovely one come for you the winter is past and without fear, anxiety, shame you're going to wade the rivers of living water according to Paul in 1 Corinthians. You're going to be reunited when you're known, loved, and lost through death. And then you're going to look into the eyes of your Abba. And you are finally going to understand a couple of things. One, the secret of the mystery is God is always greater. Two, Why he and he alone seduced and ravished the heart of his only begotten son. And lastly, you're going to fully appreciate why in his eyes you only have one name. You're my child. You're Abba's child. And no one will tear you from my hand. Would you gently close your eyes? Join me in prayer. As you center down and become aware of the presence of Jesus within you, recall his word. If anyone of you love me, you'll be true to my word and my Abba will love you. We will come to you and make our home within you. Your Abba, your Heavenly Father, is not just up there and out there as creator of the universe, but dwelling deep within you. In faith, crawl up in his lap. Become like the little child Jesus who must learn to resemble in order to enter the kingdom. Rest your head on his shoulder. recall that word from the Hebrew Bible the Lord takes delight in his people let your Abba enjoy you discover how much he likes you as the spirit mosey respond to his loving presence maybe a simple cry like Abba or Abba I belong to you or communicate in silence beyond words now it's quite probable that more than one person here tonight, despairs of ever having a real relationship with God as their Abba. Because their relationship with their human father, their earthly father, was either non-existent or negative. Maybe your father died when you were very little. You never knew him. Maybe your parents got divorced. You only saw your father in frequent visits. Maybe your father was alcoholic or chemically dependent some other way. Perhaps a traveling salesman on the road all the time. Maybe he was home all the time, but he was so rigid and inflexible, and he believed that if you spared the rod, you spoiled the child. There may have been physical abuse, verbal abuse, sexual abuse, or a simple neglect that made you feel like something was missing in you because other kids had fathers who loved them and yours ignored you. Maybe it was your mother who was so unloved herself and so desperate to provide food and clothes and a roof that she had no time for you. Maybe you got rejected by somebody you gave your heart to and that person said, I don't want to be with you anymore. But some experience of rejection is so powerful that you said, I'm never going to trust anybody again, completely, even God himself. Jesus wants us to have that real relationship with Abba so much he'll use all his healing power to overcome any kind of mental, emotional, psychological, spiritual block. So as we end the evening, I ask you to join with me in a prayer called the healing of memories. Take a risk, and in faith, slip your hand into the hand of Jesus and take a trip with him back down memory lane. Walk back to that person who wounded you, failed you, abused you, neglected you, rejected you. Try to picture the clothes the person is wearing. Does this encounter take place indoors or outdoors? Now see Jesus let go of your hand. See him walk up to that person who hurt you. And hear Jesus say to them, what you did was not a sign of malice, but a symptom of pain, a symptom of your own deep feelings of insecurity, inadequacy and inferiority. I see the sorrow, the true repentance in your heart, and I tell you, your sin is forgiven, forgotten, and washed away forever in my blood. Now see Jesus turn to you and hear him say, I want you to forgive this person as I have forgiven you. Every day you pray, our Father, forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. I want you to let go of any grudge you've been nursing, any resentment you've been harboring, any hatred you've been carrying in your heart. I want you to forgive as you have been forgiven. And perhaps you reply, Jesus, I've tried that. But the memories are still so vivid. The pain is still so real. The hurt is still so deep. Left to my own resources, I am helpless. But this moment, with you standing at my side, I rely no longer on myself. Jesus, I ask you to enter into my heart and touch any experience in my past that needs to be healed. You know me so much better than I know myself. Bring your love to every corner of my heart. And wherever you discover the wounded child, touch, console, release the little girl. the little boy within me. Walk back through my life, Jesus, to the moment I was conceived. Cleanse my bloodlines and free me from anything that might have exerted a negative influence at that moment. Bless me as I was being formed within my mother's womb and remove any barrier to wholeness that might have affected me during those months of confinement. Thank you, Jesus, for being there at the moment of my birth, to welcome me onto the earth, to assure me that you would never fail me or desert me. Jesus, I ask you to surround my infancy with your light and touch any memory that keeps me from being free. If I needed more of a mother's love, then lift me up into the lap of Abba, who is the mother and father of us all, the Abba who cried out through Isaiah, even if a mother would have forget her baby, and be without tenderness for the child of her womb, never will I forget or be lacking in tenderness for you. Ask Abba to rock me back and forth, to tell me stories, to fill in those empty parts of me which need the comfort and warmth only a mother can give. Jesus, I know I've tried to idealize my parents at times, but I know from age 8 to age 17 I can't remember anything that happened. If I have been deprived in the air of a father's love, let me be free to cry, Abba, with every fiber of my being. If I needed more of a father's love and security to assure me that I was wanted and loved very deeply, I ask you to hold me and let me feel your strong, protected arms. Give me renewed confidence and courage to face the trials of the world because I know my Abba's love will support me even when I stumble and fall. Walk back through my life, Jesus, and comfort me when others were not kind. Heal the wounds of encounters which left me frightened, which caused me to retreat into myself and erect barriers to people. If I have felt lonely, abandoned, and rejected by others, grant me, through your healing love, a new sense of my worth as a person and a new awareness of my dignity as Abba's child. Oh, Jesus, I just discovered the person I was standing before, who's crying out for forgiveness and begging for reconciliation. is wearing the clothes I have on right now. Yes, myself, Lord. For so long, I have been so unbearably hard on me. I have been disgusted with my own consistency, bored by my own monotony. I've crushed myself with savage self-condemnation. I believe you forgive me. that I've not been able to forgive myself. But this moment, Jesus, with you at my side, with you nodding your head, yes, I want you to forgive this person, your very own self. Jesus, in your name, and by the authority of your blood, I forgive myself for every time I fail my parents. The times I wasn't there when they needed me. The times I looked their love for granted, rather than with gratitude. the times that I judged them to be devils when honestly they were doing the best they could with what they had Jesus I forgive myself for all the times I failed my children and did not model to them the unconditional and tender love of Abba God for me Jesus I forgive myself for the times I sought sex without love and use another person to fill up my emptiness or to bolster my sagging ego. Jesus, I forgive myself for all the times I refuse to stand with you in the loneliness of your passion and death and sought to escape through the abuse of alcohol or the chemicals, through shallow friendships, through shallow reading, through workaholism, through constant travel. through a life of always in flight for myself. Jesus, in your name, I forgive myself for all the times I spoke badly of others, tried to ruin their good name or damage their reputation because they hurt me or because I didn't feel worthy of their friendship. Jesus, I forgive myself for the hours and days and weeks that I've squandered in self-hatred and shame because I could not believe that your compassion is greater than my sinfulness. Jesus, I look at you now. The tears in your eyes are like rivers of living water, washing me clean. I will never look back on my past again except to praise you for your unbearable forgiveness, your infinite patience with me, your tender love that keeps no score of wrongs. this night Lord Jesus Christ this third day of October in the year 1995 here on the campus of Bethel College I recommit my life to you my body, my mind, my spirit I thank you for making me whole I cry glory and praise to you as the spirit within me cries out Abba, Abba I belong to you and I grow still and listen as you say to me my little child I will change your name you shall no longer be called wounded outcast lonely or afraid I will change your name in your new name shall be confidence, faithfulness, joyfulness, overcoming one, friend of God, one who sees my face. Would you reach out and join hands? I'm going to ask you to pray for the person on your right. And I'll pray up here for anybody who's on the end so nobody gets left out. I'm going to ask you to pray for that person. for that the tenderness of Abba will overcome any resistance to experiencing their core identity as Abba's child. And so, like that little Israeli child, sitting on his father's lap, plucking his beard, calling Abba, Abba. In that spirit of intimacy, easy familiarity, profound trust and deep reverence, Let's pray together the beautiful prayer that Jesus taught us. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation. Thank you.
