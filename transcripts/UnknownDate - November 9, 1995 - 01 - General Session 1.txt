The issue of spiritual abuse. I'd like to preface my teaching this evening with the sharing of my personal perspective on this issue. How it is I came to this issue, how it is I came to the body of material that I have to share with you. And something that I think will be very helpful to you as you kind of process some of the things I'm going to be saying is the lens through which I see this entire issue. Primarily, the lens I see this through is through the lens of a senior pastor. I am a senior pastor. I've been here at Open Door for 15 years. And that puts me in a position of leadership. And I have tried to give leadership at the time that I've been here. And one of the things that leaders do is they lead. And they pray and they discern and they try to bring people along. But leaders kind of move in a direction. And whenever you do that and decide anything like that, there are going to be people who don't agree with that. So you can just assume over 15 years we've had our share of disagreements in the context of church life. There have been times when I've had to stand against certain things and sometimes people and I've had to say no. And so what that does around this whole issue is that it makes me feel particularly vulnerable to the fact that here you are, bugging us, spiritual abuse, who do you think you are? And I think I'm a master who doesn't feel like I'm in a real big perch about this thing. And so I just lay that out and leave that there. That's kind of my lens to which I see this. The second thing I want you to know is that the piece I bring to this entire conference is a biblical view as well. My piece is an exotesis of Matthew 23. The reason I kind of got pulled into this issue to begin with was not that I had any kind of perception of spiritual abuse or some desire to research it, but several years ago in the course of simply exegetically or expositorily going through the book of Matthew, I came to Matthew 23. Matthew 23 became, for our church and for me, one of the most incredible expos√©s of an issue that we had seen many times. In fact, when we were going through Matthew 23, we were going, this is exactly the kind of dynamic we've been ministering to in our church and trying to overcome in many people's lives. We didn't have biblical language for it until Matthew 23. The point is, my piece in this is to kind of establish around this issue of biblical framework and exegesis of Matthew 23. Obviously, in the two hours that I have, I'm not going to do all of Matthew 23, but that's another piece I just want you to know. The third thing I want you to know on the front end about me, and that is it relates to these spiritual abuse. I have a personal assumption, and that is this, that everyone in this room at some level is a victim of spiritual abuse, and that everyone in this room at some level is a perpetrator as well. And some may think, especially if you're really on the high end of feeling like a victim of this, you probably have a hard time seeing yourself as a perpetrator, And that's okay. I just want to know that my view is that all of us are having a strange boat. And probably, if you've been victimized, the chances might even be higher than you've been victimized. You've got to hurt people, hurt people. And this is something that's in your mind. But what it will do, if I'm right about that, what it will do is it will put some of us in an awkward position. The odd place is to hear some of these teachings of needing both healing and repentance. And I think that's an odd place. I think we see ourselves as being in one or the other in a lot of spiritual things. We need to repent, and then we do that. Or we need to be healed, and then we do that. This is one of those issues. And this was, in fact, one of the ways it landed on our church when we first began to unfold these teachings, was that people found themselves in that odd place of needing to repent and at the same time needing healing. So if you notice that, you're not out to lunch. The fourth thing is this. This issue of spiritual abuse, I want to say on the front end, is not a new issue. It's not the latest fad. Though the term spiritual abuse may be new to, relatively new anyway, to some of us, the reality of spiritual abuse is not. Moses, in fact, battled people like that in Egypt. Jeremiah confronted the issue in Judah. Ezekiel identified this interesting quote. Foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and see nothing. Jude spoke of deluded dreamers. Peter spoke of wells without water. Powerful imagery. Titus spoke of empty talkers. Paul and Galatia spoke of preachers of the gospel who are not preaching the gospel. Paul was a real gentle guy, beat around the bush, called these individuals dogs, evil workers, wolves that devour. In the chapter we're going to be dealing with, Matthew 23, But it's clear that Jesus has some names for this kind of person as well, as we will see, calling them, among other things, whited walls, vipers, his favorite hypocrites. But the truly disconcerting dynamic relative to this issue of spiritual abuse is that these empty talkers are not always easy to spot. The book that Jeff and I wrote was The Subtle Power of Spiritual Abuse. That was on purpose because sometimes the spiritual abuse that is taking place is one that is hard to discern. And you've been in it for a very long time before the lights begin to go on. And many of you, if you've been a victim of this kind of thing, called crazy for a very long time, defected for a very long time, it's a subtle thing very often. These empty talkers are hard to spot. They come in the form of safety. They come in the form of sincerity and spirituality. they are the leaders, the spokesmen, the representatives of God they are the priests, the rabbis, the pastors, the elders they are the guy we met up there they are maybe embodied in church if there's any place on earth I ought to be able to go to get some help and to get some healing and to get some comfort I ought to be in church but those are exactly the kinds of places sometimes where these dynamics happen and you pull all of that together the fact that it's hard to spot and sometimes the place it's happening the most painfully is among people who we thought were the safest. It generates fear and raises questions like this. How do we know? How can you tell? Who do we trust? I don't know if it's well through your mind right now, but some of you ought to be thinking, what about you? What about you, Dave? Oh, spiritual abuse guy. What about you? Well, I think that's a fair question. In fact, I think more than a fair question, I think it's a necessary question. I think it's a question people need to be empowered to ask. But the key, when we begin to ask that question, is knowing what to look for. And what we need to be aware of is that because someone does disagree with us, and maybe even disagrees with us strongly, does not by itself make that spiritual abuse. And sometimes when we've been disagreed with about an issue, and it could have been done respectfully, but very firmly, the accusation of spiritual abuse can be levied and the problem is that's a form of spiritual abuse itself so the question when we empower all of us to say body of Christ we need to have some discernment around this area and not be naive thinking that everyone who comes to the name of the Lord is in fact a servant of the Lord what do we look for? and that's where I think I've got some good news because we are not on this issue left clueless The fact is there are signs to look for. They are observable, objective. They are not hidden. They are not totally obscure, though sometimes they seem like that. In fact, when we go through Matthew 23, what I think happens, well, I hope it happens, is that we're going to find out that they aren't obscure at all. They were there all along. We saw them all along. It wasn't that we didn't see them. We just couldn't admit them. in Matthew 23 what we are dealing with contextually is Jesus' final speech in just a couple days after he says these things he's going to be nailed to a cross it's his final public appearance and in this it's interesting to me that contextually in his final public appearance he deals with this particular issue in it he gives in the first 12 verses at least 5 marks of a false spiritual leader 5 indicators of a well without water an empty talker, one who is following his own spirit. The first is this, verse 1, or verse 2 rather, a false basis of authority. False leadership is marked, first of all, by a false basis of authority. Let's read the text. Verse 1 says this, Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples. Stop right there. I want to set this up. The Pharisees that he is speaking about are in this context. This is happening in the courtyard of the Gentiles, the courtyard of the Gentiles in the outer court of the temple. The Pharisees are there. He is not speaking to the Pharisees. He is speaking to the multitude and to the disciples about the Pharisees. It doesn't sound like I'm squinting hairs here. It's going to make more sense when we come to verse 13, because in verse 13, he is no longer speaking about the Pharisees. He's going to turn and speak to them. We'll get to that in the second section. But right now, he's speaking about the Pharisees, describing them. And he says of them this. Describe from the Pharisees, have seated themselves in the chair of Moses. Stop right there. They have seated themselves in the chair of Moses. What that means is they have given to themselves a basis of authority, but the basis of their authority is based on something false. False criteria of authority. Let's break it down. The chair of Moses, what is that? Well, first of all, you need to know that it's not a literal chair. And I bring that up because there are things in the Old Testament that the New Testament makes reference to relative to things like in the temple that were literal things and is not making reference. There was an old chair called the chair of Moses. speaking of what we would refer to as the seat of authority I can understand it this way it's like at a university the chair of the philosophy department is the head of that department it speaks of leadership it speaks of authority it speaks of office and rank the Greek word there for chair or authority is cathedral Latin took that cathedral and in the Latin it made it a phrase ex cathedra a phrase you may be familiar with it means just to speak from a place of authority And so to speak ex cathedra is to speak in a way that is binding. And the reason it is binding is because I said so. It's ex cathedra. It's from a position of authority. And if I speak ex cathedra, it's binding because I said so. The key here, as it relates to the chair of Moses, the chair of Moses being a position or a metaphor of authority, and in the text is this, that ought to raise flags for us. It says they have seated themselves there. It's a huge flag. Notice it. It says they seated themselves. in this place? Who gave you your authority? They wouldn't answer it this way. Jesus is revealing it. I gave myself this authority. And the real key is this, that the basis of the authority that they gave themselves was their position, their office, and their rank. It would have sounded something like this. I am a Pharisee. I am a scribe. I am a pastor. I am a pastor. I am an elder. I am the chairman of the board. Therefore, I am the authority. What I want to say right now on the basis of this verse is that is a false basis of authority. Let me go further, pushing the envelope on this. Think with me for a minute. If I'm a pastor, and I am a pastor, and my criteria for authority is that I'm the pastor, that's all I mean, actually, it's kind of a great deal. I like it a lot. Because what that means is if my basis of authority is that I'm the pastor, I don't have to be right. I need to be the pastor. I don't have to be wise. I don'T have to be gentle. I don't have to know the word. I just have To be the pastor. I don't have to be discerning, Spirit-led, Mature, sensitive to God. I just have to be the pastor. Because I'm the pastor, I have authority. What that means is I have seated myself in the places of authority. That is a false basis of authority. You could be the nicest guy in the world, nicest woman inthe world. If that is your basis of authority, here's the deal. It will be abusive. When you see it run, do not pass vote. Do not collect under dollars. Get out of there. Let me poke around this a little bit further. When I talk like this, some people, I mean, if you're especially in church leadership, well, I mean, does this mean nobody has authority? Does it not have some authority in the church? No leaders have authority. Well, here's the deal. Moses did have authority. His authority was real. I think people followed Moses. In fact, in this passage, it was Moses' authority that everybody recognized as being a valuable thing, necessary thing. It was his authority that everybody else was trying to grab for themselves. Remember, it was the seed of Moses, and so they were kind of trying to discern or decide that that belonged to them. The fact is this, I believe, that even the authority that Moses had, and he did have it, did not belong to him. It wasn't his to wield. Things weren't true, in other words. They weren't authoritative, in other words, just because Moses said it. Now, fight with me here. Hang with me. Don't fight with me yet. Hang with me here a little bit. Just because he said them didn't make them true. Almost sounds like I'm blowing up in erroneous after I look at this thousands of years later. Here's the deal. His authority came from the fact that he spoke accurately and clearly and truthfully, that he accurately, clearly, and truthfully told the people what God told him. When Moses told the people clearly, truly, and accurately what God told him, some people didn't like that. They took issue with that. The authority Moses had was not just because his name was Moses. It was because he handled rightly the word that God had given him. The authority didn't rest automatically in him. It wasn't just because he was Moses. It was because somewhere along the line he was right. He spoke the truth. He was a humble servant who did what God told him to do. You don't have authority. Just because you're a scribe, an elder, a pastor, a chairman, somewhere along the line, if you want authority, you're going to have to speak the truth. You're going to have to make sense. You're going to have to be wise. You're going to have to know God. You're going to have to clearly say what he says. You can press this a little further. It's illustrated in a few different ways. Timothy, you may recall, was having trouble pastoring the church in Ephesus. There were some real obvious reasons why he would. I'm not going to go into them deeply, but one obvious reason was that Timothy in Ephesus was following a guy named the Apostle Paul. Every pastor who knows anything about going into churches knows that you don't follow the Apostle Paul. It's a tough act to follow. Timothy was doing that. He didn't have nearly the charisma and the power of personality, or maybe even the same measures of anointings in his life. And Ephesus was a tough church. Lots of chaos, lots of bizarre teaching. The Gnostics were very strong there, and his leadership was kind of slipping through his fingers. He clearly wrote to Paul a letter asking for some advice. In 1 and 2 Timothy, we have a record of Paul's advice to Timothy. And again, part of the advice, in fact, a large measure of Paul's advice was helping the struggling pastor who was having a hard time establishing authority. What's interesting to me is not only what Paul said to Timothy, but what Paul didn't say. I mean, I wish I could find a verse where Paul would say to Timothy, Timothy, just tell him you're no pastor. Just show up on Hepsis, your Sunday morning, go, I am the pastor. that'll just settle it. He said things like this. Timothy, here's what you do. You study to show yourself approved unto God, a workman that needs not to be seen, rightly dividing the word of truth. Rightly divide the word of truth. Timothy, I know you're in a tough place. In fact, evil men, verse 13, verse Timothy, chapter 3, and imposters are going to grow from bad to worse. So here's the good news. You got it bad now, it's going to get worse. Evil men and imposters are going from bad to worse. deceiving and being deceived, here's what you do. Stand up in front of everybody and go, I am the pastor. No. Say, do this. You, however, continue in the things you've learned, become convinced of, knowing from whom you've learned them, and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings, which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus. Timothy, remember this, that all scripture is inspired by God. It's profitable for teaching, for the proof, for correction, for training in righteousness. And you know what, Timothy? You're not smart enough to do all that. So bring out the word of God and teach the word of God and get away from your own agenda. Teach the word of God. Why? It's inspired by God. It's breathed by God. It's profitable. Teaching reproof. You don't know how to reproof. You don't know how to go after every little noise. Just teach the word that the man of God may be equipped, adequate for every good work. That's your authority, James Timothy. Give the people the word. Tell them the truth. The people who respond to the truth will discern the authority that you have. The Apostle Paul, in my view, has authority just because he said it. What I'm going to explain by that, what I mean by that is this. When I read Galatians 1 and 2 Corinthians, whatever it is that Paul wrote, my posture toward it is this. All I need to know relative to authority is that Paul is that he wrote it. It has authority. Two thousand years ago, Paul himself said something that in terms of his person indicates to me that he did not view his own authority as being something that was his just because he said it. Where would you get that, Dave? Galatians chapter 1. When Paul said this, if I, or in fact an angel from heaven, would come to you and begin to preach to you a gospel that is different than the amazing gospel of grace that I initially gave to you, let them be, what? A curse. That includes an angel from heaven, that includes me. Paul is empowering the people in Galatia to say, don't just take what I say, because I say it as being the truth. It has to be the truth. He's saying the truth, the authority. Playing this thing out, I think of Jesus himself when people heard Jesus speak. Among the responses that rang in the hearts of people was this, they marveled. But he spoke as one with what? Authority, he worked. And then, which is seen, not as described in the Pharisees. Who had the position, see where we're going here? Who had the position, who were assuming chapter 23, verse 2, that they had the seat of Moses. And I'm, why do you have authority? Because I'm the scribe, because I'm the Pharisee. The people, just in listening, yeah, I know they have the position. But they saw something in Jesus, who, by the way, didn't catch the position. Physically. He wasn't a scribe, wasn't a Pharisee, wasn't the pastor, but he had what? Authority. Why? I think he said he told the truth. And people could tell. Even the basis of Jesus. I mean, I just think this is incredible. It was not his office rank, title, and position. Now, what I trust is this, that the men and women who have the kind of authority that's discerned in the body because men and women who tell the truth needs to rise, for those who are mission. Understand? So, we would have men and women with real authority, in positions of authority, but their authority is not vested in their position. It's vested in the life and character, the fact that they call the truth. First mark of false leader, verse 2, is this, false basis of authority. They seek themselves in the position of authority. Second mark is a lack of integrity, a lack of congruity, I would call it, a lack of genuineness. Verse 3 says, Therefore all that they tell you do, observe, but do not do according to their deeds, for they say things and do not do them. That's a lack of integrity. They say, but do not. A little nuance here in the text. all that they tell you, do and observe. In fact, even Pharisees and false leaders use Scripture. Even false leaders say true things from time to time. I love the quote. I don't remember where I heard this. I've heard it many times, so I've lost track until I get this mind. Even a broken clock is right twice a day. So these guys are saying true things from time to time, and when they speak the truth, obey it and listen to it. And when they're speaking the Scriptures and are rightly dividing the Word, listen to it, but he's telling people here to put on their thinking cap. He's telling people here some revolutionary things about backing up and thinking and discerning about who it is they submit to. Do not do what they do. For they say things and do not do them. They're phonies without reality. Lots of superficial religious rules, but no real holiness. They tithe, build, and mention human. We'll hear that later on. do that, but they neglect the weightier matters of the law, like justice, mercy, and faithfulness. Galatians 6, 12, and 13, they make a good share of the flesh and try to compel you to do the same, but they don't have life. They say, but they don't do. There's no integrity. There's no congruity. We're not going on a witch hunt here. We're just telling you what to look for. We're just telling you what to look for. You see a lack of integrity. Don't wonder what you think. This one is intriguing to me, and maybe I would appeal again to the lens I'm wearing on the pastor. And so I kind of take something like that, and I look at my own life, and I ask some questions that I don't think the only pastor should ask, but we should all ask. But how does that happen? How does a double life thing happen? I don't think any of us will ever forget. Well, I know I will never forget the images kind of branded in my mind and in my spiritual psyche of Jimmy Swaggart, calling Jim Baker cancer in the body of Christ for his sin, and all the while, when he was doing that, and you remember these things as well, he was doing the same. At the time that some of what Swaggart was involved in was discovered, it was also interesting, not in a fun way, in a sad way, that while these things were being discovered about his particular double life because he was in the middle of a series on Rahab the harlot and the whole time he was going to one. How's that happening? Well, people a lot smarter than me have tried to figure that out. And so I do not have it just been an advancement maybe after peace. Number one, I think people get deluded literally to the point where they do not see. 1 Timothy 4.2 is a verse we would just say must apply to unbelievers. I think it happens to people. It says this. People get to the point where they speak lies with hypocrisy in their consciousness and seared with a hot iron. Meaning this, they don't even know it anymore. They don't even see the dichotomy anymore. If I was in a seminar right now and all that was here was pastors, I would begin to talk about some of what the ministry can do a person, a man or a woman, where sometimes we're out there cranking out all this knowledge and cranking out all these lessons and exegeting it. It's happening so fast. There's so many things to carry that the whole concept of self-care or something that is absolutely lost. And without evil intent or desire to defraud people, there comes this insane kind of lifestyle that has no time for the personal humanity. And before you know, there really is a seared conscience and medication in places that are horrible. I think another thing that happens slowly with this being believed, I think people get trapped, not just leaders, But leaders, for sure. Think about the Jimmy Swaggerson. I don't want to pick on him, but it's distant enough, I guess, and it's public enough just to know that I'm kind of sensitive to singling him out. But I do not believe that such people set out to be hypocrites. I mean, I don't think you think that either. I mean, they didn't wake up one day and, well, I'm going to lie and hate and hide my sin. And I know what I would like to just destroy my whole life. In fact, what I think is that in all probability, the very sin that finally got discovered in them is a sin that they despise, that they honestly despise. Now when I see Jimmy Swaggart with his tears screaming down his cheeks, and he feels like he's sinned, I believe the shame and the anguish is real. I think he hates what he did. I think when he did it, he hated what he was doing. I think right after he did whatever he did, he hated what he was doing. I think there's a possibility that from his youth, he hated the fact that this particular arena of his life was one where he had no control. Play that out as a possibility. From his or her youth, there was this arena of life where there was no ability to get it out, no talk about it. It's just this evil, ugly thing. And the trap, I said one reason people get into this double life is because they get trapped. trap, not in every system, but in a system that would set someone up, who ultimately even would become a leader, who would then be spiritually abusive, double life, is this, that all too often in the church, the only method for dealing with our sin in a religious community is to put a cap on our sin, to put a lid on those things that we find ourselves even disgusting, and would like to have some freedom around, and the only method we're giving us, put a lamp, a lid on it, crank down really hard, and let's just have this church that has all sorts of constraints and restraints and injunctions and edicts and prohibitions, and if this sin starts to sneak out, we'll yell louder, this is evil. If I'm on to something here, I don't think this is the only reason, but if I'm on to something here, you really hate your sin, the heart loves God, knows it's not about knowing what's right and wrong, I know what's right and wrong. This is wrong. I hate this thing. The only thing I've ever been given is restraint, crank it down, yell louder. I know one way that I can restrain this thing my whole life. Do you think of it? I'm going to the ministry. I preach about it every Sunday. And I will, in that, provide for myself a context, a system, a safeguard, wherein I will utilize weekly, daily, The only thing I know to restrain my sin, and that is to really try not to do it, and I'll just yell and scream about it, will be the church that becomes known as what we're against. My preaching will protect me and provide some of the discipline that I need to restrain the sin I hate, really hate. William Barclay did a study on Pharisees. In studying Pharisees, he found that there were a number of different kinds. And one of the categories, what he did was he kind of gave all the different categories of Pharisees, different types of Pharisees' names. One of the categories that he discovered was that he named the bruised and bleeding Pharisees. And the title will make sense in a minute. Let me tell you a little bit about it. They were people who really cared about morality. Okay, so let's assume a good heart. They wanted to do the God thing. They wanted to turn their heart and turn their feet and turn their hands from evil. The method they chose to keep their hearts pure and their lives moral was that they would wear these squitted frocks in such a way that they couldn't see anything. They would put their head down, hide their eyes from sin. When they would go in public, they would be totally looking at the ground. And the reason they were called bruised and bleeding is because they kept falling downstairs and running in the walls. And we might think that's ridiculous, but whatever else it speaks to, it speaks to a heart that doesn't want to put its hand on sin, and the only method it knows about to find restraint is in trying really hard. And it's amazing when that's the method sometimes we give in the church. And you hear passages like this in Colossians 2, verse 20, submitting yourselves to three such as do not handle, do not face, do not touch. These are matters which have to be sure the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and spirit treatment of the body, but are of no value against selectively indulgence. I remember the first time I read that verse. I think it was in the middle of college. It was college. And my first response was, wow. My second response was, I was a little angry because I never in my whole life heard that decision. because pretty much the way I have been doing it to deal with things that I hated in my life, so put the lid on, don't talk about it, change it down. Here's the deal, the scary deal. If your method for dealing with sin is to crank it down and hold the lid as hard as you can with your effort, one day the lid will blow, and when it does, there will be bodies everywhere. Yours, your family's, and if you're in leadership, there will be more bodies. Somebody might say, well, I know this is the only method in the list of people. Yes, sir. It may not blow, but somewhere along the line, somewhere along the line, if this really is the only method you've got to do, somewhere along the line, you are finding a place to go like this. It's the alcohol you drink that nobody knows. It's the pornography you have that nobody knows. It's there's some way of coming out. And let's say you are just Superman or Superwoman, and you crank it down, and you don't even go, whoo. I wouldn't want to be a person who lives with you. It's all cranked down, and it's based on, it's fooled with denial, and it's never able to come out because of all this shit. I'm not going to do it. What I'm going to talk about in my seminar tomorrow is the value of more. It's going to be a person who lives to do. And when I get to that, we'll just attend what I'll be in the rest of the day. So part of the reason I say that is to kind of recognize that there are people who have lived a double life and are trying to be a producer. But there was some stuff going on in them that would be good for them as well. It doesn't make them not responsible for what they're going to say about. It helps them understand. And sometimes in our healing process, it's extremely important for us to do that so we can start forgiving people. And that's what that's going to do. Next characteristic is this. They tie up heavy loads. Verse 4. They tie up heavy loads, lay them on men's shoulders. They're unwilling themselves in order to move a finger to lift them. The characteristic of a false system or a false layer is they weigh people down. If you forget everything else I'm going to say about this particular dynamic, just keep it simple. Keep it simple that when you're in a system or a church or under this kind of ministry, it just feels heavy. It just feels heavy. I mean, you don't need to get any more sophisticated than that. Pay attention. The picture here of weighing down is one that would be common in Palestine. The picture here is that of a guy loading up a donkey. Again, it would have been a common sight in Palestine. And what they would routinely do, the donkey in Palestine would have been the first century version of a Ford pickup truck. And, you know, you throw all your junk in the pickup and you carry all your stuff around. They didn't have pickups, they had donkeys. And so you would pile everything on the donkey. And the picture here, again, coming at Palestine, would be of somebody walking down the road with a donkey. And, you know, let's just put stuff on there. There's parcels, and there's stuff, and there's chairs, and there's the kitchen sink, and everything you own is on this donkey. And there's so much stuff coming off the side, coming off the side, going off the back, going off the front, that all you see is this mound of junk going down the road. You don't even see the donkey anymore. You just see this pile of stuff. weighing, plowing up heavy loads, and here's the guy who owns a donkey, hitting them in the rear end with a switch, not doing one thing to lift the load. That's the first. That's the analogy. Kicking into the spiritual arena, Jesus is not speaking about donkeys here. That's the illusion. He's speaking about people who are in religious systems, who have had so many things dumped on them relative to religious expectations, and what you have to do and what you have to carry to get God to like you, that the weight is coming off this side, coming off this side, it's coming off the front, it's coming off the back, who they are has absolutely disappeared. You can't even see the person anymore. How many of you relate to that? You lose your humanity. You've lost your, you know, in the name of God, you've lost your humanity. I am a visual person, so this donkey thing works for me, and now this person who's got all this junk all works for him, and he's all the way down. And what I picture now is being a little Baptist kid where I grew up, and I've got all my stuff, And now, now, here's the word, evangelize. Okay, okay. Anybody care for a little forever, like me? Nobody signed up. What kind of load should they put on? The most obvious load that I would talk about theologically here that would be put on people would be specifically the load that the Pharisees and the scribes put on. And it would be classic works righteousness theology. Works righteousness theology is one that I think most people in this room would spot in a minute and run like a dickens away from you. It says this. God is counting up your good behavior, and he's counting up your bad behavior, and here's the good news. If your good outweighs your bad, God might accept you. So you carry the load, hoping that someday, someway, somehow, you'll do enough. Here's the bad news. It's never enough. And so because it never is enough, or it never feels like it's enough, what you do to try to make it feel like enough is you add what? You add some more. You pick up some more religious, and maybe you went to this church, and they had all these rituals and things, and so you took them all on, and you did them, and you carried them like a good donkey, and you still didn't feel life, so you went to another church, and they had a bunch of other stuff to add, and so you added all that too, and you still didn't feel it, and you keep on piling up expectations, regulations, rituals, rules, and the load keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and if you're in a system like this, if you ever do stumble under the weight of that, get tired and fall, go weary, the ministry to you in a system like that, whose job it is to keep on putting the weight back on you, will not be to lift the load. It will be, on one hand, to shame you for not doing enough. You probably didn't really care. The problem is you weren't really committed. Let's say you're a system that puts heavy weights on people but doesn't do anything to lift it off, but you're a nice system like that. So you You wouldn't shame them and, you know, just beat them up. You would encourage them, try a little harder, do a little more. You can do it so it would be a positive approach to putting weight on people. Please note one thing that's interesting. In this works righteousness theology, where your hope is that your good outweighs your bad, the weight that you carry is both the good and the bad. I don't know if that resonates or that does anything to you, But the gospel of grace is this, that your sin is eradicated. The weight of your sin is taken away by amazing grace. In this system, you carry the weight of your sin. You also carry the weight of all you're doing good. And if you've been in a system like this, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Because even your good behavior, if it's not born of the Spirit, born of amazing grace, even your good behavior is an enormous weight. It's going to church, reading your Bible. Going to church and reading your Bible for a redeemed person is a wonderful joy. If it's how you get God to like you, it's an unbelievable way. The false system, nothing's done to lift the load. Contrast that to Matthew 11 when Jesus is coming into a system just like that. I mean, I just see him with tears looking at his people saying, just come unto me all you little years. What's he talking about? He's talking about daughters that have got all the way through. I'm going to say, come unto me all you guys who are tired of having this stuff done. And I will give you more to do. Yeah, yeah, kind of. Get ready to punch me, I'm sorry. I will give you rest. Now, in fact, I started this by saying that most of us would spot that as being wrong. And that is not the evangelical message one I gave you. And I'm not sure the next one I'm going to give you is the evangelical message either, but it's the one many of us have heard. And it would go something like this. After we came to realize Jesus 2, 8, and 9, the grace of the faith, and not of yourself, It's a gift of God, not a blessing, it's an imagined hope. After you've realized that, for salvation, somewhere along the line, somebody gave you the load back, not for salvation, but for living. Somebody gave you the load back for sanctification. In other words, it would go like this. For salvation, we would be very careful to hand people Jesus as their only possible hope for salvation. And then when we would move into sanctification, We would not be as consistent in handing to them Jesus and the power of the Spirit as their only hope. Certainly, your will is involved and it needs to be engaged. But I'm talking about redeemed people who have a new heart and therefore have a new desire. And if they don't, I question if they're redeemed. And now I hand to them, not Jesus, but themselves as their hope for salvation or sanctification and service. And now, even though I'm redeemed, I'm living the same way I used to before I was redeemed. I'm saved. But in terms of my life, I'm still carrying the Lord. It's still all I'm doing. More Christians than maybe we would like to admit have been given this message, that the method for holy living, the only hope they have for holy living, is to simply try hard, do more. It's up to you. So we pile up expectations, regulations, traditions, rituals, and rules. A real simple mark, a false system that they point to you as a bearer. They point to you as a bearer. They point to you as a source of salvation. We would spot that. They point to you as a source of sanctification. And they point to you as a source of service. It's your power. It's your ability. It's you. Just buckle up and do it. We wouldn't spot that as a bearer. And that's, by the way, what abuse is for many. I wouldn't call it abuse. Maybe that's too strong a word. It's going to be a joy. It's going to be a terrible. Two shepherds points into the teaching. I mean, it's not that hard to spot. It's hard to admit. It's hard to weigh through a bunch of stuff. But if two shepherds are not that hard to spot, one of the things I'll make you see is point to the teaching. One way or another, you'll find them pointing to Jesus. They're only going for salvation, for sanctification, for service. They'll talk about responsibility. They'll talk about obedience. They'll talk about stewardship and discipleship. But at the bottom line will be this, men and women in our flesh, we can't crank this out and develop a community hungry for the power and the life of the Spirit, who is our only home friend. The shepherds not have had a spot before the faith is done. We only have every aspect of the life. All shepherds, hard to stop, they might hand you to Jesus for salvation, but they won't go hand you to you. They'll praise God for you, and the Lord comes back to you. This thing of putting weights on people, this is another thing I had to look at through the lens of being a pastor. So the question I asked myself, if I were to do that, why would I do that? What would be the payoff to me of putting loads on people? And my theory in that is that at least the party could be with the initial control. I mean, that's not the answer, but that was my answer. What I would do. Here's the deal. I think if I can make you feel guilty. Now, I can try to make you feel guilty, and you might not buy it. Then I don't have to be controlled. But if I could put a load on you and convince you that God doesn't love you unless you do what I just said, I could pretty much control everything you do. I think I could get you to give. It's giving good, yeah. I think I could get you to pray. I think I could get you to go to church. I think I could get you to go to church Sunday night, Sunday morning, Wednesday night. If I could convince you, if I could put a load on you that convinced you that God didn't really approve of you very much unless you did this list of things I gave you, If I could give that and you would accept it, I could control your life. I could control your life. And I could get people to come, and people who even hated coming to stay. That'd be great. My little kingdom would be secure. And the reason people would give, and the reason they would come, and the reason they would maybe teach Sunday school classes, is because the Spirit of God moves in them. But I think that they're willing to listen to God, which is what's different from people who teach people who are listening to God, and they're listening to the Spirit of God. God gives you that gift. My job is to teach you how to learn to listen to that. I don't want anybody to teach you how to listen to that. But sometimes you can't wait, so you put the load on. And if I put the load on you, most people would like to get the load off. They know that you get the load off. They need to get the load off. They don't want to get the load off. They do because they do. They carry. Except for not their heart to spot. They take the burden off. They point to the music. Christ is my born, and we're feeding the Christ in the street. Don't be subject to the end when we go to slavery. Oh, hey, but if we take off the weight, what is going to restrain us? If you take off the pressure, how are you going to get people to obey and give and serve? That's easy. If God's in them, he'll be back. I don't want to be glib about that. People have responsibility, and true shepherds teach responsibility and discipleship, and it's time to grow up in our faith. but Paul also said this I am confident that this spirit can begin with now if I'm not convinced the spirit's in you I've got no confidence at all that the spirit's going to continue that work Hebrews 10 says the mark of the new covenant is I'm going to take a long I'm going to write it on men's hearts and women's hearts and they will be careful to keep my ordinance because my spirit is in them causing them to walk in my stash it's actually a few people chapter 3 6 we read that I love this passage which relates to in internal motivation. I will sprinkle water on you. It's speaking of the new covenant to come that Ezekiel didn't experience, but he saw it prophetically. And you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from your idols. Moreover, I will give you a new heart and I will put a new spirit within you and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. Here's the best part. And I will put my spirit in you. And I will put my spirit in you. As a pastor, I have to believe that. See, I'm talking to people who have the life of God in them, and if that's true, the people in my congregation who have the life of God in them, it's really there, that spirit will cause them to walk in my statutes. I'm going to tell them about the statutes. It's not my job to cause them to walk in it. It's my job to tell them about it. See, if what's going to restrain sin, how are you going to do that? Somewhere along the line, past, we're going to have to believe God. The gospel is true. Another mark, or not a mark, but another load, I've given you two, the works righteousness, the works righteousness that says salvation but not sanctification. Another load is a little bit different. It's when shepherds use the seed to promote themselves. That's an incredible load. It's called merchandise in 2 Peter 2.3 says, The way of the truth is maligned because the greed is merchandise. Zechariah 11.16 says, They don't care for the parishioners. That's not what motivates their ministry. They don't seek the shattered and the scattered. They don't heal the broken. They don't sustain the one that's standing. But they find the ones who are rich and they find the ones who can give and they find the ones who can make their kingdom look better. that's my paraphrase of these words, but they devour the flesh of the fat sheep. They find the ones who can serve their personal agenda, they shear them, and they tear off their hooves. The load that's being put on here is what I call role reversal, where rather than the shepherd being their sheep, the sheep are there for the shepherd. And that's the incredible load in the end of the following. Seekil 34, incredible passage around this. The Spirit of the Lord is speaking to the shepherds. It says this. And I'm going to read this whole thing in August 1st. Just let it sink in. I'm not going to comment. The Son of Man prophesied to the shepherds of Israel. Prophesied to the pastors and churches. The church of open door. Prophesied and say to them, Thus says the Lord God, Woe to you, the shepherds who have been feeding yourselves. The shepherds need to feed the flock. If you eat the fat, you pour yourself in the poor. When you slaughter the fat sheep without feeding the flock. Those who are sickly are not strengthened. The diseased, you haven't healed. The broken, you haven't bound up, and that's your job. This is kind of surprising, that I've done. It's a surprise that I've seen. But the force of security is dominated. I said I wouldn't even come in. This is Old Testament. What did I say at the beginning? This is not a new issue. The force of security is dominated. And the result is they're scattered for lack of a shepherd. And they became food for every beast of the field. Why are people going to the cult? They became food for every beast of the field. They got scattered. My flock wandered through all the mountains and on every high hill. And my flock was scattered over all the surface of the earth. And there's no one to search for me. Therefore, you're a shepherd for the name of the Lord. As I may be the Lord. Because my flock has become a prey, my flock has even become food for all the beasts of the field from lack of a shepherd. And my shepherds did not search for them. But rather, the shepherds fit themselves. They will reverse them. They did not search for the flock. Therefore, we shepherds in the world anymore. I'm against you. I'm against the shepherds. Really? I'm a pastor. I hear that, okay? I got to do it. And I shall demand my sheep. I'm done. I will take these from you. you won't have sheep anymore, and make them cease from feeding seeds, so the shepherds will not feed themselves anymore, but I shall deliver my flock from their mouth. The days may not be true. And I think that's what Jesus saw in Matthew 9, and he said, I see the multitude. And when he saw the multitude, he called compassion, because they were distressed, and downcast, and she was out of love. Matthew 10, the original sending of Jesus, Very obscure passage in Scripture. Not that many people know about it. We know about Matthew 28 when he said, go get the world. Matthew 10, he gave them the same authority in Matthew 10 that he gives them in Matthew 28. I give them authority. Go out and preach the king and do the king. And then he said this, but before you go out, just notice, do not go by way of the Gentiles and the Samaritanes. First, take this kingdom message from the Washington, the house of Israel. I took that to me years ago when I read that verse, this passage was that before you do evangelism, You've got to bring the good news back to the people in the church. It's simple that doesn't sound like good news anymore. The people will start having testimonies like this. I feel born again. Do that and then do the work. Fourth characteristic of false leaders, they wear their religion. On the outside, back to Matthew 5. 23, right? Matthew 23. Verse 5. But they do all their deeds to be noticed by men. They broaden their flatteries, they lengthen the tassels on their garments. Next characteristic, you know, don't be looking for this, but when you see it, don't wonder what you have. He broadened their flag. What in the head is a flag. Oh, he's broadening his flag. My all cannot agree. Where this whole thing is taken from is Deuteronomy 6, 8, and Deuteronomy 11, 16. Both those verses say this, And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind. You should bind them on your hand and your shoulder. Bind them as a frontal on your head. Now, Jews knew what that meant when God delivered that word. And what they knew it meant was this. Let your love of God be the controlling factor in what your hand does. Bind it on your hand. Let your love for God with your whole heart. And that's sanctification, by the way. The love of God, internal transformation love of God, affects what I put my hand to. That's sanctification. Let your love of God affect your hand, and let it affect your mind. Let it be the controlling factor on how you think and how you act. But, over time, what was meant for the heart got lost on the heart, because the hearts of men and women grow cold. And what was meant for the heart, if the heart is cold, it has a tendency to crawl to the outside and become some religious duty that we perform. For the Pharisees, it became a way that they could parade their piety, and they literally took these commands, love the Lord your God with all your heart, and they literally bound them on their wrists, thinking that that's when they were obeying the work. And they took little boxes, and they called them flack trees, and they bound them here. In fact, I did some research on this, and I don't remember all of this, but they had very elaborate ways that they would strap it. You couldn't just strap it on with, you know, some tape. You'd wrap it here and up here and down through this finger and then this finger and around, you know. And then they'd broaden them, make them big, which meant, what, I really love the Lord, my God, and then they would plaster them on their head, and then they would broaden them, so you'd walk around with a big thing, and that meant they really loved it. Believing that by what they did and how they dressed, they could be set apart as being cut above. Galatians 6, 12, Paul refers to people like that, as those who make a fair show in the flesh. Flactory, the word literally, does mean what some of you kind of thought, and I don't know if that's not what it sounds like. Yeah, it means it's means of protection. That's what it's called flactory is the word that we are more familiar with. And actually, it was borrowed from pagans who wore charms to ward off the evil spirits. Little would be just charms to protect the ward off sin. And that would be this little thing, that would be this little charm. And what that does is give me one more thing other than God. One more thing other than God. It's not my love for God. It's the cool thing I have here. And then you can use your own imagination. We're running out of time here. But in terms of the ways that we would spend energy broadening our flexors, making sure people would see and notice, That's characteristic of a false system of false leaders. They require, literally demand the accolades of people. Verse 6, they love the place of honor at banquets and the chief seats in the synagogue. Respectful greetings in the marketplace of being called by man, Rabbi. But do not be called Rabbi, for one is your teacher. You are all brothers. Do not call anyone on earth as Father, for one is your Father who is in heaven. And do not be called leader, for one is your leader. And that is Christ. What is that about? We'll end up with this one. Let's start our next session. They require the accolades of analysis break. It's a little bit. The place of honor at banquets, they have to have. That's like the speaker's table. I was reading this, and I was going, well, what's wrong with that? You know, being a speaker, maybe it's a sign of humility. If I'm the speaker at a banquet, I would refuse to sit at speaker's table. I'd be okay. But I don't think that's the point. In fact, what I think is there's nothing wrong at all with sitting at the speaker's table. The place of, let's forget the speaker's table. There's nothing wrong at all with sitting at the place of honor. In fact, you know what? I hope everybody in this room at one time in their life, maybe more than one time in their life, gets to sit at the place of honor. Let me tell you a story about that in our church. We had a lady here. Her name was Judith. And she was a servant. She was here long before I ever got here. And she's with the Lord now. But she was the kind of woman, and I think every church ought to have something like this, sweet spirit. But she was here before the staff got here, and she was here after the staff left. I may be stretching a little bit. This is pretty much got the sacred in our church now. But we were pretty young, blind, very energetic, and good-hearted lots in those early days. So it took us a while to notice it, but we finally did notice that he was a special person. And after it finally sinking through that this was somebody who needed a place of honor sometime, we decided we would have a surprise thing for Edith. At least once, I heard the whole staff would be together. One of the places she did all the work, she did the flowers and that kind of stuff, but she could always be found in the kitchen. That's where she was, so we learned how to lunch with her. But we had no idea how we would keep the surprise that she was always in the kitchen, so we told her we were going to honor this guy named Ted, and so we put her in charge of the whole banquet. I know that was mean, but we were young and all that, and we weren't totally cured. And we had a cake, you know, we love you, Ed. You know, her name was Edith, and thanks so much, and something like that. And I'll never forget, we had these chairs downstairs in the fellowship hall, and this table set up, it was a big U, you know, kind of a horseshoe shape, and all the staff came downstairs and filled all these chairs up, and lunch was about to happen, and Edith was where Edith was, and that was that she was standing at the door of the kitchen, leaning on the door, because all the work was done, and she was just beaming, because she couldn't wait to find out about this Ed thing, and this is what she does, this is what she wants to do. And everybody turned to her and said, this is for you. this is for you she fell apart in a good way and then we had lunch and she was just oh you know we almost had to drag her to the place of honor and we sat her down and we ate and had a wonderful time and then we went around the circle and everybody told her what they appreciated her I remember her what's the point what the point is everybody's on a certain place of honor there's nothing wrong what's in this place of honor you got a flaming light when you have people There's something very wrong with that. Don't go looking for that, but don't wonder what you've got. When you got that, it's false. They are not false, brethren. There is something in the soup, though. There's something wrong with that. Be called by men rabbi, reverend. Lots of stories around this, and I'm out of time. I want to just kind of clear up this thing about don't let anybody call you rabbi, father. I mean, this is a great verse of what Catholics some people think. I don't think it is. Rabbi speaks of knowledge. Rabbi speaks of knowledge. More than knowledge, he speaks of source of knowledge. And when I hear Jesus say, don't let anybody call you rabbi, I don't think he's saying, he's not giving this, you know, legalists will hear that and go, I mean, some people call him Jesus rabbi, and he'll go, I rebuke you. What I think he's saying to leaders here is don't let anybody treat you like you're a source of knowledge, because you're not. and don't even treat yourself like that. Leaders are leaders. I mean, I think, you know, there's not a rule here that says don't ever call anybody a leader. I think you're a leader, Dave. No, I'm not. I don't let anybody call me a leader. I'm a leader. I'm a leader. What is this about? This is about leadership speaks of authority and direction. And I think the word of Jesus here is this. You are not the source of authority. You are not the source of authority. You are not the source of direction. The Father speaks of the source of light. I got this for you. you know, not the source of light. God is the source of light. Put it all together. One of the ways to the spot of Paul's shepherd is this. In subtle ways, it's the subtle power. In subtle ways, they will point to themselves and present themselves as the source of knowledge, the source of authority, the source of light. We had to sit up here and that guy was presenting himself pretty much as the source of knowledge. Two shepherds, so he's in the spot. One of the things you'll find in the consistent mood is pointing to an offering in Jesus. In one way or another, not necessarily this very way, but in one way or another, you'll hear them saying, He is our only source of knowledge. He is our only source of direction. He is our only source of guidance and authority. And He is our only source of life. And if any of you, a true shepherd, would say, want to make me the source of life? And some people do, by the way. That's kind of the reverse thing that happens to pastors. See, I've seen this whole thing through my life. I want to make the pastor the source of authority. How come you don't know? Well, there's something else I don't know. and they want to make you the source of authority and later you are the source. Everybody who's ever tried to make me the source of knowledge, authority, guidance, and life has been very disappointed. And you know what else? They end up being really angry at me. You know why? Because I'm a pretty good pastor, but I'm a really good pastor. And if people try to make me a choice, they're going to end up just a little bit. This isn't a pastor for this. We're going to pick it up after the break in verse 13. We can move past these characteristics into something I think is even more profound than these. It's kind of a set of table. We're going to talk about the impact of these characteristics. Thank you.
