Galatians chapter 5, verse 16. Paul speaks these words to the church in Galatia, But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh. For these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these of which I forewarn you just as I have forewarned you that those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law. Of those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. Let's pray as we begin. Father, I am finding myself distracted by many things this morning and I ask that by your Spirit you will give a sense of clarity and direction a sense of clearness in my own mind even more than that Lord a sense of liberty as we talk about the fruit of the spirit that characteristic that cannot be produced by the flesh though when we see it missing we would try to stir it up Father I pray for your spirit's work among us this morning as we break open your word and discover your truth may it be more than some intellectual exercise and new insights for the mind, but some breaking open of the heart as well. In Jesus' name, amen. Our focus these weeks is the fruit of the Spirit. And I feel a need at the very beginning to point out the fact that while we are delineating the different aspects of the fruit of the Spirit, taking them one at a time, love, joy, peace, long-suffering, on and on, that it is very important that in our mind at least that we have a little check. And that is this, that the real issue we're dealing with right here is not the fruit. The real issue we want to focus on is the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit's work in me. Chapter 5, verse 16. I say walk by the Spirit. Verse 18. But if you are led by the Spirit. Verse 22. But the fruit of the Spirit. Verse 25. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. The whole focus here, the whole key to unlocking any of these characteristics, any of these virtues, any of these blessings in our lives, is walking by the Spirit of God. It's as if these weeks as we kind of go through and delineate all of these little characteristics, my fear is this, that having talked about love, we'll go home and try to stir love up. Or talking about joy, we'll go home and try to stir joy up. What we're doing when we talk about love and when we talk about joy and when we talk about peace, and I begin to see the lack of it in me, one of the things that we need to connect with is the fact that that simply indicates not that I should try to love more, but that I am not walking by the Spirit in some aspect of my life. It's as if we're taking our temperature this week, and we kind of put it in every week, and we test out the temperature of love and joy and peace, and every one of those things are going to be an indication to us as to whether we're drawing our life from God or from other things around us. There are symptoms. And in some way, if these things are missing in our lives, we have in some way, however subtle, ceased to be walking according to the Spirit. These last few weeks we first of all have heard the command Walk by the Spirit We've also heard the promise That if we walk by the Spirit We will not carry out the desire of the flesh When I hear that promise connected with that command I have a question and that is this How does that work? I don't like being left with a promise Or left with a command Connected with a promise When I don't understand how that's going to work And so in trying to answer that question We began to define some terms walk by the Spirit, meant simply this. Walk according to, by the means of, the Spirit of God that is in us. And we were very, very careful to explain that God, the Spirit of God, is not around me. He is not just with me. The Spirit of God, if I am a believer, is indwelling me. I am a new creature in Christ, a whole new species of person. And what I need to do to begin to live the life God's called me to is not just try harder, but begin to, by faith, believe who I am in Jesus Christ and begin to tap the resource of the Holy Spirit of God within me. We defined some other terms. The term flesh was extremely important to us in our understanding of this walking by the Spirit. The flesh is used here, it says here, to not carry out the desire of the flesh. And this was real helpful when we got to this. In our search for trying to figure out what it means to be in the flesh, we discovered Romans 7 verse 5 was real helpful. Paul was speaking of a time when he was not saved. when people were without Christ. And he says, for while we were in the flesh, meant simply this, while I was a natural man, not having the Spirit of God within me, I lived my life in a natural realm, and life for me was found in that which was natural. There was no spiritual capacity. There was no supernatural capacity. So it was real natural for me to find my life in those things I saw, I tasted, I touched, and I possessed. Life for the natural man is the things he has, The status he is able to achieve, the money he is able to make, the business he is able to build, and the pleasure he is able to experience. And those things are not in and of themselves bad. There's nothing wrong with a good business. There's nothing wrong with having possessions. There's nothing wrong with having a certain degree of status. Unless that's life for you. Unless you think that having that status and having that money will give to you a sense of value and meaning. The thing we've been learning these days is that it cannot do it. Those things are empty. But not only have we heard the command, we have also seen the conflict. Because while I am a supernatural being, the Spirit of God is living in me and I need to learn to walk according to that Spirit in me, there's a conflict going on. Verse 17, the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, the Spirit against the flesh. And that conflict is constant. And while I am a new creature in Christ, And while I have the Holy Spirit of God within me and a supernatural power to do and to accomplish the moral law of God, the flesh is constantly hounding me, telling me to live that life according to my own power. And so this conflict is constantly going on. And thirdly, we see the contrast. The contrast. And that is this. The contrast is simply very, very clear. If you are walking according to the Spirit, we'll know. And if you are walking according to your own power, If you are walking according to that which is natural, that which you see, taste, touch, and feel, we'll know that too. It's real evident. Verse 19. The deeds of the flesh are evident. If you are walking according to the flesh, here's what will flow from your life. Immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, all sorts of hatreds, that word is. Strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these. That indicates simply that this list is not exhaustive. There are other examples as well. We were very careful to point out that if you are living your life according to what you taste, touch, feel, have, possess, and those things are life for you, there is nothing that you can do but these things. You are incapable of expressing anything from your life but these things because life for you is what you see here. And when that begins to be threatened, all sorts of enmity rises up in you, and strife and jealousy and outbursts of anger because your life is being threatened. But the fruit of the Spirit is. The fruit of the Spirit is. And this is where we begin to see the contrast between one who is walking on natural means and one who is walking by supernatural means. And all I would ask you to do as we go through this is just put your heart to the test. Put your heart in a place where that thermometer can get in so you can have revealed to you by the Spirit whether or not you're walking according to the Spirit or according to the flesh. Something very important I think we need to point out in terms of teaching. We did it last week, but I think it's very important as we look at verse 22 that it says the fruit of the Spirit is. It does not say the fruits of the Spirit are. These are singular. These are singular. There is a reason that they are singular and it is important that we grasp. You see, we have a tendency when we look at the fruit of the Spirit, to look at love and joy and peace and long-suffering and patience and kindness and goodness and all of these different things, and kind of picking and choosing. And I see a couple, three or four there, that are part of my personality, and I see three or four there that aren't part of my personality, and I really don't see them flowing in my life, and I kind of look at myself, and basically Dave Johnson is a loving, joyful person. He is not terribly patient, nor is he terribly peaceful by nature. But that's no big deal, because I just kind of write that off and say, see the Lord is really doing a work in me in the area of love and joy. But he hasn't begun that work yet in the area of patience and peace. And I'll just give him time and it's no big deal. That may be true. It may be that there are areas in my life that God needs to work. I know that's true. But when we're talking about the fruit of the Spirit, that is a misunderstanding of this theology. And I think we need to be clear. It is a big deal that we grasp this. The reason it is a big deal is because the point of walking by the Spirit is that it is supernatural. And even impatient, anxious people like myself, who, when they are walking by the Spirit or drawing their life from the Spirit of God and nothing else, can be patient and at rest. I want to go as far as to say this. I'm sure you do this too, to a certain degree. I'm sure you see things in your life that you see there, you see yourself as patient but not very loving. You see yourself as loving but not very patient. I want to tell you something, and this is something I think is real important. If you see an aspect of the fruit in your life, but not another, like you see something like love but you don't see peace, I think there is a good chance, now listen to this, I think there is a good chance that that aspect of the fruit that right now you are identifying as a work of the Spirit is really a work of the flesh. I want you to say that again and you get it. If you see attributes or aspects of the fruit of the Spirit in your life, but not other aspects of the fruit, just a couple, but not all of them, or most of them, but there's two or three that just are not part of your life at all. I think it's a real good possibility that those attributes in your life, those aspects of the fruit of the Spirit, that you are now identifying as a work of the Spirit, are not at all a work of the Spirit, but indeed a work of the flesh. Let me explain. If you are a very loving person, and you find yourself giving like crazy, but the thing that you don't feel ever is a sense of peace, and a sense of rest, and a sense of patience, but you're calling the love and all the giving you're doing a work of the spirit but I've got a lot of work to do on peace and patience I think there's a real good possibility that your love is not a work of the spirit at all that your love in fact has all sorts of strings that the reason you're loving is to get love the reason you're giving is to have it be given back to you and when people aren't reciprocating you just get all sorts of lack of peace and lack of patience and all sorts of things therefore your love that isn't correlated with a sense of peace because you're just giving freely it's not a work of the spirit it's a work of the flesh you find yourself to be a very disciplined person possibly very into self-control but you find lacking in your spirit a sense of joy a sense of liberty and a sense of peace but you call that discipline a work of the spirit a work of the spirit has made me disciplined I think it's real possible that the problem you have is simply this that all the work you're doing is that has strings too The reason you're working is to get all sorts of attention. The reason you're working is to get patted on the back. And when that doesn't come, you don't feel very happy. When that doesn't come, you don't feel very peaceful. See, all that self-discipline isn't at all a work of the Spirit. It's simply a work of the flesh. These things can be counterfeited. That's one of the problems with dealing with the fruit of the Spirit. You might find yourself at peace. A very peaceful person. Didn't used to be a very peaceful person, but I am now. The problem is you don't see faithfulness in your life, and you don't have a sense of self-control. No faithfulness, no self-control, but very much at peace. The problem may be for you is that your peace is based not on a trust in God, but your peace is based on a withdrawing from responsibility, a withdrawing from the reality of life, a withdrawing from the warfare that was yours at one time. You want to know something? When you begin to grow as a Christian, you are going to get stretched like you've never been stretched before. It is going to be one of the most frightening experiences of your life because things that you thought were true maybe begin to get stripped away. and it is stretching. It hurts sometimes. And sometimes we withdraw from that. We call it peace. But if peace is there without faithfulness, don't call that peace a work of the Spirit. It's very possibly a work of the flesh. You see, the fruit of the Spirit is a total thing. The fruit of the Spirit is not love and then maybe joy and then maybe peace. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, all of them together. Last week we talked about one aspect of that fruit. Again, I'm being very careful how I say that. I'm not saying one of the fruits is love. One of the aspects of this fruit is love. We talked about it last week. And we spent some time defining that word. And the reason it's important to define it is because it's easy to counterfeit it. The reason it's important to define it is that it's easy to counterfeit it. We identified three words that the word of God talks about, that the Greek language has for love, eros, phileo, and agape. We delineated the fact and described the fact that in this text, the word love is not eros nor phileo. We understand those words' meanings. Phileo has to do with friendship. It has to do with warm feelings. It has to do with sentimental feelings. Brotherly love is what we think of when we think of phileo love. The characteristic of phileo love is this, however. It responds to, even though it's warm, and even though it's brotherly, and even though it feels real good, it responds to, and even more importantly, depends on mutual feelings, mutual gratification, mutual agreement. Therefore, it goes like this. If you like me, I'll like you. Or, I'll even be a little bit more noble, I'll like you first. I'll like you first. I'll take the first step. I'll move in your direction. And if you reciprocate, we'll be friends. And we'll have wonderful feelings. And if I give first and you give second, I'll give some more. And then I'll give some more. And it's great. That's phileo, and it feels real good. And it should be moving through the church. That brotherly love is a good thing. The third word was this, agape love. That is the word that is the fruit of the Spirit. The work of the Spirit. Real important to define this word, because I shared with you last week that I feel like we have in many ways defiled this word. Agape love, the fundamental difference between agape love and phileo love is not that phileo love is warm and affectionate and agape love is not warm and affectionate. Agape love, you see, is real cerebral and cold. Agape love has been defined for us by many people as being a decision that I make that is detached from emotion. I do not necessarily like you. I do not necessarily feel warm and gooey about you, but I will make a decision to act in your best interest. We have even had people tell us that that's the attitude that Jesus went to the cross with, that he did not particularly like us, he did not particularly love us, There were no warm feelings at all, nothing sentimental at all. He, in fact, detested the world, but he died for it, making a mental decision. You know what? That is part of the definition of agape. The problem is it isn't full. The distinction of agape love as opposed to phileo love is not that agape or phileo has warm feelings and agape doesn't. The distinction of agape as opposed to phileo is that agape love is warm and it is affectionate. and it is caring, it just doesn't have strings. It just doesn't have strings. The characteristic of phileo is this, I'll give as long as you give back. The characteristic of agape is this, I'll give and it'll be warm and it'll be affectionate. Jesus wept over Jerusalem. He had emotion. He loved us, but he died knowing that we possibly would never return it. But he gave. I'll tell you something. I'm not capable of that in the flesh. I can counterfeit that phony, that misguided understanding of agape. I can kind of do nice things for you and kind of physically, externally do nice things for you, but never really have any affection for you or any love for you. And call it agape. That isn't agape. Agape is a love that is felt deeply, that gives without it expecting anything in return. Today we come to joy. Today we come to joy. The fruit of the Spirit is joy. Joy. think on that would you think on that would you think on joy would you paint a picture in your mind close your eyes you don't have to do that but if you want to i'd like you to do that close your eyes and think of joy get a picture of joy what do you get you got a face in your mind somebody with joy you got a you got a family event where there's joy you feel something inside of you that just kind of starts bubbling up inside of you it feels light doesn't joy feel light some of you this morning feel real heavy so you're gonna have a hard time getting into joy but you know what it feels like. You think back into a memory of another day. You know, were you watching the Oklahoma-Nebraska game last night? Were you at all? Were you from Nebraska? Then you know what joy feels like. They won. It feels light. It feels joyful. Joy. The fruit of the Spirit is joy. Just plain, rollicking, unmitigated, romping, stomping joy. Joy. Now, wait a minute, Pastor. Wait a minute, Pastor. I understand that joy has a place in the church. I understand that joy has a real important function in the life of the believer. But the essence of Christianity is not joy. The essence of Christianity is control and restraint. The essence of Christianity is control and restraint. Christianity by nature is solemn and serious. In fact, Christianity is a little bit worried. We should be a little bit worried. Joy is something that's inside of me, but it should never come out. It should be something that is kind of at peace in me, but just keep it under control. There's some truth there. There's some truth there. As a believer, I understand something of the pain of sin, and so there's a seriousness and a solemnity to my walk with Christ. I understand something as a believer of the fragmentation of people and the separation that they have from God. I understand something of the reality of a lost humanity. I understand something of the weight of guilt that people carry. I understand something of the holiness of God. I understand something of the wonder of salvation. I, because I am a believer, have grasped the sinfulness of man and the necessity for men, all men, to repent before God, to walk by faith, and to live in discipleship. I understand that. And I have realized that heaven had to be emptied of its greatest treasure to provide for me redemption. And those are sobering thoughts. Those are sobering thoughts. But having grasped all that, let us not overlook something else that is there in equal measure, and that is this, that the fruit of the Spirit is joy. Joy. And I want to paint a picture of you for joy. It's going to come right out of the Old Testament with some Hebrew words. And I think it's real important that we don't go overboard with joy and just start thinking we should be acting crazy. And just so we make sure we don't go overboard and get real weird with this whole concept of joy and the expression of our joy, we'll just go to the Word of God and make sure the Word of God is our restraint. Four words I want to share with you. Hebrew words. that describe joy. First Hebrew word is this. The first Hebrew word for joy is this. Bright and shining. Picture that in your mind. Write it down. Bright and shining. Debbie Boone sang a song some time ago and I'm so glad she quit. It was called, You Light Up My Life. Remember that? That's joy. That's bright and shining. You light up my life. We sing a song in church a lot. Surely the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Lord is in this place. I can see His, there's glory on His face. I should never do that one. I don't know the words. there's glory on each face is one of the lines in that song believe me bright and shining joy joy biblical definition of joy a few weeks ago there's a wedding here a lot of you were here some of you were up at a retreat but there was a wedding here chris and cam got married you know what there was here in this room a lot of bright and shining people you could see it on their face chris and cam that's where they were at they were bright and shiny he was up here looking real silly bright and shiny. The thing that I remember most about that wedding though is Don. Don Hennessy. You all know Don? He's sick today. Usually he sits right over here. Most of you know Don as being very serious, very solemn, very studious. You think of Don as being very business-like. He's the kind, he's a no-monkey business guy, you know? You don't do any monkey business around Don. He gets the work done and he's real serious. What you need to do is go to a dinners of eight with Don. We had a a couple weeks ago at Don's house, and he was silly. He was acting goofy. I mean, all of a sudden, we were having conversation with people, and he started laughing, and we didn't even know what he was laughing about, and he didn't either. Real serious and solemn, but I'll tell you what, I don't forget, I will never forget what it looked like to see those three people come up the aisle. There was Don, and there was Chris, and there was Cleome, and I was looking at Don, and I looked, and I thought, what is it? What is it? There's solemn, serious Don, and I'm not figuring it out. There's a look on his face, a funny look, a silly grin. I can't identify it for sure, but you know what? It was bright. It was shining. And some people called it a silly grin. You know what God calls it? He calls it joy. Joy. There's another word for joy in the Word of God, Hebrew word for joy. It's this. It means to leap and to jump. To leap and to jump. It's what you do when you get a Toyota. Ha ha. Remember? Ha ha. You leap and you jump. That's what joy is. So when joy is spoken of in the Word of God in the Old Testament, not only is joy bright and shining, but joy is leaping and jumping. David, when he understood something of the grace of God and he understood something of the completeness of his forgiveness, it says this, he danced, he leapt before the Lord. Michael, his wife, was sitting up in a window and watched him jumping and leaping all around and expressing his joy, and she thought it was outrageous. This is totally beneath the dignity of a king. It's undignified. Michael called it undignified Michael called it disgraceful You know what the scripture calls it? Joy Joy It's an amazing thing what happens to people when they get struck with joy They might go bright, they might go shiny They might go leaping, they might go jumping There's a third word It's called shouting Clap your hands all you people Shout to God with a voice of triumph People who do our music Get real tired of me Because I like songs and I like them a certain way. I like them loud. I do. This is terrible. But I like it when we sing and I like it when we sing loud. I like it when Angie pounds on the piano and I like it when Dwayne pounds on the piano. And I like the sound to be big. I'm always getting kidded because whenever we sing a song and we're trying to figure out and we're in a pinch, what kind of song should we sing? They always know what I'm going to say. Sing a power song. All hail the power of Jesus' name. And I like it when the Spirit moves us in such a way that it sounds like a shout. and some of you think it's weird and some of you think it's excessive the scripture calls it joy there's a fourth one I was having trouble figuring this one out but it means to go around in circles Hebrew word for joy to go around in circles now it's hard for me to figure out how that would fit into a church service going around in circles I have some problems with that but I'll tell you what it didn't take long for me to think of an illustration in a place I see it see I've got four kids and my kids you know my kids i don't apologize for my kids at all i think they're wonderful but they haven't learned yet all the dignified ways to express their joy like this oh that's good just an incredible expression of joy i've got a little guy named caleb you know him two years old he's got all sorts of joy bottled up in him and it's just always right about here it's just right about there ready to go come and fly it up and it doesn't take much for me to pull that out of him just like that. I just look at him and I go, ah, ah, and he starts going, ah, ah. You know, it's great. He just responds. And I said, I just kind of start laughing and he'll start laughing and I'll go, how you doing? How you doing? How you doing? And I do this every time I come home. We have this ceremony that goes on. And before you know it, his joy goes past shining. It goes past bright. It goes past sleeping. It goes past shouting. He starts running around circles. some would call that nonsense and some would call that childish and some would come to him and say no, no no, no scripture calls it joy scripture calls it joy scripture comes and says no, no, no, no, run certainly beloved there is an intensity to our Christian life and there is a solemnity and a seriousness to the Christian life. But there is joy too. And we worry an awful lot about excess. When I start talking about shouting to God and clapping our hands and saying how I get loud, we worry, it's going to go too far. It's going to go too far. We're going to get crazy. We should worry about excess. We should worry about excess. It can go too far. And I think every one of us are aware of the fact that very often our external expressions of joy, clapping and shouting, can just be nothing but the flesh. Can be a stirring up of emotion. Can be a way for you to get to notice me, and we'll just draw all sorts of attention. It can be as fleshy as can be. And thank God for restraint, right? We all just thank God so for restraint that holds back our joy. In fact, that's what the Holy Spirit's job is, right? To restrain our joy. No. No. Good thing for the Holy Spirit. keeps us from too much joy. The restrainer's doing his job, boy. Boy, I tell you, if we didn't have the restrainer, we'd just have people all around bright and shining, dancing, leaping, shouting, running around in circles right in church. Problem is, the fruit of the Spirit is joy. Bright and shining. Dancing, leaping, shouting, running around in circles. That's just not for me. You know, Dave, you're a weird guy, and I can see how you would like to dance and leap and shout and run around in circles. Your kids do it. You teach them how. But I want to tell you, if you don't think it's in you, you're wrong. It's in you. If you have the Holy Spirit of God in you, joy is in you. Joy is in you because that's who He is. That's what He does. The fruit of the Spirit is joy. The fruit of the Spirit is joy. And you have had at times in your life that joy just well up inside of you, and sometimes it comes out in bright, and sometimes it comes out in shining. And there are some of you who've just about had it go past bright and past shining into leaping and into shouting and into clapping, but you just held it back. No way, this is too much. Bright and shining is just enough. Thank God for the restrainer. You want to know something? I really believe that some expressions externally are fleshy. I think, though, we need to consider the possibility that sometimes our holding back of our expression is just as fleshy. Because I put the lid on it, and I say, no more, that's as far as I'm going to go. I was thinking this last week as I was preparing this, and thinking of all the psychological problems that people have, and they go to psychologists, and the psychologist says, well, your problem is that you have repressed anger. And you need to get the anger out, because you've been holding it down and holding it down, and you need to get the anger out. And I was thinking, if this is really true, that the Spirit of God is in the life of every believer, And one of the things that he is going to produce is a sense of joy because we understand who we are and we understand what he's done that very well we could go to some person like that and they would identify the problem and say, Aha, I know your problem. You're suffering from repressed joy. You've lived your whole life with joy bubbling up inside you and you kept the lid on it, let it out. The fruit of the Spirit is joy. All through the New Testament as well, we see the same kinds of examples flowing out of us, flowing at us, expressions of joy. The gospel came with joy. Good news, I bring great tidings of great joy. The resurrection secured that joy. Jesus, described as a man of sorrows, well acquainted with grief, but he was also described as one who was full of the joy of the Holy Spirit, full of the joy of the Holy Spirit, bright and shiny. Those people whose relationship with God was expressed with rigidity and coldness detested him. And one of the reasons they detested him was because he demonstrated a joy that was contradictory to and a confrontation of their bitterness and anger and discontent. The early church met and had their meals together with gladness, joy. I don't know where you're at this morning, but as I'm talking about leaping and dancing and shouting and smiling and bright and shining, there are some of you who just do not feel like that at all. and you can maybe sit here this morning and say, I can relate to joy. I know what it feels like. There was a time in my life last week, last month, last year, when I felt bright. I don't know what it was about my life at that time, but I felt bright and I felt shining and I felt like leaping and dancing and shouting, but I don't feel like that now. Remember, I describe joy as being a light feeling. Some of you are here this morning and you feel real heavy, and even when I talk about joy and leaping and dancing, it's offensive to you. It drives you crazy. I don't want to hear about this anymore. in fact if I could this morning while you're talking about all this wonderful light hearted sickening joy if I could I'd get up and leave but I'm sitting right in the middle of the pew I can't go anywhere because I have no joy none none there is no reason for joy you don't know my life you don't know my circumstances the circumstances of my life right now are such that there is no room for joy joy is just not an appropriate response for what's going on in my life right now maybe some other time maybe some other day but my marriage is breaking up maybe it isn't over there are people even in the church who think we just got the greatest marriage in the world and maybe we're even going to hang together and nobody's ever going to find out we have problems and nobody's ever going to find out that there's tension in our family but you know what? it isn't joy it isn't bright and it isn't shining it isn't dancing and leaping there is no fun there is no exhilaration so don't talk to me about joy especially don't talk to me about bright, shining, dancing, leaping stuff you don't know my marriage you don't know my kids my kids are giving me a heartache that you wouldn't believe I love my kids we've poured our lives into our kids we've tried to teach them the precepts of the Lord Jesus we've tried to live our lives and yes we've made mistakes but our kids are a real heartache to us don't you talk to me about bright and shining not today my job is not working out I thought I had a career in front of me and I gave myself and committed myself to that company and it isn't working out I don't feel any kind of satisfaction I feel like I'm going to get laid off any day I've already been laid off there is no future don't you talk to me about bright and shining that's some sort of hype we hear on Sunday morning but it isn't real I may even smile back at you but it isn't real in school I'm not keeping up my future doesn't look good sickness some of you are sick don't talk to me about bright and shining when I'm feeling the way I am some of you have faced death in the family a loved one a wife a husband a child don't talk to me about joy bright and shining dancing leaping joy in the face of that take your joy away you talk about restraining your joy exhorting the people don't restrain your joy let it out I wish like crazy that was my problem there's nothing there to let out my problem is there is no joy in me would you just listen real quick here this is where it ties in with walking by the spirit I don't know if I'm going to be able to say this right I want to somehow communicate something to you that will somehow set you free and you'll come up with a concept of joy that is deeper than just bright and shining that is deeper than dancing and leaping and shouting it entails that but it's deeper for those of you who have pain carefully gently I want you to think first of all you're a Christian right? okay if I'm talking to somebody who's struggling with what I'm saying right now you're a Christian right? that means the Holy Spirit of God's in you right? you know that the problem is you're not feeling the presence of God you're not feeling any power so what I'm going to say to you is this if you're a Christian and if the Holy Spirit is in you here's the clue walk by the Spirit Oh, Dave, I knew you'd say that. Get away from me with that. That doesn't work any more than giving me a bunch of hype about all this joy. Doesn't work. Okay, let me say it a different way. Let me come at you in a different direction. If you're here this morning and you're hearing dancing, leaping, bright and shining and it's offensive to you and you don't feel the joy, let me ask you a question. What is joy for you? You got that? What is joy for you? All the things in your life right now that are preventing joy, that are preventing the bright and shining, that are preventing a sense of release, preventing a sense of the appreciation of the presence of God, what is it that's preventing that right now? What is it in your life that's keeping you from it? What is the missing link right now? Are you able to identify it? Even if it's vague, try to put it to words. What have you lost? Who have you lost that you thought you had to have? If I only have that guy, if I only have that girl, but I lost that guy, I lost that girl, I lost my joy. It's I am incapable of experiencing any joy without him, without her, without that job, without that career. My business is going down the tubes. I'm incapable of having any joy without that. I'm incapable of having... I know a friend of mine who's mad at me right now and thinks I'm really a zero. And unless they like me, I can't have joy. When people are offended by me and mad at me, I'm incapable of having joy. Don't be so unrealistic. My marriage is a mess. Don't be so unrealistic. do you have that thing for you do you have that thing that's keeping you from that's stealing your joy what life situation what person is keeping you from it do you have in your mind might be a relationship might be a girlfriend a boyfriend might be a starting position in some sports team it could be a better grade it could be what people think it could be looking good you don't look good enough could be having the answers you don't feel like you have all the answers and so you just don't have joy could be more ability you look around at all the people in your family and in your church and you think everybody here's got more ability than me and so i don't have joy and i'm incapable of having joy because i don't have the ability that other people do it's real easy for him he's got all sorts of ability not for me recognition people don't appreciate you if people would just appreciate me more i'd be bright and shining maybe it's your kids they're not turning out the way you want. Maybe it's a church. Something's just not right the way you want it. And on and on and on and on. You got it. What is it for you? Do you got it in your mind? Do you? Look at it. Look at it. Because what I want you to consider is you look at that thing that right now is preventing joy for you. Is that that thing that is standing between you and joy, that is the God you serve. Think on that. That is the thing from which you are drawing life. Think on that. That is your source of joy. If only I had him, I'd be okay. If only I had her, I'd be okay. That's life for me. If only my business was making it, I'd be okay. That's life for me. If only my kids turned out all right, I'd be okay. That's life for you. If only my marriage was better, I'd be okay. I'd have joy. That's life for you. I want to be realistic here. I want to be as realistic as I can. If you're struggling in your marriage, and you're struggling with a relationship, and you just feel heavy in your spirit because that relationship isn't turning out the way you want, or your kids aren't turning out the way you want, or you're even confronted with the ultimate, and that would be death of someone you love. That's a toughie. That's a toughie. I'm telling you that that shouldn't steal your joy. You're being unrealistic. See, the Word of God makes some promises to me about my marriage. And that is this, that it should bring me joy, and it should bring me happiness. And I have every reason to expect that my husband will give me something that will make me feel good. Or my wife will make me feel good. I have every reason to expect that. Marriage has been put on a pedestal for me all my life. And now it's just killing me. Don't tell me that this is possible with that husband or that wife the way they are. I'm going to tell you something. The Word of God says, He looked at Adam and He says, It's not good for man to be alone. So He gave him woman. And there's supposed to be marriage and there's supposed to be fulfillment in that. But I want you to know something. And this is a tough teaching. That is this, that in that marriage, in that woman or in that man, there is not life. Life for me cannot be derived from my wife. And if I am looking to my wife to give me life, to give me the fulfillment of my life, and really make me okay because she's okay with me, God never intended that to happen. My wife can't do that for me. Your husband can't do that for you. But I want to tell you something. If I'm looking to my relationship with my wife or my husband or my boyfriend or my girlfriend to make me okay. And that is life for you. You know what I can promise you? No joy. Or a joy like this. It will be up and down. As long as everything is okay you'll be at peace. As long as everything is cool you'll be at peace. As long as the person is giving you everything you need you'll be at peace. But your joy will be contingent. Relationships were given to us to enjoy. Relationships were given to us to make our lives full. Relationships were given to us as a gift. But my wife to me is not life. She couldn't be. Kids, sometimes they're a heartache. Sometimes as I talk even now about kids, how you can't let your kids, even if they're going the wrong direction, steal your joy. You can easily say, Dave, your kids are young. Don't give me that. When your kids are teenagers, then I want to hear your sermons about all this. And I think that's fair to say. But let me just say this. some of you do feel disillusioned about what's happening to your kids you have just like marriage you have all sorts of expectations about what kids are supposed to be a joy a fulfillment a thrilling thing wonderful 1 John even says the word of God affirms that no greater joy is there than this than to see my children walking in truth joy is the word joy why? because they turned out okay you know what? kids are a gift We said it this morning. Kids are a gift. And they are fulfilling and they are joyful. But I can't get life for my kids. If life for me is how my kids turn out, if life for me is how my husband acts or my wife acts, I can't have joy. Not consistently. It's always going to be contingent on how they are. Life for me is Christ. That's the only place I can find life. Everything else then gets put in perspective. Death. don't give me bright and shining in the face of death what do we do with that I say walk by the spirit and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh what a cop out you know what that means you know what that means walk by the spirit in the face of this joy in the face of death, in the face of a marriage that isn't fulfilling, in the face of kids that are breaking my heart. You know what walking by the Spirit simply means this. Let go of everything else that is the source of life for you. Is kids your source of life? If they are, you're going to have a broken heart. Is your job your source of life? If it is, you're going to have a broken heart. Your joy is going to go up and down like this. If your husband or your marriage is your source of life, then your relationship of joy is going to go up and down like that. there are things in our lives like a marriage like kids like things like a business that make our lives full again i want to say that they are not bad things they are good things they make our lives full they are great relationships the home i have the car i drive the sports i engage in are real exciting and they make me feel good there's nothing wrong with them but if i begin to switch my focus and the sports i play begin to be life for me no joy ever because if I begin to lose that sport or I begin to lose my ability or I begin to lose my wife or my kids or my husband my joy is going to go right down the drain with them. Paul and Silas were in the jail. I close with this. Beaten and chained and about to die and they sang a song of joy. That sounds so unrealistic to me. Doesn't it to you? They were beaten on the back. They couldn't move. Their life was, as far as they were concerned, they felt their life the next day was going to be taken from them and they sang the song of joy. How did they do that? well I think the way they did that was that they were simple minded they didn't have they didn't have a concept of the gravity of the situation they were in they couldn't have they were simple minded so they just sing a song no they said this I've got all this joy in me and it's just welling up inside of me and I better not restrain it so they just let it go no there wasn't any joy there maybe or they said this the Bible says in fact I said rejoice in the Lord always again I say rejoice so we better sing a song to be a good example to the people in church at the open door 2,000 years from now we'll sing a song I don't think they said that at all I think they came to a point because they had been at this point all along where they were able to say this you know life is sweet to eat and to breathe and to walk and to talk and to see things and to be with my family is sweet but we have lost everything right up to this point anyway and all along the line I've let it go but having lost life but having suffered the loss of all things they came to this final thing when life was going to be taken from them and you know why I believe they sang? I think they simply let go of life life for me is life so I got to stay alive and if I'm living and breathing I'll just do anything I can to hang on to that and I'll fight for it in that jail with the stripes on their back and death right before them they let it go and they said life for me is not my wife Life for me is not my husband Life for me is not my job Life for me is not the sports I engage in Life for me is not the grades I get Life for me is not even Life And they let go Life for me is Christ And I let go of life you
