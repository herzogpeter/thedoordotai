Our scripture reading today is from Matthew 5, 13 through 16, as well as 1 Peter 2, 9. You are the salt of the earth, but if salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand And it gives light to everyone in the house In the same way, let your light shine before others That they may see your good deeds And glorify your Father in heaven For you are a chosen race A royal priesthood A holy nation A people for God's own possession So that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Thank you, Nina. You, we are the light of the world. It means that light needs to somehow be seen where the salt of the earth means that salt somehow needs to be scattered. It can't stay in here. A word before we get to the word about Lent. Ash Wednesday is this Wednesday. You heard the announcement. I invite you to come into that because that is going to kick us into our Lenten season and experiences of people. And if you were here with us when we went through Advent just a couple, I don't know, hours ago, Wow. As a body, we kind of dialed into the lectionary and we're reading the same scriptures week after week after week into the Sunday that was to come. And then we heard a sermon on those very scriptures. And we're going to do kind of the same thing. I don't know if we're going to follow the preaching schedule as much, but we're inviting you into that kind of experience. And a lot of you don't know what the lectionary is. And Vicki, we're talking about a class on that. You promise, right? Okay. It's a fabulous discipline to enter into, but particularly as a people to be in the same scriptures all week long into the Sunday that's going to kind of come around those texts. It's an incredible thing. So the way to dial into that is to get on our website at church. There's some information in the bulletin. I think you click on discover and then discover tools, which you're not going to remember. So bring your bulletin and we can, as a people, be in those same scriptures together in invite you into that. Let's pray as we begin this morning. Father, I pray for the work of your spirit to continue among us, to be stirred up among us, and for the kind of life and effect that can only be generated by your spirit, I pray through this word in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, as most of you know, if you've been with us these days, we've been talking about vision, calling it our 2020 vision, which is a reference not just to our capacity to see things clearly with 2020 vision, but it's a reference to literally the year 2020, which in five years it will be. The year 2020, and I don't know if you noticed, though I think you maybe did, that the vision talk I brought just a couple of weeks ago didn't come with a lot of measurable outcomes relative to vision because the vision we wanted you to see, and we really did want you to see something, kind of conceptually, at least at this point, isn't about, and it wasn't about, the five or ten things we want to accomplish as a church in the next five years, though there are some very specific things we want to accomplish in the next five or so years, measurable things. In particular, I keep thinking of this creation and development of a center of spiritual formation here, an academy, as it were, of spiritual formation here at Open Door, something very specific that I and a number of us have a lot of energy around seeing, accomplished, and created. But the vision talk was much more about not what we're going to do, but who we want to be as a church, who we want to become as a church. And it's actually something we've been talking about for several months. It goes all the way back to September. If you've been with us, I know you're aware of that because we want to become a people. And it raises a question when you talk about becoming a people, what does that mean? Because it's kind of obscure, I suppose. It's not very specific. Well, the best way I can say it is this. It's the antithesis of an audience. When you think of an audience, you're not thinking of a people because an audience goes to church the same way an audience goes to a movie. They go to a movie to see the show and then they leave. And if it's good, they might tell their friends and maybe come back. Depends on what's showing. Depends on who's on. And while I get all that, how people go to church that very way, and the reason I get that is because that's been the paradigm that many of us have lived with for many years. We've grown used to it. And the idea that it shouldn't be that way, you haven't thought that through very much at all. We want to become something different. Don't know if we can. We want to become something more, to become a people, which according to the scriptures, we already are. At some level, in some way, we are a people, indeed a chosen people, no less. Read Nina from 1 Peter 2, 9, a royal priesthood, Peter says, is who we are, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, whose primary purpose, which means not only do we have an identity as a people, We have a mission. We have a purpose as a people. Still in verse 9, here it is, to proclaim. And proclaim does not mean preach. It means in a variety of ways, make known the excellencies of him who called us out of darkness into his marvelous light. And when he did call us out of darkness as a people into his marvelous light, something happened that we don't fully understand. But it's true. We became the light. Jesus said it. that way in Matthew 5, 12, which is, again, the text, another text that Nina read this morning, for you are the light of the world. You might shrink away from that. You are the light of the world. You are the salt of the earth, Matthew 5, 13, and this salt needs to be scattered somehow. This light needs to be seen in the world somehow. Maybe, I don't know, set it on a hill somehow. Jesus says in Matthew 5, 14, because a city, which speaks to, I don't know, people, because a city full of light on a hill can't be hid. So set it on a hill, but the truth is this, and I think this is the spirit of that verse in Matthew 5. I don't care how you do it. I don't care if it's on a hill or not on a hill. I don't care. What I care is this, that the life that you have, that the light that you are will shine in such a way that people might see that life and that light thereby coming into that life, the people who see it coming into that light themselves because now at the end of verse 16, text Nina read, they're glorifying the Father who is in heaven because they saw the light in you and they saw the life in you and they're glorifying the Father in heaven just like you and just like me and just like us, which doesn't sound like the function of an audience. It's not how audiences function. It's not what they do. Sounds much more like a people who maybe have begun to remember who they are as a people and why they're here as a people standing firm as a people, says the Apostle Paul in Philippians 127, which was the centerpiece scripture of the vision talk I gave a couple of weeks ago. A people united in spirit, intent on one purpose, with one mind, striving together for the faith of the gospel, they're in it together for the faith of the gospel. And striving together for anything is not what you do as an audience. It's not what you get from an audience, but maybe a people would act like that, would be striving together, intent on one purpose, and it's what we want to become. it's our 2020 vision and it's why we did what we did last week actually you know where these ideas come from well they come from talking like this and wondering how we can kind of invite people into things like this and so last week when Al Shuck was given the talk around our communion and bringing the people around all of us around the table that is the Lord's Al invited us as a people to come to the table together and maybe to come together in a different way but this time to really see each other as we came to the table. If you're here, I'm sure you remember this, and not only see each other but serve each other. So we were coming to these tables, and each one of us served the other person. We weren't being served, though we were being served, but we were also serving, and all of that stuff kicked everybody out of their comfort zone. I know. It was the first thing that happened. Even as you hear that kind of stuff, you're going to stand at a table? It just sounds weird. Because now we're not going to just take communion. We're going to serve communion. And I'm going to look someone in the eye and maybe see them and maybe be seen, which is even more uncomfortable. And it was really hard for some of you. And we kind of knew it would be. This is going to freak some people. In fact, people left at the beginning of that thing. Some people did. And it was really easy for others. Because stuff like that, for some of you, is just right in your wheelhouse. Why do we do this more? It's just the best thing. And actually, the thing that really matters about the whole thing is it was really healing for many. We've been hearing stories all week about what happened when at the table we started seeing each other. Like when this guy named Dave, not me, this guy I know who was sitting right over here. I think it was the 11 o'clock service with his friends. and in the context of the worship time and going to the table and experiencing that thing of seeing each other. And here now let's talk about paying attention to each other. He noticed a young woman behind him and he was sitting with his friends so this woman was behind him and them and she was alone, first of all, and she was weeping, he noticed. In fact, he noticed at first when his group of friends went out to take communion and when he came back she was still weeping and he has these ears. I mean, he has this thing ringing in his ears about what Al said. Al just said, we need to see each other. And so he did something he wouldn't normally do. And it's especially something you don't do if you're part of an audience. He turned around and he said to her, it felt so awkward. I see you. And maybe she didn't even want to be seen. I mean, if you get seen like that, you go, oh, look at me. I'm crying. Leave me alone. I see you. And he gave her a hug, and he prayed for her and said, God loves you, and it's going to be okay. And then he introduced her to the friends he was with because she was alone and said, this is where we sit every week, and you can join us any time you want. And then introducing his friends to this woman who was by herself, he introduced her to his girlfriend as well, which he would have been in a lot of trouble if he hadn't. So there you go. It's all about becoming a people. But that's not what audiences do. That's not what an audience does. It's not how they act. It's more like how a people might act, where we wouldn't actually know it. What a weird thing to do. Why is that weird? It's not weird at all. It's how people start to act, and it's what we mean by becoming a people. And so it is last week as a people. We tasted some things, at least some of you did, as we turned our face inward. It's important to do that, to turn your face inward, to see each other as a people. It's easy to not do that, and it's part of what it looks like when you're learning how to become, because that's where we are, learning how to become something other than an audience, actually, a people. But this week, I want us to change direction. We're going to change direction as we turn our face, not inward, but outward. And it's a powerful metaphor. I mean, yes, as a people begin to turn our face outward to see not just each other this week, but to see the world as well, because all of this becoming a people who have some life and light in us is ultimately about mission because you are the salt of the earth. You are. We are the light of the world. So we turn our face outward as a people and it's central, this turning our face outward. It is absolutely central to our 2020 vision to become a people not just connected to each other, as important as that is. In fact, if we don't have that, There's nothing else to kind of give out there, but not just connected to each other, but committed to mission. Indeed, I'd say it this way, to a missional kind of thinking and living, because the salt that we are needs to be scattered somehow, and the light that we are needs to be seen somehow. So how might I best do that? What's the highest impact way for the light to be seen, for the salt to be scattered? The answer I got when I was growing up was this, better go into the ministry. If you're serious about shining light, about spreading the salt, you go into the ministry. We called it full-time Christian service, which means everybody else in serving the Lord is kind of part-time deal. You better sign up at seminary, and that's what proves you really care about the mission of God. Again, we called it full-time Christian service, and I got it all the time. I had a lot of that growing up, as I did in church. Some of you did as well. Some of you have no idea what I'm talking about. National youth conferences that I would go to all the time as a kid in church. It's just part of what it means to grow up in church, and they were a wow. The thing they put on was, wow, and you'd get these kids from little towns, and they were saying, wow, it feels good to be a Christian today because we're cool. Anyway, it was great. It was really good stuff. The second to the last night was always the same, and it took a while to figure out the pattern because on the second to the last night of these conferences, they would pull in the net, and the net was basically this, and it was really a good thing. You're going to give your heart to Jesus. You're going to say yes to Jesus, and all of us said yes. We all said yes. I said yes. I love saying, I've said yes, yes, yes last night however, the question was raised in a number of ways did you really mean it, when you said yes to Jesus, did you really mean it here's a way to prove it, say yes now to his mission, okay I will but his mission specifically meant full time Christian service, where you sign on for ministry, and even that was ranked some of you know exactly what I'm talking about, some of you again, this is foreign it was ranked because the number one thing you could do for God in the kingdom of God was to become a missionary number two was close but not quite as good become a pastor some kind of ministry where does it happen in the church when you think about ministry what is it where is it where does it happen it happens in the church and all of that began I wonder where did that start it started with those goofy people in the 50's probably this started a long long time ago that whole way of thinking and ranking and bringing it all in and institutionalizing the church in such a way that actually undermines the actual vision of the church began with a guy actually named Eusebius wonderful name actually third century guy, was a bishop of Caesarea, prolific writer of the day. He kind of came in the same context of the Emperor Constantine who institutionalized Christianity and now it became the official religion of the Roman Empire of the day, which kind of ruined the actual DNA of the life of God in the church because now everyone was a Christian and no one was a Christian. But here's what Eusebius argued, and it's fascinating because it stuck. Oh, man. Here's what he said, that Christ has given two ways of life to his church. One is the perfect life. The other is the permitted life. The perfect life is, guess what? It is the spiritual life dedicated to contemplation, and consecration is reserved for the elites in the realm of the spirit, priests, monks, nuns, pastors, missionaries, ministry, full-time Christian service. That is the perfect. And I hear wonderful sounds. Permitted life. It's okay. This whole life's okay. It's secular. Dedicated to work like farming. That's okay. That's permitted. God's okay with that. I'm going to burn in hell for that. The permitted life is secular life dedicated to things like governing and trading and entrepreneurialism and raising the family and caring for the poor. And there you have it, this bifurcation that we've been living with ever since. It's fascinating how it took. The bifurcation being this. There's the perfect life. And then there's the permitted life. That's okay. And there's the higher life. And there's the lower life, everybody else. and there's the sacred and the secular. And Eusebius came up with that in the year 341 A.D., fast forward to 2,000 years. See yourself now in a gymnasium. I'm in my dad's church, so it was many years ago, this scene I have, and it's a story I've told before. I'm with my brother, and we're at some sort of celebration of my dad in ministry and been there for a long time. and my brother and I had come home to celebrate that whole thing, so we kind of had already moved away. And this guy from my dad's church, I don't know if he was an elder or somebody on the board, he'd been there a long time, and I can still see his face, came to me and said, Dave, I hear you're going to follow in your father's footsteps and go into ministry. I said, yeah, I think I am, and it was great that I was going to do that. And he said, kind of like that anyway. And then he turned to my brother and said, Steve, what are you going to do? and Steve told him, I'm going to be a coach, because he was in the process of becoming who he is now, Coach J. And it was real obvious in terms of his response, because I think he said it this way, that that was good. Not what? Great, because they picked the perfect life. Don't you hear that? When you just see me, it's kind of like that. And Steve picked the permitted life. It doesn't make you kind of sick. Does anything irritate you in that? Well, it irritated my brother, and he punched me. We did a lot of that in those days. Actually, we did talk, and we had to talk, because that's a messed up thing, and it messes with your head. Does it matter if you're a coach? Oh, my goodness. I mean, never mind that the three most influential groups in people's lives are identified as coaches, teachers, parents. Steve, you should go to Africa. What a waste. He would kill everybody there and they would kill him. You know why he wouldn't go to Africa? Because nobody there would laugh at his jokes, but football players will. Anyway. By the way, that guy who came to us and wanted to know, and he would cheer for me because I'd pick to be, he was an audience guy. Because I promise you. He would give money to missions, but he didn't have any sense of mission in his own life. That's why he couldn't see my brother's mission at all. This undermines. This is not a minor thing. It's not a minor thing. This undermines the mission of the church. It creates several things. One, it pushes people into vocational ministry who, quite frankly, don't belong there. And you know what I mean. And that weakens the church. You've got people who have no prophetic gift, no teaching capacity, and they go into ministry because they love God. They're good people, but they have no capacity to lead the church, to inspire God's people, but they go because they got, it's the highest thing. And it weakens the church. And the second thing it does is it lets everybody else with this, leaves everybody else with this nagging sense that I'm a second-class citizen. I didn't do the perfect, I did the permitted. God's not mad at me, but he's not delighted. with me. The other thing, and it may be the worst of all because, I mean, most of you get over that. My brother got over it, I think. He still punches me once in a while, and maybe that's why. The real damaging thing is it undermines our capacity to have a missional view of our ordinary life as being part of what God is doing in the world. And it's how we become an audience. because come watch a show and no connection to what's going on here in terms of us becoming the light of the world bringing it out there and how out there is where it actually is happening to the glory of God. Which brings me finally to what I want to clarify about our 2020 vision this morning and in particular what I mean when we talk about preparing a people for next because part of our preparation as a people involves a paradigm shift. At least for some. For some, this won't be a shift. It's a paradigm you understand. But for many, it's a paradigm shift, and there's actually two of them. The first has to do with our understanding of the church. The second has to do with our understanding of call. What is the call of God on our life? Have you heard the call? Have you horrors? Have you missed the call? I've had people with me in grief, with tears, going, I feel like God called me and I said no, and now I've wasted my life as a noble, wonderful person who was shedding light and he didn't even see it. So what is the call? Let's get clear about that first. And the quickest way to do that is to simply say this. Get this. The call of God on your life has far more to do with who you actually are and who you actually are becoming than it has anything to do with what you do. with your vocation or your career has much more to do with who you are and who you are becoming, which is why our first thing is a radical commitment to spiritual formation because if you're not being formed, if you're not becoming, you have nothing to give. Forget about the call if you haven't responded to this one. Osginas says it this way, and it's on the screen. It's a pretty thick quote, so I wanted you to see it as well as me just reading. He says this, that first and foremost we are called to someone, that is God, to whom we bend our knee, not to something like politics or business, parenting or teaching, or to somewhere like Africa or the inner city. Our secondary calling is that everyone, everywhere, in everything they do, regardless what it is that you do, should think and speak and live and act entirely for him. We can therefore properly say, he goes on to say, as a matter of secondary calling that we are called in some way to homemaking, to coaching, to business, practice of medicine or law, but these are all secondary, never the primary call, and they must be kept in that order because the primary call always leads. And so I've been called. Call of God on my life is not to preach. Call of God on my life is to bend my knee to God. That's you too. After that, we'll figure something out. I say it this way, and this is funny. I'm writing this one on the board too, because I actually found this quote of mine in some old sermon notes that I said a couple years ago, so I'm quoting me. I love quoting me. I've never done it. Here I go. Dave Johnson says. And this is a wonderful example of why I don't write, because this is the most unbelievable run-on sentence you'll ever see, so here we go. That the primary call of God in our life as a people is to become the kind of people who are partnering with God and with each other in the living of a life under the authority of God, in the context of community, for the purpose of becoming the kind of people who are first of all experiencing the life and light and love of God and then giving that life and life and love away for free. And to be doing all of that in the context of whatever it is you do, be it a pastor or a plumber, a nurse or a policeman, a carpenter or a coach, a movie star or a politician, a homemaker, a teacher, a student, I don't care. And that, okay, yeah, there you go. You're officially my favorite service. I didn't do that last night. And that is the primary call of God on the lives of his people to become the kind of people, that kind of people, because now the salt is out of the shaker. It's being scattered somehow, and now the light is not under a bowl anymore or stuck in a church anymore. It's being seen somehow, and that is why our 2020 vision talks about a radical commitment to spiritual transformation, because if we're not becoming in here authentically a different kind of people, we've got no life to share. We've got no light to shine. We've got no salt to scatter, which brings me to the second paradigm shift that we think is necessary to fully embrace in this preparation as a people for what is next as a church, and it has to do with the church. Old paradigm of how you do church or what the church is for. The old paradigm says this. It's the come and get it approach. In other words, you need it. And by you, I mean everybody outside the church. You need it. We have it. Come and get it. It's here. Alan Hirsch in his book, The Forgotten Ways, calls that approach to church ministry, The antithesis, and I agree, the antithesis of the missional church that we see in the book of Acts. Because the missional church isn't attractional. The attractional model is come and get it. You need it. We have it. Come and get it. And we're going to become as attractive as we can to get you to come and get it. The missional church isn't attractional. It's incarnational. Big difference. Think that through. What that means is the missional church is not get the world or the culture to come here and be attractive enough to get them to come here. It is the missional church, people who are becoming the kind of people who might effectively go there into the world, into their world, but what do you go with? a gospel tract put it in your pocket how about you went with a life like you had life like you actually had light and salt it's who you were and if we're going to go with that we would have to become something or someone for years we've used we've used the metaphor around here of a locker room here at Open Door. It's one you're familiar with, and I think it accurately reflects this paradigm because like a locker room, the church is not where you play the game. I've said that so many times. That's not where we live out the mission. The mission is out there. The church is where you prepare for the game. This is where we prepare for the mission that is out there. This is where we rest, having been in the game. This is where we heal so we can get back in the game because we got wounded somehow. Maybe, I don't know, this is weird, maybe we ran out of bounds. Maybe we shipwrecked our lives and wonder if we can ever give, will you come back to church and we'll heal you up and give you the grace of God and help you to stand back up again. And the church, the locker room is where you come to regroup and remember how you play the game and why you play the game. So the locker room, this is huge. I don't know if I've ever said it this way before. The locker room is for people already in the game, which is weird. What about bringing my friends to get evangelized? I know many, many people who have come to faith in this church, in this room. When they came here, it's not why we're here, though. It's not why we're here. That goes on out there. But if it was going to happen out there, people would actually have to have a life that someone else wanted. Locker rooms for people who already kind of have a sense of mission and they might not be doing it well. Just kind of overwhelmed. Like, I don't even know if I belong on this team. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. And the locker room will remind you why. Which means the locker room is really important. The church, when we gather here, it's really important. And what we do here matters a lot. But what we do here is Ephesians 4. 11 and 12. Ephesians 4, 11 and 12 says this, God has given to the church, and don't worry about this because God in every generation has provided for his church pastors, prophets, teachers, evangelists, who were equipped by God's spirit to give leadership and teaching and vision to the people of God. In every generation, God provides men and women like that. And eventually they find their way, even if God has to slap them upside the head and swallow them by a fish, with a fish someplace named Jonah. But the purpose of their place in the church is to equip the saints, the people, for the work of ministry, and we think it's in the ministries. It's not in the church. It's not so you can teach Sunday school, though we need Sunday school teachers. It's to become a people who are being equipped with the life of God so they can minister out there. It was not in here. In the old paradigm, the primary question was and is, it still exists today, it's quite dominant actually today. How do we get people out there to come in here? The answer almost always is we become more appealing, more inviting, more exciting, more attractional. Okay. Good luck with that. Reggie McNeil in his book, Missional Renaissance, referring to this old paradigm, says that in the attractional model, church members are often viewed as functionary resources to get the church to grow. So even the emphasis, he says, in recent decades on spiritual gifts has been associated with helping church members find their ministry fit in the church. Many church members have come to see spiritual gift inventories as not much more than a recruiting tool for the nominating committee or the church staff to identify the talent they need to fill jobs in the church. Further, McNeil says, frequently pastors lament to me that they can't get their high-powered laypeople involved in the church. They almost always need to start thinking about offering them a church job to entice them into the church. But think about it, says McNeil. We ask people to leave their place of greatest connection and influence, their homes, their businesses, their schools, communities, and organizations, to come and do church work. Sitting in the pews are people, men and women, who lead multi-billion dollar multinational corporations, own their own businesses, work with dozens of school students, serve in governmental and political agencies. But if they got involved in church, they'd have a ministry. does anybody want to throw up? Anyway, amen. More and more churches are becoming irrelevant to people like this, not much more than an add-on to their already busy life, and they wonder why can't God use them where they're already embedded in their homes, in their schools, workplaces, and communities. Here's a flash. God can, he does. But that's how you become an audience. That's why when we talk about our 2020 vision, part of it requires a fundamentally different way of thinking about our everyday lives as it relates to the mission of God. In the world, one more thing. This paradigm I'm talking about fits the time that we live in. Because here's the truth about the world we live in. Most people aren't interested in church. It's not even on a radar screen. I don't care how attractive you become. You're just going to invite other people from other churches who are already, but you do it funnier. You do it better. You'll just get more not interested. McNeil again says this. The American culture no longer props up the church the way it did in past years. It no longer automatically accepts the church as a player at the table of public life and can be downright hostile to the church's presence. This collapse, he says, also involves the realization that the values of classic Christianity no longer dominate the way Americans believe or behave, which makes us get, whoa, just relax about that. You're the salt of the earth. You're the light of the world. Don't worry about that. Sure, he says, when there's a community disaster or a national calamity such as 9-11, people scurry back to church. And while some prognosticators see these attendance spikes as signs of renewal and spiritual awakening, the truth is that these people who are scurrying back to church aren't looking for church, they're looking for God. And when they went to church, they didn't find God. Indeed, most people in non-church culture don't associate Jesus with the church. In their mind, they think it's an audience. Here's what he says. In their mind, the church is a club for religious people where club members can celebrate their traditions, hang out with others who look and act and think just like them. they do not automatically think of the church as championing the cause of poor people or healing the sick or serving people. Those are things they associate with Jesus. And all of that is why our 2020 vision includes becoming the kind of people who are beginning to think, and it starts there. You've got to change how you think. Who are beginning to think in a fundamentally different way about our everyday lives and how our everyday lives are connected to, how they are central to the mission of God in the world. Central to the kingdom of God. Central to the calling of God on your life and mine. And it's why our theme for Lent this year, I love this, will be about turning our face outward. When you think about Lent, I mean, some of us don't know anything about Lent. It kind of comes around this question, what are you going to give up for Lent? I remember when I was a kid, my Catholic friends would ask me, what are you going to give up for Lent? And I would say, Lent. Again, my favorite service here. They didn't even laugh at that last night. You know what we want to give up in light of what we're talking about? We want to give up our obsessive preoccupation with ourselves. Instead of pop this year. I'm going to give up pop. our obsessive preoccupation with ourselves and as the people turn our face outward and wonder together what would we see if we looked? Last week we looked at each other, so important. This week let's look out that way and wonder what we will see, what we will hear. We kick it off Wednesday. Come and be with us. If you can, stand as we're dismissed. God I thank you for what you're calling us to as a people and in my heart and I think in ours it resonates this is right and good and it doesn't feel like a new paradigm it feels like an old one it feels like something we're remembering and we're returning to what you have designed from the beginning to call out a people of your own possession who not only step into light to become light and then they figure out ways for it to be seen. Help us by your spirit to become who you've called us to be and then to do what you've called us to do wherever that is and all God's people said, Amen. God bless you as you leave. Thanks.
