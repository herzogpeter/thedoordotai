Let's pray as we go to the Word this morning. Father, my request for this service is the same as the other two, and it's very simple. I pray that, Father, in addition to the Word of the Lord this morning coming to us, that the Word of the Lord today would happen to us. And I pray that in the name of Jesus, your precious Son. Amen. I'd like you to open your Bibles with me to 1 John 4. Our continuing study of this epistle brings us to the fourth chapter, picking the study up in the seventh verse. We're entering a section of thought this morning that extends to the third verse of the fifth chapter. It's a pretty big section, and the theme of this section is love. Now, we're going to take some weeks here, and I want to tell you that partly to kind of settle me down because I want to kind of get myself off the hook and kind of give you some awareness that today I'm not going to even read every verse. I'm not going to get into every nuance of this. But by the time we're done with this, I think we're all going to be satisfied that we have really gleaned what it is that the Spirit of God is saying through John in this text about love, but it's going to take several weeks. It's the third time, actually, in this epistle that John has raised this issue of love as being of central importance. Each time, he says a little bit more about it, elaborating, expanding. In chapter 2, verses 7 to 11, he introduced the love of God. Our response to that love in chapter 2 was love. First of all, his love ignites in us our love for God and then for one another. Chapter 3, verse 11 through verse 18, he elaborated on that. And now here in chapter 4, he expands it even further, saying everything he's said before. In fact, there's some redundancy here. I struggled with that as I was studying. He's just saying the same old thing. But he's saying also much more, kind of finishing off and filling out his thoughts on this issue of love. Now, at the risk of oversimplification, what John says about love all through this epistle and now finally and fully here is this. First of all, that God is love. Verse 8, he says that. and that this God who is love has set his love on us. He is the initiator of this relationship. In other words, he loved us first. Before we loved him, he loved us. Verse 19 says precisely that. We love because he first loved us. It all began with his love. And driven by his own love for us, he has pursued us. From before time, he has pursued us and was willing to pay an enormous price to win us. to reconcile and redeem us. It says that in verse 9 and 10. By this, the love of God was manifested to us, that God has sent, the sending is the pursuit. God has pursued us by sending His only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him. This is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son, pursued us by sending His Son to be the propitiation or the satisfaction for our sins. and driven by all of this. The really good news about all this, the glorious promise of this is this, that if we have the courage to open our hearts and step into and receive what Frederick Buechner calls the furious love of God, that love will change us. That love will transform us in a number of ways that I've been able to identify. I'll give you four today very quickly. The first would be this. If you have the courage to step into and receive, believe, really sit down in the furious love of God, it will change, number one, who you are. Chapter 3, verse 1 of 1 John says that. We dealt with this a few weeks ago. See how great the love of the Father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the children of God, and such we are. Beloved, now we are the children of God. That means there's a change of identity. Ephesians chapter 1, Paul says kind of the same thing this way. There was a time, beloved, when we were separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth, strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus, you who were formerly far off have been brought near, no longer strangers and aliens, but fellow citizens with the saints at home in the household of God. Stop right there. sit down, get down into that phrase, at home in the household of God. You ever feel at home? You ever not feel at home? You know how it feels either way? Why? Why would we feel at home in the household of God? Paul tells us because we're citizens, because now we're saints. Well, I got even better news than that for you, more than being citizens, even more than being a saint as being the reason and we're at home in the household of God. Behold, now we are, according to John, the what? Children of God. See, if we have the courage, beloved, and the trust, and it takes both, and I think it's going to be clear why as I go through this word this morning, to open our hearts, to step into and receive what Frederick Buechner calls the furious love of God, it will change, number one, who we are, and it will change, number two, how we live. Now, it's going to change how we live in many ways, And we will discuss the many ways, the furious love of God, if we really believe it, will change how we live. But it starts with this. This is the fundamental change from which everything else has to flow. And you have to have this. Here's the change. No more fear. No more fear. Where did you get that, Dave? Verse 18 of chapter 4. 1 John, for perfect love, casts out fear. And what that means is it changes how you live. No longer driven by fear. Now you've got a different motivation for everything you do. No longer obeying God simply to avoid punishment. Anybody know what that feels like? Maybe like a child might, living in a home or sitting in a classroom, though never feeling loved, might still obey. Can you feature that? though never feeling cherished, might still be very compliant and eager to please. But their compliance, obedience, and eagerness to please is not being driven by the fact that they have been pursued. It is not because they have been called, drawn into, nurtured, or transformed by love. They obey simply for fear of what will happen if they don't. And what will happen if they don't is they, well, just a number of things. They might be rejected. They might get the silent treatment. They might get smacked in the head, just a whole bunch of things. And you can end up with a very rebellious person from that. But you could quite possibly end up with a very compliant, obedient, eager-to-please person. But all of that energy is being expended because of fear. But perfect love changes all that, says John. Casting out fear of punishment as being the driving force for what we do and how we live. The rest of verse 18 says all of that this way, because fear involves punishment. And the one who fears, or just interpret it in language we can get, at least I can get, is the one who fears, or the one who lives by fear, or is driven by fear and shame, has not been perfected or made complete in love. Now, when it says you've not been perfected in love, it does not mean that you're not a Christian. It doesn't mean that you don't love God. It just means that in this whole arena of God's love for you, you have not been fully formed in this. And that's why even though you're probably a Christian, what drives your behavior, even good behavior, is not love. It's still fear. Pull it all together. What I think John is saying here is this. The kind of love I'm talking about inviting you to brings with it a fundamental change, not only in who you are, because now you are a saint, now you are a citizen, now you are a child of God, but it also brings a change in how you live because now what drives your obedience is not fear of punishment from God, but your love from God, but your love for God. And, beloved, that is a fundamentally different way to live. What strikes me about this fundamentally different way to live, and I think I've already made it clear, is that you could still have behaviors that look good, but driven from a different place, it's a different way to live. We experience this. Forget the God thing. I mean, it gets too lofty for us sometimes. I've got to get this down in relationships because all of our relationships reflect these things. We experience this every day. I mean, it occurs to me that I could do the dishes. I could do the dishes. My wife is down there going, you know, you could do the dishes. But I could do the dishes. And I could do the dishes for a couple of reasons. I could walk in the door one day and see the dishes, and I realize that today I got home earlier than Bonnie did or any of the kids. Well, there's not even a chance they're going to do them. So it's either me or Bonnie. And I could look at the dishes, and I could just have this thing going, you know what? She had a harder day than me, and I'm here first, and I'm going to notice this thing. And you know what? This dishes stuff means even more to her than me because I can live with a bigger mess than she. I promise. She knows that. I can get a witness for that right now. But I can have something dawn on me, and I can start doing the dishes. And I hate doing the dishes. Promise. You probably believe that too. But I could actually do the dishes when born of love. I could do it singing a song. I just couldn't even wait for her to get home. I wouldn't say nothing, but I could do it for love. I could also do the dishes because I walked in and I got home earlier. And I know maybe the reason I do it is because I know if she walks in, she'll pitch a fit because I didn't do the dishes. And you know what? Because I'm scared of what she's going to do, I might do the dishes. And either way, the dishes got done. But I just described to you two fundamentally different ways to live. Our old friend Brennan Manning, in his book The Ragamuffin Gospel, speaks of a study that he did some years ago researching the origins of the Christian faith in the Deep South. And in the sifting through of the archives of his research, he came upon this fascinating piece of information that hundreds of years ago in the Deep South, the phrase that we have commonly come to use in our Christian culture today, born again, was hardly, if ever, used. Instead, the phrase most commonly used to describe the breakthrough into a personal life transforming with Jesus Christ was this, to be seized by the power of a great affection. I love that. Let me say it this way. Someone might today say, with great emotion and heartfelt gratitude, I came to know Christ. And he might get tears in their eyes when they say that. I was born again, and I can't even tell you when it happened, on June 5, 1980. What Manning was saying, however, was that a hundred years ago, a person in Louisiana or Mississippi would more likely say something like this on June 5th, 1880, I was seized by the power of a great affection. Among the things I love about that phrase is that it captures both the initiative of God, the powerful affection of God who loved us first, And it captures the explosion in the human heart when Jesus, instead of being some vague, distant, abstract figure in outer space, suddenly becomes alive to my senses, alive and real, the lover of my soul and the Lord of my personal and professional life. Why would he ever become the Lord of my personal or professional life? Here's why I have been seized by the power of great affection. or I could make him that because I'm scared of what will happen if I don't. Fundamentally different way to live. To be seized by the power of great affection gives new meaning to the old Russian proverb that those who have the disease called Jesus will never be cured. Because when you open your heart to, when you step into and receive what Frederick Buechner calls the furious love of God, It changes who you are. It changes how you live, no longer fear. It changes how you love and why you obey. And that is why chapter 5, verse 3 of 1 John says this, for this is the love of God that we keep His commandments. But His commandments in this context are not burdensome. Sit on that for a second. How many of you in the testimony of your heart, maybe it wouldn't be the answer you give, but really the commandments of God are always what you should do. And they are what we should do, but that's all they ever are to you, what you should do, I really should do. Well, commandments in that context sound pretty burdensome, don't they? John here says, no, no, no, in this context, why? They're not burdensome, why? Because in this context of love, keeping his commandments simply become the things we do for love, not the things we do for fear. Same behavior. different motivation for the behavior makes all the difference and represent two fundamentally different ways to live. The things we do for love. Think about that for a minute. See, people do, in fact, do extraordinary things for love, things you couldn't get them to do any other way. I've seen guys act pretty, teenagers who are pretty into being cool, Act pretty stupid for love. So we do romantic things for love, sometimes noble and sacrificial, even heroic things people will do for love. I mean, for love, people might give what they can't afford to give. For love, beloved, people might even break a vial of costly alabaster and pour it on Jesus' feet and mix it with their tears and hair and make a spectacle of themselves in front of people of propriety or who are horrified. For love, people might, like Zacchaeus, give away half of everything they own. Zacchaeus is an interesting guy. He's a pretty wealthy guy. It occurs to me about Zacchaeus that you couldn't get his stuff away from him without a gun. But for love, he gave it away for free. what you couldn't pry out of his hands, his hands for love. For love, you might stay up all night with a sick child. Not because there's a rule that says good parents stay up with a sick child. I mean, there's probably a book somewhere and there's a rule somewhere. I'm sure it says good parents stay up with sick children. But that's not why when you're captured by this kind of stuff. And you're not staying up all night because you get in trouble if you don't. You might even get arrested if you don't take care of your child. Well, you might get arrested if you don't take care of your child. But that's not why this parent is staying up all night with their sick child. Staying up all night with your sick child is what you do. It's just what you do for love. I was really moved last Sunday when I saw some friends of mine after church. I hadn't seen them in a while. Just the holiday stuff happens and people are coming and going. And I wanted to talk to them because I hadn't seen them, talked to them for a while. But I also wanted to talk to them because they both look really tired to me on that day. and they have a daughter, and many of you know them, and Doug and Jamie, or Doug, Greg and Jamie have a little girl named Inga who has been sick ever since she's been born. She's 18 months old. We've prayed for her several times here in church. Her little lungs are struggling with their development, and there's some diseases. The doctors are really struggling with identifying it. Everything from cystic fibrosis to a bad cold kind of thing is going on, and we know it's more than a cold. She's having a hard time sustaining her weight. has a problem with a valve in her stomach and can't keep food down. As I talked with Jamie, she told me how just with some fatigue and close to tears, for the last week and way longer than a week, they've been up just about every night, including the night previous to church from about 2 o'clock in the morning to 5 with Inga. She just can't keep food down. But she came to church. And that was a good thing, but Greg is on the altar team, and Greg came to pray, to pray for other people, people who had no idea what was going on with him. I was hearing the story, and my heart was going out to both of them, trying to sympathize. I mean, this is a crazy thing for a pastor, but I kind of wondered, Jamie, why don't you just stay home today? You could have stayed home today. And, you know, if you came, Greg didn't have to pray. Everybody would have understood. That would have been just fine. and she said well we were going to stay home in fact we were struggling this morning with whether we should or not and I turned the alarm off at first but then we got up and Greg just really felt like God wanted us to come and not only come that Greg was supposed to pray so there he was exhausted and empty but obedient interesting I talked to Greg after and there were three people that he prayed with all of whom had very serious issues with lung disease in their family or them. They just felt like, I don't know what this is about, but I can. Let me ask you a question. Let me ask you a question. Why did he do that? Do you think he did that because he was afraid of being punished if he didn't? I don't. So I just think it's the kind of thing you do for love, which, by the way, helps me clarify something very important about chapter 5, verse 3, when John says the commandments of the Lord are not burdensome. You see, he does not mean by that that the commandments of the Lord are always easy. It wasn't easy to come when you didn't feel like coming. It doesn't mean by not burdensome that the commandments of the Lord are easy, light, and breezy. You see, while opening our hearts to the relentless love of God changes us, please hear me, beloved, it also calls us. It makes demands of us. Now, before you freak out on, oh, what are the demands, what are the demands, you're kind of ready for a list of demands. Understand this. Again, instinctively we know this. All love makes demands. It's quite frankly why we often hold authentic love at arm's length. It's quite frankly why some of us, even in marriage context, don't experience love because we hold even the person we're married to at arm's length because we know that authentic love is going to call for some things from me. It's why we often, I believe, hold God's love at arm's length. It's much easier, quite frankly, to have an arrangement with God than a love affair with God because if all it is is an arrangement, I can go to church and feel better. I can read a verse and feel better. I can tip my hat to God, do a little list of behaviors and feel better. But hold the passion of God, his love for me, and what that calls from me at arm's length. See, passionate love coming toward me makes demands of me. Again, instinctively, we feel this in relationships. Just kind of feature it this way. We begin to date. Feelings start to stir. One of the people in this relationship begins to come on a little bit stronger than the other one. Gifts that feel way too extravagant. I mean, you're spending too much money on me here, and you feel very awkward. And when this other person is coming on with kind of big love and big promises and expensive gifts, you might really like that, but you also might pull away. Why would you pull away? Because this person's love, by virtue of what love is, is making a demand. And do you know what love demands? What love demands is love. That's all. Just that. The kind of love that might just pour out a vial of alabaster. Oh, boy. The kind of love that might just stay up all night with a child cleaning up vomit. The kind of love that might offer up a life to God, singing softly in the night when no one hears or sees but God. Words like this, take my life and let it be. Consecrated, Lord, to Thee. Nobody sees. Nobody hears. Just God, take my hands and let them move at the impulse of thy love. Take my feet and let them be swift and beautiful for thee. Take my voice and let me sing always only for my king. Take my silver and my gold. Not a mite would I withhold. Why would anybody talk like that? Why would anybody live like that? It's just what you do for love because what love demands is love. John says it this way, verse 16. Again, chapter 4. And we have come to know and have believed the love which God has had for us. Stop right there. Let that in. I can't slide over that. Listen to the confidence that John is living with relative to the love of God. We have come to know and have believed. I have let it in. I have received it. I'm sitting down in it. Nothing can change the love of God that he has for me, a love that has pursued me. Verse 19, he says, we love him because he pursued us first. He loved us first, and this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us. Verse 10, chapter 3, verse 16, he said, we know love by this, that he laid down his life for us. That's a pretty expensive gift. That's more expensive than jewelry. And then Paul adds in Romans 5.8, speaking of the same event, but giving it the appropriate context, you need to remember that he didn't just lay down his life for us. It was while we were yet sinners. It was while we were yet hostile that he laid down his life, that he pursued us, that he loved us. Put this in human terms. This guy's coming on pretty strong. Wouldn't you say? and do you understand now why people hold the love of God out here? Just let it be religion. Just let it be go to church on Sunday because this kind of love is coming on pretty strong. He might want more than a peck on the cheek. This God. See, when I say that all love asks for is love, I think all of us instinctively know that when we say all love asks for is love, is that all love asks for is everything. He wants it all. The hymn writer Isaac Watts reveals that he got that. It went in the last phrase of his hymn, When I Survey the Wondrous Cross. He writes this, love so amazing, so divine, demands. What's a hostile word? That's a icky word. Demands my soul, my life, my all. some time ago I pointed out to you and I think we were in exodus when I did this but I pointed out that the word of God all through the word of God employs a wide scale of metaphors to describe a relationship with with God through Christ and when we put them in an ascending order there is a noticeable and powerful progression for instance down near the bottom he is the potter and we are the clay and I respond to that in a positive way and my response when I hear that analogy is mold me and make me. Up a notch from that analogy, he is the shepherd and we are the sheep. Just step up on the food chain here, but hardly flattering if you think about it. The sheep is neither graceful nor intelligent. Up from there, he is master and we are servant. I like this one. I respond to this one. I live in this one, and so do you a lot. I don't mind being his servant, and I want to hear, well done, thou good and faithful servant. This one gets me in the house. See, in this analogy, I'm past a lifeless piece of clay. I'm no longer a dumb animal. But if you really think about the analogy of being a servant and he's the master, as a servant only, if I never understand more than that about my relationship with God through Christ, I still have the feeling that this isn't my house. I'm kind of, I hope they don't catch me here. This isn't where I live. I just work here. Many Christians never understand their relationship with Christ as being more than that, and they're comfortable with that. Partly because if all I am ever is a servant, then my role is clear. I just do what I'm told. I obey the orders. I do the list. I keep the rules. I kind of clean up the house and leave. Lock the door when I go. Hope that he liked my work. I did it for him. I really did do it for him. But we need to understand that the ladder of metaphors is about to take a quick ascent. For beyond clay, sheep, and servants, we are, according to John's epistle, his children, and he is our Abba, which brings with it the possibility of an entirely different way to live. No longer is there any doubt that this is the house, that I belong in, that I belong in it. See, love is not something that the clay and the potter share. Nor does the sheep really know the heart of the shepherd, though he may enjoy the fruits of the shepherd's kindness. And the master may like you and may pat you on the head and be very pleased with your work, but all the master really owes the servant is pay. But as a son, as a daughter, I now have access. I matter to God. I belong to God. But I got news for you that ascends even higher than that. For now, I call you friend, Jesus said to the disciples. Friendship levels the playing field in a way that the parent-child relationship doesn't. Now I'm taking my place with him in the work of the kingdom of God. The highest and deepest, most exhilarating and quite frankly frightening metaphor of our relationship with God is when Paul in particular compares our relationship this way, saying, I am the bride and he is the groom. What kind of love is that? And what does that kind of love demand? Ephesians chapter 1, the Apostle Paul lets us in on a little secret. It's this, we've been more than noticed, we've been pursued. Farther than space and longer than time, for God had you in his heart before the foundation of the world. And that is why he came for us, to be with us, not just as clay with potter, or sheep with shepherd, or servant with master, or even child with parent, or friend with peer. but he has called us to be with him as bride and groom. What kind of love is that? What does that kind of love demand? I don't know for sure what kind of love demands, but I'm beginning to get the sneaking suspicion that it is going to call more from me than a tip of the hat, a kiss on the cheek, a little church attendance here, a little money on the plate over there, love is going to call for more. He's going to want a relationship. John Eldridge, in the wonderful book I've made reference to in the past and highly recommend to you now, entitled The Sacred Romance, says it this way. God created us for intimacy with him. When we turned our back on him, he continued to pursue us all through history. He sent personal messengers, prophets, priests, and kings. Sometimes he used beauty to recapture our hearts, sometimes affliction. But after all else failed, God conceived the most daring of plans. Under the cover of night, he stole into the enemy camp incognito, the ancient of days disguised as a newborn. While the whole world lay under the power of the evil one and we were held in the dungeons of darkness, God risked it all to rescue us. All of which raises for me two questions. Number one, what does he see in us? Number two, what does he want from us? Well, some say what God wants most is obedience. Well, that's sure important. Some say what God wants most is sacrifice, morality, adherence to right doctrine. Others, more therapeutic, say God really wants, what God really wants is our contentment, our happiness and self-actualization. Here's the deal, beloved. He is, of course, concerned with all those things. All those things. But, beloved, they are not his primary concern. For what he is after is you. He is after you. Your laughter, your tears, your dreams, your fears, your heart of hearts. Indeed, beloved, the lament of God, the anguish of God expressed through the prophet Jeremiah is this. These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. In vain do they worship me, and I'm tired of their many words. What he's saying is this. I'm tired. I'm just tired of people who are simply going through the motions, who are doing their duty. They're doing the dishes because they're scared of what I'm going to do. If they don't, I want more than that. I want a people I came and died. I came and gave so that we could enter into a relationship where they might begin to do what they do for love. That is the heart of God. Because what love demands is love, Which simply means what love demands is everything. Demands. That word demands, it sounds forceful, doesn't it? Well, I don't want to take one bit away from it because it is forceful. But it can't be forced. It creates the strangest tension actually for God. Philip Yancey, in his wonderful book, Disappointment with God, kind of says all of that this way. And I quote, Power can do everything, but the most important thing, what power can't do is control love. In a concentration camp, for instance, the guards possess almost unlimited power. By applying force, they can make you curse your family. By applying force, they can make you renounce your God, work without pay, eat human excrement, kill and bury your closest friend. All of that is within their power. But one thing is not within their power. They cannot force you to love them and then to, by love, serve them. This fact may help explain, says Yancey, why God is sometimes shy to use his power. For his most impressive and frightening displays of the same do nothing to foster love, only compliance. God's problem, you see, is not that he is unable to do certain things. God's problem is that he loves. Love has complicated the life of God. The reason he didn't make puppets is because he wanted lovers. He wanted a relationship of love. The kind of love that just might pour out a vile valabaster, that just might give half of everything it owns, that just might stay up all night with a vomiting child, that just might sing softly in the night when no one sees and no one hears but God. Take my life and let it be. Consecrated, Lord, to Thee and take my hands and take my feet and take my voice. In a dungeon, which had been years before the dwelling place, for its prisoner who eventually died there was found etched in the walls these words. Could we with ink the ocean fill, and were the skies of parchment made? Were every stalk on earth a quill, and every man a scribe by trade? to write the love of God above would drain the ocean dry nor could the scroll contain the whole though stretched from sky to sky oh love of God how rich and pure how measureless and strong you need to know that as I this morning attempt to preach to you the love of God the kind of love that if responded to by you has the power to change who you are, how you live, how you love, and why you obey, that I do this preaching in the shadow of that prose. That prose which affirms, I don't care how well I say it, I can't come close to describing to you the love of God. But I will take comfort in this thought. It's become my prayer all week for this sermon. It's what I prayed at the very beginning of this sermon. I'll explain it this way. Several places in the Old Testament, it says this, that the word of the Lord came to this person or that person. The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah. The word of the Lord came to Isaiah. I don't know about you, but I kind of try to imagine things, and sometimes I'm kind of wooden in my literalism, and I kind of wonder, Jeremiah, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, So God was talking and he was writing it down as like a dictation thing, is kind of how I have featured it. Well, I missed it, but you say that again. What did you get? Okay, now I got it. And we get stuck in these, whatever. The Hebrew language, however, is very colorful and goes far beyond the picture and actually captures what probably did indeed happen because the Hebrew word there does not mean the word of the Lord came to them. What it really means is that the word of the Lord happened to them. Feature it now that way. The word of the Lord happened to Jeremiah. The word of the Lord happened to Isaiah. The word of the Lord happened to John. The word of the Lord happened to the Apostle Paul. And when the word of the Lord happened to them, they wrote it down. This was this incredible experience of God's reality and amazing love. With all of that, I close by indicating that my prayer as I close is this. That this word today about the measureless love of God would happen to you the way it has happened to me. It has happened to me. And it has changed everything. And if you have the courage, and it does take courage, to open your heart to the furious love of God. To step into it and to receive it. and maybe today to remember it, because we forget it. I'm going to promise you something. Here's the promise. It will change you. It will change who you are. It will change how you live. No longer motivated by fear. It will change how you love. And it will change why you obey. But it will do more than change you. it'll call you. This is the scary part. And it will challenge you. And it will demand some things of you. For what love demands is love. Which means what love demands is just everything. It's just everything. I'm going to do with you what I've done with the other two services and just ask you just quietly to be quiet for a moment. I want you to really respect. If this is, if you don't, it doesn't touch you at all, that's fine. Just respect what God may be doing in the person next to you. Just a moment of silence. Let the Spirit of God just kind of go inside of you with this word about the furious love of God. Just be quiet. Listen to the Spirit. Father, we get so used to going to church sometimes. We just go to church and we listen to the talks and we sing the songs and we end up just kind of analyzing them. That was good, that wasn't good, yada, yada, yada. Our prayer today is that this word, even if the words themselves are all forgotten, I pray this word about your furious love, your pursuing love, I pray that it would happen to us. And that as it does, Father, it would continually change who we are and how we live and how we love and why we obey. And Father, we would even let it bring us to the scary place where it doesn't just change us, it calls us. And that we, as we open our heart to you, we allow it to make some demands of us. And we respond to those demands with love, with yes. Do these things among us by your Spirit's life and power. In Jesus' name. And all God's people said, amen. The altar team will be here for anyone who needs prayer for anything.
