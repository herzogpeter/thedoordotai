And you were dead in your trespasses and sins in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince and the power of the air of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath even as the rest. But God, being rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, he made us alive together with Christ. By grace you've been saved and has raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus in order that in the ages to come he might show the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace, you've been saved through faith. And that not of yourselves, it's a gift of God. Not as a result of works that no one should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for the purpose of good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, us take your word which is alive and do your work in our hearts this morning amen the book of ephesians we have learned is a book about what it means to be in christ it's a book about riches it's a book about fullness it's a book about being one with christ it's a book that tells us about being part of the body of Christ, master plan before the foundation of the world. And we get chills when we think about that. Chapter 1, verses 1 through 14, we saw that master plan before the foundation of the world being mapped out by God himself. Paul took us back, as it were, into the very council chambers of God. And we saw the promises of God towards those who believe being delineated, that we are chosen in him before the foundation of the world so that we can stand before him holy and blameless, not because we've done anything right, but by faith receive the gift he's given, we're adopted as sons, we're redeemed, bought out of the marketplace, forgiven of our sins, and then on top of all that, we have an inheritance that's secure because it's sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise. Exciting truth. Exciting truth. And we spent several weeks just going over those first 14 verses. And then Paul did something after he finished those first 14 verses delineating all these powerful promises towards those who believe. And he backed off in verse 15 and just kind of said, wait a minute, I've done enough talking. I need to just sit here and pray that you understand what I just told you. Because it's not enough that you intellectually know, you need to understand. You need to understand. In verse 18 he says, I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, that the eyes of your understanding may be enlightened so that you may know what is the hope of his calling, his plan for you, what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints. You need to know all you have in Christ. You need to know who you are in Christ, because if you don't, you're never going to be able to live the life he's called us to live. It's always going to be a thing you're trying really hard to do. We talked about the fact two weeks ago that all of the riches that he could possibly give, has given. They are ours. We are complete. We were not spiritual polywogs, as it were, being born, but needing something more, needing an arm and a leg, something drop off, something come on. What we need, we are born complete. We are complete in him. Colossians 2, 9 and 10 tells us that in him dwells the fullness of the Godhead in a bodily form, and in him you have been made what? Complete. What we need to do is grow. What we need to do is mature. What we need to do is learn how to use the resources that he's already given us. Chapter 2 then, the apostle Paul moves from eternity past, chapter 1, and he moves into time in chapter 2. And he describes for us the very act that draws us into that masterful plan of eternity. That act is simply this, the miracle of salvation. Now I want you to know something as we approach this text. There's something else I want you to keep in mind because it's a very important part of the context of this entire text. One of Paul's thrusts in chapter 1, we picked it up a couple of weeks ago, and it flows into the second chapter of Ephesians, is this, that we are possessors of the power of God. We are possessors of the power of God. You remember how he brought this theme in the 19th verse? Let's start with the 18th, where he's telling us all the hope of his calling, wanting us to understand that, what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance and the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of his power toward us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of his power, his power. He wants us to understand that, that we possess that power. And he wants us to see that at the moment of salvation, the moment you believe, you received all that power. You received all his riches, all his resources. And then to kind of convince us that that power is really valid. He gives us an illustration. He says, the power that is at work within you is the same power that raised Christ from the dead, verse 20, and exalted him above every name. Verse 20, 21, 22, and 23. That same power that raised Christ from the dead is the same power, that same resurrection power is at work in your life. He has done the same thing for you. Resurrection power. What do you mean resurrection power in my life? I don't see any of that. I don't understand what you're talking about. Verses 5 and 6 of chapter 2 tells us what we're talking about. Even when you were dead in your transgressions, he made us alive with Christ. We're alive. We're complete in him. Ti telestai. It is finished. Complete. You couldn't possibly have more of God's power, of his glory, than you already have right now. What we need to do is understand that it is ours and begin to grow therein. You know what? This whole thing, this power I'm talking about from death to life is the miracle of salvation. That's the miracle of salvation, and that's the miracle that we're talking about in chapter 2 of the book of Ephesians, and we need to grasp it. Let's take a look at it. To see the general outline of Ephesians chapter 2, we could see that it breaks down basically into three pretty simple stages. The first stage is the pastor. By the way, he's talking to Christians here. He's talking to those who are already in Christ, so that's very important we understand that. The first stage is verses 1 through 3, the past dimension of salvation. This is what you were before you met Christ. Verses 4 through 6 and 8 through 9 is the present working of salvation. This is who you are. This is who you are right now. You're alive. And verses 7 and verse 10 is the future, what you are to become as you walk with the Lord. But under that general thrust, there are six basic principles that we need to understand about this particular text. Six dimensions of salvation that I want us to understand. And it breaks down like this. Salvation is, one, from death. Two, by love. Three, into life. Four, with a purpose. Five, through faith. Six, unto good works. You got that? You'll get it later. We'll go through it slower. Okay, the first dimension. The first thing we need to understand is that salvation is from death. From death. Verses one through three. And you were dead. Now I want you to understand again, if you're a Christian, this is part of your past. But I also want you to understand, if you haven't responded to Christ, this passage right here is part of your present. This is where you are right now. You were dead. Paul is introducing us here to the basic problem of man. You see, Paul is saying here that the basic problem of man is not that he is out of harmony with his environment. He is not unable, the basic problem of man is not that he can't maintain relationships. You know what? He can't maintain relationships. What he's saying here, though, is that's a symptom. That isn't the real problem. The problem is this. He's dead. He's dead. It's pretty blunt, isn't it? Chapter 4, verse 18 says this. The man alienated from God is darkened in their mind, excluded from the life of God. He's dead. He's dead. Obviously, what we're talking about here is a spiritual death. It's not a physical death because physically we're alive, the body is alive. What he's talking about here are people who are dead to God. What does that mean, basically? What does it mean to be spiritually dead? What's the big deal? I think the best way to grasp what spiritual death is is simply by comparing it to physical death. Physical death is simply this. It's an inability on my part to respond to anything. Okay? You got that? That's a good definition ties in well here. Physical death is an inability on my part to respond to anything. If you've ever gone to a funeral or ever had an experience in your family where somebody died, you know exactly what I mean. You can go to the funeral, the person is laying there, you can stick them with a pen, nothing happens. You can cry, you can try to resuscitate, you can do all sorts of things. I don't care what the stimulation you use on that person is, they're not going to respond, they're dead. Spiritual death is being dead to God, it's being unresponsive to God. It's having an inability to respond to the things of the Lord. And very often Christians, when we share with people, we get pretty frustrated. We think we're doing something terribly, terribly wrong because the people we're talking to aren't responding all the time. One of the things we need to know is their spiritual death. They're almost totally incapable of responding. They're weird. You're a strange person. We need to get the picture, and that's exactly what Paul is doing here. These are more than words. What Paul is doing is painting a picture. The unbeliever is dead. He is unresponsive to God. And you know what the unbeliever needs more than anything in the world? He doesn't need resuscitation, does he? He needs resurrection. He needs resurrection. He needs the power of God in his life. He needs new life. He needs, here's this fun word, he needs to be born again. We've lost that word, haven't we? We've lost it to kind of a movement. It's almost become a joke, but that's exactly what he needs. He needs new life. The touch of God in his life, and that's salvation. That's salvation. But Paul goes on and develops this picture of this dead person, this spiritually dead person, a little bit more. And it really gets graphic. You see, this person who is spiritually dead is not just sitting dead. It isn't. It's bad if we get the picture of somebody sitting in a coffin. Because that isn't the picture that Paul is giving us here. This is more of a, let's read that second verse. First, verse 2. And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you formerly walked. Literally, the picture Paul is painting here is one who is walking and yet he's dead. Literally, it's a case of death walking. Okay? A case of death walking. You ever watch science fiction movies when you were a kid? The zombies all over, right? Their eyes were open and they would walk like this and they were real. They were insensitive to anything that was going on around them, but they looked like they were alive. That's exactly the picture Paul is painting here of spiritual deadness. They're alive, yet they're dead. They're going through the motions. They're doing a lot of things that look like they're alive, but they're not. They're dead. They even think themselves to be alive. They're walking around. Their eyes are open. They're moving. They're going through the motions. They may be very, very religious, going through all sorts of religious motions, but there is no life of God. They're cut off, and they don't even know it. They're zombies, spiritual death walkers. 1 Timothy 5, 6 says, But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead even while she lives. Matthew 13, 13, Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees and he says, I speak to them in parables. I speak to you in parables. Why? Because while seeing, you do not see. And while hearing, you do not hear. Why? You're dead. You're zombies. You're death walkers. You're going through the motions, but there is no life. You know, you think about that and you kind of take the picture Paul is painting here of the condition of man and you translate that to the condition we have in the world. And we're painting quite a graphic picture here, aren't we? Of the condition of man. Spiritual death walkers, zombies. But let's go on. He says more than you're just dead. He says you're dead in your trespasses and in your sins. The opposite of being in Christ is being where? In sin. You see that again? We're talking positional truth, aren't we? We know all about positional truth because we've been in the book of Ephesians for about six months, it seems like. Okay. The opposite of being in Christ is being in sin. Positionally before God, you're in sin if you're spiritually dead. The result. Okay, let me get this right. The reason you are in sin is because you're dead. It isn't the other way around. We could go on and on in that. I'll just throw that out if you want to write it down. You write it down and you think about it later. Okay? The reason you are in sin is because you're dead. You can't respond. There's nothing you can do. Let me go on. It's very important if we're going to grasp this concept here that we understand the word sin, what it really means. And there is a bit of confusion. In fact, as I was studying this, some things kind of came to me as it relates to salvation in this particular text. The word is this, hamartia. Now, you're familiar with that. I remember talking about it even since I've been here, giving you that word. It means, I bet most of you could tell me, it means to miss the mark. Okay? Sin means to miss the mark. Sin is simply failing to hit God's target. For all have sinned, right? And come short of the glory of God. They fall short of God's glory. Now, if you grasp this, I think it's going to begin to alter our view of what sin is and how it interacts with our need for salvation. Sin, get this, is not an issue of what I do right or wrong. Hang with me here. Sin is not an issue of something that I do that is either right or wrong. Sin is an issue of something I have failed to do. You got that? I hope it comes clear as we go along. What I've failed to do is hit God's target. You got that? let me give you an illustration to help you get grasp this a little bit better sin is not a matter of something i've done either good or bad it's something i have failed to do i failed to hit the target a bunch of the young marys and singles and things like that got together at elmer and anita carlson's house and they've got this lake and i had this terrible thing because the lake was frozen and i couldn't go around baptizing everybody but uh we had a good time and i was just thinking of this if all of us got down into the lake and we had a contest and all the water was there there wasn't any ice and we wanted to get to the other side of the lake and what you could do anything you wanted, okay? You could only have one jump, though. You could jump off the diving board. You could jump off the house. You could take a running start. You could do anything you want, and we would all try to jump off this edge and get to the other side of the lake. Well, you know what? Some of us would get further than others. Some of us would be ankle deep. Some of us would be knee deep. Some of us would be waist deep. Some of us would be up over our necks. I would. I always am. But you know what? The problem is, no matter how sincere we would have been, no matter how hard we would have tried, no matter what kinds of connivings and manipulations and little techniques we had perfected to do that, the matter wouldn't have been how much we did, how far we got. The problem is this. None of us made it. None of us made it. Sin is not a matter of what you've done. I don't care how much you've done. Sin is a matter of what you fail to do. You fail to hit the target. Matthew 5.48 says, Be ye perfect, even as I am perfect. 1 Peter 1.16 says, Be ye holy, even as I am holy. That's the target. None of us have hit it. Every one of us falls short. All have sin. We're dead in our sin. We're dead in our sin. The reason I bring this up is obvious, I think. Because invariably, when we talk about salvation and people's need for it, people start beginning to evaluate their lives on a scale of what is good and bad and what they've done good and what they've done bad. We do that all the time. In fact, I got a feeling that a lot of people figure God grades on a curve. You know what I mean? Kind of at the end, he's going to kind of do it all out, and everybody's kind of in this little bunch here, and we'll all get seized, but we'll pass. Okay? Sounds kind of trite, but basically I think we think that way. Or a lot of us throw ourselves into systems of religion that will foster our desire to do something that will attain salvation. They'll teach me techniques to jump a little further, okay? The problem is this. You don't understand. Sin is not a question of what you do. It's a matter of what you failed to do. You failed to hit the target. I don't care how much you've done. It doesn't matter how many good things you've done. You've still failed to do one thing. That's hit the target. Looks pretty hopeless, doesn't it? We're painting a pretty hopeless picture of the condition of man. He's dead in his sin, and there's nothing he can do about hitting the target because he's already blown it. He's already fallen short. It's pretty hopeless. Hang on. It gets worse. Verse 2, let's look at it. Okay, you're dead in your trespasses and in your sins in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince and the power of the air of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. A real interesting verse here. Here we have spiritually dead people, death walkers, zombies, walking through life in their sin, not even knowing it, in which you formerly walked according to the course of this cosmos. Now, this does not mean the physical world. They were walking around in the world. It means you are walking around according to the attitude of the age, according to the philosophy of the day, according to the spirit of the day. You are walking along according to the spirit of the day, doing what the spirit of the day told you to do. And all of this is being controlled by the prince and the power of the air. Basically, he's calling the shots. Satan is behind the whole thing. The trends, the philosophies, the teachings, the cultures that are telling me how to live. Basically what this verse is telling us is that the spiritual death walker is a victim of the spirit of the age. He's a victim of the attitude of the age, the philosophy of the age. And that philosophy that is permeating our society is being orchestrated by none other than Satan himself. And we hear people say this, you know what, the reason I'm kind of rejecting Christianity and I really can't get into what you're trying to share with me is this, that I'm really enjoying doing what I want to do. I've got a lot of freedom, you see, and I'm just living my life the way I want to live it. Well, Paul looks right into the teeth of that and says, you're nuts. You're deceived. You're being deluded. You think you're doing what you want. Really, what you're doing is simply doing whatever the spirit of the age tells you to do. The spiritual zombie thinks he's doing what he wants to do, but really, he's just doing what the philosophy of the day tells. If the philosophy of the day says be have morality well then everybody's kind of whether they're alive or dead in christ they're kind of a moral kind of group of people they just kind of go along with it if the society of the day the spirit of the age is freedom and do what you feel then oh everybody can the spiritual zombies kind of just go right along with what the spirit of the age says you're not doing what you want you're controlled by the zeitgeist germans call it the zeitgeist he does what the world tells him to do. He says what the world tells him to say. So we walk around in the sphere of sin and feel okay. Why? Because the spirit of the age says it's okay. It's okay. Just do it. Just go ahead and we just kind of follow along. Again, kind of a graphic picture. The spirit of the age tells us that humanism is the thing. Man is the measure of all things. You are the measure of truth. If you think it's truth, it's truth. That's fine. God is not real. He's just kind of an oblong blur. If you want to believe in it, it's fine, but we wish it didn't. You are king. That's it. The spirit of the age says, that's it. It sounds good. We just go along. It's real fine, real nice. The spirit of the age says materialism is the thing. That's what's going to bring fulfillment. So you need more money. You need more things. You need a bigger house. You need more cars. And it doesn't really matter how many times we find out that that never does bring fulfillment. And every time we go for it and pour our lives into it, we get frustrated. The spiritual zombie is just a victim of the spirit of the age so he keeps going and going and going into it it's the zeitgeist so the spiritual zombie goes for it what do you think about it this is quite a picture again that paul's painting of the condition of man and the result of all of that is verse three among them we too formerly lived in the lust of our flesh indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind just being controlled by any little thing i feel i was just there was no other control on my life but the things i just felt like doing being driven the result of all that is that we were by nature children of wrath this may sound kind of rough but basically what's that what that means is this person this death walker the spiritual zombie who is living according to the spirit of the age and just being controlled by it as a bullseye for the judgment of god but god verse four but god i love the contrast here verse one and you were dead but god verse four you see salvation is from death but it's by love he brings us into life but god being rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us i wasn't going to say this but i got to say this this is important you know that we have not only sinned against his law we have sinned against his love and that makes his love even a little bit more let me give you an example of what that means i'm driving my car and i'm acting like an idiot i never do that by the way i never act like an idiot but this time i am just for illustration okay i'm driving like an idiot i'm acting irresponsible i'm not paying attention to what i'm doing and a little girl or a little boy runs in front of me and I hit them with my car and they die. And I have to go to court because I've broken the law. I was driving irresponsibly, I was breaking the law, I was speeding and da-da-da-da-da. On and on and on. Blah, blah, blah. Okay? Okay, I come into the court of law and there's a price that has to be paid for that law I broke. And maybe there's a fine and maybe there's a jail sentence. Well, I pay the fine and I pay the jail sentence. I do my time. I come out of jail and I have, I am okay as far as the law is concerned, but I have a problem and that's that little kid's mother. You see, I haven't sinned against her law. I have sinned against her love, haven't I? And there's only one way that I'm ever going to have a relationship with that person. And that's this. If that person unconditionally comes to me and says, David, I forgive you. We have not only sinned against his law, we have sinned against his love. His son had to die. And he comes to us and he says, I forgive you. There's no other way we could ever have a relationship with him unless he did that. there's no there's no way we could put the law back together it's been broken there's only one way and he did it but god i'm spiritually dead a zombie a death walker but god being rich in mercy because of his great love which he loved us but you know what is so neat it was more than love it was more than love it was by love he brings us to life it was more than love what does the dead man need more anything else we already talked about it it isn't love a dead man doesn't need love anymore it's too late he doesn't need a coffin either he needs a resurrection he needs a resurrection he needs the touch of god on his life and here again is where the power i talked about at the beginning comes in again verses five and six even when you were dead in your transgressions in your sin he made us alive together with christ second corinthians 5 17 says therefore if any man's in Christ, he's what? He's a new creature. I like that. It means more to me now that I know what I just learned in Ephesians, because it means a new creature. It means I'm no longer a death walker. I'm no longer a spiritual zombie. I'm alive. I'm alive. Believer, this is a miracle of salvation. He made us alive. He raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places. That's done. It's complete. I'm not there now, but it's as if it's already done because it's so sure his promises toward me are yay and amen this is not a religion this is not a ritual that we go through this is not even a warm and gooey feeling salvation is taking a spiritual death walker and bringing him into life it's a resurrection we're talking about a resurrection no longer alienated from the life of god becoming sensitive to god once i was blind and now i see i'm alive salvation is from death by god's love into life third with the purpose with the purpose and what was the purpose why did he do all this verse seven i love this you know why he saved us well he saved us to get us out of hell you know what primarily the reason he saved us was in order that in the ages to come he might show the surpassing riches of his grace and kindness toward us in christ jesus the reason he saved us primarily was so that he could lavish upon us all his riches and all his grace and all his love and all his forgiveness i'm going to say it a little crass but i want to bring it across god gets his kicks by pouring on me all his grace all his love forgiveness and acceptance over and over and over again forever he gets his joy by taking spiritual death walkers and making them alive in christ and then showering them forever with his love i like that where do we get the idea that when i got christ i needed something more we have all the resources we need right here this is the miracle of salvation god saved us for the purpose of unloading on us all the riches of his grace salvation is from death by love into life with a purpose that he could just shower upon us all his grace through faith number four through faith verses eight and nine this is important and really hang with me here because this is the thing that kind of kicks it all off and takes it off the page and makes it apply to my life for by grace you have been saved through faith and then not of yourselves it's a gift of God not as a result of works that no one should boast this is so simple and so clear I almost feel like I don't have to explain it anymore that's the that's the thing that engages God's promises toward me that's what brings his life-giving power into my life is that faith through faith for by grace you've been saved through what some of the things we think through what? Through going to church? For by grace you've been saved through going to church. How often are you going to have to go? There's no way. For by grace you've been saved through doing six prayers a day for the next 20 years. Uh-uh. It doesn't say that. For by grace you've been saved through ritual, through communion? No. Through baptism? No. Through observing holy days? A lot? No. A lot more? No. Never. It doesn't. See, the problem is this. God says, hey, it's really nice that you do all those things. I'm really glad you go to church. That's neat. I'm really glad you take communion. That's good. I'm really glad you got baptized. That's fine. But the problem here isn't that. It has nothing to do with something you've done. The problem is what you failed to do. You failed to hit the mark. And I don't care how much you do. You'll never make it. You're dead in your sin and there's only one thing that can change that. it's an act of God a resurrection from the dead and God says to us I offer you that life as a gift grace, caris, grace, gift for by grace this is a gift you receive it through faith there's only one thing you can do to get it and that is receive it accept it believe it you know we really do have an urge to do something I don't know, something about our human nature that I just can't one of the big stumbling blocks with this whole message of salvation is that I just need to do something there's got to be something that I do and God says Paul says in this particular text if there's something you got to do I'll give you something to do by faith receive it that's what you do do that verse 9 is important this gift that you receive this resurrection that you received through faith is not a result of works so that no one can boast you see if salvation came as a result of something i did again we've gone over this then i would have every right to stand before you and say hey look what i did i made it say i i performed that ritual four million times and four million and one is all i needed and so i'm going to do it one more time and i'll be in i did it lord you got to take me now because i'm so great look what i did no way there's no there's no room for boasting that approach appeals to us again and that's why i believe major systems of religion even major systems of religion who have the banner over their church being christianity foster that whole approach that it's something you do you keep the rules you go through this ritual you just do it so many times and you make it the problem is scripture runs absolutely counter to that you see the problem with all of this and me trying to earn it for myself is that god wants the glory we learned that in ephesians one he did all of this before the foundation of the world so we wouldn't get messed up and think it had something to do with us he wants all the glory this is not a religion of human achievement it's all of god and he did it before the foundation of the world i want you to back off a minute and look at this whole text just look at it it couldn't be more clear. If you're here this morning and you've never heard this, maybe you're a believer. I hope you've learned something. But you could be here this morning, and I just want to tell you, this couldn't be more clear as to what salvation from the Word of God tells us what it really is. Verses 1 through 3 tells us the condition of ourselves without God on our own, trying really hard. You're dead. You're dead in your sin. But God, verse 4, being rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us looked down on me with love and made me alive in christ resurrection but he did more than that he raised me up with him it's done exaltation the same thing he did with christ verses 19 and 20 in the other chapter he's done with me spiritually he rose he raised him from the dead he exalted him on high he's raised me from the dead he's exalted me on high and that position's secure but he's done more than that he's pouring out on me all the riches of his grace and then he offers it all to me as a nice little package and says it's a gift buddy and if you want it you can have it but you can't get it any other way and you can go on trying if you want but you're going to fall short you're going to fall short every time so let's what's left for me to do one thing accept the gift and start living accept the gift and start living go from death to life salvation is from death by love into life with the purpose through faith you say can we can we really know that there's eternal life just by faith is that really a feasible that just goes against my grain i mean i'm even from a church where they tell me that you can't know and that's how they kind of keep us going trying to trying to earn it first john chapter 5 verses 11 through 13 says he who has the son has life he who does not have the son of god does not have life again that illusion death in life he who has the son has life he who does not have the son is spiritually dead and these things i write to you children why so that you may know no underline it that you have eternal life yes you can know yes you can know but all this thing wraps up its salvation is from death by love and the life with a purpose through faith and it all results in good works in chapter 10 in verse 10. I love this. And I close with this. For we are his workmanship. That word there, workmanship, is a Greek word, poimea. And we get our word, poem from it. We are his poem. I like that. We are his, we are his masterpiece. He's put us together. How did he put us together? In Christ Jesus. And the result of that new creation, that new life, is that now I can become all God intended me to be. good works do they have a part in our life you bet your life they have a part in life christian yeah we're to be good do gooders yeah we are it's a result of the work he's done in our life he's made me alive so i can but to think that good works and trying really hard is the thing that qualifies me before God is absolutely wrong as a result. What can I say just in closing? What a glory this is. This is not a religion. It's not a ritual. In fact, when I see the glory of this, what God has done for us, when I think of it in terms of even using the word religion and ritual, it almost just looks cheap. This is a miracle of God's grace. We call it salvation that takes people who are dead and makes them alive and i think of the words in hebrews chapter two where the writer says how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation closing i think of a story very posh and uppity kind of social gathering where there was an actor coming and they began to talk and he began to kind of show off a little bit talking about how he could do these little things and he began to do recitals kind of from macbeth and hamlet and his and his diction was so sharp and people were just spellbombed and a servant was walking by and he was lowly man and and didn't really have a lot of education and he was listening and got a little carried away with the whole thing and probably shouldn't have even been listening but he was just enthralled with the majesty of this and he said what would you do psalm 23 and the actor in an effort to kind of kind of embarrassed him said oh yeah i'll do it if you do it and the man was kind of taken back and shocked and said okay i'll do it and he didn't really know what he said and the actor went in and did psalm 23 and he did it so beautifully and majestically and addiction was beautiful and it was great power and when he was done the whole place just broke into applause and then they looked at this poor lowly servant and he got up and he began to do the 23rd psalm and by the time it was done the people were in tears and this actor went over and put his arm around the servant and says you know something friend I know the psalm but you know the shepherd you know the shepherd do you from death to life resurrection salvation let's pray Lord I'm frustrated because words don't work you can't talk anybody into seeing this I call upon your spirit to work and to rule those to yourself who don't know you who are still walking around according to the course of this world victims of the spirit of the age because they're death walking and they don't even know it Amen Thank you.
