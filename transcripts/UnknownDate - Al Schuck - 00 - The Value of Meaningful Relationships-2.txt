Good morning. For those of you that don't know, my name is Al Shuck. I am the adult life pastor here at Church of the Open Door. And during the summer, our senior pastor takes a much-needed break, and I get a chance for a few weeks here anyway to share the word with you that God gives to me. One of the things that if you're around here you know is I kind of milk this thing for all it's worth about a picture of my daughter. And what I notice is that some of my daughter's friends, they kind of think that the playing field's not really even. It's not really fair because, you know, I can do it and they can't. You know, they're like, we can't show pictures of our kids. And since we're talking about relationships right now, I thought this weekend I decided to show some pictures of my daughter's friends instead of, you know, just my daughter. So let's go ahead and do that. This is my daughter with her friend Josie. This is my daughter with her friend Judd. This is my daughter with her friend Annalise. This is my daughter with her friends Devin and Jessa. And Devin found a minnow and he's shown it to them. This is my daughter with her friend Megan. And this is my daughter with her friend Katie. Now, you're thinking this isn't fair. And I'm all about fairness, okay? You're thinking, yeah, you got your kids' friends up there, but what about my kid or what about my loved one? How can I ever do something like this? And we're working on a way, and once we know how much we're going to charge, then you too could have your kid's picture up there, maybe. Or your loved one, your friend. We joke and we laugh. Let's pray. Let's take it to God. Here we go. Jesus, it's fun just to be together and know that we are your body, and we're called to be a family and to love one another. And Lord, even in those pictures, it just does stir in me the sense that even from a time of being a little child, we long for relationship. We long to have others we can laugh with and we can share with and we can be with. And so God, what you're doing in people's lives, I don't know, but I pray that this morning you would take what you've given me to share and you'd make it real specific. and you would do what you were wanting to do in people's lives. So I trust you with that, Holy Spirit. I want to get out of the way and let you do that. In your name, amen. Over the last two weeks, we have been talking about relationships. We started out by seeing that way before anything else ever existed, there was in the Trinity relationship between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. A relationship of selfless love and mutual submission. One that contained everything that is good and everything that is right and everything that is meaningful. Last week we looked at how we as humans, because we're made in the image of God, we too are intended to be in relationship. We are wired for relationship, both with God and with other people. And right from the start we learned this is not a small thing with God. He saw that Adam was alone and he said it is not good for man to be alone. We need to notice that God said this prior to sin entering the picture. This wasn't one of those cases of, well, everything was going along just fine, nothing needed to change, nothing needed to be improved, and then sin came along, messed it up, and so now God has to create somebody, another person. This was before that. Before that ever happened, God said it's not good. Adam was made for meaningful relationship, and for him to live an isolated life, to be alone, would not have been a good thing. And the same is true of you and of me. We were made to enjoy relationship with God and with others. We were made to enjoy relationship that looks, feels, and tastes like that of the Trinity. Where God is the center. And together we experience love and joy and peace and everything that is right and good. That's what we're intended to do. God would say the same thing to you and the same thing to me that he said to Adam. It's not good for you to be alone. But it seems so far away from what most of us experience in relationships. We talked last week about how there's an irony in this, that on the one hand, we are created, and it's absolutely essential for us to be in meaningful relationships with each other, and yet the irony is, on the other hand, there's probably nothing more difficult that we have to do in life than work through relationships and be in relationships. It's a tough thing. We talked about how in relationships with others, that's where we experience tremendous joy and tremendous pain. Relationships is where we experience A relief that comes with truly being understood And also the pain of being misunderstood We talked about in relationships We experience loyalty And we experience betrayal In relationships we experience acceptance and rejection It's where we feel valued And it's where we feel insignificant Relationships sometimes seem to fill us up And other times seem to drain us dry this is really the challenge that's before us how do we enter into something that can be so hard and so difficult and yet so essential how do we do that it's a complicated thing there are no easy answers using the story of adam and eve in genesis 1 through 3 we began to see why relationships are so difficult so hard for us first was a simple observation you may recall that people are difficult. I had you turn to the person next to you and say, you are difficult. And it was a great therapeutic moment right here for all of us. While some people, granted, seem to be easier to live with than others and get along with than others, and other people seem to be more difficult, given enough time in close relationship with any one of us, you will notice and you will find out that every single one of us is flawed. Take me, for instance, personally. If you and I were to be in relationship, I think there'd be a lot of things that you'd like. But somewhere along the way, you may happen to get in a car with me. And if I'm the driver, you quickly realize one of my flaws. I drive way too fast. Pray for me, please. I'm going to take this opportunity to apologize for those of you that are like, wasn't that the pastor that just cut us off? Didn't we see him speak once it opened? But you know what? It goes much deeper than those flaws. Much deeper than those flaws. Adam and Eve got their hands on some bad fruit, didn't they? And sin entered the world. Sin came into the story. And from sin comes shame. And in our shame, we act in ways that make relationships very difficult. First thing we saw was that as soon as Adam and Eve sinned and shame came into their life, they hid. They hid from God and from each other. And it's really easy for us to do the same thing. I don't want you to know the parts of me that I'm ashamed of. So I hide. We also saw for the first time in human history, fear existed. Fear never existed before that. Can you imagine a world without fear? There was no fear. But fear makes relationships incredibly difficult. Fear of rejection, fear of disappointment, fear of being hurt. For some of us, to enter into meaningful relationships means we're going to have to come face to face with our deepest fears. we talked about how in our shame just like adam and eve we're prone to lie deceive and try to talk our way out of things and just like adam and eve we're really good at blaming others genesis 3 remember god gives adam god wonderful thing god gives adam the chance to come clean by asking him have you eaten from the tree that i commanded you not to eat from look what adam says the woman you put here with me she gave me some of the fruit from the tree and I ate it. It isn't my fault, God. It's this woman here in the garden with me. She gave me the fruit. And come to think about it, who was it exactly that had the idea to put this woman in this garden with me anyway? It was your idea. Clearly, I have nothing to do with this. I'm not at fault. You know, I think we have something here that probably nobody in this room can relate to at all. But I think we have the first instance of something going really, really wrong and a husband blaming his wife for it. Do you wonder? I just was wondering this week. Do you wonder sometimes what the conversation was like after God left? I think some of us know what that conversation was like. It's not just Adam. Look at verse 13. Then the Lord said to the woman, what is it that you have done? The woman said, the serpent deceived me and I ate it. So she blames the serpent. You know, we could make fun of Adam and Eve if it wasn't like looking in the mirror so much. As we continue this week, I want us to start by digging deeper into the text, just a little bit more, to see one more reason why relationships are very difficult. And this is a big one. And then after we do that, I want to get really practical with you and share some basic truths around developing meaningful relationships. So that's the plan this week. We're going to first dig into the text, and then we're going to do some basic truths about relationships. Let's start. Let's go to the text. Genesis 3, verse 16, if you have your Bibles. Genesis 3, 16. Here God is describing the consequences of sin. Okay, you may recall that part of the consequences of sin is that he said to Adam, that as a man, as you work, you're going to sweat. He said to Eve, as a woman, you're going to have tremendous pain in giving birth to children. Personally, I think the guy's got the better end of the deal out of that one, but that's the case. And then we pick it up. At the end of that, it says this. Here's what he's saying to Eve. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you. And we need to remember that this is a description of the consequence of sin. This is not a model for how to have a healthy marriage At first glance, when I read Your desire will be for your husband I'm thinking a different kind of desire I'm thinking, honey, read this verse Your desire is to be for me And you know what? There's another little part about me ruling over you Here's the deal That's not what that verse means Over the years, some really whacked out people Have used that verse And they've used it for that exact thing but we have to look and understand what the word desire really means. Most scholars agree that the key to understanding that verse and that word desire means that we'd have to look at Genesis chapter 4 verse 7, the next chapter. In Genesis 4, 7, it's God warns Cain, okay, Cain, about the anger he has toward his brother Abel. Notice at the end of verse 7, here's what it says. Sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must master it. Literally, you must rule over it. The words of these two verses are virtually the same in the Hebrew language. But even in the English, you can see how amazingly similar they are. In 3.16, God says to the woman, Your desire will be for your husband, but he will rule over you. In 4.7, God says to Cain, Sin's desire is for you, but you shall rule over it. Okay, so when God says to Cain, sin's desire is to rule over you, what does the word desire mean there? Think about it. The word desire there means sin wants to defeat him. Sin wants to crush him. Sin wants to overpower him. So with that in mind, go back and read verse 16, chapter 3. Your desire shall be for your husband. You will want to defeat him. you will want to have power over him and likewise his desire will be to have power over you again as I mentioned last week while this teaching applies to marriage it's much bigger than marriage this isn't about just a marriage relationship this is about human being relationships this is my problem this is your problem we come into relationships and we desire to be in charge we desire to have our way We desire to be the ones that have the power. We're the ones that want to call the shots. A while back, Pastor Dave talked about the difference between power over and power under. That's what this is right here. That's what this is talking about. We are prone to want to have power over people instead of taking the little power we have and coming under and submitting and supporting and lifting up others. you may recall that back in chapter 2 after god created eve adam said this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh this is adam saying wow bone of my bone flesh of my flesh we've come a long ways in just a few short verses from bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh which It's all about equality and submission and unity. My desire will be to rule over you. Just that quick. I like the way Dallas Willard says things sometimes. He says that we're all on a journey either of self-worship or self-denial. Either of having to be the one on top, calling the shots because I know what's best. or which is self-worship or self-denial of going, you know what, I don't have to care so much about me and my needs and my wants. I can come under and lift. Now I want you to combine this desire to be the center, this desire to be on top, this desire for power. Combine that with all that we looked at last week that we're prone to hide with our fear. We have fear in relationships. We get hurt in relationships. our unwillingness to take responsibility for our own failures, the habit we have of blaming others. Put all of that together and you start to understand just how difficult relationships are, how seemingly sometimes impossible relationships are. My guess is that as I've been talking about relationships last week and this week and how difficult relationships are, maybe you've had some pictures in your mind. Maybe you've been thinking about some relationships. Either your marriage or with your parents or your children or coworkers or neighbors. Maybe some of you have been thinking about how difficult relationships are here at church. In this building with these people. I don't know what your picture has been. But whatever it's been, I want to share with you some stuff this morning. That I think is just really practical around relationships. And because I don't know your picture, I really do have to trust the Spirit of God here. That you would hear what you need to hear and that you'd be able to let go of what isn't yours. And that's been my prayer all week. Before I start, you need to know something. You need to know that much of what I'm going to share this morning, I got from you. Okay? I've been here 11 years. And during that time of being here 11 years, I've talked with a lot of people. I've been in a lot of conversations with lay people, with fellow staff members, with friends here, with all kinds of people. I've literally been in hundreds of conversations about friendships and relationships. We may have used different terms. We may have used words like friendship or community or groups or being connected, whatever you want to call it. In some way, shape, or form, it's about relationships. And much of what I'm about to share is, I've heard from you. So I'm putting the blame on you. I have heard it from you, but I've also experienced it in my own life. And I believe these are truths that are really important for us to say out loud and be on the same page about. So here we go. Here's the first one. Relationships are the place where God does some of his deepest work in us. As a church, one of our core values is the word belong. By that we mean a sense of connectedness, a sense of community, a place to belong. why is it that one of our core values is belong well basically it's because we believe that it's in relationship that you are going to experience what we call transformation that in relationship god does the work of transforming us into his the image of his son jesus christ which by the way reminder is the best possible way to live and it's in relationship that we believe that happens That's why it's so important to us. You see, just when I start to feel hopeless about relationships and I get frustrated about how hard they are, I'm reminded that as difficult as relationships can be, as hard as relationships can be, it's in those relationships that God does his work in me. When I look back on my life, I see that it is some of the most difficult times, some of the most painful times that God is doing his tender work in deep parts of me that I don't even realize. Now, don't get me wrong. I don't go looking for relational struggles, all right? Some people who are closest to me may question that. Sometimes it seems like I do. I don't. But I don't think you have to go looking for it. If you're in relationships and you're putting yourself out there and you're coming out of hiding, you're going to run into things. There's going to be difficulties. You see, in relationships, I experience differences with others. And it's in those differences, when I experience those differences, that I realize just how incredibly petty I can be. Things that shouldn't matter for nothing, but all of a sudden it matters to me. Why? Wonder about that. I see how judgmental I can be. It's in relationships that I get a real clear picture of just how I like to be in control. it's where I realize how preoccupied I am with getting my way it's where I come face to face with my weaknesses and my sins and my failures it's in relationships but it's also in relationships that I get a chance to see myself change and grow and become different it's in relationships that I see that I'm not quite as petty as I used to be I am becoming a different kind of person I do love a little bit better I realize that that time I used to care about my way and I actually did put them first and I just noticed that I didn't judge I didn't rush to judgment that time he's changing me and the only way I can find that stuff out is in a relationship it's also in relationships i experience and taste what we talked about what god wants as far as what he's intended for us support forgiveness acceptance contentment laughter encouragement and purpose you put all that together you put all that together and if you know what i'm talking about you realize that even though relationships are incredibly hard and difficult, painful, you feel so ripped off sometimes, even though it's that hard, if you get this, if you understand this, you realize that you wouldn't want it any other way. Because you have to have the difficult stuff too, if you're ever going to be transformed. It's in relationships that God does his deepest work in us. Second thing that I've heard from many of you, and I've learned myself, is this. Each of us are responsible for our relationships. You can't wait for someone else to make it happen for you. Never once has anyone told me the story of I was just standing out in the gathering place, someone came up to me and said, I don't think you have any meaningful relationships. Can I have one with you? I've never heard that story been told. You're responsible. I'm responsible. I'm not just talking about individuals. Understand, here's the deal. This is be real honest time. We understand that sometimes in a church this size, it is difficult to find those connections and to develop true community, a place to belong. As church leadership, there's probably nothing that we talk about more, maybe transformation, because that's our greatest passion. But we talk about this a lot. and you know there's probably over the years we've wrestled with it if you've been around here very long you know how much time and effort has gone into it you know that there have been really good people who've tried really good things and yet for some reason there seems to be this nagging sense that we need to do a better job with community well let me let me say a couple things about that that hopefully are just helpful to get us on the same page first of all you need to know this I don't know a church our size that doesn't wrestle with that. I don't know a church our size that if their person who's like in one of our pastoral positions here, if we brought them up here, that they wouldn't say the same thing. This is just a hard thing. That many people. It's so hard. We try stuff and we get frustrated. I just know because I talk to them. It's not easy. So it's not like our problem. It's the problem. It's relationships. on top of that there are expectations that people bring to a church not all bad but there are expectations and we need to know that because if those expectations aren't met it can be disappointing if you come from a church of 100 or 200 people and you expect that when you're in the hospital the senior pastor is going to come visit me you'll be disappointed it's a different deal there's too many people here. There's a lot of people here. And you'll be disappointed. And if your experience of community means that that has to happen, you're gonna feel like I can't find community here. So if you expect that you're gonna have a close personal relationship with me or another pastoral staff person here, we are very relational people, but it's really hard to have relationships with everybody. We just can't. It's just not possible. And so expectations can cause disappointment. Instead, you may get a visit from another pastor that you've never seen before. You may get a visit from a lay minister who we've identified as someone who can care really well. Here's the beauty of a huge church or a big church. Here's the beauty. We have so many people around here that are gifted in so many different things. I can name you a long list of lay ministers who could do a much better job visiting you in the hospital than a seminary trained guy like me that thinks he knows something. I just can't. That's how it works in the body of Christ. We all have different gifts, and you can bring your gift here. It's a different deal. So it's not easy. There's good and there's bad. There's sometimes that it's more difficult with a church our size. You might be in the hospital and we don't even know you. This happens to us. I oversee adult life, which is made up of adult care and adult connections. And in our adult care area, we realize people in our body are in the hospital and we don't even know them. And all of a sudden, we'll get a call that someone was in the hospital and it bothered them that nobody visited them. And we look into it and we go, we don't know anyone that knows them. And we didn't hear about it. And we feel really bad, but it's like, what can we do? We didn't even know. And so part of this being responsible for our relationships is we need to know you. We need to know who you are. We'd love to know who you are. Get to know somebody here. Take the initiative. Now, when I do this, I said there's a couple things you need to know. First thing is that we understand in a church our size it can be difficult. Here's the second thing. There are a bunch of people sitting here right now going, what is he talking about? What do you mean you can't get connected here? That's crazy. Because you know what? They've got a bunch of relationships here. A bunch of meaningful connections here. Like I said, I haven't heard anyone say, you know, the way it worked for me was someone came up to me and said, I want to be your friend because I know you don't have any. That's never happened here. Never heard that story. But let me tell you a story that I've heard over and over and over again, countless times. I was feeling unconnected. And then I realized that for me to be connected with others, I was going to have to take the initiative. I hear it all the time. I finally realized it was my responsibility, not someone else's. It wasn't my wife's responsibility. It wasn't my husband's responsibility. It wasn't my neighbor's responsibility to get to know me. It wasn't even the church's responsibility. I had to take responsibility. And when I did, I found connection. That story we've heard hundreds of times. we have to take responsibility next thing moving right along community is all about relationships therefore it cannot be programmed this one has come through loud and clear to us in the last four to six months about six months ago we sent we surveyed over 600 people in our body and got responses back and along with those responses came nearly 20 pages of comments it was extremely helpful for us as leadership confirming some things and helping us see some things that we were missing we had a follow up discussion for those who filled out the survey and over 120 people came to that this time was also really important and since then we've been meeting with smaller groups of people just trying to hear from people, trying to understand different things, not just about community, but about many different things. And just a couple of noticings from those experiences. First of all, you need to know, we are a blessed church. And if you are around me very long, you'll find out I'm not afraid to say the hard thing and I'm not going to say something if I don't mean it. So this isn't about kissing up to anybody. But we have some wonderful people here. people who have been through who have stuck with Open Door for years and you know what they care more about being loving than being right and they care more about being in relationship than having their own way and I don't know what we'd do without people who are willing to do life that way and we're a blessed church and I just think it would be really important for you to know that especially if you're new here. These people are not afraid to tell us their honest thoughts, share their honest thoughts, tell us what they think. And several of you have gone out of your way recently either to talk to me personally, send me an email, leave me a voicemail, or yank my arm off. Literally feels like, you gotta listen to me now. And one of the things we hear over and over again is in here, you're not thinking that somehow you can program community, are you? Like you're not gonna try to create a program to make community happen, are you? And you know, I always say no, we're not, but it's really good to be reminded because the temptation is there. The temptation is there. All you have to do is look at the countless numbers of videos and books and tapes and DVDs and manuals and conferences and workbooks and seminars, all telling you that if you do this program, if you try this program, you'll create community. It's interesting, though, that most of them say the same thing. Here's what they say. I might exaggerate just a little, but it's just like this. Does your church lack community? Have you tried all the other methods out there only to find that they fail? well this is your lucky day you hold in your hand the answer to all your community problems in eight simple weeks every person in your church will be plugged into a meaningful small group that answers all their questions satisfies their deepest longings and sets them on a course for a meaningful life I thought about how fun it would be to roll a wheelbarrow out here of all the stuff we've got around our building of DVDs and books and I thought, well, probably hurt my back or something. We've come to the realization that true community is about relationships. And as difficult as they are, you don't program that. You can't program and make community happen. Here's the next thing. Next thing, next truth that I've heard from you and I've come to believe myself about community. You need to let go of your expectations that others must meet your needs. While in relationships, sometimes God does use me to meet someone else's needs, and sometimes he uses other people to meet my needs, the truth is, is there are times when the only thing that can sustain me, the only thing that can get me through, the only thing that can fill me up is the real presence of God to me in my life. You see the greatest community won't satisfy the deepest longings of my heart I have some wonderful friends But it's like the old saying goes I don't have any perfect friends And neither do they I can't turn to my friends I still need them But they're not going to fill me up all the time And I sure can't expect it demand it, require it. This is hard. This is hard stuff. We all come loaded with expectations and agendas of what we know we need from relationships, of what we know that we need to feel good. It carries into the same thing around church stuff, and it's why you can't program it. It's part of the deal. All the curriculum and tools and books and DVDs And the world can't meet the uniqueness of the body of Christ. We're all unique. And if you've been a part of a program group, you've probably run into this. And I'm not saying they're bad. I'm just saying it makes it really difficult. One person is going to come to a group, and they just want to get to know some other people. And the next person that comes into the group, they want a Bible study. And as soon as you go, well, okay, they want a Bible study, the person who just wants to get to know some other people, they're going, I don't want to be here anymore. you know next person comes in they want a prayer group the next person comes in and they want to meet some people to go rollerblading with none of these things are wrong or bad they just make it hard to program Joseph Myers is an author who's probably thought about this as much as anyone and he looked at large churches across the United States and specifically he looked at those who put enormous amounts of time and energy into creating small groups for people. He concluded that even in those churches, the cream of the crop that put all the time and energy and resources into it, the best they can hope for is maybe 30% of the people to be involved. So does that mean they're bad and you don't do it? No. We have groups around here. We have different things. But we realize that a program isn't the answer to making community happen. We can't create that. We can't make it happen. I said community can't be programmed. Before that, I said that each of us are responsible to develop relationships. You put those two things together, and you figure out that as leadership, we realize we can't create community. We can't do it. And so a logical question is, well, exactly what can you do? What is your responsibility? And here's, it'd be important for you to know. As leaders, we think it is our responsibility to create opportunities for people to meet others and hopefully connect. Now that may sound somewhat similar, but let me tell you, there's a world of difference between trying to create community and creating opportunities for people to meet each other and hopefully connect. We can't create that. I think we can do this better. this is one of our focuses as leadership to create ways for people to meet others who they have the chance to connect with and go deeper in a relationship with and then to help those groups most of them will just be really informal personal groups, friends that you have friends that you meet here how can we be intentional about helping you go deeper in those relationships but when I say that Even saying that, it's like this catch thing because it could almost imply that right now there aren't any places for you to connect, which is totally untrue. And again, a bunch of you are sitting here going, I know all about this. You don't have to keep talking about this. But you know what? Some of you are sitting here going, I don't know what those places are. I don't know how to connect around here. And you can pick up a kingdom now, and there are all kinds of wonderful places in this body for you to connect. We have a men's ministry and a women's ministry, both of which have leadership that know and get relationships. Wonderful opportunities to be connected. Other types of groups and classes. It's like there's all kinds of different things. I was with yesterday morning. I just took a little bit of time, and I stopped over and said hi to a group of guys that were at Baker Square. It's what's called Hearts in Action. And once a month, they go out, and they go to a needy person's home. and they swing the hammer, and they might lay carpet, or they might fix a toilet, or they might. And I sat there, and I watched them at Baker Square just for a little bit, and I was just like, this is about connection. This is about coming together. It's about service, but there's something greater going on here, too, to find ways. It's our job to create some ways. We're looking at new things. But you know what? There's a bunch right now. Don't hold back. The point is, if you're looking to meet others and have a chance to connect here, there are many opportunities for you to do that. But it doesn't have to be here either. It could be in your neighborhood. It could be down your street. It could be serving somewhere else. I grew up thinking that you had your life over here, which was work and school, and then the church had a whole other life over here for you, of groups and classes and stuff you had to go to. And somewhere in there we forgot that the whole point of this was to enhance this. and instead it almost like kept you from living. We're like, we don't want that to be the way it is here. We have wonderful things, but they're supposed to serve the purpose of helping you grow deeper and connecting with others. Here's the deal. It's not easy. Over and over again we hear from people, I had to be patient. I had to keep trying. it wasn't easy I would try and it just didn't work for me and so I had to try somewhere else don't give up that's another thing that I've heard over and over again is tell them not to give up tell them not to give up it may not be what you want it to be it may not meet your expectation of what you need put it aside enter in, get to know others that's the challenge it's so easy it's so easy for me and so easy for you to check out of relationships it's easier to hide I think there's a fruit that comes from sticking to something I think when you go through the difficult the difficult stuff of man this is hard getting to know somebody this is hard work developing a relationship I think on the other end comes out a fruit and it's wonderful it's a beautiful thing but it takes time to grow last night after I spoke I had two parties to go to because I'm a party animal let me tell you and I went to the first one and it was a group of people most of which were if not all were open door people and it was to celebrate the birthday of somebody. And there was a bunch of people there celebrating this person. And we were just there because we all believe in this person and love this person. And I looked around the table and I went, you know what? Four, five, six years ago, none of these people knew each other. And they all met through some type of connection here at church, whether it was serving down in the youth, whether it was being on worship team, whether, I don't know, there was different connections that I could identify around the table. But they didn't know each other. And my guess is, for some of the people around the table, there's been many times where it was like, I don't even, do we even know if we, does this work? And they wanted to check out. And there was a fruit there. I went to the second party. And this was a going away party for someone who's moving, a couple that's moving. And I watched. I actually rang the doorbell as they were in the center of the living room getting ready to pray. They were gathered around laying hands on the couple. And I stepped into the circle, I stood there as they were praying. And I was overwhelmed with how beautiful it was to watch 12, 13 people, whatever it was, come around this couple and say, we love you, we miss you, we support you, we believe in you. You're a part of us and we're gonna miss you. And I watched and I went, three, four years ago, these people didn't know each other. But something happens when you take a risk and you enter in. It's a beautiful thing. It's fruit from the hard labor of relationships. Here's the last truth that I want to close with. I think it's the most important. Community happens when we follow the example of Jesus. Remember, we started this whole talk with Adam and Eve and the phrase, your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you. And it was a power over thing. But community happens when we follow the example of Jesus. Compare your desire will be to rule over them with the words of Philippians chapter two. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only at your own interest, but also to the interest of others. Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus, who being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness, and being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death, even death on a cross. what would it be to follow the example of Jesus to do that is going to mean a radical shift in how some of us do life and how we view other people it means putting people first and not just people that are logically should be first like family and friends, but it means each other here, even people we don't know, even people who have nothing to do with this place. I got convicted of this this week because what came to me was I realized how excited I get when I get to buy something. I get really excited when I get to go treat myself to something. I'm looking for a video camera right now, and I'm just jazzed. I'm going to spend money. and I get really excited about buying something. And what occurred to me was, what I felt the conviction came was, I don't remember a time when I've been so excited about buying a thing that I've gone to the cash register and I got excited at all about the person who was selling me the thing. Now, my guess is most of us don't think that way. It would be a radical shift to live like Jesus, that people would be more important than things. I was standing in Haiti one time with a group of kids singing under the stars, and I'm a sucker for stars. I love stars. And down there, there was no lights, and you could look up and see all these stars, thousands of them. And I remember thinking, and I just believe it was God giving me a gift, that as awesome as those stars are, they're nothing compared to these kids you're standing next to. You see, there's nothing like people. Nothing compares to people. People are the highest creation that God made. He just, he adores us. He loves us. He sees things in us that we don't see in each other. He notices everyone. This isn't a weighty thing to put on. This is asking the spirit of God to change your heart in how you see people. It means wondering about caring for people. You see, the ironic thing is in all those resources that I told you about for pastors so that they can create community, they all focus on groups of some sort, whether it's community groups or small groups or common interest groups, accountability groups. And again, I'm not saying those things are bad, but I notice a glaring absence in all of that stuff. There is a glaring absence in those materials about becoming a people who truly care about each other. The Apostle Paul makes it clear. It's not about creating community. It's about becoming a different kind of person. It doesn't seem strange. It seems strange. There'd be so much in Scripture about it, but we don't look at that as a way to create community. There's so much in Scripture about simply being present to each other, bearing one another's burdens, loving each other. And from doing that, it seems like in Scripture, that community just flows out of that. It isn't about a program, it's about a life. It's about relationships and who we're becoming. It seems so clear. Community happens when people love each other, when people care for each other, When people lay down their own agendas, when they care less about themselves and more about others. If you had to have a phrase, as I was in this going, what does the Bible say? How does the Bible say community happens? I think it's when the body starts to care for the body and notice each other and care for each other. And that's really the question for us today. What would it be like to notice? each other. Oh, but there's so many people here, I can't get to know everybody. No. But could you get to know a couple people more than you do? Just because they're valuable. Because they're important. What it means to move toward each other. But don't I have to know someone first? I mean, that's a great question. Don't I have to know someone before I can care for them? I mean, I'd have to know them first. No. You don't have to know someone to care for a little child down in kids ministry on Sunday morning, to really love and care, to care for a junior hire or a senior hire, to greet or usher and say, hi, welcome, glad you're here this morning. You don't have to know people to do that. You can just let the care come out of you. And you know what I know about all those different places around here to care is all of them work in teams. And time and time again, we hear that, you know what, that's my community. is I get to know people that way. As we close this morning, I want us just to go to God. So let's close our eyes, bow our heads, come present to the Holy Spirit, however you do that. Just come quiet to God for a moment. And I would ask that you would just simply invite the Holy Spirit to be very present to you. And then I would ask that you would ask him, of all the stuff that we've talked about over the last couple weeks, is there something that keeps you from relationships? Hiding, fear, busyness, ask him is there something that keeps you from relationships and then ask him if there's someone that you need to notice that you've been missing they may be very close to you but someone you've been overlooking, someone you could care about. And then if you feel like you had something in either one of those questions, ask him to give you a picture if there's something you're supposed to do. Is there something you're supposed to do? Holy Spirit of God, I would ask this morning that we would have ears to hear and encourage to obey. I would ask that the beauty of all the little things that happen here every week in people's lives, whether it's here because of open door and relationships with this body or whether it's in just ordinary everyday life, that we would long for the beautiful things of relationship. That you would fill us so that we don't have to turn to other people to fill us, but we'd have stuff spilling out of us to others. Give us eyes to see people the way you see them. Lord, I pray that we as a body would care for your body. And I just thank you for those of us who are on this journey together, that we get to learn together and do it together. In your name. amen last week at the end of the service we gave you a chance to come forward we're not doing a song or anything like that but know that the altar is open the cross is available go in peace and please notice someone on your way out thank you Thank you.
