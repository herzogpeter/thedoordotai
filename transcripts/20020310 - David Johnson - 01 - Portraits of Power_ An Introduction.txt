go this morning to the breaking of the Word. Father, my prayer is this, that as your Spirit has been at work among us, powerfully in the worship, that you would continue that manifestation of power in the working of the Word. I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. The Word we've been responding to, as most of you know, these last few months, actually. Born both of 1 John 5 and Joshua chapter 1 through 3 is that as we anticipate where we're going as a church, kind of physically embodied in our move to Maple Grove, that one of the things we need to be about as a church is to be preparing ourselves and consecrating ourselves in three vitally important arenas of life, money, sex, and power. And having dealt already with the issues of sexuality and money at great length, we begin today our examination of the issue of power, which like our sexuality and expressions of our finances, brings with it the potential for either great blessing or great cursing, for it can either be rightly ordered under God or disordered. And power, when disordered, as almost everyone in this room knows, brings with it great capacity to destroy. Examples of that abound. Historically, globally, symbols of disordered power are embodied in people like Hitler and Hussein and Milosevic. Just the speaking of their names stirs in our minds images of horror. It's all about power. It's all about disordered power. Closer to home, on a much smaller scale, disordered power could be manifested with your kid's soccer coach. Could be your boss. Could be your spouse, some bully at work. If you read the paper this afternoon and pay attention, I'm guessing that on pretty much every page, in fact, this would be a good assignment, to go and look and see if you can find an example on every page, a story of a politician or a parent a businessman or an athlete, maybe even a child, who not getting what they wanted in this arena or that arena resorted to a disordered use of personal power to force the issue. And that disordered use of power is why there are pictures in the paper today. According to Anthony Campalo in his book, The Power Delusion, almost every one of us play power games at one time or another. Quoting him, he says this, Husbands want power over their wives, and wives fight for the same over their husbands in different ways. Children struggle to free themselves from the control of their parents, while some parents tyrannize their kids. There are pastors who dominate and control their parishioners, and parishioners who give the same back just as strong. There are employers who enjoy bossing their employees, and there are employees who form unions so they can dictate the policies to their employers. There are nations that willingly threaten human existence by building war machines and weapons of mass destruction simply to become a world power. The word operative there is power. And there are world leaders who would willingly push the button for an all-out nuclear war if their power were ever threatened. Bottom line, according to Campalo, is this human being's hunger for power. It's a drive that many have. Now, just by way of kind of getting the ball rolling in this introductory talk and stirring the pot of our thinking, consider this, that if the primary manifestation of a disordered relationship with sexuality is lust, and that's why we spent some time in that series on lust, and if the primary manifestation of a disordered relationship with money is greed, and that's why we spent some time on greed and content and discontent, I want you to consider that the primary manifestation of a disordered relationship with power is control. Sometimes a desperate need to control my circumstances, my environment, my relationship. Sometimes a desperate need expressed in desperate ways to control my children, my spouse, my world by whatever means necessary. sometimes even to the point of violence, even murder. If I can't control you any other way, maybe I can force you to do what I want, thereby giving me again control I didn't mean to kill you. The truth is, when I look in the paper, every time I read in the paper of some man using his physical power to murder his wife or beat up his girlfriend, it all comes down in my mind to an issue of power and control. And they resorted to that to get it. Foster, in his book on money, sex, and power, Richard Foster, that is, says it this way. If money hits us in the pocketbook and sexuality hits us in the bedroom, then power hits us in our relationships. And so among the things we're going to have to talk about in this series and get to is how it is that we play power games and are relating to each other. Relationships. Power games in relationships. The most commonly cited reason for divorce, speaking of relationships, is irreconcilable differences. Roll that around in your mind a little bit. Irreconcilable differences. Sounds kind of civil, doesn't it? Strip away, however, the veneer of irreconcilable differences, and I'm betting that in most cases, you will find a relentless, sometimes vicious, vying for power and control in that relationship, manifesting itself in a variety of ways, sometimes manifesting verbally. Someone who would never hit another person, probably didn't have enough physical power to do much damage, can do incredible damage with their mouth. Emotionally, sexually, financially, violently vying for power. It's all about power. It's all about control. People verbally assault, emotionally wound, sexually manipulate, either by offering certain sexual things to get control, withholding sexual things to get control. Financially, you can threaten people for control. Physically, again, you can assault people to get control. It's about money. It's about power. It's about control. Abraham Lincoln, having considerable experience in the arena of disordered power, having seen the best and the worst that men could do in the context of war, his context, the civil war, said interestingly this, that nearly anyone can stand adversity. And that's an amazing thing for him to say because he saw people facing adversity. And his conclusion was pretty much anybody can do adversity. But if you really want to test a person's character, give them power. For power is as dangerous and unstable as dynamite, not only to those upon whom it is used, but to those who exercise it as well. But maybe the most famous definitive word on the dangerous capacity of power, a phrase that many of us are familiar with, came years ago from the British statesman, Lord Acton, who definitively said this, power corrupts. Flat out, that's what power does, according to him. And then he finishes the phrase, and this is the part we're familiar with, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. All of which, by the way, leads us to believe that power expressed in any way, power of any kind, is evil. That my response to power should always be, and in fact, the energy of this series of sermons should really be about learning to avoid power, mistrust power, dismantle power, relinquish power. If you grew up as I did in the late 60s and the early 70s, the evil of power was kind of our mantra. Power is evil. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Anyone with power in my growing up years was suspect, was to be mistrusted, fueled by things like the Watergate scandal. Pretty much anyone in a leadership position was to be dismantled. But there was a problem, you see, As we were trying to dismantle all this evil power, it took something to dismantle evil power. You know what it was? Power. It took power to dismantle evil power. And so we started giving power to the people, which was a really good idea. Riots in the streets. Which, by the way, makes my point. All forms of power are evil. To be mistrusted, dismantled, avoided, relinquished. But stop right there and start to think. For the truth is this, that while there is indeed a kind of power that demands ascendancy, there is a kind of power that demands total control, a kind of power that crushes, destroys, and wounds people. There is another kind of power at work in the world that does not destroy, it creates. In fact, if you were going to create anything, I promise you, among the things that you would need would be power. There is another kind of power, you see, that does not crush things. It lifts things. It does not wound things or people. It heals things and people. And the power of which I speak is a real, authentic kind of power. Indeed, it's a desirable kind of power, the kind I believe we should aspire to be hungry for. In fact, I desire, I've been praying, that one of the ultimate results of the series of sermons that we're in is there will be a healthy stirring up of authentic hunger for rightly ordered power among God's people in this church. You want us to be power hungry? Absolutely, absolutely for rightly ordered power. See, before we decide that all manifestations of power are evil to be avoided and dismantled, relinquished, Remember this, that it was God, by the word of his what? Power put the world, formed the world and put the stars in their place. You know what it took to put the stars in their place? Incredible power. Remember that it was Jesus who just prior to his ascension told his disciples to wait in Jerusalem for the promise of the Father. And the promise of the Father was the Holy Spirit. And then he said this, When the Holy Spirit comes upon you, you will receive power. Power to do what? You will receive power to live, power to love. You will receive power to serve, power to build. You will receive from the Holy Spirit power to lift those who have fallen, to lead those who have lost, to liberate those who are bound, to protect those who are vulnerable, to heal those who are wounded and sick, to destroy. you will receive power to destroy. Stop right there. Power to destroy is a good thing. See, there's the problem with power again. I want to tell you something. Rightly ordered power destroys things. What? Evil. I want to talk about in the course of this series, the power of God, rightly ordered under God, that destroys strongholds in people's lives. Here's the deal, beloved. While disordered power is frighteningly destructive, rightly ordered power touches on, calls for, and reveals some of the most profoundly noble instincts known to man. For rightly ordered power uses power to build, to serve, to restore, to protect, to create, to create. Take this out of the category for a moment as we're thinking of this, out of the spiritual arena, and just kind of stick it in the physical. Appreciate it there in this way. I do a little bit of traveling. I get on a plane. Just about every time I get on a plane, it causes me to wonder, how does this thing get off the ground? I know it always surprises us. It makes the news when a plane crashes, and it ought to make the news. People die. But it always surprises us when they crash. It surprises me when they get off the ground. I mean, you look at a plane, you almost can't let this in. Every time I fly, I think about it. This thing is huge. It's bigger than my house, and it's going to fly, and I'm going to get in it. What does it take to make that thing fly? I don't know. I think the word power comes to mind. And before the power of that plane is manifested, I go back to the beginning. You know, I do this with all sorts of things. I think of food. I think of exotic foods, and somebody found out that this berry was really good. I always wonder, who's the first guy who ate the berry, you know? Who was the guy who was, you know, puking all over? if you do it this way, it's okay. Who are these people who unleashed and figured out the power that aerodynamics have? That person had some power, some power in their mind. You know, God is a creator. God has incredible power to create, and he shares all his gifts with us. You ever think about that? He shares all his gifts with us. Some of you have incredible creative power. Incredible. How many of you know that the creative power God gave you to be an artist, to build things, to build a house is a gift from God. Maybe you don't give glory to God. Maybe you don't even know God. I'm here to tell you, the creative power is a good thing. And it's power. I go out to the building. I really do admire, and maybe you're like me, I admire people who are good at what I am no good at. One of my good friends is a mechanic. He can fix anything. He just can fix anything. I think actually the basis of our relationship is based on the fact that I break things and he fixes things. And so we found each other. I couldn't fix a thing. I bring it to him, and I am. I'm honestly amazed at the power he's got. He's harnessed his power. He's disciplined his power. He's put it into play, and it fixes things. It's amazing. I go out to the land where we're building our church, and when we first began to do this, honestly, I'd be all excited. You know, the big picture God stuff. We're going to have a home. I'm praising God. I'm praising God also for the incredible creative power that people, construction workers, you amaze me. There's a pile of dirt there. they start moving it around with tractors and bulldozers. How do they know where to put the mound? How do they know how to... And all of a sudden, something makes sense. There's order to this whole thing. That's power. It's creative power. Somebody harnessed that power. It's authentic power. Here's my point. The answer to abusive, disordered power is not an abdication of power. The answer to disordered power is not to avoid it, mistrust it, dismantle it, relinquish it. It's not to aw shucks it, oh it's just a little old me. Stop that as it relates to all forms of power. The answer to abusive disordered power is rightly ordered power under God. It is the kind of power that actively, not passively, but actively serves and builds, protects, creates, leads, organizes, heals, blesses, and in some cases, destroys evil. In the course of this series, I want to talk about something that at the beginning, It wouldn't have occurred to me that this would be part of a power series. But I want to talk about what it means to be a good steward of the capacities, the powers God has given us. I mean, I figured to talk about stewardship when it comes to money. I want us to use that same word stewardship and apply it to the capacities God has given to you and to me. Intellectually, emotionally, physically, spiritually, to build and create and help and heal. Drive north on Highway 94, past where we're building our building. Go toward Monticello. You look on the right-hand side of the road, if you're going north, and you will see this enormous nuclear power plant. The operative word there is power. In the early 1980s, a place called Chernobyl became known to all of us because the nuclear power plant mismanaged poorly designed blew up costing hundreds and thousands of people their lives incredible pain was wrought out of that because the power they were trying to leash was not stewarded rightly it was not rightly ordered managed well but you go to Monticello or other power plants nuclear power plants incredible power, incredible gift however, when managed rightly when stewarded well serves thousands of people. These are the pictures that want to have stirring in your mind relative to power. Rightly ordered, disordered. One of the questions we'll face about Jesus in the course of this series is not whether he had power. Did Jesus have power? Of course he had power. He had incredible power. He had power to heal the sick. He had power to raise the dead. He had power to confront evil. The issue of Jesus' power is not whether he had it or not, but how he used it. Just for a little snapshot, I'm calling this sermon actually Portraits of Power, an introduction. So here are these little snapshots. Picture of Jesus on the cross, hanging there in agony. We sing the song, he could have called 10,000 angels. Now what that means is he could have, hanging on the cross, used his power as God to get off the cross. Instead, he used his power as God to stay on the cross, to shed his blood, to taste death for every man, to descend to the lower parts, break the grip of hell, blow open the gates of hell, say bye-bye. We're free. It's not whether he had power, it's how he used his power. One of the things that got me thinking in this direction of not deciding that all power is bad was a quote, believe it or not, from Aristotle who said this, that every virtue consists of the mean between two extremes, excess and deficiency. Now, you think about that. Let me kind of explain that. For instance, the virtue of generosity, according to Aristotle, lies somewhere between waste, which means you're throwing your money away, excess, and stinginess, which is deficiency. Likewise, the virtue of rightly ordered power lies somewhere between excess, which would be abuse, and deficiency, which would be passivity or neglect, where you're just doing nothing. And when that definition occurred to me, and I began to think it through, one of the things that occurred to me is that the problem for many of us relative to this issue of power is that our solution to excess or abuse is deficiency or neglect. We become passive. Admittedly, a stereotypical example of that is illustrated with the person who may be growing up in an abusive family where their father or their mother used physical, verbal, emotional power on them in an excessive way, in an abusive way, decides that when they raise their kids, their answer to the abuse will be passivity. And they're frightened to death, incapable of exerting any kind of authority in their home whatsoever. And nobody can stand to be around their kids, including them. Their answer to abusive power was passivity. Both of them disordered. Another example of that in kind of a different arena is a person with great physical or intellectual capacities. Some of you have incredible power because of the mind God has given you to think in certain ways that normal people can't even think. You can conceive of things. You can build things. But some people, given physical capacities and intellectual capacities, never developed those capacities. They never disciplined those capacities. They never trained them. They never challenged those things in order to maybe use them to build and to help and to serve. Enormously gifted people their entire lives, they would be what we call underachievers. And they think it's okay. Might even call it humility. It's not, okay? And it's not humility. It's passivity. It's a disordered use of the power God gave you, the capacities God gave you to build and to serve and to create, to achieve. This is a person who never takes a stand, who never offers an opinion, who never speaks a truth, who never confronts a lie, and glory to God, they never abuse their power. You know why? They've abdicated their power. it's just as disordered as the excess of power stuff to think about stir up the pot in this whole arena it was interesting for me to be thinking of these things and as I did I thought of Moses who by all accounts eventually became a great and powerful leader, just think for a few minutes snapshot kinds of stuff, portrait kinds of stuff relative to the power of the incredible manifestation of power and authority that Moses had as he stood his ground on numerous occasions and confrontations with Pharaoh in his court. You talk about the home court advantage. Pharaoh had it. And Moses walked right in and stood his ground. As he coordinated the exodus of two million Israelites from Egypt, as the waters of the Red Sea parted when he extended his staff, as manna from heaven was provided, Moses had obviously discovered what I would call the sweet spots, what Aristotle calls the virtue between excess and deficiency. But what's interesting, if you think about Moses, the great powerful leader, is that it wasn't always that way. He hadn't always found the sweet spot. He found that sweet spot, that place where virtue relative to power is over time. There was some transformation that needed to take place in his life to discover that. Indeed, the scriptures record at least two occasions in Moses' life where God got angry with him. Now, we have many occasions where God kind of spoke to Moses in angry terms relative to the whole people of Israel. But there were two times when God came at him. And it's very interesting to note that both of them had to do with Moses' disordered response to the power, the responsibility God had given him to express some power. The first was when he abused his power. And I think you probably all have it in your mind right now. It's when he killed the Egyptian in Exodus 22. Moses was indeed called by God to lead his people. He knew that. The people even knew that. But when he kind of did his ministry leadership debut, he wielded power the way he learned to do power in Egypt. And the way he learned to do power in Egypt, Egypt, by the way, being a symbol of how the world does power, he did it that way. He forced it. Killing the Egyptian. The result of that is that Moses spent 40 years in the desert of Midian watching sheep. But what's interesting is the second time God got really angry at Moses was also in a disordered use of power, but this time it's not because Moses abused it, it's because he abdicated it or tried to. In Exodus chapter 3, you know the story, the burning bush. You see, like many of us, Moses having experienced firsthand, because he was kind of the abuser himself, having experienced firsthand the destructive capacity of abusive power, Instead of discovering virtue, he embraced deficiency. He embraced passivity, kind of, oh, just a little old me, and called it virtue. Exodus 3, God came to Moses and said, I'm going to use you in a powerful way to lead God's people out of bondage and into freedom. His first response, you know what it was, who am I that I should go? It's just a little old me. I'm a shepherd. I don't have anything of value or power. to give. And God said to him, in effect, this, it's not about who you are, it's about who I am. So you go in the power and authority of who I am, and I will be with you all the way. But I can't speak, he said. God said, then I'll be with your mouth. What if they don't believe me that I'm really sinned from you and that you're really with my mouth? I'll be with you, he said again. Finally, in Exodus chapter 4, Moses says to God, send someone else as they volley back and forth and then in Exodus 4.14 having heard Moses' final words send somebody else it says the anger of the Lord burned against Moses. Why? Because he abused his power? No. That happened before. This time the anger burned because he was trying to abdicate his power. He refused to embrace the responsibility of authentic power. some people do that in their homes refusing to take the place of a father or a mother and bring loving discipline upon their children they call it love it's disordered happily Moses like many of us grow up snap out of it he did and found what I'm referring to as the sweet spot of virtue, somewhere between excess, abuse, and deficiency, passivity, inhumility, and dependence on God. Stop right there. One of the things I want to do in the course of this study, and you can pray for me as we would see this kind of fleshed out among us, is that we would be able to discover together the virtues, the kingdom virtues that give us access to authentic power. I just named two of them. Did you hear them? They are what? Humility and dependence on God. In humility and dependence on God, Moses took his place as a leader, wielding authority, real, live authority and power, such that people, however, were not beaten up. They were set free, protected, they were led, they were fed, the power that came from Moses' hand was actually pretty heady stuff if you think about it. Demonstrations of power such that the waters of the Red Sea parted. I'd feel pretty good about that. I think I'd feel pretty frisky at the end of that day. In fact, I'm trying to work something out with Keith and maybe some of the tech guys that when we moved to Maple Grove, I don't know if you know this, but there's going to be a round circular drive and in the middle of the pond and I'm kind of, this is a behind the scenes thing, we're not telling anybody. that it's going to be dry. We're going to be dry. And the first day I'll walk out and they're going to give me a staff and I'm going to put it over there and it's going to fill up with water. And then I'll have to go back and read all this stuff again. Anyway, pretty heady stuff. People got hungry manna from heaven. People got thirsty water from a rock. Amazingly, however, in Numbers chapter 12, verse 3, with all of this incredible demonstration of power, the word on Moses was this, that he was the meekest of all men upon the earth. Meek. What do you think of meek? Remember when we studied this way back in the Beatitudes, it was well over 10 years ago that we did that, so most of you don't remember that. But my question about meek is, how on earth could a powerful leader be meek? I mean, if he really was meek, they must have hit him in a tent and somebody else was making all the hard decisions. Because meek people are weak people, timid and feeble. Nothing could be further from the truth relative to what meekness is or what Moses was. I will never forget the time we were going through the Beatitudes in Matthew chapter 5. And I did a word study on meek because I thought meek was weak. There was nothing about this beatitude that I would ever aspire to. Meek, you want to be meek? Yeah, he can do that. And then we found that the word meekness literally means power under control. We had a little hard time finding any other examples of it in scripture, but the classical Greek had usages of it. The most profound and telling was how in classical Greek, that word would often be used to describe a wild horse that had been tamed. It had become meek. Before it was tame, this horse had all sorts of power. But it was useless at best, destructive at worst, incredible power. You get into the corral with this horse and he would use his power to crush you, to kill you, to knock over the fence and run away. Incredible power, just useless power. We'd call that disordered power. But when that magnificent animal finally yielded to the bridle and the bits, Finally submitted to the promptings of the master rider. This magnificent animal became no less powerful. Did not by meekness turn into a spineless pile of mush. It suddenly became an animal whose power was under control. Pouncing now at the bidding of the master. One of the things we're going to discover in this series. Another little snapshot as we put together this portrait this morning. that Jesus was meek. When I think of Jesus as meek, I picture him in a meadow with some children, being very gentle, and that's a perfect picture of one aspect of meekness. As he stood before Pilate, he was silent. That looks like meekness as well. But the same Jesus who was silently meek and gently meek picked up a whip one day and drove the money changers out of the temple and they didn't quit calling him meek after that. See, the father said, counts now. See in Moses' case, get the picture, power out of control, before he was tamed as it were, meek, power out of control killed the Egyptian. Power under control stood toe to toe and face to face with Pharaoh in his court. And didn't shy away. See Moses found the sweet spot. Of virtue between excess. And deficiency. In this introduction talk. I'm just trying to give as many images as I can. For the stirring of your thinking. I want to kind of pull this together. By having you consider. Two kinds of power. Very quickly. There's first of all positional power. And then there's personal power. And you just kind of use this as a grid. To think about this the rest of the week. Positional power. I'll define it. the ability to act on the basis of one's station, one's office or title or platform in life. Now Moses had, I think, positional power by virtue of God appointing him to a kind of position of leadership in the life of God's people. In the corporate world, positional power is measured by things like title, educational degrees, the size or placement of your office, the number of employees under your control and whether you drive your own car or have a limo pick you up. Those are all symbols of positional power. And if you have positional power, you get to decide certain things by virtue of your position. Now, while positional power in and of itself is not an evil thing at all, it can be rightly ordered or disordered, the very nature of these trappings, however, reveal that positional power is first of all external, second of all, it is temporary. It comes and goes. There's an axiom in Washington, D.C. that says you can go from who's who to who's that overnight. Why? Because that's based on positional power. The procurement and then loss of positional power. When President Bush's term is up, he will no longer have free access to Air Force One. Why? He's lost his positional power. When corporate executives, corporate CEOs retire, they lose their corner office because they had all those things by virtue of their position. Now, lots of people have positional power who think they don't have any. Don't you think? It's not that hard to figure out. Coaches have positional power. Bosses have positional power. Teachers have it. Parents have positional power. Policemen and policewomen have positional power. See, if I'm getting pulled over by a policeman or woman, I don't know what kind of person they are. I mean, I don't keep driving and going, you know, I don't think they're a very good person, so I'm not pulling over. No, no, I see the light, I hear the siren. I pull my car over because they have power. They have positional power, and that power, guess what is legitimate? They might be a cruddy person. It doesn't matter. I'm listening to them. My boss, your boss, might be a cruddy person. It doesn't matter. They get to call some shots. The coach might be a wonderful guy, might be a cruddy guy. He's the coach. She's the coach. That's the way it is. Positional power, they have it. It's temporary. It's external, but it, to a degree, is very, very real. I don't get to leave the grocery store until I pay my bill, until the cash register lady goes, okay, you can leave now, Mr. Johnson. Until then, she's got power to keep me there. It's legitimate. It's necessary. Second kind of power, you already know where I'm going with this, is personal power. This kind of power has much more to do with the kind of person you actually are. And this is where we really have all sorts of high hopes, that people with positional power have personal power as well. When we talk about personal power, we're dealing with issues of character, integrity, and honesty. They aren't external, they're internal, and they aren't temporary, they are actually eternal. Personal power can be a thing that grows in you all your life until the day you die. You could have more character personally, more wealth and personal power on the day you die than at any other day. It's one of the exciting things about personal power. I think it's obvious that it's possible to have positional power without personal power. And I think we all know, maybe, someone or know of someone who has the position. And by virtue of the fact that they're the coach or the boss or the police man or woman or the parent, you do what they say. You know why? They're the boss. But if they don't have the necessary character to go along with that, they are probably the most irritating people that you know. Irritating at best, very destructive at worst. Why? Because people who have positional power without personal authority often use their position to wield disordered power. People who have positional power and personal power have what's called moral authority. They are the great leaders that you have ever known. They are the people for whom you would run through a wall. Because not only do they have, are they the boss, are they, you know, they have the position, but they have the corresponding character that calls you to virtuous, noble things. In light of that, I think it's fascinating, again, as I'm just stirring the pot here today to try to give some pictures. It's fascinating to note that in Jesus' earthly ministry, he had very little what? Think about it. What kind of power did he not have? Positional power. In fact, I don't think he had any positional power. But what did people continually notice about him? In fact, it was like they marveled because he would speak and the text would say over and over again. And the people would marvel at his what? authority. And then it always would be added this. Not like the Pharisees. Who had what? They had positional power. They didn't have personal power. And with these Pharisees, religious positional power, but not personal character to go with it, they became incredible abusers of their power. And we'll probably talk about that in the course of this series. Just to pull this together, let me give you some verbal pictures of positional and personal power for you to fiddle with. kind of in your mind, and you can add some of your own, just literal pictures in your mind. I want you to picture in your mind Mother Teresa right next to Bill Clinton. Right next to each other. It's an interesting picture. In fact, the reason I thought of this is because this is, the picture I have in my mind is coming from an actual event. It's a national prayer breakfast, February 5th, 1994. Mother Teresa was at this thing speaking with President Clinton right next to her, and she publicly scolded the president for a stand on abortion. I looked for a picture of this thing. I couldn't find one because I wanted to show it to you. I found the transcript of exactly what she said, but the picture would have shown this tiny little woman about this tall and Bill Clinton's about this tall. And she's kind of waving her little bowing finger at him and he's bending over like a, you know, little child, you know, and very respectful of her, was he. But what was interesting about this, that this little woman calling the president of the United States to task had absolutely no what? positional power? None. All sorts of what? Personal power. And he was just the opposite. He had all the positional power. But at the time in particular he had very little personal power. Let me close with one of the pictures, Jesus and Pilate. Jesus and Pilate is the picture there. Jesus, silence before him. Pilate had all the positional power, enough to execute Jesus. Jesus had no positional power, but his personal power made Pilate look weak. An episode in the life of the disciples is what I want to close with here. It further illustrates this point of positional and personal power, but also indicates one of the places I want to go and explore in the course of this series. This incident is found in Matthew 20. Just set it up very briefly. It won't take long with this. Jesus has just announced to the disciples that he is going to die in just a few days, that he is going to rise again and establish his kingdom. And as soon as he does that, in verse 20 of Matthew 20, the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons, bowing down and making a request of him. And he said to her, what do you want? And she said, command that in your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit on your right and on your left. What's she asking for? Positional, personal power. What's she asking for? Positional power. Give my sons positional power in your right and left, that they can sit with you. Jesus' response was a teaching on power when he says this Jesus calls them to himself and says you know that the jewelers of the Gentiles lord it over them and their great main men exercise authority over them it is not to be so among you in the kingdom that I'm bringing but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave and then he said these most amazing words this God of power who by the word of his power spoke the world into existence and put the stars in their place said that God did not come to be served did not come to spend his power to make people serve him but the God of power came to serve and to use his power to give his life away and I have just tapped into one of the things that access authentic power Jesus' answer to these guys was you want positional authority I'm not giving you positional authority in the kingdom of God until you figure out first personal authority and here's where personal authority comes from not in being served but in serving not in being the greatest but in being the least and then he used all the power that belonged to him as God by winning by crushing no by serving and giving and what he gave was everything he had to purchase everyone he could. Two weeks ago, before our Sunday service, it was our consecration service, I was in prayer early in the morning and doing something I do quite often. I was just going through the Lord's Prayer and praying the Our Father. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. And for reasons that I don't fully understand, this doesn't always happen to me, But I just began to weep when I came to that part in the prayer, just quietly by myself. I just began to weep, Thy kingdom come. And I just sat on that for a while and let myself feel what I was feeling. And after a few moments, I got this picture. And again, I'm sure this was to some degree. That was our consecration week, and it was all about preparation and consecration. And I'm very aware of where we're going and what God may be doing in those days to come. And the picture I had in my mind was of that Maple Grove building. And for whatever reason, I don't get it, it was full of light. It was full of light. And with that picture coming right after your kingdom come, what occurred to me was that it was a picture of that building, our church, with the active life of the kingdom, the power of the kingdom in that church. Well, in light of this sermon, I'm kind of sharing this morning by way of introduction. My question would be, how do we access that power? How do we get that power to be released in our church and in our community? Well, one way would be to go to Maple Grove and announce, we're the power church, here we are, we're the power church, we're going to do power. The other way would be to go without saying anything. And to go there because this is who we are because of personal power, we would go to Maple Grove with this primary agenda. We're the serving people. We're here to serve this community, and we're here to love this community, and we're here with a vision that one day, Maybe people who never even come to our church will look at that church and go, boy, I'm glad they're here because they have lifted us and they have helped us and they have served us. And they didn't come here wondering who was going to serve them. They came here wondering how they could serve us. Thy kingdom come. There is an authentic kind of power that the people of God need to embrace and walk in. It is the way of servanthood. It is the way of humility. It is the way of dependency. It is the way of the cross. It is the way I want to discover over the next several weeks. Pray together that in this journey, we would hear from God what we need to know about rightly ordered power. Let's stand and be dismissed in prayer. Father, first of all, I want to pray and acknowledge that some of us in the course of this are going to need to repent of excessive abusive uses of power when we just had to have our way and maybe even go back and do some work. And we're just going to bless that. Some fathers are going to, in order to deal with this well and walk through it completely, are going to have to go a little deeper in terms of recognizing their need for healing. Because people have used on them disordered power in such a way that they're incapable of seeing rightly ordered power as being authentic. Father, I pray ultimately that where we would be moving with this would be the full-blown expression of rightly ordered power among us because rightly ordered power uses power to heal and lift and build and create and redeem and do the works of the kingdom of God for the betterment of everyone who gets in the way. From this word of power, bring life and healing and building and create things that we do not yet even know exist. I pray these things in Jesus' name. And all God's people said, Amen. Amen.
