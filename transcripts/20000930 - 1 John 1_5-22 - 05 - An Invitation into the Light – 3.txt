Open your Bibles with me, would you, to 1 John 1, verse 5. This is our third week in this section. We're growing familiar with it, I think. I've been referring to this section as an invitation into the light. And it begins with these words in verse 5. And this time as I read it, what I'll do is kind of give to you the explanation that we've been kind of discovering, interpreting it as I go, so you kind of get the feel for it and we can move right into application. This is the message, says John. We have heard from him and announced to you that God is light. And in him there is no darkness at all, meaning no illusion, trickery, pretense. There is no shifting shadow with God. There is no hiding with God. He just doesn't play that game. If we say, therefore, we have fellowship with him, fellowship is the word partnership, participation with. So if we say we are partnering with God in the living of our everyday lives, and yet we walk in darkness. And walking in darkness, we've come to understand, means to hide, to conceal, to cover up the reality of our life, then we lie. And what we're lying about is this, that we really are partnering with God if our whole manner of life is to cover and hide. Why is that? Because God is light. And what light does is reveal. And if our whole manner of life is to hide and conceal, we are obviously working at cross purposes with God in our life. So don't tell me, says John, you're partnering with God because you're not. But if we walk in the light, open-faced with God, is our posture of life, allowing Him access to the realities of our hearts. As He Himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of His Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. But if we confess our sin, if we agree with God about what He is shining His light on in our lives, He will forgive our sin and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Let's pray as we move into this. Father, I pray again that by the power of Your Spirit, You would shine a light on what needs to be revealed in us and to us. And Father, that we would respond by bringing into the light we're hiding in the dark so we can experience your grace and your life. I pray it in your name. Amen. The thought that we can actually deceive ourselves is a strange one, if you think about it. If, for example, I suspected that you were trying to deceive me, I would be guarded around you, avoid you altogether if I could. I would consider you an enemy. But self-deception carries with it no such protection because we do it to ourselves. And when we do, we are at once the perpetrator and the victim of the deception. It's a strange thing. Cornelius Plantinga, in the book I made reference to last week entitled, Not the Way It's Supposed to Be, says all of that this way. Self-deception is a shadowy phenomenon by which we pull the wool over some part of our own psyche. We put a move on ourselves. We deny, suppress, or minimize what we know to be true. We assert, adorn, and elevate what we know to be false. We prettify ugly realities and sell ourselves then the prettified version. We know the truth, and yet we don't know the truth because we persuade ourselves of its opposite. First, we deceive ourselves, and then we convince ourselves that we're not deceiving ourselves. We actually forget that certain things are wrong and that we've done them. Don't believe it, says Plantinga. Why then do alcoholics and drug abusers typically go through years of denial? Why is the revelation of incest an astonishment to people who are living right in the middle of it? How did reigning Nazis convince themselves that their killing program served the best interest even of their victims? Why do battering husbands offer minimizing and euphemistic accounts of the beatings that they administer? And why do battered wives sometimes accept and repeat those accounts? Here's why. Because we have learned to live in the dark. Since Adam and Eve in Genesis 3, we have been hiding, covering, and concealing our sin. And that is why I have decided to spend another week on this, the third consecutive week. I'm extending an invitation to you to come out of hiding and begin, maybe for some of you, for the very first time, to walk in the light of what is real and true about life and about you. A prospect that is admittedly quite frightening for some of you, because if you've been living in the dark for a long period of time, the light at first invariably will hurt your eyes. feature, someone coming out of a cave, been in the dark a long time. They want to get into the light, but that thing, you're like this for a while. Paul did not welcome the light on the road to Damascus. It blinded him at first, and some of us need to experience that. It's the transition sometimes from darkness into light, recognizing that that is a real thing and that fear around this is a very normal thing. I've attached to this invitation some promises, making it more enticing, trying to help you see what you're coming to if you come to light. Bold promises like this, that if you have the courage and faith to come out of hiding, press through the initial pain of letting the light hit your eyes, you begin to live in the light of what God says is real and true about life and about you, then I promise you, you will begin to experience levels of kingdom life and joy that you may have never known before. Jesus said it this way in Matthew 4, the kingdom of heaven is within your reach. And what I am saying to you this morning is this, that this is one of the ways you can reach out and access the kingdom that Jesus says is indeed within our reach. Like any invitation, be it to a wedding or a party or this one, an invitation into the light, I would want to extend my invitation to you in such a way that you would know what you're getting into if you come to the party. I would also want to extend it in such a way that you would know what you're missing if you decide to stay at home. So I promise you that if you begin to come out of hiding, walk in the light of what is real and true, there are specific, significant, noticeable things that will happen to you if you respond to this invitation. The first is this. I gave it to you last week that you will find freedom. You'll feel clean. You'll experience grace and know forgiveness. The operative words there are find, feel, experience, and know. I am not talking simply about an intellectual understanding or a theological grasp of freedom, cleansing, grace, and forgiveness. I'm saying that if you pull out into the light, what you are hiding in the dark, you will find freedom, you will feel clean, you will experience grace, and you will know forgiveness. I got an amazing letter this last week from a woman in our church that powerfully illustrates this, and it was stimulated. The letter was in response to last week's sermon. She writes this, Dear Dave, you know how long we've been at Open Door for many years and very involved, but I was a hider for many years. Out of fear of abandonment, rejection, and what people would think of me, I kept a very big secret. I'd had an affair years ago and never told anyone. By the way, I have permission to read this letter. I've gone over this with her. I tried to act like everything was okay, but my relationship with my husband was slowly eroding. The separation in my spirit was creating a separation between my husband and me. Like you said in your sermon last week, I'm not sure anyone would have ever found out, but I could not live an abundant light-filled life with this darkness hidden in my soul. Often I would go to conferences or be in worship services at Open Door where I would feel a nudge in my spirit to let the light in and expel the darkness. But I'd actually talked myself into the fact that it was better for no one else to know so that no one else would get hurt. In the spring of 98, however, while attending a conference that focused on the restoration of intimacy in marriages, the nudge became a shove. With fear and trembling, I told my secrets. First to a trusted friend, then to my husband. I am not saying that there have been no consequences or that our process of healing has not been painful and long or that we're even done. But I feel clean. In a way that I have never experienced before, I know that I am forgiven and I am free. Living in the dark was for me a slow death, but now I am alive again. Since that April night, my spirit is no longer filled with fear. I got that letter from one woman. I know that many of you could have written a letter just like that, maybe with different circumstances. To that woman who wrote that letter and to others who've experienced that same kind of route of what it feels like to bring out into the dark light what you're hiding in the dark and even what it feels like to live in the dark for a very long period of time, what I say to that person, that kind of person is this, welcome, dear one, to the way the kingdom of God works. Jesus said the kingdom is touchable, it's accessible, but here's how you access it. If we confess our sin, here's how you access it. Agree with God about what is being brought into the light. If we bring into the light what we're hiding in the dark, we will find freedom. We will feel clean, experience grace, no forgiveness. You will experience kingdom life now. Not just this assurance you're going to heaven when you die. That's nice. That's more a byproduct, folks. We're inviting you into kingdom life now, to taste it now. Here's how. Second promise I made was this. If you begin to bring into the light what you're hiding in the dark, you're going to find some new friends. And the new friends are people who are desiring to live the same way, to come out of hiding and live in the reality of what is true and real about life and about them. See, God's great dream for the human race, God's great dream for His blessed church is not just that you by yourself. It's not just that me. It's that we begin to come out of hiding together. Not just one person, but we together come out of hiding and live authentically with each other before God. The promise I'm giving you is in verse 7. If indeed we do that, if we together, not just a few, but we as a body, walk in the light as he is in the light, we, here's the promise, we will have fellowship with one another. No longer based on phony smiles that mask what's really wrong, but coming out together, we will have intimacy and relationship and authentic kingdom community when this happens among us. Living your life, living our life this way, breaks us out of the self-imposed exile and isolation from authentic intimacy that hiding invariably brings with it. I made you promise that you're going to make some new friends. What I didn't touch on last week is something I need to just hit this week, and that is this. There is some danger here. For you to come out with what is real about what's going on inside brings with it danger. It's inherent because not all will receive it well. Blessed are those who mourn. They get the comfort. But some of you have mourned, and I'm not going to go through that whole thing, but mourning doesn't mean just be sad. Remember, that means getting out here, what's really going on in here. some of you when you mourned got out here what was really going on in here did not get comfort you got condemned and when you've done that you've probably made a promise to yourself and that's this I will never tell the truth again there is danger in here if you if you desire to walk in the light and you do that in front of someone else who's not doing that and they call themselves a Christian but they're not doing a kingdom life thing you could you could get burned I ran into my daughter this week. It's an interesting interchange. Have permission to tell this story too. I think it's important that you know that. I never do that. And don't read anybody's letter unless they know. I don't tell anybody's story unless they're okay with it. Ran into Erica this week, about Thursday at the health club. And I was doing my thing over there. And I didn't know she was there. And I saw her. And I don't see her very much. She's kind of living away from, kind of. She's living away from home and working and crazy lifestyle. So it was just delightful to see her. And first thing she told me was, she says, Dad, these sermons on the light are just killing me. And she began to tear up real quick, and I will sit here and talk about this for a bit. And she said, the only thing is that thing about making friends and coming out with what's real. She said, I've been burned doing that. And you didn't talk about that. I've been burned doing that. And I was all ready to kind of explain and do this thing. And then she went on. But she said, last Sunday, I was sitting over here, and as you're talking about the light, God put his light on something in me. And I just began to struggle, and I thought about how I'd been burned, and I'm not going to do that again. But he was kind of tenacious, and he wouldn't let the light go off. So I went and I told a friend, and she didn't condemn me. She just blessed me. And then I went and told my roommates, and they've been sending me flowers all week long. And I looked at her, and I said, you've tasted the kingdom. That experience is a taste of the kingdom. And sweet daughter, keep taking the risk. Are you going to get burned again? Probably. But you can taste the kingdom if you come out into the light. And you meet with another kingdom person. We will have fellowship. If we walk in the light, we will have fellowship. I'm not being naive about the danger. Don't be naive about the danger. In fact, I would arm you with caution. In fact, biblical caution. It says in John chapter 2, Jesus was ministering and many were believing. It was Passover. Many were believing. So they're all his friend, right? Right? Oh, they're believing. They're saying, yes, I like you, Jesus. Jesus, it says, however, verse 37, for his part did not entrust himself to them. He's a mean guy. No, because he knew them. You need to know it's okay to withhold from people that are not safe. That's very important teaching. I'm going to make you some promises. You bring into the light what you're hiding in the dark. You're going to experience some things at the kingdom. You're going to find some new friends. Third promise is this. I gave this one to you last week. I told you I'd unpack it. I will now. God will be gentle. There's a qualifier on this, and this is where I start to unpack. God's gentleness is going to be experienced by you when your life posture is to bring into the light what you're hiding in the dark. if you continue to hide and especially if you're a believer and you continue to hide the gentleness can get pretty he's not quite as gentle then the gentle caveat the caveat on the gentleness here is when you are walking in the light when you are saying god my posture is to be open with you and and to bring these things out well let me explain this a little bit with a kingdom principle that this whole light thing is speaking to in Matthew 10. Jesus says this, everything that is hidden will be revealed. And everything that is in the dark will be brought into the light and everything whispered in secret is going to be shouted from the rooftop. That is a kingdom fact. And it will be manifested most obviously on the other side, in final judgment. Everything will be revealed. And that final judgment is going to be most painful for people who have been what all their life? Who have been not believing the right thing. Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, that's going to be hard for people. No, people who have been hiding their whole life and keeping the lid on the thing the whole life. And that final day when everything is hidden, that's going to be a really frightening day. And I'm telling you, there are people who are believers. I think they're believers. They love Jesus. But they're your whole posture of life. It's been to cover and hide in that final day. Are you a believer? Are you going to go to heaven? Yeah, but I'm telling you, it will all be revealed, and God will wipe away every tear. But that experience, I am not convinced that experience, even for believers, you're going to have an incredible sense of loss. I could have lived this gloriously free way, and I was being invited into this freedom my whole redeemed life, and I chose to live like this. This invitation into the light right now today is an invitation to live right now the way we're going to live forever. Do you get that? And I'm just telling you, I don't even know how to describe this, but there's this inside thing that happens when we start saying yes to God. And God, I don't even know what it means. I'm not, it's that search meal, God, I know my heart posture. I don't know what you're going to reveal. And quite frankly, God, I don't know if you pray like this, but I do. God, I don't even know what I'm asking for. And quite frankly, I think there's going to be some pain here when your light shines on something. And I might even regret it when it happens. But right now when I'm thinking clear, go ahead and shine your light like that, you know. That's my best shot at describing this. I'm going to tell you something. With that posture, God will be gentle with you. And I am speaking here. I don't have a chapter and verse for you. I'm speaking out of my own experience with this. my knowing of this. When we walk that way, God is not generally going to shine His light on everything at once. If He did, I'm sure we would despair. Most often it's one thing at a time. He'll shine on this, He'll shine on that, and then He'll take you over there. And I'll tell you in my experience, every time He shines His light on something in me that needs to be revealed, part of the grace I experience, along with all the other things I experience, part of the grace I experience as I press through that is realizing that this thing he's shining his light on right now, oh my goodness, that is so ugly, that is so clearly sin, but that thing has been there for years. And then the grace of that is that he, oh boy, even with that there, he loved me. In fact, he even used me. And then he puts his light on something else. Isaiah, in the middle of his ministry, remember this? I mentioned it last week. He got a revelation. The light shined, I'm a man of unclean lips. he'd been in ministry for a very long time when God showed him that about his lips and then God just decided I'm going to bring you a little deeper though Isaiah we're going to go a little further God will be gentle I want you to notice however this not only is he gentle he is relentless and the way I would really say this whole point this promise is he will be gently relentless. Let me illustrate that this way. Tomorrow marks the beginning of the PCM conference, the Leanne Payne conference at North Heights Lutheran Church that we're kind of doing along with them and Woodland Hills, kind of all three churches are kind of sponsoring that. I mention it simply because four years ago when we sponsored that conference here at Open Door, God used that time in my life to shine a light on some things in me that I just was unable to see, at least in the light that he was putting them on this. I knew they were there, but he put his light on them in such a way that I saw them a different way, and that's often the way he does that. Some of what he revealed to me about me that was in me was very painful, quite frankly. Some of it was embarrassing, hard to tell people about it, even ask for prayer for because, oh, what would people think? Yeah, that kind of stuff. You know what I'm talking about if you've ever experienced it. But in that light that got put on me in that time, very privately, I experienced profound healing and freedoms that I have never known. It was like, I mean, there was this area of my life that I was handling a certain way and feeling like I was handling it, but I was never free in that area. And God put his light on it in such a way that brought me to a deeper level of repentance about that and an awareness about that that was incredibly free. But you know what else he did to me during that time? And by the way, in that whole thing, I was just delirious. I mean, it was like I was born again again in that area. It was like, I was just delirious. I was telling everybody about it. You know what else he did, though? That thing he shined a light on, and then I agreed with him about it, and I cooperated with God about it. What it did, however, was open the door to a whole series of other things. that God wanted to shine his light on. You know, I was really excited about the first one. I didn't know that if I said yes to that one and cooperating with God about that one, there was a whole bunch right behind it. If I'd have known that, I'd have said it. Forget it. Just stop right here. I'm living my life this way, fine, until now. But it did. There were many other things that kind of were somehow connected to that and there were some issues in my life I became aware of. And then I became aware I needed some help and I said I need to go to somebody and talk to somebody. I found a counselor that I trusted who I could go to and who didn't see me as Pastor Dave. I was just this guy who would talk to me straight and I brought my things and God shined his light on some more things and as best I knew how at the time I just kept cooperating with God. Oh, man. Then one day he said this thing. It was really interesting. He said, you know, we'd been doing this for a month or so And he said, you know, I want you to bring your wife in sometime. And I said, you know, that would be really good. Bonnie probably is hiding some things as well. You know, I'm sure that this will be very good for my poor, poor, poor wife who needs to be as, you know, enlightened as me. You're laughing because you know what happened, don't you? Yeah, yeah. She came and told the truth about her marriage. And God shied his light on some more things. just one little story about that I think one of the defining moments for me in that little process of bringing Bonnie in was the time that this counselor brought out a book this thick I shouldn't tell you this but I'm going to this thick, it was this thick I swear it was about sociopathic behaviors abnormal psychology and he said to Bonnie I want you to look up the word narcissist and I said what? And then she went from the word narcissist, and then he said, tell Dave how many of those apply to him. There were a few. And I got a picture of how unbelievably absorbed I am in myself and how much our marriage was about me and not about us. And I felt things like bile rise up in me to say, this isn't true. I deny this. And something in grace came, and I agreed, and I cooperated. And God brought healing. I hated that. I love that. And as I reflect, that's just one thing, folks. That's just one thing. I reflect in the ways God has shined His light on me, and then I've cooperated at the times I did. I haven't always, as you haven't either, but when I have, the picture I've gotten of God with me is gentle and tenacious, gentle and tenacious, gentle and tenacious. He shines His light, and He ain't turning it off. I can, but He won't. Tenacious, gentle, soon as I agree, there is grace, and there's healing, more than healing and grace. The word here is transformation. I don't want to sound like you. I have not arrived. I think you would never hear that from me. I've arrived, but I can tell you this, that there are things that were part of my character two years ago that are not part of my character now. There has been transformation. But here's the deal. There are parts of my character right now that I don't even know about that God is very interested in transforming you too. Here's the promise. God will be gentle. He'll be tenacious. Fourth promise. Got to get going here. By the way, that was just all last week's sermon. Yeah, I know you know. I know. Anyway. Fourth promise, if you begin to come out of hiding and live in the light of what is real and true, God will make you gentle, especially with other people who are coming out of the dark. You might actually be a little more tenacious with people who are trying to hide. Jesus was most impatient with the religious Pharisees who put out this little external religious show, but inside they were full of garbage. He was incredibly patient with prostitutes who were saying, I hate living like this. You're going to find a gentleness be transforming. You see, walking in the light of what is true about your own sin is an absolute cure for a self-righteous, judgmental, condemning spirit. It works humility and mercy. It really is an interesting thing to watch. I'm sure you've seen it as I describe it. You will identify it. People who are living open-faced with God about their own stuff, who are consistently inviting the light of His truth to shine on them, are usually not the ones who are busy and quick to shine the light on everybody else, to try to fix everybody else. People who are living in the light of their own stuff do speak the truth about sin. They do not avoid it. They are not naive, but they speak the truth in love. It works in you a transforming effect of gentleness and mercy. It's not because you're trying to be gentle because God would have me gentle. If you're walking in the light, gentleness will be formed in you. it's one of the results indeed I have come to believe that this is so true that one of the surest signs that someone is not walking in the light in other words they are not dealing honestly with their own stuff one of the surest signs that they're not is that they are constantly upset about everybody else's tracking everybody else down I mean I almost feel sorry for you because it's like you're wearing a sign I am not doing my own stuff when you're constantly out there One of the clearest ways, one of the most positively identifying ways that evidences that you are not looking in here is that you're always looking out there. The other flip side of that is one of the easiest ways to never have to look in here is just by looking out there. Just fix everybody else. Dallas Willard, when he was here, brought a wonderful teaching about this out of Matthew 7, where Jesus is confronting those who judge. Matthew 7, verse 1 says, Judge not, lest you be judged. To judge not does not mean that you abandon discernment. Some would think that in our culture. That's not true. Discernment, beloved, is vital. Discerning what sin really is is vital, but it need not be condemning. Willard gave this example of discernment without condemnation of going to a dentist, going to a doctor. I think this works pretty well. If the dentist tells you you have some decay and you need a filling, he's not condemning. He's discerning. And discernment about such things is vitally important. What kind of dentist would it be if he didn't see your cavity? And if he did see your cavity, he wouldn't tell you the truth about it. I just don't want to hurt your feelings. I don't know. I'm going to a different dentist. If, however, that dentist began to wonder aloud after he saw your cavity, what kind of disgusting human being, lets their teeth get this kind of decay. Got a whole new ball game now. He's condemning. He may be despising. Here's the deal. To discern is a vital function of kingdom community. We are going to deal with sin. We're going to call sin, sin. But to be able to do it without rejecting is critical. And to be able to do it without rejecting requires great care and skill. The million-dollar question is how? How do you do it with skill? Well, Jesus answers that in verses 3 through 5 of chapter 7. He first of all talks about not judging, and then he says this, verse 3, Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye and not notice the log in your own? How can you say to your brother, let me take the speck out of your eye? I'm going to be helpful. I'm going to do your stuff. I'm going to do your life. How can you take the speck, the sin out of their life when you have a log in your own? You hypocrite. He really doesn't like people who hide. First take the log out of your eye, and then you can clearly take the log, the speck out of the other's eye. Why can you do that? Because now you can what? See. It's a perception problem. You don't see the light of your own stuff because you have a log in your eye. Say it in the language that we're using of walking in light and dark. If you hope to take the speck out of your brother's eye, you've got to take the log out of your own because if you aren't dealing honestly with what's in your eye in your life, if you're not bringing into the light what you're hiding in the dark, you will never see clearly what's in theirs. You may think you see clear. You may wade right in and call it righteous indignation. You may have all sorts of energy to correct and confront everybody else, and you're convinced you're right. But more often than not, instead of removing the speck, which does need to be removed, you poke out their eye. Let me just give you some helper. You know, I said we need to pick safe people. Let me tell you how to identify safe people. Safe people are the people who are themselves bringing into the light what they are hiding in the dark. That's who's safe. The log in the analogy of Matthew 7 is a judgmental, self-righteous, condemning spirit, and the people who have that spirit are almost always people who have never at significant levels of their soul brought into the light what they are hiding in the dark. They are blind to their self-righteous pride. They are useless for ministry. Scary part, however, they're almost always in ministry. They are incapable of bringing authentic healing to other people. Indeed, they do great damage. If you know someone like this, you probably just run from them. I mean, there's even a fear that stirs up in you when you think of them coming because you know that you won't get help for the speck in your eye. You'll just get clubbed or run over, probably with something good, probably with something right. If you are someone like this, people probably just run from you. And now you know why. See, you always thought the reason people run from you and reject what you say is because they don't care about sin the way you care about sin. No, no, no. They hate the speck in their eye. It hurts. They're just tired of being clubbed by you. Do yourself first. Feature now a different scenario, a different person. Feature someone who's walking open-faced with God. Just imagine, I mean, maybe, I hope you know some people like this, but if you don't imagine them. Someone who knows what it feels like themselves to have a speck in their own eye and be blinded by it. And how do I get this out? I can't get it out myself. Maybe even someone who knows what it feels like to have a log in their own eye. Who remembers a time, who had a time where their biggest problem was that they just were so full of pride. And they just knew everybody else's problem. but it's someone who just maybe a few weeks ago began to pray a simple prayer the prayer was this lord help me bring into the light when i'm hiding in the dark help me see what i don't see help me confess what i deny lord shine the light of your truth on what's real about me and guess what you pray that prayer and god will begin to do it that's another promise i promise you and let's say in this person's life god began to do it he did it gently relentlessly, saying things like this to this imaginary person. You need to look at this. You need to confess that. You need to go to her and apologize. You need to go to him and tell the truth about what you kind of veiled there, this little management, truth management thing you did. You need to see the truth about this thing you ignore. And with each thing, the light revealed. There was first fear. Oh, boy, if I look at that, what will people think? What will they say? What will they do? And then you come to this point where I've been, I don't care anymore. I don't care anymore what anybody thinks. And as soon as you press through that awful place, there comes this rush of grace followed by healing, cleansing, and freedom. And as that person that I'm kind of describing to you continually agrees with God and cooperates with God about what His light is continually revealing, begins to have worked in him or her mercy, gentleness, humility. Now feature that person that I've just constructed for you coming toward you to remove a speck from your eye. Question, think they could do it? How would they do it? I think they'd do it gently. I think they do it skillfully. Picture the corner of a proverbial handkerchief, carefully lifting the speck, barely touching the eye, and it's gone. I promise you that if you begin to walk in the light, that if you begin to bring into the light where you've been hiding in the dark, that God will make you gentle, that you will walk in mercy, that you will minister grace, and that you will be the agent for the healing of many. fifth promise you'll become like a child now if that doesn't sound too attractive to you right off the bat let me say it this way you will discover the fountain of youth does that sound a little better okay remember a couple weeks ago this is what i'm driving at with this one i i was elaborating on how we've learned to live in the dark and how we learn to hide and how as little children we couldn't do that little kids little tiny ones can't even lie but they they learn to lie. But little ones, they are incapable. They haven't learned yet, as we adults have, to hide their soul behind half-truths and pretend smiles. Kids have this incredibly wonderful way of looking happy when they're happy and looking sad when they're sad. And they have this wonderful, delightful thing about them that they look like they're lying when they're lying. So you can catch them. And see there, you can give them some grace and you can bring them along and you can help them and that's a wonderful thing. But then they learn, don't they? Just like we learned, and we learned how to hide. When we were little, we couldn't hide our souls, but then we learned how to hide our souls from God, from each other, and from ourselves. When we were little, we were afraid of the dark, but then we learned to not be afraid of the dark, and we learned to live in the dark. And the call a couple weeks ago was that we would have stirred in us a reversal of that. And God, make us afraid of the dark again. Make us afraid of hiding. Make us afraid of that place where Satan can just leave that thing with us and that thing can grow in us. And Father, help us become open-faced with you. Here's the good news, the promise I have for you. God can restore for you this childlike innocence. It can be done. Before you blow that childlike thing off, because inviting people to childlikeness on one hand is positive, but there are some downsides of childlikeness that I've got to work through. I mean, children are vulnerable. You know, if I'm wide-eyed, you could hurt me. So who's going to protect me? I don't want to sound flippant. I don't have time to develop this. God's going to have to protect me. Do I trust God? Brings up a whole new thing, doesn't it? That's where my battle will be, though. is God good can I trust him with my soul can I trust him with my woundedness and all that's my fear but while you're fighting with that consider this in Matthew 18 Jesus said the most stunning thing to his disciples who were wondering who was going to be the greatest in the kingdom he says you guys unless you become unless you are converted and become again like children you won't enter the kingdom they say they're never going to heaven I don't think that's what he was saying. I think what he was saying is this. You guys, if you don't turn around and become like children, you will never enter into and experience the fullness of the kingdom that I have brought near. It's near. You can access it. You can experience kingdom life now. You don't have to wait for heaven. It's here now. Beloved, the kingdom of heaven is within your reach. I promise you, if you begin to bring into the light what you're hiding in the dark, God will restore to you a childlike innocence, a transparent soul, a wonder-filled awareness that the kingdom of God is something you can touch. It is within your reach. Fountain of youth, where'd you get that? 2 Corinthians 4.16 says, even though the outer man decays, you get older and older and you look more and more decrepit, to tell you the truth. The inner man is growing day by day. Picture that I would set before you by way of vision and give you a taste for is that as you get older and older, your spirit can get younger and younger as you walk in kingdom truth. I mean, it really puts inside me a dream for me. And I hope you have it too. And that is, you know, if God gives me 40 more years, I'll be probably not, let's say 30. I'll be 77. You know, when I'm 77, you know, maybe they'll let me preach once, you know, or twice a year. And I'll be up there. I don't know. Whatever. But you know, one of the delights, I think, would be is if you saw me get older and older and more and more, weak and old, decay as I watch you. What an incredible thing to watch if I got younger and younger inside. that's kingdom life that's what I want to walk in that's what I want to walk in and it's for you, I invite you into light final one, quick, gotta close if you respond to this invitation I've been extending not only will you experience those other things but you will become light yourself this is just like the little thing right on top this is kind of just as wow, the culmination of it all see, as you and I begin to bring into the light what we're hiding in the dark, the very light that comes to you will begin to flow through you, radiating from you light. And you will begin illuminating the places you go. You will begin illuminating your household and your workplace and your marriage and your church. But it won't be the way you thought it was supposed to be. It won't because you're going to work. I'm going to correct everyone here. I'm going to tell them everything I know. Be quiet for a while. Just be quiet for a while. And let the light come to you. And as the light, if the light authentically begins to come to you, and you begin to cooperate with what the light reveals, I promise you, you will become the light that you have invited in. And you will begin illuminating your marriage. And you will begin illuminating your workplace. Jesus said, you are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. If you have this light in you, it won't be able to be hidden. People will notice. They'll actually be drawn to you. You know why? Because there's so little light. There's a lot of religious people who are ready to correct you every 10 minutes. There is very little light. Paul in Philippians 7 said, I, in a crooked and perverse generation where evil people and imposters are growing from bad to worse, you appear as lights. You appear as hope. You appear as something real and true. Why? Because you are walking in what is real and true. You're walking in light. I promise you that if you have the courage and faith to come out of hiding and to begin to live in the light of what God says is real and true about life and about you, that you will begin to experience levels of kingdom life and joy that you may have never known. You will find freedom. You will feel clean. You will experience grace and no forgiveness. You will break through the self-imposed exile from intimacy that hiding brings with it, and you will become gentle. You will walk in mercy. You will become like a child, and you will radiate light, and you will eternally experience the relentless tenderness of Jesus. I invite you into the light. And if that is indeed an invitation that you would like to respond to, let me tell you how. The easiest way to respond to this invitation is by making an invitation of your own. It would sound maybe something like this. Lord, I invite you to shine the light of your truth, first of all, on me. I want to be free. I want to be clean. I want to feel forgiven. I don't want to be alone. I want to walk in the light. Lord, make me afraid of the dark. Make me like a child again. Help me step into the kingdom that is within my reach. Lord I am very grateful for your gentle tenacity in dealing with your people turning light on things that we would just as soon hide I pray Father that you would build into us the courage to willingly bring into the light what we're hiding in the dark I pray that you would move against the fear that all of us have of this kind of exposure and fill us with the overwhelming confidence in you that you are full of grace that we are so your children that you so have for us the very best I pray Father that we would more and more be people who are entering the realities of kingdom life now. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
