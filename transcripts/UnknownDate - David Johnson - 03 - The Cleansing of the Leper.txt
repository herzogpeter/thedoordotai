I feel sorry for them when I get going in a prayer because their arms get really tired. So, oh man. But it doesn't stop me. I do just keep going. So anyway. I'd like you to open your Bibles with me to Matthew's Gospel, the 8th chapter. Matthew's Gospel, the 8th chapter, beginning this morning in the first verse as we begin to examine what I said last week. We would start talking about this week, the healing miracles of Jesus. They start with these words in verse 1 of Matthew's Gospel, 8th chapter. When he, that is Jesus, had come down from the mount and great multitudes followed him. That's important to keep that picture in your mind as we see what happens next. In the middle of the crowd, a leper came. And behold, a leper came to him and bowed down to him, saying, Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean. And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, I am willing, be cleansed, that immediately his leprosy was cleansed. Now, the reason we're doing this, for those of you who maybe haven't been with us for the last few weeks, is because for several months now, actually, we have been on what we've been referring to as a journey with the Holy Spirit, dealing of late with the gifts of the Spirit as found in 1 Corinthians chapter 12. Two weeks ago, we began to examine the spiritual gift of healing and the operation of power as found in 1 Corinthians 12, 9 and 10. Now, to talk about the healing miracles of Jesus as kind of a spinoff from this gift of healing to give us more understanding, I chose Matthew 8 to begin our journey for a number of reasons. One is that it's a very interesting section of Scripture related to healing for, among other reasons, the sheer volume of healing miracles here. From chapter 8, verse 1 through the end of chapter 9, There are nine healing miracles in all. We won't necessarily hit all of them, and there will be other places we look. But this is where we're starting, partly because of the volume. The nine miracles in these two chapters fall into three categories, or three kinds of healing miracles. Three of them are physical, leprosy, paralysis, and fever. Three diseases that in that culture and in that time were usually considered fatal. So when he heals these three diseases, it's like healing cancer. It's like healing AIDS. those kinds of diseases that even in our day kind of come with what feels like a death sentence. Some of the healings that we'll see here are spiritual, even though they start with a physical thing. The real deal is an inner healing. It's about forgiveness. It's about deliverance from demonic oppression and even possession. And one of them that we will see speaks to victory over death, the resurrection of a little girl. All of them are found in the section of Scripture between chapter 8 and chapter 9, which I found curious. Why are they here? Why are these particular miracles here? There were nine. Are they random? I don't think so. At the end of John's gospel, the 20th chapter, the 30th verse, John indicates that many of the miracles that Jesus performed in the presence of the disciples were not written in the book, Which leads me to believe that the ones that were written in the book were chosen carefully, were chosen purposely, not randomly. Indeed, I believe they're here, at least in part, to communicate something, as I indicated last week in kind of introducing this, to communicate something about the character of Christ and the mission of Christ that goes beyond the miracle itself. Last week, I called them subplots. where you have the miracle itself, the healing on the surface of things, but a subplot or a message in the miracle that is at least as important as the miracle itself. Let me give you some examples of that. One of the messages that every one of these miracles we're going to look at over the next several weeks conveys is that God cares deeply about human need and human suffering. And while that's generally true, what we're going to see in these miracles is that he cares specifically, he moves specifically with a special affinity to the least and the lost, to those who are outside the camp. It is not by accident, beloved, that the first three healing miracles that we will see in chapter 8 include a leper, a Samaritan, and a woman. All three of them, in the time that Jesus lived, were marginalized kinds of people in this culture. Women in that day were not seen as having much more value than property. Samaritans were considered half-breeds, worse than Gentiles. And that story is going to be all about racism and people that we feel real free to despise or push out to the edge. And lepers in this culture were unclean. Not just physically unclean, but spiritually unclean. And in fact, it was thought by many, kind of the spirit of the day among truly spiritual people actually, was that the only way you could stay clean yourself was to stay as far away from unclean people like lepers as possible. Which is why one of my favorite parts of this particular story is found in verse 3 where it says that Jesus reached out his hand and what? Touched someone who no one else would touch. See these miracles among the many that Jesus did Weren't chosen by the gospel writer here Just to prove that Jesus could heal leprosy and paralysis and fever Though these miracles prove that Jesus could do those things Now these miracles I believe were chosen on purpose To communicate a message in the miracle That's at least as important Maybe more so than the miracle itself It's like the miracle, wonderful, glory to God, points to something else, deeper, more significant even than the miracle. Another example of the message we're going to find in almost every one of these miracles is that Jesus blesses faith wherever he finds it. We're going to just kind of see that as he's walking through the streets and he runs into people and it's almost like wherever faith is, it's almost like something just kind of comes out of him. It's instinctive. And he just blesses faith wherever he finds it. But the real kicker in every one of these stories as we go through this is we're going to find that not only does Jesus bless faith wherever he finds it, he finds it in the strangest places. In places where you wouldn't expect. Now, to answer this question, I think, you know, with a clean slate here, you'd have to get yourself out of church right now. But here's the question. Where do we expect to find faith? Where would you expect to find people with faith? As you think about the world we live in and the dirty, rotten stuff that's going on everywhere, where would you go to find people with faith? I would go to where? Church. I would go to the temple. I would go to the synagogue. You know where Jesus finds faith? Well, he keeps finding faith. He finds it among lepers. And he finds it among Samaritans. He finds it among the disenfranchised. In fact, he says to the centurion, the centurion was the Samaritan. We'll tell you how I know that in a couple weeks when we get to that. But the centurion, by the way, the centurion could be despised by the religious people of Jesus' day in Israel for reasons other than being a Samaritan. He was a Roman soldier. No group was more hated than them. I mean, think in your mind of someone that we feel kind of free to hate. I mean, this might be a stretch, but I thought this morning. A Muslim terrorist. I mean, I don't know if he's that exactly. But Jesus says of the centurion, when the centurion came to him, I have not found faith like this in all of Israel. I mean, that's got to tick Israel off. Are you kidding? He blessed his faith wherever he finds it. And if he finds it in the synagogue, he would bless it there. But he keeps finding it in the strangest places among lepers and Samaritans and centurions. Remember last week, one of the things I told you, of the 35 recorded miracles of Jesus in the Gospels, only two of them took place in the context of a religious setting. Only two of them took place in a synagogue. And the reason I told you was, at least in part, because it's out there in the highways and the byways where people actually live, because that's where the need is. That's where the lepers are. That's where the blind people and the dead people and the people who don't know God, who need this desperate healing, that's where the need is. But according to this journey we're on, we're going to find out that it turns out that it's not the only reason. Another reason he did those healing miracles out there is it's because also where the faith is. Turns out it's where the faith is out there. Now that will bend your brain a little. Jesus is saying, I see more of the real deal out there where you religious people, rabbis, Pharisees, you won't even go. One more thing I want you to see by way of introduction that I think is important has to do with the context within which these miracles are found because immediately following these miracles, and this is something I made mention of last week, but I didn't put it in the context of this whole thing. In chapter eight and chapter nine, we have this run of miracles. He does nine of them, as you know, and then we come to chapter 10 and he gathers his disciples to himself and he says, after all these miracles and everybody's cheering, wow, Jesus, you're amazing. Everybody who comes, you heal all these people. Chapter 10, verse one, very important to grasp. He turns to his disciples and he says, oh, by the way, not just me, you. And he gave to them authority to do what he had been doing. And the message I want you to be hearing and I'm gonna be bringing it back up again all the way through this thing is this. I don't want you to just cheer me, says the Lord. I want you to join me and say the words I say and do the deeds I do. I have been anointed, said Jesus in Matthew, for to preach the gospel to the poor. But when I sent my spirit on you, the anointing that is on me is on you. Go now and start touching lepers and Samaritans and the marginalized. The demonstration of my anointing, he said in Isaiah or Luke chapter 4, is to preach the good news to the poor and release to the captives and healing to the lepers. Let's meet the leper. Chapter 8, verse 2, and behold, a leper came to him. Stop right there. The word behold is significant, speaks to astonishment. It's like saying, holy cats, you'll never believe it, a leper came. Even the word came is significant. Now I'm getting a little picky here. But the Greek is nuanced in ways that the English isn't. The word came means to actively approach, to come straight away, to make a beeline for. Behold, you'll never believe it. A leper pushed through the crowd, didn't care what anybody was saying or doing or thinking, and he came straight to Jesus. It's unbelievable what he did. To understand the it's unbelievable what he did part of this, I need to tell you something about the leper. I need to tell you something about leprosy. Physically, this disease did several things. It attacked the nervous system, eventually anesthetizing the limbs. And because the victim of this disease couldn't feel anything, he'd injure himself often without knowing it. He could step on coals, for instance. Not so much a fire, because he'd see that, but you could see him stepping on coals and not feeling that he's being burned, have horrible burns on his feet that would result in infection. He wouldn't feel it. And one of the things many know about leprosy is that their hands would fall off and sometimes their limbs. And that wasn't always just the disease itself, though that was also part of it. Sometimes they would fall off just out of this kind of infection, not being able to feel anything. On top of that were oozing sores, the loss of teeth and hair. It attacked their vocal cords, resulting in a raspy, wheezing sound that was frightening to people. So physically, you had this kind of frightening look about them, but also what came out of their mouth was frightening as well, this raspy, wheezing. A man by the name of Dr. Hoisinga, who worked with lepers for years, said this about the disease. It begins with pain followed by numbness Soon the skin loses its original color Turns thick and glossy and scaly As the disease progresses They develop dirty sores and ulcers Due to poor blood supply The skin around the eyes and ears Begins to bunch up with deep furrows Creating the look of a lion in the face Fingers drop off Or are absorbed back into the skin Toes, eyebrows, and eyelashes Are the same If you got diagnosed with this disease, you were put outside of town. It was the law, actually. Leviticus 13, 45 says this. Actually, verse 46 says, His dwelling shall be outside the camp. Verse 45, His clothes shall be torn, His head uncovered in sackcloth and ashes, with a cloth over His mouth. He must cry out with His wheezing, raspy voice to anyone who comes near, I am unclean, I am unclean. For your own safety, stay away from me. By the way, the tearing of his clothes with his head on cover in sackcloth and ashes is very symbolic in meaning because there's other places in Scripture where instruction was given to God's people as to how to mourn. And you might even remember, kind of vaguely recall that there would be people in sackcloth and ashes, and it was always an indicator of mourning of some sort. It's how people in those days went to funerals in sackcloth and ashes, and they would rip their clothes. The symbolism of that for the leper is this, for him to dress that way is as if to say, I'm on my way to a funeral, mine. In fact, they were called, lepers were called by some the walking dead, and they were in the embodiment of that. and everything about them said stay away. To make things worse, there was a strong belief in Jesus' day among the Jews, particularly among religious people, that people who had leprosy deserved it. Because the belief was that this particular disease was a judgment from God for sin. Indeed, the rabbis had identified what they thought were primarily the 11 sins that caused leprosy, which means if you ever see a leprosy, you know, I'm not really sure what he did, whatever it was, it was bad. It was probably on this list. They probably won't admit it. In fact, there was even a sense among some that the leprosy was God's way of making them pay for their sin. They didn't understand things of redemption or forgiveness. And so if they're paying for their sin, it's very important that you don't help them at all. Because they need to pay. They should pay. They deserve to pay. So now I have the psychology of that. Not only do you have a disgusting disease, you are a disgusting person. Not only were these people feared because it was just frightening to see this. They were despised. And there was a tremendous permission to despise them because they deserve what they get. When they're not sure what they did, it must be bad. Indeed, for many, leprosy was the embodiment of sin, the physical manifestation of sin. It would be like, I've talked to you before about what it means to mourn. Remember that concept of mourning, getting out here, what's going on in here? I've talked to you about Pharisees who look good on the outside, they're sick on the inside. Leprosy was like somebody wearing their sin on the outside. and the assumption was the way they look on the outside is how they look on the inside they were in many people's minds the embodiment of sin like sin leprosy was disfiguring it was painful it was contagious so stay away it was pernicious and it was incurable it was incurable like sin it was incurable unless maybe god would touch you. Unless maybe God would forgive you or cleanse you, but be a leper. Be a leper who has been outside the camp, outside of any kind of religious acceptance, in the corner over there, knowing the only chance I have is God forgiving me. Fat chance of that. Fat chance of that. so when these people died they died symbolically in the eyes of people they died in their sin because of their sin again I'm not sure what they did but it must be bad in fact when they died there was no grief over that it was looking good let's get rid of that garbage it was against the law to come within six feet of a leper or for a leper to come within six feet of you. If the wind was blowing toward you from the direction of a leper, it was not six feet. You needed to be 150 feet away from the leper. If you spoke to a leper in public, just said hi, you'd broken the law. Rabbis in particular had a thing about lepers. If they saw a leper in the streets, they would throw rocks at him like you would a stray dog. And they had the perception of themselves that when they scattered these lepers out of the street by throwing rocks at them. They were kind of doing a public service, kind of making it safe for all the decent people like us. One rabbi boasted that he wouldn't buy food from a market on a street where a leper had walked. The picture is this, therefore, if you're a rabbi or a good Baptist, whatever, this was the belief, whether it was stated or not even, it was just the subconscious belief that my personal cleanliness and holiness was measured at least in part by how far I stayed away from people like that. Lepers, unclean people. By the way, these lepers believed all of this stuff was true about themselves, that they were cursed of God, they believed that, that they were unclean. They believed that. In fact, it came out of their mouths. They kind of confessed that all day long. When anybody came near to them, their declaration over and over all day long, I am unclean, I am unclean. For your own sake, stay away from me. And all of that is why chapter 2 of, verse 2 of chapter 8 begins with these words, Behold, a leper came, holy cats. you'll never believe it a leper came pressed through the crowd to Jesus a few things to notice in pulling this picture together so as to hear the message in the miracle and I would even invite you to kind of ask the spirit as I speak to help you see messages that I'm not going to notice but these are the things that I noticed. The first was this, just that he came. It's not a big deal. I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on that but it's just that. He was active, not passive. We sang a song earlier. Joel introduced it, I will arise. He was active. I will arise and I will go to Jesus. In Matthew chapter seven, verse seven, Jesus was saying to people, again, Matthew seven, important, this is part of the context. Matthew 7, just before Matthew 8. It's like all connected. And he's saying this to people who weren't sure it was okay to come to God. And he's saying to them, I need to invite you. I need to encourage you to tell you it's okay for you to ask. It's okay for you to seek. It's okay for you to knock. Because some of you are acting like you've been invited to the table. You know God has invited you to the table. You've been invited to dinner. You're in a relationship with God. But you're acting like you're acting all polite. You're acting like it's not okay to eat the food. God, would you pass the potatoes? It's okay. God, would you pass the meat? I need some meat. Jesus is saying, ask for the meat. It's on the table for you. Quit being polite. Ask, seek, not. First thing I want you to see about this guy is that he came. Actively, he rose. More significant than that he came is how he came. And with all I've told you about his life, I think it's safe to say that he came desperately. I love that about this guy. See, somewhere along the line, he quit caring about what people thought. He quit caring about what they might say, what they might do. One of the things that occurs to me about this guy is he came to Jesus. Again, as you kind of just really get into the scene and how he would have been responded to by people, particularly religious people, and the fatal and untouchable reality of his disease is that he didn't have any options. And before I go off and describe that a little bit more, let that land on you. Because when I talk about he didn't have any options, what occurs to me is that we have a lot of options. It's one of the reasons we maybe have a hard time even relating to the leper, because there's lots of places we can go to feel better. I mean, my healing is as close as the next big deal, you know? I land that account, I'm healed, baby. I'm feeling better. I got lots of options. My healing, my feeling better is as close as buying another car or vacation. I'm going to get healed in two weeks. I'm on vacation. I got lots of options. This kind of desperation preaches, and we all go, I don't know if we completely can enter into the kind of desperation this guy has. And it's this kind of desperation that God moves toward with incredible power. He didn't have any options. No one else could help him. And if they could, no one else would. Even if they had the resources to help him, no one would touch this guy. I want you to think about him in the context of his life again. Do you see, as you see him in your mind, I mean, I don't know if you're able to do this. I'm closing my eyes because I see movies in my brain. And that's why I rarely get bored. And they always change. It's very strange in my head. So I don't know if I can recreate this for you. But if you kind of close your eyes and just watch the movies with me. Whoa, anyway, it's very weird. As you watch him coming, pressing through the crowd and running to Jesus, do you see the risk he's taking here? I mean, he is banking everything on Jesus. If I'm wrong about this guy, I have no plan B. If I'm wrong about this guy, if I can't get help from God, this crowd is going to kill me. I mean, I see the guy coming through the crowd the way a car would come through a crowd. You know, on the way in, everybody sees it, is terrified, just jumps out of the way. Behold, a car came, you know. And then the car runs into something, and now you have time to think, and now you want to kill the guy who's driving, okay? The leper came, and everybody's going, whoa, the leper's here. But if Jesus isn't going to touch this guy and help this guy, That crowd's turning right now. Sky, he is counting. He has no plan B. If this isn't true, if Jesus isn't a healer, a cleanser, I'm dead. I'm not just embarrassed, I'm dead. He came desperately. He came courageously, I think. Courage, I've talked to you about courage before. Courage is not the absence of fear. Courage is doing something even though you're afraid. I think he came with some fear. Actually, I think it was even part of his faith, fearfully, courageously, desperately. You know, these lepers weren't allowed, again, to be very close to people. He couldn't have been close to the action. Anything he picked up relative to information about Jesus, he kind of had to overhear. He had to keep a safe distance and maybe watch something or hear a rumor about him. This is not somebody who grew up in church and heard the story over and over again, how much God loves him, how accessible Jesus is. he heard impressions and one of the things one of the things that he heard about Jesus or heard people say about Jesus was that he was a rabbi people called him, not all of them but some people called him rabbi I promise you with all of this determination to come to Jesus and putting all of his eggs in this one basket if this is not who I think he is then I'm dead there still had to be some questions they called him rabbi will he do what rabbis do? after I run through this crowd and get to him will he throw rocks at me? will he make an example of me? will he be disgusted by me? will he turn the crowd on me? oh man it wouldn't be hard to turn the crowd on me they'd turn in a minute in fact he would probably help his cause if he did what the religious people do when these kind of people come if he scorned me and made fun of me and refused to touch me, he would gain points actually with the Pharisees and the rabbis because he would be the holy man who kept his distance. I promise you all that stuff's going through this guy's head. So the question of the day as he comes through, is Jesus like the rabbis? I love this guy. And symbolically he speaks. He speaks of many people who come to Jesus, and when they come, they're banking everything they have on him. That he's not like the rabbis. That he's not just religious. He came desperately, he came courageously, he came, I think, somewhat fearfully. I talked to you earlier about the context and how the context brings just some more juice when I see that in Matthew 10, he says, not just me, I want you to do this. Well, if you go back in the context as well, there's meaning that comes to this. See, I see this leper as, this is the first healing miracle of Jesus that we kind of focus in on an individual, and I see him as the embodiment of at least the first beatitude, and that's part of the context here. We bring you back in your mind, back in Luke chapter, Matthew chapter four. Jesus began his ministry. He proclaimed the kingdom was at hand and you could get on that train that we talked about last week and be part of the big story of God. But it wasn't just a proclamation. He did the kingdom demonstrating the power of the kingdom by healing all these people. And when he healed all these people and cast out demons from them, you may remember that great multitudes began to follow Jesus and Jesus immediately became the pastor of the first church of what's happening now. It was the hottest thing in town. People from everywhere came to hear what he had to say and see what he had to do and maybe get something from him as well. And as the multitude grew in chapter five, verse one, Jesus withdrew from the multitude, went up on a mountain, gathered his disciples to himself, sat them down and began teaching them saying, and this is my paraphrase of how the Beatitudes go. He began to teach them saying, I got some good news and I got some bad news. The good news is this, all of that power that you just saw released on those people, bringing them healing and release is true, and it's for you. The bad news is this. None of that is coming the way you think. None of that is going to come to or flow through the kind of people you think. That kingdom power you just saw is not going to come to the religious and the put-together and the people who know how. It's going to come to the broken who come to the end of themselves. Blessed are the poor in spirit. It's the first thing he said. Blessed are the poor in spirit. Blessed are the desperately dependent. Blessed are the broken is how we've been teaching that here at Open Door. For theirs is the kingdom of heaven. And in the Greek, the nuance there is theirs alone is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are the broken. They're the only ones who get the kingdom. The only ones. The only ones. Why are they the only ones? Here's why they're the only ones. Because they are the only ones who come desperately. Recognizing, I have no hope but you. I do not have a cold. I have an incurable disease. And nothing short of God's touch can heal this thing. See, this is weird. I hope you're connecting the dots, but let me help you if you're not. I mean, I do. I just see churches all across the land right now in my mind's eye, full of people who know nothing of this kind of desperate coming to God. I know nothing about it. Because for one thing, they don't have any sense that they have leprosy or ever had leprosy. Can I tell you one thing about a leper who gets healed? You know what they are after they get healed? Breathlessly grateful for grace. And every time a self-righteous thing... And by the way, people who have been healed of that kind of thing, they're very gentle with other people who have incurable diseases. Spiritually, physically, any other way. Because they know what that feels like. But I think there's a lot of people in a lot of churches who are kind of sitting there singing their songs, and they're nodding their head, and they're very careful about the right theology, make sure you say the right thing, and all that. But basically, if you really got down to it, basically they think they didn't get cured of much more than a cold. I had a sniffles, and you know, I'm not perfect, but I ain't no leper. and quite frankly even without God I probably would have gotten over the cold all by myself I think this leper here is exhibit A of the Beatitudes blessed are those who come desperately blessed are those who mourn in sackcloth and ashes blessed are those who hunger and thirst for a righteousness a cleansing a cleanness that they can't get by scrubbing themselves clean. They're the ones who get satisfied. He came hopefully. If you are willing, he's gotten through the crowd. He's face to face with Jesus. This is what he says. If you are willing, you can make me clean. The you can make me clean part indicates he's really not struggling with the power of God here. There's something in here. And by the way, again, he says, Lord. He says, Lord. A lot of people made a big thing about the fact that, you know, this is, he sees that he is God. He's got his theology right. I don't know how clear this guy's theology is. I think this Jesus, he's seen enough. He's sensed enough. He's had hope rise in him enough that he really is Messiah. And I believe you can make me clean. Here's my question. Are you willing? Why would he wonder that? if you are willing. Well, actually, I think the answer is obvious why he would wonder that because everything he'd ever been taught about God and what he believed about God was that God was the one who had cursed him. Would God be willing to heal him? I mean, this is a weird place he's in. God is the one who had cursed him. Would he be willing to cleanse him? The rabbis who represented God wouldn't cleanse them, wouldn't touch them. Proved how spiritual and clean they were by staying away from them. Again, is God, is this Jesus? Is he different than the rabbis? I'm betting my life, I'm betting my life he is different. Picture with me the bind that this guy is in as he runs to Jesus. see here's the bind to come to God to go to church to go to the temple you kind of have to be clean because God doesn't like unclean stuff he doesn't like sin so if I'm going to come to God I have to be clean right that was the message you got in more ways than one from everyone but I got a problem here's the bind I'm not clean and I can't get clean by myself. There's not enough soap to rub this leprosy off. I have more than a cold. By the way, I do think people kind of do church that same way. I mean, I maybe relate to this. I can't go to church today. I just don't. I had a bad week, so you don't go to church that week because you can't go to God until you're clean. Then you have a good week and you feel like you're a good little boy you're a good little girl and then you go to church and the whole time you're at church you just feel kind of righteous. I'm not clean and I can't get clean by myself. The disease I have is incurable. The disease I have is untouchable unless God is different than what I was told. So the question. are you willing? I'm not sure. Priest frame it right there again. Try to imagine being this guy. Get in his skin. Sitting before Jesus, he's just asked the question. If you're willing, you can make me clean. Are you willing? Do you think his heart is pounding? Do you realize he's not sure of the answer? he's betting his life on it but he's not sure of it which is a very interesting kind of faith see I think we think faith if you have enough faith meaning I don't have any doubts no this is an earthy kind of faith right here it's courageous, it's desperate it's fearful, it's hopeful all at the same time and I promise you what Jesus saw when he saw the desperation and the courage and the fear and the hope, I promise you, I know that what he saw, he translated all that and mixed up stuff into faith because Jesus' response in verse 3 was, you know that he stretched out his hand and touched him for you stream it there be the leper you can make me clean will you? Jesus touches him as he's I think kneeling there do you think when he felt the touch anything exploded inside of him? I don't know for sure but I think he probably had a hard time breathing do you think he wept? he's sitting there this is before he's healed He just feels the touch. He touched me. He can't do that. He can't come within six feet of me. He not only came within six feet of me, this guy hasn't physically, you know, I'm talking about healing on a number of levels. This guy hasn't physically been touched by another human being since the day he got diagnosed with leprosy. He touched me. Now, don't be the leper and pull away. Here's the movie going weird again. But pull away from the scene and view the scene from a distance. See Jesus reaching out and touching them. The crowd is aghast that he's doing this. Now they're going to get all impressed when the leprosy is healed. But they're going, I can't believe he's doing this. And just kind of picture him touching Jesus. And look at that. And the picture here symbolically is amazing. Because the leper that Jesus is touching looks horrible on the outside. Just looks horrible, full of sores, wearing, as it were, his sin. and Jesus is touching him. Now leave that scene there and come over here to this scene in Matthew 23, just a few chapters later. In Matthew 23, having touched this leper guy that no one else would touch, full of stars, looks horrible, he's gonna say to the Pharisees, you know, you guys polish the outside of the cup and of the bowl and you look really good on the outside. You tie dill and mint and cumin and it's very impressive. And if people were to see the scene of Jesus and the leper, they'd go, ew, disgusting. And they were over here to see me and you, Jesus would say to the Pharisees, they would look at you and go, whoa, pretty cool, pretty good. Policy outside of the cup and of the bowl. You tied the element in cumin, you look really good. But here's the word I have for you. Made all sorts of friends saying things like this. Your leprosy's on the inside. You're full of robbery and self-indulgence. you don't know a thing about God you don't know you don't you spout his name but you know nothing of justice and mercy and faithfulness and that's what he says in Matthew 23 23 you tie a dilament in cumin but you neglect the weightier matters of the law like justice and mercy like mercy maybe for someone like this who needs to be touched and faithfulness your leprosy is on the inside full of robbery and self indulgence. Incredible picture to me, the contrast. Back to the leper. Jesus' answer, I am willing. Be cleansed. And he was not just healed, but cleansed. Here I am being picky in the text again. When I say it's not just healed, he's cleansed, it doesn't mean the healing doesn't matter. It's on purpose language that this guy wasn't just being healed. He was being cleansed. Inside and outside. And that gives me another picture. Remember the teaching of the rabbis? If you touch this kind of sin, you get defiled by the sin. And so we stay away. And that's a legitimate fear. I don't want to go by these kind of people. I'm going to get all sinful myself. Let me tell you what's happening when the power of God is at work. The Holy One, the anointed one, touches sin, and sin doesn't defile him. He cleanses the sin. It goes the other way. And then he says to his church, don't just cheer me that I love people like this and heal people and cleanse people like this. Join me in bringing that kind of cleansing and healing to people who want it. Not everybody wants it. Don't be walking around cleansing people or going, I don't care. No, it's okay. Keep your anger. See ya. Let me close with a question. Anybody here got leprosy? Let me put it a different way so it's a little easier to get your head around. Anybody here feel untouchable? Incurable? if you do I got some really good news for you he's willing right here and right now to make you clean to touch you in a few minutes I will invite you if you want to respond to that to come and our prayer team prayer team I'm talking to you we are kind of informal around this but I'm going to ask the prayer team to make themselves available our prayer team just be the hands of Jesus this morning. Just be the hands of Jesus. Because Jesus said I'm anointed to preach the gospel to the poor. My anointing is your anointing. My anointing, says Jesus, is your anointing. I've called you to do the same. So in a minute if you feel untouchable and curable I'd invite you to come and some of you might go, well, right here in front of everyone? Want me to come in front of everyone? Let me tell you something. I don't want to be mean here but a real leper couldn't care less about right here in front of everybody. The whole point was that he came didn't care anymore what people thought. He just wanted to be clean. Problem is most of us don't come that way desperately. You know why? Because most of us don't think we're that bad. We don't. Oh, I'm not perfect, but I'm not a leper. Yeah, I know, I know the feeling. Let me help you with that. Because maybe your leprosy is on the inside. That's why Jesus, here we go with context again. Matthew 5, just a couple chapters before this. In Matthew 5, he's just done the Beatitudes said, the only way you can come into the kingdom is desperately recognizing your only hope is God and you need grace desperately. But there were a bunch of Pharisees who thought they were pretty good. So in Matthew 5, 21, he starts poking at that and he says, you know, you guys have heard that thou shalt not commit murder. And that's a really good thing. And all the Pharisees who were hearing Jesus say, thou shalt not commit murder, were going, amen, that's right, don't commit murder. And they felt really good about that one because none of them had committed murder. And then he goes on to say, well, here's the deal. I say, if you're angry with your brother and you're full of rage, you are guilty before the courts. And then he goes on, you know, you've heard it said, don't commit adultery. And every Pharisee there said, yeah, I hate it when those, we have a law, if you commit adultery, we will kill you. And they all felt really good because none of them had committed adultery. And then he'd say, what I say to you, if you look on a woman to lust after her in your heart, you've committed adultery already. Your leprosy is on the inside. As long as you keep it on the outside, polish the cup and the bowl, you're feeling really good. Let's go inside. That's where your leprosy is. I've told you this story about me before. I grew up in church. I was this little churchy Sunday school kid. And I remember from time to time someone who would come to our church and they would tell a story about how God touched them. And it would be about how they used to be in prison or they used to be an alcoholic or a drug addict. And they couldn't hardly talk about grace without crying. And I noticed they were grateful. So grateful. And the truth about me was I knew I was a kid and I was a goofy kid and I was bad at times. I was reminded of that quite often actually. But I didn't have leprosy. I memorized these Bible verses I went to a church until I looked inside oh Dave you never I never murdered anybody we should kill the murders capital punishment I'm so for that okay you don't commit a murder you love getting all big about the murders want me to show you a murder let's look inside and I looked inside and I saw rage if you look inside it'll take your breath away never committed adultery I wasn't old enough let's just look inside and they're just full of loss I'm telling you what if you begin to look and you hear what Jesus is really saying about these things you'll find and you know what happened when I began to see that you know what I came up desperate for Christ and grateful that I could get it and a little more eager than I ever used to be to give it away to people who felt incurable, untouchable. The message of the miracle is twofold. One is this, come and receive. Healing and cleansing and grace. The second part of the message, and this is particular for Open Door because I think God is saying this to us these days. Open Door, go, go and give this thing away because I don't want you to just cheer me, says the Lord. I want you to join me for the Spirit of the Lord has anointed me, said Jesus in Luke 4. And now I am anointing you, said Jesus in Matthew 10 and Luke 10, to preach the good news to the poor, release to the captives, sight for the blind, and cleansing for the lepers. Cleansing for the lepers. But you know where most of the lepers are? Out there. So go. Quit proving how holy you are by how far you stay from people who desperately need help and hope and healing that can only come from God. Let's stand as we pray. I'm gonna pray and we'll be dismissed, but while I pray, I'm gonna just ask whatever prayer team people, and our prayer team people are kind of indicated, they'll have kind of a purple cord with a name tag on, but for some of the prayer team people to come and make yourselves available. And if you need prayer this morning for you to come, that's the message, part of the message, to come. And the other thing I would just indicate, I say this to you from time to time, I mean, you might run into somebody out in the parking lot with a purple cord and you didn't come forward, but you wanna be prayed for. If they're wearing that purple cord thing, what they're saying with that, among other things, is you can interrupt me. You can interrupt me wherever you see me, in the gathering place, out in the parking lot, and I will pray for you. I will pray for you. And then prayer people, just kind of settle into this. Just be the hands of Jesus. Just be the hands of Jesus. Touch somebody, okay? Let's pray. Holy Spirit, I pray, first of all, for those who need to come to you who desperately need you today because they have an incurable disease. I'm talking about people who need today to go from death to life. Talking about people today who need to come to you for that first time and feel the cleansing hand and healing power of a redeemer who says, I can make you whole. I can restore you and reclaim you and bring you to myself. I pray, Father, that those among us who may be that desperate would not hold back, I pray. And I pray also for those who don't see their leprosy because their outside of their cup is so shiny. I just, not to be mean, but I pray, Father, that by a gift of your spirit there would be a capacity to look inside. And out of that come up desperate and out of that come into your kingdom maybe for the first time. And then, Father, I pray that this anointing among us would increase, that this anointing among us would increase, to be people who are seeing that it's not just about coming here, it's about walking out these doors. The Spirit of the Lord is upon us to preach good news to the poor and healing to the leper. I pray these things in Jesus' name. And all God's people said, Amen.
