Music And on that day, a great persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. But Saul began ravaging the church, entering house after house, and dragging off men and women. He would put them in prison. Therefore, those who had been scattered went about preaching the word. Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began proclaiming Christ to them. The crowds with one accord were giving attention to what was said by Philip as they heard and saw the signs which he was performing. So there was much rejoicing in that city, but much suffering too. And then from the Revelation of John, the fifth chapter beginning in the first verse. I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a book written inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals? And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look into it. Then I began to weep greatly because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look into it. And one of the elders said to me, Stop weeping. Behold, the lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the root of David has overcome, so as to open the book and its seven seals. And I saw between the throne with the living four creatures and the elders a lamb, standing as if slain. When he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the 24 elders fell down before the lamb, each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. and they sang a new song saying, Worthy are you to take the book and to break its seals, for you were slain and purchased for God with your blood men and women from every tribe and tongue and people and nation. Therefore those who had been scattered went about preaching the word. They were proclaiming the Christ. They were singing this song, Worthy art thou. This is the word of the Lord. and I saw in the right hand of the one who sat on the throne I saw a book it was written on the front and on the back I saw a book and all through that revelation John keeps saying I saw and I saw and I saw Holy Spirit as we enter into this text in Romans 8, Revelation 5 help us to see what we can only see if you empower us by your spirit to see it. I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. And so it is that on that day, that day being the day that Stephen was stoned, Acts 8, verse 1, a great persecution arose in the city of Jerusalem, in the church in particular of Jerusalem, such that they were all scattered throughout regions of Judea and Samaria. But one person in particular, says in verse 3, had begun ravaging the church. His name was Saul. He would one day be Paul, the apostle Paul, who would one day stand, actually, before this guy named King Agrippa in Acts chapter 26, some time from now, and confess before Agrippa that what he did, actually, in Jerusalem to ravage the church back in Acts chapter 8 was only the beginning. Acts 26 verse 9, Saul, now Paul, says this, because I did many things hostile to the name of Jesus of Nazareth, and this is just what I did in Jerusalem. He says in verse 10, because not only did I lock up many saints in prisons having received authority from the chief priests to do that, but also when they were being put to death, I said, amen. I said, good idea. I cast my vote against them, and as I punished them often in all the synagogues, I tried to force them to blaspheme. And he did that with torture, forcing them through torture to blaspheme. God denied Christ, being furiously enraged at them was I. I kept pursuing them, even to foreign cities. So when it says in Acts 8, verse 3 that Saul was ravaging the churches. It speaks to a particularly brutal and sadistic kind of cruelty. In fact, the ancient literature uses that word ravaging to describe an animal that is tearing its prey. So the church in Jerusalem, try to get the picture, as recorded in Acts 8, is being torn apart, literally being torn apart like an animal tears his prey. With no time to grieved the death of Stephen. It was the same day that Stephen was stoned that this thing lit up, this persecution did, driven from their homes, running for their lives, separated from their loved ones. In Matthew 16, 18, I don't know if this was going through their mind as they fled for their lives, but Jesus had made a promise, and they believed this promise. I will build my church, Jesus said, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. But today, on this day, it really does look like hell is winning, so maybe this is it. It's what Steve Weems, last week as he was unpacking this story as well, kind of suggested they must have been feeling in the moment at least. It was fun while it lasted, but now the game is over. Roll the credits, turn out the lights. But that isn't what happened. And you kind of know that because a funny thing happened on the way to destruction. A funny thing happened on the way to hell winning. Because these people who got scattered, and they surely did get scattered in a brutal kind of way, but they got scattered. And this is the allusion that Steve used last week. It was incredible. They got scattered like a farmer scatters seed. He just throws the seed everywhere. And everywhere the seed is thrown. the life that was in the seed this life of Christ that was in these frightened people began to grow indeed this life began to spread throughout all of Judea the text says and even into unlikely places like Samaria but I want us to notice something here it wasn't in spite of the persecution that this life began to spread it was because of this diagmas, this persecution, this scattering that the life found in the seed began to grow and then to spread. One way to see it is like a farmer spreading seed. As Steve was describing that last week, I saw a fire. It's a different way to say the same thing, a fire that started actually pretty small. Think of it that way. Just a few individuals, actually, if we just follow the text going back to Acts 2, who had gathered in a house in Jerusalem, Acts 2, verse 1, when suddenly, as they were gathered in this house, there came from heaven a noise like a violent, rushing wind. And that noise was the Holy Spirit embodied here now. And it filled the whole house where they were sitting, and there appeared to them tongues as of fire. There's the fire. It started really small, this fire distributing themselves as they rested on each one of them, and it started pretty small. In this kind of picture, just a few individuals, but 120 people, actually. Acts 1, verse 15 says, gathered in this upper room of some house in Jerusalem, but then that fire spread from that house into the city, it says in Acts 2. And when this fire spread, it scared some people like fires do. Fires are scary things. So we got to put this fire out, they thought, they being, among other people, the religious officials, but in their haste to put it out, in maybe their panic, in what Saul would describe himself as having, a furious rage. So for Saul, it wasn't a furious rage. I know how we'll put this fire out. We will stomp on this fire like you do. You stomp on a fire with sheer force. We'll crush this thing. We'll snuff this fire out. But it wasn't an ordinary fire. some fires you could put out by just stomping on that thing, but this was more like a grease fire. Ever have a grease fire? Starts kind of small on your, you know, stove in your kitchen, little thing, and then it's flaming, and it scares you when that happens, and in your haste or in your panic, you do what I do when I have a grease fire. I throw water on it. Good idea. And before you know it, You're on fire. The fire spreads. The fire spreads, and the more you stomp on it, the worse it gets. But it did spread, and Saul knew only one way to do this kind of thing. He kept on stomping. He kept on pursuing. He says back in Acts 26, he kept on pursuing these little embers of fire, even into foreign cities, stomping on them wherever he could find them. But when he did even that, it just spread more. until this word about the Christ, this good news about the king, had spread like a fire from Jerusalem to all of Judea and Samaria as well, even to the uttermost parts of the earth that they knew at the time. But notice it again. It wasn't in spite of this persecution. As if against all odds they made it happen, against all odds they spread the word in spite of these horrible things that were happening. It was, and this is hard, it was because of the persecution that they ended up doing things that they never would have done. They ended up going places that they never would have gone. They would have just stayed where it was safe. They ended up saying things that they never would have said because they knew it would rock the boats, but now the boat had been turned over. Who cares anymore? They ended up attempting things they would have never attempted. It's amazing, isn't it, when you think about it, how free you can become when you lose it all. Because when you lose it all, you've got nothing to lose, nothing to protect. It's a hard way to get free. But some of you know exactly what I'm talking about because it wasn't until you lost all your money and the respect of your friends or your job or your marriage or your home that you finally woke up. I'm tired of protecting this image. I'm tired of this. It wasn't until that happened, that hard thing happened, until you finally came to life, found God, found yourself. It wasn't until that hard thing happened, until you actually began to dig deep, get healed, find your passion, Passion and you started doing things you'd never done before. You started going places you'd never gone before. You started saying things you'd never said before. Indeed, as painful and frightening as this diagamas, this scattering, this persecution in Acts chapter 8 was to the people who were going through it, it was almost as if this persecution was the best thing that could have happened to that early church. Like this persecution almost did this church a favor because when they got scattered like seed, when they got spread like a fire, they didn't go silent, which you might expect that kind of fear would silence your voice. Actually, they found their voice in the context of this and they raised their voice. Look at verse 4 because all of those who had been scattered went about preaching the word, it says, but it wasn't from a pulpit that they preached. Get that out of your mind. And it wasn't an apostle who was doing the preaching in Acts 8, verse 4. It wasn't a person like Peter or John or Stephen, even Philip. He shows up in verse 5, but in verse 4, it was all these scattered ones. Indeed, the apostles in Acts 8 weren't even there. I don't know if you remember verse 1 says that everyone was scattered throughout Judea and Samaria except, remember this part? Except the apostles. Weird, who stayed in Jerusalem, which if you're one of the scattered ones, knowing the apostles are back there is just one more disturbing thing. Because without the apostles who kind of know how this works, we just heard this message from them. What do we do now? But once again, a funny thing happened on the way to, oh no, what are we going to do now? Because all those, it says in verse 4, who had been scattered went about preaching. They didn't lose their voice. They found their voice. For their first time, they found their voice. They went about preaching, but not like Peter or John, not like Stephen or Philip, and not like Steve Weans or me, not like that. In fact, the word there, Steve unpacked this last week, was euangelion. They went about good-newsing. They actually, I think, just went about telling their story of how they had encountered the Christ. They went about good-newsing, and they did it on streets, and they did it in kitchens, and they did it in meadows, and they did it on the road along the way as they scattered everywhere they went. They were telling their story, and the story was a good-news story. when commentary likened what they did to gossip. I like that, I like that. They went everywhere they went, everywhere they went, they were gossiping, I'll tell you a secret, about the Christ. And it spread like gossip spread, did this message, which just sounds like such a good thing, but it begs the question, if you stay in the story, if you hold on to the whole story and what's going on here, and the question that it begs to me is this, What's so good about all that? Because while the gospel is spreading, and I see that that's good, I get that, and there is much rejoicing in this city of Samaria, it says in Acts 8, verse 8, because people were being healed and delivered under the ministry of Philip. Now, when I see that that's really good, the fact remains that these people who've been scattered and are good-newsing everywhere they go are still scattered. They have still lost their homes. They can't go back, and it's going to get worse, actually. That is their physical situation, because what happened in Jerusalem was just the beginning, says Paul in Acts 26. Because after I stomped on the church in Jerusalem, Paul says, being furiously enraged, I pursued them. Everywhere they went, I kept finding them and stomping on them. as I punished them often in synagogues. I tried to force them to blaspheme God with torture. And when they were being put to death, I said, Amen, good idea. I cast my vote against them, all of which raises another question. In the middle of all that, my question would be, was it worth it? You who were being scattered, and it was unrelenting, And yeah, the gospel was praying. That's good. And people were rejoicing when they got healed. But in the middle of all that, you kept on getting stomped. Did you ever in the middle of it wonder if it was worth it? Philip, I'd like to talk to Philip because, because Philip, we all know that the whole city was rejoicing. In Acts 8, verse 8, when you came and you preached and people got delivered, they got healed. But we also know that Saul and people like him kept coming after you and stomping on you when they found you. Indeed, later in Philip's life, I don't know if you know this, he would be martyred. He would be executed. Like all of the other disciples, apostles would eventually be stomped on that particular way. And when Philip was crucified, actually legend holds that he was forced first to watch his daughters be crucified. Just watch that. And when they were done, he suffered the same fate himself. So I don't know. I'd like to know, was it worth it? And in the middle of it, did you ever wonder if it was worth it? Same goes for Peter and John. Maybe Stephen as well, because it all started so good. Pentecost. Was that worth it? Yes, worth that. But in the middle of it came this ravaging of the church. Because in the middle of it, you were getting stomped on. And my question is, did you ever wonder, was it worth it? The question even is, for you and for me, do you ever wonder that kind of thing? If it's worth it, especially when you're in the middle of it. Is it worth it? to pursue God and live to serve Him? Of course it is. Yes, it is. Well, when you can't always see the benefit. Is it worth it to live for God and live to serve Him when you can't always see the benefit, when you can't always see the fruit? Is it worth it to obey God when this time obeying God could cost you something? When this time obeying God will cause you to maybe humble yourself, You'll have to say you're sorry again. Is it worth it when this time having to obey God means opening your heart and forgiving again and telling the truth, and that might cost you a lot because now you'll have to stand alone. Do you ever wonder if it's worth it to persevere day after day, year after year in a difficult marriage, in a difficult ministry, in a difficult life, when you just want to run, because there's just way more plowing of the field than there is harvesting of fruit. And as I was putting all this together, I just started wondering what kind of things you'd need to know if you're living in their day. Yes, good rejoicing, really good, but you're getting stumped at the same time. What kinds of things which you need to know, which you need to believe, which you need to see to press through those kinds of things. And I thought again, when I thought of that, I thought again of John, who we talked about a couple of weeks ago on the island of Patmos, who did in fact see some things that I think we need to see. In fact, he saw them and wrote them down, particularly for these early churches who were going through these kinds of things because they became profound sources of hope and helped answer that question. It may just be worth it if this thing is true because he saw some things that we need to see and believe and remember. And the first thing he saw, Lisa read this after the Acts text, the first thing he saw was a book. It was called in some texts a scroll, Revelation 5, beginning in verse 1. John says, I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a book. And it was written on the inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals. These seals are important. Let me describe to you what they are and what they mean. Because in John's day, one of the documents that would be sealed in such a way would be a personal will and testament. We talk about that kind of thing, someone's last will and testament, which holds all the things I desire, you know, for my relatives. I want to give to them. So this scroll with seven seals can be seen like that, as the revelation of God's will, his desire, what he wants to give to his people, what he wants to bring his creation into his last will and testament. And this last will and testament contains all the judgments of God, all the explanations of God for all that has been in the past and all that will be in the future. So this last will and testament includes some wonderful things for some, some devastating things, quite frankly, for others. All the purposes and plans of God are in the book. This scroll John sees, including God's plan for restoring his lost creation to himself, tekun lam, the healing of the world, and reconciling all things to himself to make everything new, to set everything right. So there's a book, John says, and it tells the story of God and reveals the purposes of God. And whoever has that book has the ability, they have the authority to open the book and break its seals, to unveil the story and to reveal the purposes, indeed to fulfill the purposes. But then in verse four, it says this, that John, in seeing all of this, begins to weep. Why? Here's why. Because there isn't anyone who has the authority, who is worthy. There isn't anyone who can take this book and break its seals. So then there isn't anyone to unveil the story, to fulfill the purpose, to make things right, to restore all things that just can't happen. And so John weeps because this actually is the reality of the human condition for throughout human history, you know it's true. We have anointed kings. We have followed leaders, formed governments, made alliances, created initiatives, all of them with the hope that maybe this time, we'll get it right. Yes, we will. This time justice will triumph and peace will prevail, but it doesn't, at least not for long. We celebrate it with a parade, but it doesn't last. very long. And you need to know that this is what John is weeping over because he's weeping for the failure of the entire human race, for the beauty of a world that could be but is not, for little children who are abandoned and afraid and exploited and abused, for the relentless inhumanity of humans to humans. And he's weeping for his own failure too because he's aware. I couldn't fix it either. I tried really hard and I couldn't fix it either. And then he weeps because he realizes not only could he not do it, but there's no one who could take this book and break its seals. And on him comes a kind of despair. And if you've ever felt anything like that, you're in the story now. Indeed, beloved, if you have ever been awakened in the middle of the night and wept, because things had suddenly gone wrong and you didn't know why they had gone wrong or because you wanted so badly to make things right. But you didn't know how. And when you tried, you just made it worse. If you've ever felt that, then you have felt what John felt and you have wept the tears of John. But enter now in verse 5 of Revelation 5, one of the elders saying to John, stop weeping, John. Behold, the lion from the tribe of Judah, the root of David has overcome, say so as to take the book. There is someone who can take this book and break its seals. And when John looks in verse 6 to see who the elder is talking about, he sees the weirdest thing. He sees this lamb, talked about this a couple of weeks ago, standing as if slain. But when he sees it, another thing happens that we didn't talk about a couple of weeks ago, he begins to hear a song. It's in the distance at the first. He sees the lamb, that's weird, but then he begins to hear this song in verse 9. And what's being sung over and over again is this. Again, at a distance, but it's getting stronger. Worthy is that one. Worthy is that one. Worthy is that lamb to take the book and break its seals, to reveal the purpose, to fulfill the purpose to restore what is lost. Behold the lamb. These people were singing. The lion has conquered. The lamb has been slain. A word about the song real quickly. Because in verse 11, the song, I said, kind of starts in the distance, but then it begins to grow as more and more people or beings, if you are joining this chorus, says this, verse 11, And I looked and heard the voice of many angels, many angels, around the throne and the living creatures and the elders, and the number of them was myriads of myriads, thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb. So there's lots of voices, and they're gathering kind of steam, and they sing with a loud voice, which may not be good news for some of you, because worship in heaven will be loud. It's going to be really loud, louder than here, louder than Joel and Ann. Myriads, Greek words, myurion, ten thousands of ten thousands. And then finally, in verse 13, the whole praise chorus is together. They're all there. It's complete. As every created thing, verse 13, every created thing, ha-ha, in heaven, on earth, under the earth, on the sea, and it joins in the chorus. singing this to him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb. Be blessing, honor, glory, and dominion forever and ever. And the four living creatures kept saying in wonderment, Amen, Amen. Okay, whatever. I think it was a little more dignified than that. Verse 14, And the 24 elders fell down and they worshiped because it wasn't just loud. They fell down because it was overwhelming what they were experiencing. So they fell down. Turns out they fell down a lot. A clumsy group, these elders were. Chapter 4, verse 10. Revelation says this. The 24 elders will fall down before him who sits upon the throne and will worship him who lives forever, casting their crowns before the throne, saying, over and over, worthy art thou to break the seals, to open the book, to make sense of these things. Chapter 5, verse 8. And just think about what these images had to mean to these people who didn't know if it was worth it or not. The 24 elders fell down again. Before the Lamb, chapter 5, verse 8. And as they did, they began to sing a new song saying, Worthy art thou to take the book and break its seals. Which raises this question, what makes him worthy? Why is he worthy? End of verse 9. Here's why. Because he was slain. And he did purchase for God with his blood men and women from every tribe and tongue and people and nation and made them to be a kingdom of priests to our God. And that's what made the angels sing. Verse 12, worthy is the lamb. A word about the purchase of people. Slaves were bought and sold. And sometimes an owner would come up with enough money to give it, but there were very few people who would be that caring or loving. The whole purchase thing here was this, that Jesus purchased you and me. And to do it, he gave everything he had. He gave everything he had. And that is why he's worthy. And that is why we worship. And that is why it's worth it. And that is why we sing. And we sing even though sometimes we wonder if it is worth it. Especially when we're in the middle of it. Like some of you are right now. Like the people in Acts 8 were then. When they got scattered like seeds. When they got spread like fire. When they got stomped on by Saul. Saul. Who one day would be Paul. Saul, who was doing the stomping, one day would sing this song himself. Worthy is the Lamb. To receive power and riches and wisdom and honor for he that is Jesus. Did purchase for God with his blood me. Would say Paul. He gave everything he had for me. Would say Paul. And for you. and for Saul and for Paul and for Peter and for John. He gave everything he had, and that is why he's worthy. That is why it's worth it, and that is why we worship, and that is why we sing. Thank you.
