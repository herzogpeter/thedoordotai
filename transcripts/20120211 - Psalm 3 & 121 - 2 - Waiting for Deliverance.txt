Well, if you were with us last week, you remember that we gave Dave the assignment to preach on baptism. We said, Dave, we do baptism twice a year around here. Could you please give your most stirring talk on what it means to be baptized? Not so that a bunch of people necessarily get baptized, but just so that we all are on the same page about what baptism is. And so he took us to this beautiful text in Exodus 14, which has been put on the silver screen many times, most notably Charlton Heston as he leads the children of Israel through the Red Sea. But it's this crazy and amazing moment where the children of Israel have been delivered from Egypt. They are actually free and they're on their way to the promised land. But then they approach this massive body of water called the Red Sea and that's what's standing in front of them. And then they look behind them and they see Pharaoh's army chasing after them. Not to kill them, as Dave said last week, but to enslave them again. And so there they sit. The Red Sea in front of them, impassable, and Pharaoh's army behind them coming to take them back to what they've been freed from. And we were given the invitation to reflect on what part of your own life are we in that story. Maybe you right now are in a situation where you desperately need God's deliverance from something that's had its hold on you, its grip on you for a long time, and maybe it's something that even you thought you were free from, but it's kind of gotten storming back, and it's right on your heels, and out in front of you is nowhere to run, and out behind you is your enemy seeking to enslave you right on your heels, and so what do you do? Well, I want to read to you this text, this specific two verses that that stood out to me last week. And I even thought about going back into Colossians 3, back into husbands and wives in that text, which we will do more on next week, probably. But as we talked this week, Vicki and Dave and Kristen Evenson and others and I, we said, man, I think there's a little bit more. So Exodus 14, 13 is what I landed on this week. And even as I sat and listened to the talk last week from Dave, This is the two verses that I sort of camped on. Moses answered the people who were crying out and terrified. This was his answer to them. Don't be afraid. To which I would have said, okay, too late. Too late. Then he said, stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today, you will never see again. And then Moses said this crazy thing, the Lord will fight for you. You need only be still. And sitting in the comfortable 70-degree auditorium in Maple Grove, Minnesota, those words sound comforting, don't they? Put yourself on the banks of the Red Sea, the sound of chariots coming at you at blazing and breakneck speed, The impassable Red Sea in front of you. You haven't seen the movie yet because it wasn't made yet. You don't know what's going to happen. All you know is your kids standing around you are about to be trampled by horsemen. And your leader is telling you to be still. What would you do? I want to talk this morning about how hard it is to do that. That even though in the scriptures we read it and it sounds so majestic because we simply cannot read it in real time, we know how the story goes. And so we read it and go, oh yeah, be still. Because you guys don't know, but the waters are about to be part. It's going to be amazing. You're going to cross right through. God's going to make a way through. And you don't know it yet. You just got to be still, guys. Woo! In real time, in the deliverance that you're waiting for right now, it's really hard to be still and wait for the Lord to fight for you. Is it not? This relational anguish that you're in right now, crying out to God for deliverance from the pain of it. Be still. I mean, everything in me wants to do every single thing that is in my power to make the pain stop. Amen? I mean, that's what I do. And I do a pretty good job of that, actually. I could do a pretty good job getting real busy and trying real hard and being real active, even as I wait for the deliverance of God. And so I want to walk you through at least four things that I'm tempted to do instead of waiting, as I'm waiting in this place where I'm asking God for deliverance. Maybe it's from a sin that I used to be good on and now it's running back, or if it's a relational conflict, or if it's just something that I'm just in pain about. The first thing is this. I'm tempted to pretend that I'm okay instead of naming what's real. Hey, how's it going, Steve? It's going great. How about you? You played that game long enough? Steve, how are you? Well, not that great, but, you know, I'm doing all right. You know, it's day to day. Steve, how are you? What kind of courage would it take for you to actually name what's real? Not with everyone. You're not broadcasting it on Facebook. every, well, you shouldn't broadcast it on Facebook. Some of us really probably are a little inappropriate, you know, whatever, but anyway. So what would it look like for you to, with a few trusted people, say, you know what? I'm really not okay, And here's exactly what I'm afraid of. I know it's going to sound silly, but here's exactly what I'm afraid of. So that's one of the things I'm tempted to do. Pretend I'm okay instead of naming what's real. Another thing I'm tempted to do is if it's a relational deliverance I'm looking for, I'm tempted to discredit my enemies and look for public vindication. Anyone ever had those conversations in your mind before? Where you cast yourself as both the judge and the jury and you put your enemies on trial and you load up the barrels, both of them, and you fire away in your mind, of course. Or maybe someone talks to you and says, hey, how you doing? And then you have an opportunity to discredit someone, to discredit the person that actually is maybe lobbying some pain in your direction. And you're not gonna do it really overtly. You're not gonna say, wow, that guy's a total, jerk and I hate him. You say, well, you know, there was, I'm, you know, but he's. And you know how we do this? And we discredit people instead of being still and waiting for God's deliverance. And we seek vindication from other people. Oh, I can't believe she did that to you. Unbelievable. Instead of being still and waiting. I'm tempted to give more weight to the taunts I hear than to what God says is true. Dave talked about the taunts that come at us when we're waiting to be delivered. Oh, this thing you're waiting for, it'll never happen. You just need to know that. That's a taunt. This thing that you're enslaved to right now that you've always been enslaved to, you're gonna always be enslaved to it. Because all they're talking about at church there, It's a magic wand that they're waving over you. It's not real. And you felt it. You came up for prayer that Sunday morning, and it felt real. How'd you feel Monday? Felt fake, didn't it? Well, that's because it was fake. These are the taunts. Instead of what God says, which is, I am the Lord your God. I will come to rescue you. I will fight for you. you need only be still. The other thing I'm tempted to do is, and this one is big for me, I'm tempted to try to deliver myself. And if that doesn't work, and newsflash, it doesn't work, then I demand other people deliver me. And I usually look to the people that are in authority over me to deliver me because it's usually their fault. Mom, dad, boss, deliver me out of this mess that I'm in. Spouse, our spouse is our favorite target for this, deliver me from this mess because you caused it. Nervous chuckling. What would it look like to listen to the words of Moses and simply be still and wait for the deliverance that the Lord promises to bring? What would you need to learn in order to be okay just being still? I want to submit to you that we as a culture are not okay just being still. Those of you with iPhones or smartphones of any kind, try not checking your email for a four-hour chunk. Try not checking Facebook or Twitter just for a four-hour chunk. Put your phone right there on the counter, And as you pass it by, feel the pull to do something. It's try not going to the bathroom with your smartphone, people. Dirty little secret. We can't even do that. It's because we can't be still. We have to constantly be distracted and distracting ourselves so that we won't feel the pain of the reality that we're in. So we distract ourselves. We eat a little too much. We get on technology too much. We waste time on the internet too much. What would it look like and what would we need to learn in order to just be still? There's an amazing and tragic story in 2 Samuel about King David when he's late in life. And King David is at odds with his son Absalom, whom he loves. But Absalom has killed David's other son, Amnon, because Amnon raped Absalom's sister, his half-sister. And so Absalom killed Amnon, and then David did nothing. So Absalom went away for a couple years and then came back to Jerusalem. And David then, for another two years, wouldn't talk to him. so Absalom's waiting for some sort of word from his father that it's okay even if he maybe did something wrong and that word never comes so Absalom takes matters into his own hands he goes out to the we read the story it's crazy how it unfolds he goes out to the city gates and Absalom we read in 2 Samuel that he is an absolute spectacle to behold I mean he is just the hottest, most amazing, best-looking guy on the planet. Probably looks a lot like his dad, King David. Think Brad Pitt or George Clooney or whatever you want to think. And so he uses his good looks and charms to win the hearts of all the people of Israel away from David and to him. And then he looks to declare himself king, to usurp his father's place. And so it gets so bad that David and his people have to leave the palace and flee for their lives. And in Psalm 3, we read an account of how David feels right in the moment. Before he's delivered, before he knows what's going to happen, before it all works out, this is what David writes as he's waiting for deliverance, as he's running for his life as an old man. Psalm 3, Lord, how many are my foes? How many rise up against me? The song that Joel sang for the offering is based on Psalm 3. Many are saying of me, here's the taunt, God will not deliver him. But you, Lord, are a shield around me. You're my glory. You're the one who lifts my head high. So I call out to the Lord and the Lord answers me from his holy mountain. I lie down and sleep and I wake up again because the Lord sustains me. I will not fear, though tens of thousands assail me on every side. You think you're having a bad day? You think your deal is bad? You think your gig you need deliverance from? David had 10,000s of people against him. Arise, Lord, deliver me, David writes. My God, strike all my enemies on the jaw. He's writing boldly. If you're going to ask, ask boldly. Break the teeth of the wicked because from the Lord comes deliverance. This is what he settled in his mind. I'm not going to bring it on myself. I'm not going to bring deliverance. I'm not going to demand deliverance come from other people. If I'm going to be delivered, it's going to come from the Lord. If the Lord doesn't bring deliverance, I'm going down. If God doesn't show up, it's all over. Game over. that's what he came to so we're going to learn really four lessons in in in waiting right out of this text and the first lesson is this when you are in a place especially of relational conflict like david was with absalom you need to know that accusation may come publicly but vindication will come privately and we want it the other way around. We want to be vindicated publicly. So everybody knows how faultless we are and how faulted the enemy is. But David learned something very different. He says, you, oh Lord, you are a shield around me. That's a military term, an actual shield. When I move out in my enemies, you're the one that keeps the arrows from going in. And I'm going to go out between my enemies. my enemies are always around me. You're the one who shields me. And God, you're my glory. You're the one who lifts my head high. And it's such an interesting phrase. Glory means, the Hebrew word is kabod, and it literally means heavy. It means weighty. So David is saying, God, if I have any weight or influence as a person, it's because you give it to me, God. And this is King David. I mean, he was the most powerful person on planet Earth, the most wealthy person on planet Earth. Women were flocked to him as we read in the Scriptures. He had every single reason to put his identity in who he was and what he did, but he said, no, no, no, if I have any weight, my glory, my weight comes from God. You're the one, God, that lifts my head up. You are the one that personally vindicates me, and you do it just between me and you. And God, I'm here to tell you right now, David says, that's enough. It's enough for me to be vindicated by you privately. About a year ago when, I mean, I'm telling you, the taunts in my mind were just huge. I mean, just enormous. They were just ringing in my ears. And I was speaking at this church, and there was two services, and I was speaking about the identity that God can give you, the name that God can give you that is a new name. Because we all grew up with a name or names that are derogatory. I grew up stuttering, and so one of my names has to do with that. and all these, you could kind of, if you had a counselor work with you for one or two hours, you would come up with three or four names that you have, you know, allowed to lodge inside of you, which are derogatory. So I was speaking about the fact that God gives you a new name. And as one of the experiences, I had people, as they came up to the communion table, we gave out name tags like that and little pens. And we said, I want you to take a name tag and take that pen and put it in your hand and you ask God for the name that God has for you. You just ask God and you wait. And then when you get that name, you write it down. And so I went up for communion on the second service and I remember kneeling down and, oh, there was my experience that I was leading people through. And so I thought, maybe I should do it. You know, like, here's a radical thought. Maybe I need that too. So I picked up the name tag, and I knelt down, and I took the bread, and I took the juice, and then I said, all right, Lord, right there at the community table, I said, do you have a name for me that you'd like to give me? And bam, I mean, it was like this name came in, and it was not a name that I would have come up for myself. It was not like, your name is William Wallace, you know? Oh, yes. Wow, Lord, you are so good, William Wallace. No, it was actually kind of weird and kind of different, and I had to think about it for a little while, and then I went home, and kind of, and then the more and more I sat with it, the more and more it was an answer. It was a vindication. It was, Steve, this is who I made you to be. You need to lean in that. And it was this huge gift. I was personally, personally, and privately vindicated. God was saying, no, no, no, no. Those taunts, they're not who you are. This is who you are. Lean into that. When you allow yourself to be still and stop your striving and distracting, you open your ears up to hear what the Lord has for just you. If you're wondering, well, how do you get that kind of a name? I'm telling you, open up the scriptures. Just start reading through. Read through the Psalms. Read through some of the epistles. Read through some of the Gospels. And you just start reading. And God will meet you. If you have no idea how to pray, most of us know how to read. Read the scriptures. That is God's word to us. Second lesson we learn from David. As we learn to wait and be still so that the Lord will fight for you, is that I need to encounter God in real time over and over with what actually is, not with what should be. I need to encounter God in real time over and over and bring God what is most honest. You notice that David writes this, I call out to God and he answers me. What do you notice about that sentence? I call out to God and God answers me. I notice it's in the present tense. It's not in the past tense. I called out to God in fifth grade, and he answered me, and he gave me everything I needed to know for the rest of my life. No. I call out to God every moment of every day because every moment of every day is another moment where, as Brendan Manning so eloquently puts it in his writings, my cheese is falling off the cracker. Every single moment of every single day, I'm one breath away from totally losing it, Either becoming an absolute prideful megalomaniac or an absolute shame-filled loser. Every single moment of every single day, I need to hear God's voice telling me whose I am again and again and again and again and again. And I need to bring to God what is real again and again. God, this is what I'm afraid of. God, I know it's the same thing that I've been afraid of for a year straight now, but I'm still afraid of it. God, please come. Would you come, God, again and again and again and again and again and again? What would it look like for you to bring the reality that God is present to you at every moment of every day? The moment you start feeling that anxious pit in your stomach or wherever you feel anxiety, maybe it's in your shoulders, and you're walking around, you don't even know up, your shoulders are like up here. what if that was a signal to you to pray? And at that moment, you might just pray what I would call a breath prayer. Oh, Lord, have mercy on me. My God, come quickly to help. Just one sentence. Lord, come quick. Or as Annie Lamott, the great writer, says, one of the best prayers that you can pray is simply, Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God. maybe your prayer is simply help me help me God I need help God I'm so terrified God I'm so anxious God I don't know what to do God come quickly God please help and the more you do that the more you bring into your consciousness the fact that God is available to help and the more you don't do that the more you soldier on and say all right, I just gotta try harder. I have to run faster. I have to get more distracted. The more you set into your consciousness that you're on your own. We learn from David that we need to encounter God in real time over and over and over and over again with what actually is, not what should be. Oh God, here's what should be. Oh God, I know you're good. And I'm trying my best. And things are going okay. And I know you're here, but no. Real is, God, where are you? God, I'm terrified. If this doesn't change, I don't know how I'm going to move on here. So God, you've got to help me. You've got to come right now, God. That's an honest prayer. Another honest prayer. God, I woke up today saying I'd never do that again. Guess what? I did it again. God, I woke up today wanting to forgive this person. The moment I put my eyes on them, I was filled with hatred and I don't know what to do and it hasn't changed, God, so you gotta help me. That's an honest prayer. Lesson number three we learn from David. This is an important one. I think David learned this over and over in his life, but it's this, I'm not limitless, I run out. Amen. That was an amen from a baby. I'm not limitless. I run out. Now, we don't like to hear this message, but it's really true. In your quest, in your crying out to God for deliverance, you can cry in one moment, God, please help me, and in another moment, it's like you're putting on your makeup, driving 60 miles an hour down the freeway, and saying, I've got to make it happen over and over again. I mean, today, it's game on. I've got to keep going. Here we go. and everyone's gonna expect me to be a perfect person. Everyone's gonna expect me to keep doing what I do and I can't run out. But David writes this, I lie down and sleep. Why would you write that? We all do that. Then the next sentence is, I wake up again because the Lord sustains me. You know what that speaks to? See, we wake up again because we figure, well, we've had enough sleep. when David got knocked down and lied down and went to sleep he didn't know if he was getting up that was it was that bad he had run out the word uh to lie down is Hebrew word shekab it means to lie down but it also can mean to be knocked down or to be humiliated what does it look like to be knocked down so hard that you're not even sure that you're going to get up or that you can get up what does it mean to say to yourself and to God and even to the people around you listen you got to know I'm running out and that doesn't mean I'm giving up it just means that I don't know I don't have any other resources the the needle is on empty and I don't know what else to do so David writes this but you know who sustains me not a good night's sleep not the next book, not even an encouraging word from my friends. The Lord is the one who sustains me and raises me back up. Kamak is the Hebrew word for sustain. It means to bear up. It also means to establish, and I love this. It means to lean or lay a hand on. One of the most loving things that my wife does for me when I'm freaking out is she'll get up to me and she'll just put her hand on my back. And there's something about that that just, okay. It means I'm here to help you. This is a verse that many of us should memorize in Isaiah 41, verse 13. I am the Lord your God. I am holding your hand, so don't be afraid because I'm here to help you. i'm here to help you but here's the deal and i really think this is true the degree to which god can actually help us is directly related to the degree to which we're willing to admit that our resources have run out amen i mean i just think god gives is the is a loving God who gives us choice to keep doing it on our own or to submit to God. And if we want to keep doing it on our own, I just think the way God works is God just says, well, you just got a little more to go then before you hit empty. So get empty. Thank you, Paul. So get empty. One of the foundational teachings of Church of the Open Door is blessed are the poor in spirit. Where the word poor there is tokos, and it means blessed are you when you are at the end of your rope. And you're blessed not because that, you know, well, the people that are at the end of the rope, that's the one that God goes to, that's the one that God loves. No, it just simply means there's a law of the universe that says God can only help you when you finally say, okay, God, uncle, I mean, I'm done. I'm done. So you're blessed when you admit finally that you have run out. How many people need to make the courageous statement today and say, I'm done. Doesn't mean I'm giving up. It means I'm submitting to God and dependent on God. The fourth lesson, last lesson here that I think David learned in this trial, in this deliverance, is that nothing and no one else will deliver me. If God doesn't show up, I'm done. And that's where David writes this, arise, Lord. It's like, Lord, if you're sleeping, wake up. And we read in Psalm 121 that David writes later on that the Lord neither slumbers nor sleeps. So great. Arise, Lord, deliver me, my God. From the Lord comes deliverance. And deliverance always comes when there seems to be no other way. God makes a way when there is no other way and it's God that does it. And if God doesn't do it, we're totally and completely done for. What does it look like to be a church of people that says, listen, we're gonna, you know, We're going to do our homework. We're going to do our work. But at the end of the day, we believe that if God does not show up for us in our moment of need, we have no hope. That's who we're putting our hope in. Do we believe that God is that real and that concerned? This is what happened in Exodus 14. verse 21. I want you to picture this again in real time. Man, this is crazy. Any leaders out there? Imagine being this leader, Moses. The Red Sea is not moving, and it is expansive. And the Lord has told him, stretch out your hand and pray that that thing would divide. So imagine the moment where you're like, all right, Lord, I'm going to look like an absolute idiot if nothing happens here. But I'm going to do it. And he stretches out his hand. And all that night, the Lord works. What does it mean that the Lord works in the dark when you can't see? What does it mean that the Lord is active when you don't know what's happening and can't see what's happening? All that night, the Lord drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turn the water into dry land. Who can turn the water into dry land? Who can do the impossible thing? I can't and you can't and your spouse can't. God can. Do we have the boldness to pray, Lord, deliver me from the impossible. Deliver me by doing the impossible. So those of us that are in a place of waiting for the Lord to fight for us, and I believe it's many of us, might be a relational conflict you're in, might be a sin that you're struggling with, might be just someone you're trying to forgive, it might be a situation that you had no control over, but it now has changed your life, and you are waiting for the Lord to fight for you, you're waiting for deliverance. What I want to close with is some practical next steps about what to do. So here's my best shot. if you need to simply sit in an environment where someone's gonna pray for you and you're gonna hear from people who've maybe been there, I want you to come Monday night right here at Open Door, 7 o'clock. And Peggy Lang and Al Shuck are gonna lead us through some moments where we just say, Lord, arise, Lord, deliver us. And I think it's gonna be a sacred time. But if that's not for you, you might just need to sit with this question, what do you need? You think about these four lessons that David taught us. Maybe what you need most is a private vindication from God. You need to hear from God who you are so that you can wait well. Because you've been listening to the taunts. And so you need just to sit with, I would say, sit with your Bible, sit with God and say, God, please speak to me. Read through the Psalms. read through Colossians and wait for God to speak maybe you need to encounter God in real time maybe you need to set a discipline maybe you need to come with a one sentence prayer that you will pray every time that anxiety comes and you just say every time the anxiety comes every time I feel it every time I feel lost I'm going to pray Lord Jesus help me now Lord Jesus have mercy on me oh God come quickly to help whatever it is for you write that phrase down and you have it come to mind every time so you can connect with God in real time with what really is maybe you need to acknowledge that you've run out maybe that's your step is just to say you know what doesn't mean I'm giving up doesn't mean I'm out it means actually I'm going to engage in a totally different way but I'm going to engage depending on God to come through rather than running on the treadmill of my own performance. I need to acknowledge, I'm out. I've run out. Or maybe you need a prayer for deliverance, and you really need someone, even this morning, to pray for you that God would arise and come quickly. And maybe that person is sitting right next to you. Maybe the act that you would do is to ask them to pray for you. If you don't have someone with you today that could do that, we're going to have prayer team people up here in the front again this week. I want to invite you to come down and we would love to pray for you. So as you look up on that, on those screens, if you're in the place, and not everyone is, and if you're not, that's okay. You don't need to drum something up. Oh, what do I, maybe there's something. No, just be okay. But if you are, what is it for you? What work do you need to do with God? And then my encouragement to you is to do it. be still and let God work. I want to invite you to stand up and I want to pray a benediction over you. This benediction is written in your bulletin so if you dig it, you can take it home and you can pray it on your own several times. It's by a guy named Ted Loader from a book, Gorillas in Grace. So let me pray this over you. If you need to receive it, you can just put your hands out as a way of saying, God, please come. Here's what Ted Loader writes. God of history and of my heart, so much has happened to me during these whirlwind days. I've known death and birth. I've been brave and scared. I've been hurt and I've helped. I've been honest and I've lied. I've destroyed and I've created. I've been with people and I've been lonely. I've been loyal. I've betrayed. I've decided, I've waffled, I've laughed, and I've cried. But you, God, you know my frail heart and my frayed history. And now another day begins. So, oh God, help me believe in beginnings and in my beginning again. No matter how often I've failed before. Oh God, please come and help us breathe in your life and breathe out the taunts. Please help us breathe in a new beginning and breathe out this belief that we've had that we're totally done for. God, help us breathe in your help and breathe out isolation. Help us breathe in your deliverance and breathe out the toxicity of our own desire for revenge. Help us breathe in forgiveness and breathe out judgment. Help us breathe in your life and breathe out death. Help us breathe in deliverance and breathe out gratitude. in your holy name Jesus Amen Thank you.
