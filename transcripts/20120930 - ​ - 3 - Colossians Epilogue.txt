*Slow Music* Well, Dave? Hi! Yep, Steve. Okay. This is different, isn't it? Don't be scared. Go ahead, go ahead, do it, do it. Please? That's the snort blocker right there. We've had a bet that we would get her to snort and we were going to count and she hasn't done it yet, so. Yeah, it's going to be a big afternoon at the Degner household. Yeah. Well, folks, we are wrapping up our three-year series in Colossians this morning, and we've been having a lot of fun doing it. There is this quote by Soren Kierkegaard that I really love and has come to me from time to time, and he says this, We live our lives going forward, but we make sense of our lives as we look back over them. Kind of found that to be true? So that's what we're practicing here this morning. We're going to take a look back over the last three years, Steve and Dave, and what we've experienced together as a community and what we've experienced individually as we've sat and immersed ourselves in this book of Colossians. We're going to press the pause button, and we're going to have some conversation together, tell a few stories together about this. So we're looking forward to it. As I listen to these two guys that I get to work with, Steve and Dave, talk about this over the last few weeks as they're thinking about preparing and stuff, I thought of this ancient, very old, simple Christian prayer form called the summary prayer. And a summary prayer is like this. You simply sit down with God. You take intentional space and time. You sit yourself down with your journal or your notes and your memory. And you ask God to help to remind you what you've experienced with him over a certain period of time. And you ask God, where are the places in which I have experienced deep conviction over the last month, over the last year? Where are the places that you have done deep healing and deliverance in my life? Where are the places that I experienced resisting you? And how did I come around to that? So that's what we're going to do together this morning. Sort of a summary prayer. So it's our prayer that as we talk a little bit together this morning, have conversation and sit under song, that God will bring to your memory and to the eyes of your spiritual heart those things that you have experienced with him and in this community as we've sat in Colossians over the last three years. And that something will be settled and more sealed in regards to your faith in the place that you're in with God. Now, the way we plan to do this is for me to interview Steve and Dave. And that is what I plan to do. But I think we all know the real reason I'm up here. Because these guys need a lot of facilitating and moderating, you know? And, you know, they've just been gaining energy. It's just the third service now. And they're like, you know, they're just full of it. So I'm going to do my best. They're full of it. No, you are. We taped the 9 o'clock, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, we have had fun together. And so I would like to start with a question this morning, you guys, and I want you both to answer it. But I want to start with you, Steve, if I could. We have had this long experience here at Open Door, And some of these folks haven't been here that long, where we sit in a book, in a chapter for a long period of time. So how do you guys do that? What do you experience as you do that? And why do we do it that way? That really is a great question. And it really is true that for years and years and years, that's the way that Open Door has done it. And I don't think it has to be the best way or the only way. It's our way. And certain planning teams map out every series and every week for a year. And the way we look at it is sort of like we're approaching an archaeology dig. And so we know that something really amazing and historic and life-changing and beautiful is underneath the spot that we've just arrived at. and so we want to take great care to discover the things that maybe we've never seen before and to look back to see what history will teach us and so sometimes that means breaking out the little brushes and and sort of geeking out over oh my gosh have you ever seen that and David like yeah I saw that 20 years ago but I'm like no I haven't and um no but and then and then we'll start talking about it, and then we'll regroup on Tuesday, and we'll talk to some staff and some people, and we'll hear, oh, that really touched a nerve, and we need to stay there. And so we might stay there for a week or two or three examples. Definitely, really recently, would be around men and women. I mean, we spent 10 or 12 weeks on what amounted to be just two or three verses, because all of a sudden it unearthed something that is really important that 2,000 years ago they were dealing with. And it turns out it's right in our story as well. And Dave and I together, it's really not lost on me at all that I've been listening to Dave teach for 20 years. But in these days, I get to go back and forth with him. and it really is this really fun back and forth where he'll say something that will make me want to say more on it and vice versa. So it's really fun for me. And that's one of the reasons it does go long because I'll be sitting there, and that happens to me too, is I'll be sitting there and listening to Steve and it will trigger things and all of a sudden we spend, if he's on three, I'm on three. We've even talked about the fact that at times I feel like we're saying exactly the same thing a different way and that's one reason it goes longer and I also think it's really good teaching and stuff like that. But I've enjoyed this kind of style, this way of doing it for a very long time. You liken it to an archaeological dig. I used to liken it to walking into a room and it is interesting to talk like this because I sometimes wonder what you think our process is like as if we come to a text and we already kind of know it and out of our PhD theological thing we have all this stuff. And the truth is, you come into sections of scriptures, and there's almost kind of an anxiety. I don't know anything about this. And you walk into these sections, and you don't know what you're going to say. And all of a sudden, you see something, and then all of a sudden, it's like in a room, you see something else and something else, and it gets bigger and bigger. And having the freedom to do that for years has been a luxury. But then when a few years ago, Steve got added to the mix, it just expanded to me. beyond what I could have expected. And I think the teaching has grown richer. A story around this, it just explains maybe to you how this could go three years. It's a little crazy because it is a little crazy. But we were in Colossians 3, verse 9. Paul is talking about all the things that need to be taken off and put on and even put to death for this life that has come to us to grow in us. And Steve is dealing with the text where Paul talked about putting off your old self and putting on your new self or your true self. And Steve was unpacking that, and he used David as an example of someone who was standing in his true self, his true identity, and not trying to borrow it from somebody else. And the story he used was the story of David and Goliath, and how the evidence of David's sense of his own identity was that when Saul came offering the armor, like, this is the way you should attack this problem, David. David had enough sense of himself to go, no, I really respect you, Saul, doing it your way, but this is my way. I do these five stones and a slingshot thing, and it was a powerful sermon, I thought, on identity. But I'm sitting down in the front row, and as Steve is talking, I'm thinking, because I know a little bit about David's life. I'm going, where did David get that? Where did he get that sense of identity? Because the truth is, he didn't have any of the kinds of things we think you need to have to have a strong sense of self. He didn't have a good king. Saul ended up being jealous and wanting to kill him. He didn't have the kind of father that sons and daughters want, and fathers need to see their sons and daughters. And Jesse didn't even think of David being a possible candidate to be king when Samuel came looking for one, and his brother picked on him. But he had a good old man named Samuel, a prophet, and he had a good friend named Jonathan. I don't want to give you a whole sermon. I already did. That wasn't the point. The point is, this is why it goes long. This is why right there, that's why it goes long. No, the point is like, I was looking through my files this week, trying to familiarize myself. Where do we go in Colossians? Then I see the title of the sermon, so why did David do it? And honestly, I looked, I go, where is David in Colossians? And the point is, there is this interplay that goes on. And we give ourselves the freedom to let these thoughts trigger into other thoughts. And I do think it's very creative. And I think it allows us to go into many, many places. And I think it's really good teaching. And the thing we've done together, for me, for my experience, has been a profoundly rich thing. And I'm very grateful for that. And for you. He's an idiot, though. Behind the scenes. See what I mean? Behind the scenes. You've got to take it down a notch. Just, yeah. I mean that in the best possible way. All right. Come on back, Dave. Okay. Come on. This is the third service. We're really... Okay. Dave, I have a hard question for you. Dave, if you had to wrap up Colossians in one sentence, what would it be? Love. Jesus. Jesus. Okay, well, this is the third time I've done this, so I can wrap it up in one sentence, but then have sentences to explain it. Of course. I think it's all about becoming more and more and more alive. And a lot of this language came out of Colossians 3. There was a real turning point, I think, in Colossians 3. We really picked up some traction at that point. But when I think about this metaphor of life, I reflect on the fact that I kind of grew up, I remember when I was growing up in church, the critical question we were always asking, and this is a very important question, but the question was, are you saved? And out of Colossians, I think a more, to me, a more compelling question has arisen. And the question is this, not just are you saved, but are you alive? And the reason it's compelling is, I think, is, and maybe this is just coming from kind of my history, and journey with trying to say things a certain way that's really capturing what we're trying to say. I grew up in church where if people were asked that question, are you saved? Most of the people I would have talked to would have said yes. And they would have even been able to explain why, because they read this verse or they signed this thing or they believed this certain tenet. But it's a tougher question to ask, are you alive? Because there were a lot of people I knew who were indeed saved. I mean, they were saved. But you didn't always see a lot of life. And what I mean by life isn't pep. It is Christ's life. Like, they were saved. They're going to heaven when they die. But you don't see a lot of grace or mercy or kindness or gentleness. And so this question that kind of rose right out of Colossians about coming to life. Steve did this thing about resurrection. And then Colossians 3, verse 1 is, Since then this life of God that comes through Christ has come to you. It was all about life from that moment on. And so I just think that that was the primary message of Colossians. And actually, Steve and I, when we kind of got our teeth into that metaphor of coming more and more alive, it really affected how and gave power, I think, to the rest of this whole run that Paul went on when he talks about all the things that need to be taken off and all the things that need to be put on and all the things that need to be put to death. In certain contexts, those things could be kind of coming. You need to put this off because that's what good Christians do, or God won't like you anymore, or he'll like you better if you do. All of that's kind of pushed aside to this invitation. Do you want to live? Would you like to be more alive? Because if you don't do something about this anger, this area has nothing to do with whether you're saved. You're saved, okay? We're talking about becoming more alive. And to do that, we need to talk about your anger and enter into a journey of recognizing and putting aside, and that's another reason why these things end up being so long. But I would say that life thing was one of the primary themes we landed on. Yeah. What would that sentence sound like for you, Steve? Well, I would agree, and we talked about it. I would add to it that the letter to the Colossians is a story of a group of people who actually lived in a certain place and time that were experiencing the resurrection of Jesus and the effect that that had on their lives. So for me, Colossians takes it out of the theological, theoretical, well, I'm just all about love and all about God and into, yeah, but when it's your turn to empty the dishwasher, are you going to do it? And when you've blown it, absolutely lost it with your spouse because, and you've transferred onto her every ounce of anger that you have, are you going to be willing to go back and own that and say, because of the resurrection of Jesus, I actually can change and want to change? And so as I was reading through Colossians and even preaching through Colossians, I would think about the aunts and uncles and the fictitious and not fictitious, but people that really lived and really had to struggle through that and really listened to Paul's letter as it was being read out to them and then broke it down with each other over a pita and hummus or whatever it is that they ate together. And so for me, it really became where I, and you've heard me say this a lot, but this example of people who lived their actual lives and were married to their actual spouses and had their actual kids versus the ideal. And it's really easy, I think, in church especially, to preach and pretend that we're living and believing all these things that have no impact on our actual lives. And so, to me, that's how I would describe that in 17 sentences. There you go. Thank you. Yeah. But Steve, we know you as pastor, teacher, as an actual guy in his real life, Married to Mary, father to three boys, co-worker, neighbor, all those things. What does this coming fully alive really personally mean for Steve? Well, it's played out in my actual life, in my actual relationships. And so one of the things that has, I have through some very painful experiences been uprooted from some things that have been dear to me. And then replanted in some other things over the last two or three years. And what that has caused me to do is realize what false self I put forward to people. Including my wife, including Vicki and Terry and Dave and the people I work most closely with. and I've realized that perfectionism and performance is something that I absolutely, that's my face, that if I can come across as nailing it, hitting a home run, doing it really well, if it calls for being really sensitive to be really sensitive, if it calls for something that requires a lot of force and direction to do that but not too much and not, you know, to balance it all perfectly. Well, at the end of the day, what I have realized is a life lived that way has resulted in me being pretty resentful. And even of the people that I'm with, and I'm not revealing myself to. And so putting off perfectionism and putting on vulnerability for me in my relationships with my wife and Vicki Yu and Terry and Dave and some of the other folks that are closest to me, means risking sometimes hurting someone's feeling because I'm a little bit more open and I'm showing my rough edges a little bit more. and not being as concerned with what they think about how I performed. And what I'm experiencing with these wonderful friends anyway is just really grace. And it's as I've, you know, can I show up this much in this meeting? Can I do it a little more? And sometimes when I cross the line, they come and talk to me in grace and confront me. And that's happened in the last two weeks, at least twice. So that's actually happened in my actual life. That's not just, you know, an illustration. And that's been a painful journey for me. But also, I'm starting to smell freedom. And maybe I can really be myself. Whoa. And that's been amazing. Wow. Dave, how about you? Well, just reflecting on what Steve's saying, I'm sitting here thinking about teachers in general and people who we think have authority and an authority as someone who knows their topic. Obviously, you'd have to know what you're talking about. But I think authority in the spiritual realm, particularly as it relates to pastoring and teaching a people, is that we're doing what you just said, that we talk about this from time to time, that we desperately, as teachers, need to be eating the same food we're serving you. And one of the things I love about Steve and trust about Steve, I tell him this often, actually, is when he comes to me with something about what's going on inside of him. I just know he's the real deal. And you're a great teacher. But there's kind of a big deal about that. The authority place comes when you, because I think people can tell when you are kind of up from this lofty place speaking down to you and when people are bringing the word of God from a place that they've allowed that same word to touch them. And I think for years we've wanted and tried to do that. One of my favorite verses about ministry and staying in it, is what Paul says, not that I've arrived, I have not obtained it, but at all. And so we're not trying to stand up here as the know-it-alls, because we don't know it all. But here's what we know, and here's what we think. But we do press on toward the upward call of God. And what Steve just described in a very practical way in your life is what it means to step, to press into the upward call of God in Christ. And we need to do that in front of everybody. And as we model that, hopefully, we model that, you do that all over the place as well. Specifically, Colossians, Though it really did give some language. I'll try to do this quickly. Colossians 3 verse 2, or 1, it's that since then this life of God that comes through Christ has come to you. Keep seeking those things that give life, and the things that give life are those things above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your mind on these things that give life and not on things that are on the earth. And I remember only first getting into that. That's very kind of vague and ethereal language. set your mind on things above, which means you should walk around thinking about heaven all the time, which is goofy, and not on things on the earth. And what we talked about was two postures of life. That's how we taught this. And this actually did kind of change how I think about things. And the two postures of life is one that is bent toward the earth. Remember this language you're talking about being bent toward things of the earth. And the reason we bend toward things of the earth and things of the earth would be things like sex and money and what people think. And the reason we do that is not because we're scummy people. It's because we're looking for life. And we believe that things in the earth are going to give me life. So I grab those things desperately, thinking they're going to give me life. But they don't give me life. Paul is saying, you need to keep seeking those things above. Because I believe, says Paul, that's where life is going to come from. And we just began to talk, if you might remember. You might remember, we began to identify all the things we could bend to. And that language gave me language for some of the things in the middle of that sermon series. I'm going, I didn't even know. I really am bent to something here. It even gave me grace when I was preaching it because what dawned on me is if some of you are bent to things and have attached yourselves to things of the earth, a lot of times we do that without knowing it. So there better be grace for when we wake up. And then when we want to let go of those things, I don't know if you remember this language, what we talked about, the fact that sometimes when I realize I've grasped something of the earth, it can't give me life, I try to let go, and I realize that this thing that I grasped has now grasped me, which is an addiction, and that's when we called out kind of the sword, and we were cutting cords, and the whole thing about standing up straight, and I'm giving all that teaching to say we've entered into that kind of thing, and even, I can't tell you how many times, I'm having flashbacks of you and me on Wednesday. Steve and I meet every Wednesday for two hours, and we just talk, And a lot of times it's about, man, you know what? I just recognize I'm bent to this, this person's opinion, this thing over here. Or, you know, six months ago I was standing up straight, now I'm bending over again. And this is life. This is life in the kingdom. And I think it's what it means to interact with the text. It's more than, yes, it's the teaching. But what comes to the pulpit and from the pulpit, from Steve and from me, is this behind-the-scenes interacting with it because it's our life, too. and I'll stop now. I just want to highlight what you just did is paint in three minutes the arc of Scripture. I mean that is the story of Scripture. Us trying to find life in other things other than God. God being gracious and patient and relentlessly pursuing us again and again and again and again and I think when you just have that in your mind that's the central arc of scripture. That's the narrative arc. Then you see it in every story. Every story. And so that's fun. And that's why it's so exciting in a teaching context to find language like that. It helps you say the same thing a different way. I love that arc thing. It's cool, isn't it? Yeah, it's good. Steve. We all know that you guys get excited about digging into the text. I mean, it is so obvious. You are nerds. You are nerds. And I'm just going to go off script here for a moment. And I think it would be remiss to not say out loud, Steve and Dave, there is a cost to living out your own story in a very personal way, out of the text, which you then bring to us and invite us into. There is a cost to that. And we know that. it has served all of us in such a great way. It invites us into the same thing. So there's a lot of power in that. And thank you for that. Really, thank you for that. I appreciate that. All right, here's what I know. Dave, I know all of these people are waiting with bated breath. I don't think so. To hear where in the world we are going next in the story of God. Are you going to unveil that for us today, you and Steve? Yes. Okay. Are you excited? Yeah, right. They're nerds too. They're nerds too. We just drew all the nerds. Yes, yes. Well, I'll tell you what we're going to do, and I'll tell you why we're going to do it. You can chime in on this as well, but we're going to move to the book of Acts. There's a couple of reasons. One, just kind of, again, behind the scenes, how we think about this in terms of, I mean, several months ago, actually, we started wondering, you know, Colossians is, we are in the fourth chapter here, and it's going to have to end sometime. But we just thought about, first of all, before Colossians, we were doing the Way of the Rabbi, and the Way of the Rabbi was rooted in the Gospels, so it was the life and teachings of Jesus. We did that for almost three years, and part of choosing Colossians was we wanted to get out of the Gospels. We were doing that. Okay, let's move to something else. Let's do an epistle. And so we did the life and teachings of Jesus for three years. We did an epistle for three years. We don't want to do that again. And so beginning to think about the book of Acts, one of the things that was attractive to us about it was what I just said. It's not the gospels. It's not an epistle. But there's been a sense of all through the book of Colossians, Steve and I have been trying to invite you. And the language we've been using often is inviting you into the story. Where are we in the story? Okay, there's the Colossians, and what are the ways in which we're in the story the same way they're in the story? And Acts just kind of becomes a way to stay in the story. And in seeing these first century Christians wonder, as we sit here in Maple Grove 2,000 years later, in what ways are we in this same story? And you reflect on this group of people who had no economic, no political, no military, no social clout. Something pretty powerful happened in their lives that would turn this pretty innocuous group of people, kind of timid and afraid when they denied Jesus, when Jesus was crucified, what was it that turned this whole thing around for them in such a way that their life change, at least in part, explains why we're even here, naming the name of Jesus. Something happened. What is it? And is there anything there that we would do well to remember, to revisit, to go back to, And so that's some of the reason we were drawn to Acts at our annual meeting as well. If you were here, we talked about the fact that we spent a couple years re-identifying our DNA as a church. Kind of out of that has been our values and our mission, and yet we haven't quite articulated our vision. There's a sense of where that's going. And at the annual meeting, I indicated that, speaking for our board, that we had a sense that as we've identified this DNA that God has kind of planted here in our church. We sense the vision is going to be in this next season to figure out ways to send that DNA out, to give that thing away. And that's a pretty central theme in the book of Acts, where God comes and does this amazing explosion of God's spirit in Jerusalem. And God, in some ways, kind of says, you know, I really like it that you're enjoying Jerusalem. I really like it that you love Open Door. But you can't stay there. You have to move out. And I think that kind of tees up what you would say about the discernment stuff and things like that. Well, Acts, again, is the story of a group of people who lived in an actual space and time. And so sometimes when the church looks at Acts, they go, well, it's the first century church and you got to copy everything that they do because that's the model of church, right? So you got to sell all your possessions, everyone live in the same house. You got to go to temple at three o'clock. You got to look for a guy that needs healing. You have to heal him because that's what they did. And because it's a model. And what I think Acts is in its most simple truth, and what we can learn from Acts is, it was a group of people that lived in an actual space and time that were absolutely dependent on the direction of the Spirit to do what they were called to do. And over and over again, you'll read in Acts about how when they needed to replace a disciple, Judas, they sought discernment. They had actually a way of discerning what the will of God was. And over and over again, that happens in the book of Acts, this picture of a group of people coming and saying, we don't know what we're doing, but the Holy Spirit does, and the Holy Spirit is going to lead us to do what we need to do next. And in the life of our church, and the story that we find ourselves in in 2012, we're going to spend a lot of time trying to ask the same question. How can we, as a group of people, be really humbly dialed in to where the Spirit of God is calling us to go as a people and to become as a people? And like a song that won't get out of our minds, what we really keep sensing is God wants to continue to do a work in us so that it can be unleashed into the world. And we don't know what that looks like, and we don't have a lot of plans for that other than, well, let's ask what God wants to do, and then let's be faithful to doing that. So that's Acts, and we're going to learn a lot from it. So it's going to be fun. Next week, Dave's going to start it. Well, this has been fun. God has done a mighty work in each one of us in this community as we have been in Colossae together. And thank you for sharing your snippets of story. I hope you enjoyed that very much. It just builds your faith, doesn't it? To see those little snippets of actual stories in real lives up on the screen. It brings great encouragement to all of us. So it means a lot, and thank you for sharing that. I'd like to invite you all to stand up straight with me as we close this morning. And I just have a short little prayer that I wrote for us, and I would just like to invite you as we close now to lean into this prayer and open your heart to God, and may God seal in you his good work. Oh God, for your word of life, your living word, that living voice among us, we thank you. for eyes to see where we are actually at in this great story. Oh, Lord, we thank you for your saving grace that is offered to us and washes over each one of us daily. Oh, God, we thank you for deliverance and lasting healing from those strongholds that bind us in our actual lives oh God we thank you for the deep and abiding presence of Christ that you have made sure to set within each one of us around us and among us as a community oh God we thank you now oh Lord may your kingdom come in each one of us in this community of believers and in all the places in the world which we all live and move and have our being. And all God's people said, Amen. Amen.
