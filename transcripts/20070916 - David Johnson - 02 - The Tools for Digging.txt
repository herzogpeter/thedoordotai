Amen. Amen. A couple weeks ago, in introducing the Sermon on the Mount, which is where we're going now, with this journey we're on with Jesus as our rabbi, I called it a re-digging of the wells. An analogy, this well-digging thing, from the life of Abraham, who, when he settled in Canaan, having come from Chaldea, dug wells that provided fresh water for his livestock, for his fields, and his family. But when Abraham died in Genesis 25, those wells dried up because they weren't being tended. So when the Philistines came along, not understanding the purpose of the wells or the potential of the wells, they filled them up. Remember that? With rubbish and dirt. I said they threw old rusty bikes in there. They used it to dispose of their garbage. Till Isaac, the son of Abraham, came along in Genesis 26 to re-dig the wells that his father Abraham had dug, thus providing fresh water again for the people of God, which is exactly what I think Jesus is doing in the Sermon on the Mount, re-digging the wells. Not that Abraham dug, but that Moses dug in Exodus chapter 20 when Moses went up on the mountain to get from God the ten great words for life, the ten commandments, in like manner. I want you to see this. I see Jesus going up on the mountain. Says that in Matthew 5 verse 1 like Moses, but Jesus is going up on the mountain to revisit, I believe, to re-dig, if you will, the wells that Moses dug in Exodus 20, wells that back in Exodus 20 had provided fresh water for the people of God in ways that we spent several months actually describing in late spring and early summer. But by the time Jesus came on the scene, the Decalogue, the law, designed by God to provide fresh water, to be the means by which the people could stay in their freedom and step into the fullness of their destiny, that law had been filled up with rubbish and dirt, with the rubbish and dirt of empty religion, dead works, and stifling legalisms. So when I hear Jesus saying in Matthew 5, we're going to re-dig those wells, I really believe that he's doing that. But what he's saying is this, not only are we going to re-dig the wells, We're going to go deeper than Moses ever did, than Moses ever could, because it's not juste about murder. Matthew 5, verse 21. Which is what Moses said, and you needed to start there. We're going to go deeper. We're going t talk about anger. And it's not just adultery, which is what Moses said, Matthew 5, 27. And that was a good place to go. It was a good place to start. But we're going to go deeper, because we're going to talk about your lust. But to get to those places like anger and lust, we're going to have to dig down deep because that's where the freshwater is, which leads to the second analogy I gave you a couple of weeks ago in beginning this whole thing, that I want us to bring into our understanding of the Sermon on the Mount, again, from the life of Abraham who came from Chaldea, Chaldea, a place known for its ziggurats. Remember that weird word? Huge religious edifices is what they were, monuments that I picture in my mind like the Washington Monument built to their gods in Abraham's day to appease them, to honor and reach them. But the bottom line, the key to the analogy, what I want you to get is this, that these ziggurats were external, visible, and very impressive so that anyone who saw a ziggurat would go, whoa, who did that? Standing, therefore, those ziggurats in contrast to what Abraham did kind of with his whole life. He dug wells, deep columns into the ground, what I called two weeks ago, reverse monuments that from a distance don't look impressive at all, but that in fact provide fresh water for drinking. The point is this, that the Sermon on the Mount, like Abraham's Wells, is not about ziggurats, big monuments to ourselves or even to God that are external, visible, and very impressive. If that's your goal, and if that's even what you think God life is about, the Sermon on the Mount will not help you or us in that kind of endeavor at all. Because the Sermon on the Mount is all about not going up. It's about digging down deep into the kind of life in here that especially at first and on the surface may not look impressive at all. That's why a lot of people don't ever go here. But that can, in fact, if you go down deep, provide nourishment, refreshment, and sustenance, fresh water for generations and generations to come. So blessed are the poor in spirit. Matthew 5, verse 3. It all starts there. And so we begin with these words. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of God. But right off the bat, that verse raises a question. At least it does for me. The question is this. How is poverty of spirit a good thing? And how on earth, in what possible way, is it a deep thing? You're talking about deep things. How is that a deep thing? Fact is, it's a weird thing to say because no one I know, no one I know wants to be poor in spirit or any other way for that matter. Because while we make care for the poor, minister to love, and even realize that we can learn some things from the poor, deep things, in fact, no one I know wants to be poor. It's an oxymoron, actually, and an oxymoron is, as most of you know, two words or thoughts that don't fit together, but do, like jumbo trip. Doesn't go, but they do, but they don't. Bitter, sweet. Anyone go, Yes, they do. The blessed, poor. The second Beatitude is actually worse. Blessed are those who mourn. Sounds like blessed or happy are the sad. I always thought happy are the happy. All of which, that weird kind of talk illustrates why I think, before we actually can begin to dig down into the deep places of the Sermon on the Mount, I think we need some familiarity with the tools that Jesus is using for digging into these deep places. Tools being a metaphor in my mind for the teaching style of Jesus, rooted, as we know, in rabbinic tradition. A tradition that if at some level we don't understand, we won't be able to follow. We won't be able to go to the deep places. We won't be able to dig our well very deep at all. And we won't be able to go to the places that his teaching in the Sermon on the Mount is designed to bring us if we don't understand what he's doing and how and why he's doing it. The fact is, Jesus' education, his Semitic form of dialogue, his use of story, riddle, paradox, and parable is fascinating to us, but it's very Eastern in terms of its essence, which is decidedly different than and foreign to how most of us were educated, how most of us think, which, I mean, because we've been very Western in our thinking and in our education, which doesn't make us bad and it doesn't make us stupid. But it puts us at a disadvantage, and it's a disadvantage I think we need to acknowledge when it comes to understanding the teachings of Jesus, because he's coming at it from a whole different place than what we're used to doing. And we can do it, but we need to dial into it. He often speaks in riddles. We'll see that in the parables. When what we want, it's kind of how we're trained. It's kind of how we're wired. What we want is answers. He speaks in riddles. Drives us nuts. What we want is clear and concise, linear and mechanical. Almost formulas for our faith. Even mathematical is good, where two plus two is four. And that's kind of our theology way. It all adds up to this. And you're thinking, well, two plus two does equal four. I know. But you've got to dial into some different ways of thinking. What we want is answers. Almost always. What we want is answers that remove all doubts about who's right and who's wrong. We want to know. That remove all doubt about who's good and who's bad, who's in and who's out. And the problem is Jesus rarely does that. I mean, I've told you this before. There's 80-some questions that Jesus has asked, and he directly answers the questions he's asked twice. He's always kind of moving around and being weird on us. Indeed, when he does make a definitive statement about something, give an answer to something, he often does it in a way that just confuses you. Like, happy are the sad. And he's saying, that's true. He doesn't explain it, and he just walks away. And if you really hear what he's saying, And you're not in Sunday school anymore because you go up and study, happy hour to the side. And you go, yes, I know. That's so beautiful. I have no idea what it means. You know, one of the first indicators that you actually hear what Jesus is saying is that you would go, huh? What? You're on the way. Now, we dealt with some of this early in this series on coming to know Jesus as rabbi. When we talked about the educational system of Jesus' day that we assumed, and I assumed, Jesus went through himself, beginning in Betsephir and Bet-Telmud, where by the age of 14, Jewish children had memorized the whole Old Testament. Remember that? It was amazing, fascinating. In Betsephir, from ages 6 to 10, they would memorize the first five books of the Old Testament, the Torah, the Pentateuch. And then from 10 to 14, they would memorize the rest of the Old Testament. So, by the way, put this into your paradigm as I move to some other places. You start with a download of information. one of the things I'm going to press into in this talk is that we need to move beyond just giving people the right answers but at the beginning there needs to be some download of these are things we know for sure they had scriptures they were people of the word people of the book but after 14 years of age and don't be insulted because some of us spiritually in terms of our formation are about 14 or maybe not yet and this could be hard for some of you because we're going to move past that because by the time they were 14 they would move into what was called Bet Midrash to the rabbinic art of questions and answers but it wasn't the kind of questions and answers that we're accustomed to where you're asked a question and this is kind of how we do it and it's your job to spit the answer back and the answer you're giving is either right or it is wrong instead in Bet Midrash by the time they were 14 they began to answer questions with another what? Question. And the reason they did that was because at this level of education from 14 years of age on they wanted to teach the students how to think. Not just what to think. They already had that download and that's important. But at this point we're calling you deeper. I want to teach you how to think. How to not just know the material. The text. Now you have to have that. but how to interact with it, how to get underneath it and behind it and to look at it from more than one perspective, particularly to get you out of looking at it from just your perspective, which is really a nice thing to do, but it's very small. I'm sorry, it's just me, this is what I think. Nobody cares. And then to realize, and this is scary, that there's often, sometimes, more than one right answer. What? I mean, 2 plus 2, is it always 4? and then to learn to hold things that seem to contradict realizing that sometimes sometimes not always there is absolute stuff but sometimes both are true now you have to be this is mean you have to be developmentally past 14 to be able to do this See, happy are the happy. That's true. But happy are the sad. That's true, too. What? All of which drives people like us crazy. This kind of talk drives us crazy because we're into linear, mechanical, single interpretations where we know for sure who's right, who's wrong, who's in, who's out, who the good guy is, who the bad guy is. Indeed, this kind of thinking actually scares a lot of people. because when we hear this kind of thing, this is the stuff that leads to relativism. Oh, I hate relativism. This doesn't lead to relativism. What I'm talking about does not lead to relativism. We're talking about people who are people of the text. We've downloaded the information. What I'm talking about leads to wisdom. Jesus was a wisdom teacher. And that's what we're going to be exposed to here. And I don't want to be, again, I don't want to be me, but not everybody's right. If you're not 14 yet, it's going to be really weird for you. Now, ultimately, the purpose and value of this kind of teaching, this rabbinic training, is that it brought people into what I'm going to refer to as sacred space, new kind of term for us. And the value of sacred space, according to the church fathers, was that it was the only kind of space within which people would actually change. Sacred space. Weird term, weird couple of words foreign to many of us. So let me try to explain this, give you a handle on it with a little help from a number of authors who talk about, among other things, the axis mundi. I'm giving you that word just because it's kind of impressive that I know it and just want to give it to you. And now you know it. The axis mundi is the center point. In your mind, picture a circle with a dot in the middle, a center point in the middle, and dial now into this. But the fact is, for most of us, most of the time, the center point of our life, the axis mundi of our life is us. We are the center. Now, the upside of being the center, and there are some upsides to it, is this. It's very comfortable being the center, being the decider of what is true and what is not. Because the only view you ever have when you're the center, or the only opinion you ever hold, is yours. And it's okay because you're the center and you decide. We think what we've always thought when we're the center. And we're very sure that we're right. We know with certitude who the good guys are, who the bad guys are, who's right, who's wrong, who's in, who's out. We're sure. And there's something, you know, you know what it feels like. When you're sure, it just feels great. I love that feeling. I just don't have it often. Now the downside of being the center, however, is this. You never grow. Ever. You never, ever change. Indeed, when you are the center, when you are the axis mundi, transformation is impossible. You may have downloaded all the information. You might be a theological textbook. But if you're in the center and you think you just know, you will never grow. You'll never change. Simply because you see no need for change. You're sure. The ancients called that profane space. Interesting term. And it was called profane not because it was dirty, but because it was ordinary. I like that. Because it was common. Nothing supernatural about that kind of space. Nothing transformational. I mean, you're just like everybody else when you're in profane space where you're the center. Fact is, most of us don't have easy access to sacred space, at least in part because of our Western education. I don't want to beat on that, but we have kind of been trained, not even just on our education, but our culture, where we're pretty much from day one, we are told, in fact, we're told to tell our children, you are the most important thing in the whole world. You are the center. I know, I believe you. Well, guess what? It makes it really hard to enter sacred space where you're not the center. And it makes it really hard to change because the only time you will is when you're knocked off center. But it does happen, even though it's hard for us to access it, this sacred space thing, when for whatever reason we are knocked off center and suddenly all the things you knew for sure, you don't know for sure. And some of you know exactly what I'm talking about. Most often these things occur and we enter into it when something unexpected, disappointing, disruptive, or even catastrophic occurs. But it's not always catastrophic, this thing that knocks us out of profane space, out of the center. Let me give you some examples. Remember the first time you fell in love? You were in sacred space for a while. You know, it lasted maybe through the honeymoon. where for the first time in your entire life, you weren't the center. She was. He was. Birth of your first child can bring you into sacred space as well, where again, maybe for the first time in your life, your center point is outside of you. Oh. And it just, and you know, I mean, how many of you, I talk to parents, they go, it's changed my life. You don't even know, you don't have words for it. It just changes your paradigm. Because when you're not the center anymore, that's where people change, where paradigms shift. Sometimes it is difficult things. Talking about birth. What about death? The death of a loved one. Someone you cared about, particularly someone who died when you weren't expecting them to die. And when they die, you enter into this sacred space. You wouldn't have called it that. But you can't see anything else. My dad just died. You can't feel anything else, and it just drives you nuts that anybody else in the whole world wouldn't be dialed into the fact that your dad or your mom or your best friend just died, and it just blows you away. You walk into Kmart, and people are still buying and selling, and you're going, none of this matters. Don't you guys get it? You've been knocked off center. And in that place, paradigms shift about what matters and what doesn't matter, and they don't shift until you're in that space. It's called sacred space. This last week as a nation, we remembered 9-11. And this may sound weird to you, but that event six years ago brought our entire nation into a kind of sacred space. I mean, some of you think of sacred space as going to church. I tell you, sometimes sacred space is really hard to access in church. I'll talk about that in a minute. The whole nation went into what I would call sacred space, where for a period of time, our whole nation had one reference point so clear and so central that it relativized everything else. And you know it's true. Lots of stories of things that people worried about on September 10th. Oh, this is so big. On September 12th, meant nothing to them. That's sacred space. You're off center. You're no longer the center. Something else outside yourself is. And in that place, people change. And sometimes we do experience it in a worship service. and I hope you can kind of stir in your mind a time in ways that you couldn't even articulate it's just there's something happening and everybody was there with one center and it really was God but mostly we don't enter sacred space when we go to church because when most of us come to church and by the way I'm including myself in this as well when most of us go to church, we're still the center. Indeed, we're in what's called our critical minds, where what we do is critique. You know it's true. Let's just all confess, I do it too, maybe more than you. So at the end of the service, the worship service, and not just open door, anywhere you go. At the end of the service, it's all about what we liked and what we didn't like, the music. It was too fast, it was too slow. It was too loud, it was too soft. I liked the speaker, I didn't like the speaker. I liked the talk, I didn't like the talk. Fact is, this is just the truth, I think. When we're in that kind of space, we're in profane space. I don't mean you're dirty. I mean it's ordinary space. It's just ordinary. It's common. Everybody does that. And in profane space, I might leave a worship service feeling really good about it or leave feeling really bad about it, even irritated about it. But I will not leave any different. because nobody changes in common, ordinary, profane space where what I decide is good and bad is the center. Every once in a while, I'll come home from a service. I mean, I'll walk out that door. You don't know. I'll walk out that door on Saturday night sometimes and I fix it by Sunday, I hope. But I'll walk out. I'm not going back. That was horrible. Everything fell again. Nothing worked. The word was awful. the worship was stale, the announcements were irritating, everything bugged me. It's hard to preach when you're mad. Two weeks later, I'll get a letter from somebody or an email, and they'll be talking about that service that I thought was horrible, and they'll be talking about how deeply they were moved. Now, I used to think that was a great encouragement. It's like, oh, you know what that says is your sermon wasn't that bad after all. And I don't think that anymore. I don't know if it was bad or not. I don't think anymore. Here's what I think now. More likely, I think it's this, that that person who was moved by that weekend we thought was horrible, it was really about where they were, and they just might have been in sacred space that day, where for whatever reason that week, they were knocked off center. I mean, maybe they went through something horrible. They just got divorce papers. Or maybe they really stumbled into sin in ways that just horrified them, and they wondered if there was any grace for them. And for whatever reason, they were disturbed by, disrupted by. They were no longer the center. And therefore, when they came, they were hungry. For something I could have read out of the phone book. Not quite. You need something a little more solid than that. But do you get that? Do you get that? That's sacred space. And those are the places we change. I'm telling you all of that, getting back to the point here, because the rabbinic style of Jesus' teaching is uniquely designed and perfectly suited to create that very thing, sacred space, where people might actually be transformed. Not by simply providing answers, which is what we want, but by often doing the opposite, by raising questions, by speaking in ways where the meaning of what he's saying is hidden, by use of parable and paradox, precisely for the purpose of disturbing, disrupting, and contradicting what I would call conventional wisdom, What everybody thinks, let me tell you, what everybody thinks is wrong. If you think what everybody in Minneapolis thinks, it probably feels comfortable, but there is no wisdom there. Trust me. I mean, you know that. Let me give you some examples of this. There are actually several, and I see them as the tools we need to dig down deep where the fresh water is. One of the first and most obvious, clearly one of Jesus' favorite techniques was what I would call the great reversal themes, where he confronts and reverses the order of what most people think in order to make them think. So he says things like this. Maybe the most famous, well-known is this. The first will be last, and the last will be first. That's a reversal theme. And he says, well, that's a weird thing to say. So these goofy kids are in first in line. I should be last. Okay, whatever. You don't get it. That's fine. Blessed are the poor in spirit. That's a reversal theme. this. What? What? It goes against conventional wisdom. We love to tell stories where the person, I love this, where the person you expected to be the hero is the villain, and the person you expect to be the villain is the hero. Good Samaritan is a classic example of that. You have the priests and the Levites, who are supposed to be the good guys. They're the pastors, and in the story, they're the villains. The Samaritan in the story, the non-Jew half-breed bad guy, is the hero. It's just incredible how subversive Jesus' teaching is. I mean, it would be like, the Good Samaritan story would be like me telling a story where the evangelical pastor is the bad guy, and some Hindu or some Muslim, Samaritan, half-breed, non-Jew, not part of the community of faith, indeed a villain is the hero. Someone from whom we can actually learn about what it means to love your neighbor. That's the whole point of this. I mean, you just need to know how. I mean, if I told a story like that without setting you up and knowing that I got a trick for you, people would walk out. Prodigal son is the same thing. You have a son who does it wrong, who does it really wrong, but in the end is what? Right. And you have another son who does it right. He does it right his whole life. He does it absolutely right, and in the end, he misses everything. He does it wrong. It's an incredible confrontation. It's very disturbing because it means that you can do it all right. And for those of you who are into doing it right, this is really scary because you could be doing it all right and be all wrong because you can do the right thing for the wrong reason and be missing a mile. And you could actually be stumbling and bumbling around and in the end find something that brings you into what's right, which is precisely, by the way, the parable of the publican and the sinner and Luke's gospel, the Pharisee, did it right. I mean, he really did. I'm not just making, he really did. He followed the rules. He went to synagogue. If he was an evangelist, he went to church. He had Bible study at 5 o'clock in the morning. He did it all right. But he was full of pride. Remember the parable? There was one Pharisee saying, Lord, thank you. I'm not like this loser over here for this is all I get up at 5 in the morning. I have devotion. Nothing wrong with devotion. nothing wrong with tithing, but he was full of, he did the right thing the wrong way. He's the wrong guy. And the publican did it all wrong. He was a liar, a cheater, a thief. But in the end, he saw that he was a liar, a thief, and a cheat, and he fell on his face and said, God, be merciful to me, a sinner. Reversal themes. I want you to note something here, very important. The style of teaching didn't originate with Jesus. Now, some of Jesus' teaching we're going to focus on and see in the next weeks in the Sermon on the Mount, and then we're going to go on to other things, the parables, and we're going to be in here for a couple weeks anyway. Some of his teaching, it's unique to him, but a lot of this rabbinic stuff did not originate with him. Indeed, the psalmist, this is just an example of that, and one of my favorite reversal themes says that the stone, Psalm 118, the stone that the builder rejected becomes the chief cornerstone. Now, Peter in 1 Peter 2, 7 says that speaking of Jesus, the chief Cornerstone, who the builder rejected. And it is Jesus. But that psalm in Psalm 118 also speaks to a theology that's called the theology of the sacred wound. Listen to this. Where the thing you thought in you, that thing you most fear and most reject, that you're most ashamed of, maybe a sin, a failure, that you're convinced and have been for years is that which keeps you from God, if that thing, horrible as it is, is faced, wept over, repented of, forgiven, can become, in fact, the very thing in your life that becomes the cornerstone of your life. You know it's true. It's why sometimes as you look back on your life, the worst things that ever happened to you that you never want to do again and you really don't, but there's another the way you look at it and you go, it's the best thing that ever happened to me. Where the worst failure you ever had in your life, where you were the most selfish and the most vile and the most self-absorbed, and it just cost you so much. Your marriage, it's the worst thing you never, but it was a paradigm shift. It brought change. Now, just because you go through something like that doesn't bring change, but those are the places where it's possible. It's fascinating because part of this reversal theme that Jesus utilizes is that Jesus is, I love this, is Jesus is introducing a spirituality not of perfection but actually of imperfection because blessed are the poor in spirit because they know they need. This is so weird because the Pharisees were the sure ones, remember? They knew and that's why they never grew. That's why they didn't even recognize who Jesus was and what Jesus said of these people who knew for sure, was you listen, but you don't hear. You look, but you don't see. Why? Because they were sure. They were the center. And they needed to get knocked off. Reversal theme. Designed to disturb and disrupt and pull us out of either or thinking. Where everything is either black or white and we know who's good, we know who's bad, Who's in, who's out. You're either a heretic or you're orthodox. And it's weird. If you know any black and white people, there's a sense, boy, they're really strong. They really, you know, you're 14. I'm sorry. You're still 14. That's okay. But it's kind of irritating if you're 60 and you're still 14. So to either or thinking people, it's black or white, Jesus does irritating things. Like he praises the Syrophoenician woman and he declares the faith of the Roman centurion to be greater than any faith he's seen in all of Israel. And all these people who think, ah, it just drives them nuts. I mean, this is why people loved him, and this is why people hated him. Why would he say, you know, to all these Pharisees and all these people who knew for sure that I've never seen as great a faith in all of Israel, and any of you, as I've seen in this guy that none of you think are, you know, that you think is evil and vile. Why would he say that? And why would he follow it by saying, many will come from the east and the west to sit at the table of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but sons of the kingdom will be cast out. Why would he say things like that? He would say things like that to get them to wonder that maybe they don't get it. Maybe you don't know. Don't be so sure. He loved metaphors of mixture, the collision of opposites, wheat and tares, Matthew 13. The reality is often a mixed bag. It's not either or. Sometimes, not always, but sometimes it's both and. So he says don't pull up those weeds. A number of reasons. I don't know. Sometimes I think we need weeds. I think we need to be disturbed by the weeds. I think we need to weep over the weeds. Sometimes, however, he says don't pull up the weeds. It's because I don't trust your ability to identify a weed from a wheat. Because you think you know, and I'm telling you, you don't. Many will come from the east and the west and sit at the table, people you don't expect. It's a bigger table than you think. You think you know. Maybe you don't. Don't we hate this stuff? Then there's a lost and hidden images, because Jesus seems to think that there are some things that we can actually know better by losing them, looking for them, suffering from the loss of them, searching for them, and then rejoicing in the rediscovering of them than to have never lost it at all. That's the lost coin of Luke 15. That's the lost sheep of Luke 15 in Matthew 18. That's the lost son, the prodigal son who had to lose it all. Not everybody does, but this guy did, and some of us do too. He had to lose it all and then rediscover what he had all along, what he had all along, his father's love, his father's house. It's just, I just, Jesus so fascinates me because he gets us. He gets us. He understands how people grow and how sometimes they have to lose to find. How many of you have friends like mine? I have some friends. Some, quite frankly, of the deepest and wisest people I know are people who at some point hit the wall. even lost what they called faith at the time and in the loss of it now some people lose their faith and they never find it again because they never go on a search and that's the danger of this kind of stuff it really is dangerous but I know many many people who lost what they called faith but it was precisely in the losing it and longing for it and suffering over it that they were stirred into a search for something deeper where the fresh water is and they rediscovered something rejoicing. You know, I face this as a pastor, as a parent as well. We think if we do it right and train everybody right and give you all the right stuff, no one will ever, you know, have any pain or wander off. I can help people avoid all that. I can help my children avoid all that. I can help the people in our church avoid all that. The fact is sometimes people need that. Jesus seems to think there are some things that you need to lose to actually find. He lived with images that spoke to growth and slow transformation, not magic wands, presto chango spirituality, the slow growing seed of Mark 4, Matthew 13. Even his analogy with Nicodemus of the born again thing. I just, you know, we have such a, and by the way, I don't want to get lost, I could get in trouble here if I don't make this clear. I mean Paul would be a wonderful example of born again right now okay that happens and by the way Paul is a wonderful picture of having to be knocked off center because even our conversion experiences often God experiences involve being knocked off center Paul on the way to Damascus the thing I pictured in him was this he was absolutely sure that he was right I'm killing Christians and I know him he had no doubt in his mind he's like who we all want to be I don't want to have any doubt and then God knocked him off his horse and guess what he wasn't so what sure anymore guess what happened to him there he transformed i lost my point oh the conversion thing born again even the born again thing even a born again thing think of this there are moments in time we always make it do you have that thing dude was there that time you said the words maybe maybe that's good that's good but even the born again thing it starts with a seed being planted and nobody knows it i what i don't know i don't feel any different something starts to grow and you still don't notice it. But God's at work. And something starts to grow and then you go, whoa, what's going on? You don't even understand it. And it grows and it grows and it grows. And then life comes, even that's a process. Jesus understood that. Also notice, you'll see this in Jesus' teaching, an expectation on God's part and his part for fruit, for transformation. He expected it. The cursing of the fig tree. He ticked off. what? It didn't produce fruit. The cutting off of the branches, it didn't produce any fruit. This is not a performance thing. It's just like Jesus saying this, what I'm giving you, what I'm giving you has the power to change you. And if it doesn't, you're not on board with this thing. Bottom line is this, the teachings of Jesus that we're entering into here will force us to face, among other things, are true loyalty systems. We think we're loyal to God and truth and love, and we want to be, when actually what most of us, myself included, what most of us are loyal to are the ways we already think and the ways we already believe. So here's my question as we begin. Are you willing to be disturbed? Are you willing to be disrupted so that maybe you, so that maybe we could enter sacred space where real transformation by the power of God's Spirit can occur? I think you're ready. So here we go. Ready or not, here we go. Let's pray as we close. Stand with me, would you? Lord among other things what we're going to need is so many things I think we need courage one thing we need is humility it's really hard to come to places where we have to go God I guess I don't know I was so sure and to enter into these it's just so frightening So I pray for courage and humility. I just pray you bless these people. I pray you give us tastes of this water that is flowing in deep places. Give us the courage to stay at it, to stay at it, and dig in days when it feels dry and there isn't any water, to stay at it, and to find some friends who would be on this journey with them, with us. And we just pray these things. We just pray these things in Jesus' name. All God's people said, amen, amen. God bless you, God bless you. You're dismissed. Thank you.
