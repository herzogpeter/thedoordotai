of Palm Sunday is something we spoke of two weeks ago, actually, and that is of Jesus riding in to Jerusalem on the foal of the donkey and how dissonant that would be if we're looking for a liberator, someone who's going to bring us out of exile, the people shouting, Hosanna, Hosanna, we think you're the one, and Jesus weeping because he knew they didn't get it. That most of them had no intention of following his way out of their personal and national exile into the kind of life he was offering. With that in mind, let's pray. My prayer is this, Father. With that picture in mind and the exile reality we're going to talk about this morning, that you would give us eyes to see or to hear, hands to help, feet to follow the way of the Rabbi, may it not be true of us that we just don't get it. May we be among those who do and follow. I pray that. In Jesus' name, amen. For several weeks, most of you know, if you've been with us, in the context of the series of sermons we're referring to as the way of the Rabbi, we've been talking about the importance of understanding the message and the mission of Jesus in the context of history, particularly first century history, and how first century Jews would have heard what Jesus was saying and interpreted what Jesus was saying in the light of religious, the religious, political, and economic realities of his day. And we'd been doing that for several weeks when two weeks ago we kind of zeroed in on the fact that a significant part of this historical context we've been working to establish is this. So keep in mind that Jesus was himself a Torah-observant Jew, which means that his entire frame of reference theologically, the grid through which he understood the world and God and all these things, was the Old Testament. That was his Bible, that Jesus grew up as a young boy in Nazareth, going to Hebrew school, going to Beth Sefer and Beth Talmud, hearing the stories, not of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. He never heard of Paul. He grew up hearing and memorizing, indeed, the stories of Moses and the prophets of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, and that those were the stories that shaped him, that formed his view of God and who God is and how God works, and also it formed his view of himself and who he was in the context of this nation called Israel, the people of God, and how he and they, the people of God, fit into the story of God. It was all shaped by the Old Testament. That's why two weeks ago we kind of did this flyover of the entire Old Testament telling the story of what we called God's wrestling match. Remember that? God's wrestling match with his lost creation, calling his lost creation back to himself in a variety of ways with the primary theme being this, that sometimes even a God who is by nature love says enough in the form of judgment, thus bringing, a couple weeks ago, some clarity, I think, to the seeming contradiction we identified two weeks ago between God's judgment on one hand and his grace on the other hand, between the apparent power over strategy that looks to be God's way in the Old Testament and the power under strategy that looks to be God's way in the New Testament. And that clarity came in the context of the story, the Old Testament, and how Jesus understood it. And so it is today. I want to do the same thing, to tell the story again, but this time with a different theme. A theme that is threaded into and through the entire Old Testament story that Jesus was formed by and aware of, a theme that actually takes the form of a pattern or a cycle of life deeply ingrained into the psyche of first century Jews that we need to understand, if we hope to understand, how they heard the message and the mission of Jesus and maybe how we need to hear it as well. The pattern that we're going to identify this morning was and is this, that they were a people marked in their history from the beginning by a continual cycle of exile followed by restoration back to slavery and then freedom back to bondage and then deliverance hopelessness mixed with promise identity and mission among all the people of the world they were a people who knew who they were as the people of God and had a sense of mission but over and over again That identity and mission would give way to self-indulgence and sin, back to bondage and exile. All of that is the backdrop of Jesus' ministry and message such that if you talk to a first-century Jew about being saved, a term they probably wouldn't use, but I'm using it because we use it all the time. If you talk to a first-century Jew about being saved, they probably wouldn't think about being saved from hell then, sometime in the future when they die. They'd be thinking in terms of being saved from hell now, from exile, slavery, and hopelessness now. They wouldn't think just about going to heaven when they died then. If you use these kinds of terms, they would think about restoration and freedom and deliverance now. And they wouldn't think of this kind of salvation as being something that just happened once and then you're done. This kind of salvation, because of the story they lived in, was something that they needed to continually be experiencing over and over because they knew their story. That from their story, as the people of God, they needed restoration and freedom and deliverance in an ongoing way. Now, just keep in mind, as maybe I'm making some of you nervous, That's the way we would talk about being saved and the way they would talk about being saved. And the way I'm going to talk about being saved today is very different. They were the people of God. As you are and I am if you and I are in Christ. But though they were the people of God, they were still in this continual need of restoration. A continual need of ongoing repentance and deliverance. a continual need of being saved, in some sense, from their sin. They would have never thought of, you're done, ever. The thought of which prompts me to borrow a phrase I heard from Rob Bell in a series of sermons where he said that Jesus wants to save Christians. It's a rather provocative title. The point of which I think is this, that if the people of God, who actually are the people of God, were actually in this continual process of being delivered and being restored, being set free and being saved, and recognized that they really did need that, that maybe we would actually become the light of the world. God calls us to be. With all of that in mind, let me begin now to tell you the story that reveals this cycle that was just in the DNA of first century Jews. Actually, there's going to be three places that we will visit. Three places. It's very significant to any Old Testament person, Jesus himself, that embody this reality of cycle from exile to freedom. The first, predictably, is Egypt. A place of exile and slavery. A place where people knew in their spirit that we are far from home, cut off from our identity and our mission as a people, Egypt. or about Egypt as a type. Because beyond the fact that Egypt was a real place with real people who became real slaves, Egypt was and is a metaphor. And by first century time, Egypt would have been a symbol of at least two things, two kinds of slavery would Egypt stand for. And it does now as well. First of all, Egypt is a symbol of the bondage to sin that all of us experience individually. So think of Egypt this way, that all of us have our personal Egypts, places in our lives where we experience a kind of bondage to sin, where for over a period of time, there may be freedom in this area or that area, but there's an Egypt, and even as I'm saying it, you may be identifying that place in your life that is your personal kind of Egypt, this place where you never seem to really get free. And whenever you go to that place and find yourself kind of there for a while, totally helpless to get free from it, you feel far from home. You are in a kind of exile personally, cut off from the fullness of your potential and destiny, not only as a person of God, but you're cut off from your potential and your destiny as a human being. And you begin to wonder when you're in those places, how did I get here? How did I get so far from home? but Egypt is also a symbol not only of individual sin but of also systemic sins of injustice and bondage it's not hard to see let me explain it this way Egypt is also a place you see where evil gathers a head of steam in the context of a group or a system of people so Egypt is a symbol of a group of people who are being systematically, in a culture as it were, being systematically held down, held out, marginalized, oppressed, enslaved. That's Egypt. If you're trying to get a picture of it, think of religious systems that enslave Jesus. In Matthew 23, in fact, his whole ministry, but it really comes to focus in Matthew 23 when he comes to the religious system of his day and begins to confront it. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, who shut off the kingdom of heaven from people who are trying to enter. He is battling there a systemic Egypt, if you will, that is keeping people in bondage. There are political systems that systematically oppress people. There are economic systems, family systems, corporate systems, again, that systematically oppress. And in both cases, whether you're talking individual or systemic, what is needed to get set free from that bondage from that Egypt is a deliverer, a redeemer, a Moses, who in some way will fight for and provide freedom and deliverance, which is why, and just kind of work with the metaphor here, which is why on one hand we need a Billy Graham fighting for individual deliverance, personal salvation. That's part of the kingdom of God endeavor. But it's why also, if you understand the systemic piece, we also need a Martin Luther King fighting for systemic deliverance, for social justice, both of those things. Absolutely central to and consistent with the kingdom of God. In Exodus 3, it was God, through Moses, who provided this deliverance. Exodus 3, beginning actually in verse 6, that reminds them of who he is. For I am your God. I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who came to do this. It says in verse 7, beginning in verse 7, actually it says this. I want you to know this. I am the God of your father, your fathers, and I I have seen your affliction. I have heard your cry. I am aware of your suffering. So I have come down. This is incarnational language. It's the kind of language you expect to hear at Christmas. God came down, became a man. In Exodus, this is language of gospel in the Old Testament. So I have come down. I am getting now involved in this deliverance. to do what? To deliver you from and to bring you up and out and into a new and spacious land to bring you up and out and into an entirely different kind of life. Indeed, in Exodus 19, 4, God reminds them when he says, you yourselves know because you've seen what I did to the Egyptians. Stop right there. if you're a first century, what did he do to the Egyptians? What image would that conjure? You saw what I did to the Egyptians. Well, the last time you saw the Egyptians, they were where? In the Red Sea, drowned, which is a very harsh picture. Oh, God, he's being mean. What that does symbolically is give you a picture of what God thinks of systemic evil, of injustice to people. Do you remember a few years ago when we were doing the life of David, we came to Absalom and David, and Absalom, his rebellious son, became a symbol of a usurping, rebellious spirit that rises above authority. And Absalom ended up hanging by his hair from a tree with three spears in his heart. And I told you, if you ever want to know what God thinks of a usurping spirit, remember that image. If you ever want to know what God thinks of systemic evil, think of the Egyptians drowning in the sea. That's what he thinks. He hates it. Because it destroys people. Holds them down, pushes them out. Significant part of the kingdom of God and calling people out of exile is working for these kinds of things with that image in mind, that place understood. Let me bring you now to a second place of great significance. In this cycle of exile and freedom and back to exile again. And what it means and what it would have meant to a first century Jew to be saved, restored, deliver the place of Sinai. Pretty significant place in the life of a first century Jew. Sinai, where God says in effect this. And by the way, he says this to his church as well. He's not stopped saying this, it's this. I did not rescue you, people of God, from your Egypt in order for you to simply be an exclusive club of rescued people who just endlessly talk and sing about how wonderful it is to have been rescued. But I rescued and redeemed you from the individual and systemic bondage of Egypt in order that you would become rescuers and redeemers yourselves. That you would become a light beginning to shine in the middle of this awful darkness. The darkness of which we spoke of two weeks ago as I kind of gave you a picture of this culture of war into which Israel was born. Indeed, it's at Sinai that God gives his people two things. Number one, just remember this, if you forget everything else, at Sinai is the place where they got their identity, and number two, they got their mission. Exodus 19, verse 5, God says to them, for you shall be my own possession among all the peoples of the world. That's identity. You belong to me. The words we use now is you are the beloved of God. We are his people, his own possession. That's identity. verse 6, and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. That's mission. Now, some of us, when we think of kingdom of priests and a holy nation, we think of this group of people who are all separate and all sitting in church being priests and being holy. This is missional right here because a priest, whatever else a priest would say or do, what a priest does is help people, bring people to God. He's a mediator, as it were. Put their hand on people, put their hand on God and says, let me introduce you to each other. Priests are people who help people understand and see who God is and how you can know him. The prophet Isaiah said it this way when this mission became even clearer to him, Isaiah 49, verse 6, I will make you, Israel, O people of God, I will make you a light to the nations so that my salvation, my kind of deliverance, may reach to the ends of the earth. In other words, your salvation, your deliverance, your bondage from the bondage of Egypt, both individual and systemic, is going to be good news for the nations. Why? Because having been rescued, you will become a rescuer. Having been delivered, you will become a deliverer. And having become a people of my own possession, you will begin to show the world who the people of God really are and that through that they will come to know who I really am. See, this is weird, but even in the Old Testament, God was looking for a body. God was looking for a people that he could inhabit, as it were, be among and in the world be the hands and the feet and the eyes and the ears and the mouth of God. so at Sinai they get two things identity and mission so we're on our way at Sinai there's a real good thing happening here at Sinai no longer are we slaves the exile is over at Sinai we know who we are and we know why we're here so now with that in mind fast forward to the third place as we're doing this Old Testament overview that I want you to know about that ties into this cycle 1 Kings verse 10 where it looks like this whole thing is happening where they really are being the lights no longer in exile they are now in Jerusalem which means both in symbol and reality they're home the exile is over we're home we're in Jerusalem in the time of Solomon in fact where I'm going to pick this up is near the end of Solomon's reign it is still what they would all call the glory days so that now it looks like they're doing this light of the world thing. In fact, 1 Kings 10 verse 9, the queen of Sheba has come to visit Solomon and the reason she came is because she's heard and she's seen of these people of God and become interested and she simply reports back to Solomon what it is she's heard and what it is she's seen. Verse 8, 1 Kings 10, how blessed are your men, she says, Now, blessed are your servants who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom. Blessed be the Lord your God, who obviously delighted in you, she says, to set you on the throne of Israel because the Lord loved Israel forever. She could tell that the Lord loved Israel forever. She could see that and made you king in order to do justice and righteousness. Now, here's what you need to dial into. the queen of Sheba, simply by observing the people of God and how they lived could tell what their identity was and what their mission was. And what their mission was was to do justice and righteousness, that they would be a people who would have an awareness of and a heart for people among them, and even in the world who would be oppressed or enslaved or in need. And it's kind of what she simply knew about them by watching them. So again, at some level, in 1 Kings 10, this being a light to the nations was happening. But at another level, and at the same time, in 1 Kings 10, right around there, there's something beginning to crumble. And the cycle is beginning to turn because the people of God in this very same area, around 1 Kings 9, 10, 11, have begun to forget. And that's the cycle, their identity and their mission. Listen to 1 Kings 9, verse 15. And see, if I just read this, you can hear something that just strikes a very dissonant chord. It says this, Now this is the account of the forced labor which King Solomon levied to build the house of God, and his own house, and Milo and the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. Just read it fast. Did you notice anything that made you go, what? I hoped there was something that made you go, what? It's two words, forced labor. You know what that means? Solomon had what? Slaves. What is going on here? Anybody who knows the story is thinking, what? Having once been slaves, they now have slaves, all of which means, among other things, that they have now become themselves. And this is scary because it can happen to the people of God today. And in ways that it has, we need to notice and repent. But they have become themselves the very system of injustice and oppression that they had previously needed deliverance from. The oppressed people of God had become the oppressors. And the lights are going out. It's just amazing. Because in all of the Jewish festivals in David's time, and even today, the Jewish festivals, The key word throughout was this, remember. That's why they would have the festivals, and they would say over and over again, remember. Everything symbolically was to remember. Remember what? Particularly Egypt. That place was just in the DNA of every first century. Egypt was part of their identity. And part of what they needed to remember was what it felt like to be a slave. But by the time we get to Jerusalem under Solomon, they don't remember. And if they do remember, what they remember is that it's really horrible to be a slave. Much better to have them. Now we have the people of God in a power over posture. By the way, do you remember earlier in this talk when I told you that Egypt's sin symbolically had a systemic expression of oppression on the people, holding them down and pushing them out, and an individual expression. Well, in 1 Kings 9, what I just read you, we see there, what I just read you, is the systemic dimension of Solomon's sin. The people of God, his kingdom, had become a system that oppressed people. Now let me tell you, in 1 Kings 11, the personal and individual dimension of Solomon's personal slavery to sin. So we'll see both here. It starts in verse 1, 1 Kings 11. Now King Solomon loved many foreign women along with the daughter of Pharaoh, Moabite, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonian, and Hittite women from the nations concerning which the Lord had said to the sons of Israel, You shall not associate with them, neither shall they associate with you, for they will surely turn your heart away after their gods. Solomon, however, held fast to these in love. Verse 3, we find out that Solomon had 700 wives, 300 concubines, and it came about in verse 4 that when Solomon was old, his wives did turn his heart away after other gods, and his heart was not wholly devoted to the Lord his God as the heart of David his father had been. And when you pull this picture together, this third place that brings this cycle of God's people moving in and out of exile, The picture you get here at the end of Solomon's reign is that Solomon and the people of God had slowly, and it almost always happens slowly, they had slowly built a kingdom of comfort, complacency, and excess, where the top priority now was not being the light of the world. I mean, that wasn't even on a radar screen. The top priority now was their own pleasure and preservation and the accumulation of more, primarily because they could. Having forgotten their identity and mission as the people of God, they'd become blind to their own greed and their own sin. They had no problem at all using people. Having slaves. All this wealth, a sure sign of God's blessing. It's ours. We deserve it. Not only that, we need more. But the fact is this, that Solomon and God's people, keep in mind, they were God's people in 1 Kings chapter 10, are absolutely lost. And they desperately need saving. I'm talking about God's people. Luke chapter 12, Jesus tells a parable that I think has echoes of this story where he is confronting greed. The same kind of greed that we see in Solomon and the people of God at the end of his reign. Luke 12, 16 tells this story of a certain man whose ground produced a good crop, which is a good thing. There's nothing wrong with that. So he thought to himself, verse 17, self, what should I do? I have no place to store my crops. Something to dial in here too. Notice first that he sees these crops as being entirely his. Where do I store my crops? Keep also in mind something we've talked about in weeks previous in terms of historical realities and context. The level of poverty that existed in Jesus' day. And there's poverties everywhere. The rich were getting richer. The poor were getting poorer. The vast majority of people had no idea where their next meal was coming from in many cases. And this guy has more than he needs. And he's going, I have no idea. I have no idea. This guy's an idiot. Which is something God's going to say to him in a few minutes. He said again to himself, verse 18, this is what I'll do. I have a solution to my problem of what I do with all I have. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones. And there I will store my grain and my goods. And I'll say to myself, self, you have plenty of good things laid up for many years. You're set. Take life easy. Eat, drink, and be merry. Got a feeling he doesn't have a sense of his identity or his mission. And God says to him in verse 20, you fool. This very night, your life will be demanded of you. New American Standard renders that your soul is required. That word required is an interesting one. It's a legal term, and it refers to the paying of a debt, like a debt is being called. So basically what that means there is this. Your life, you need to understand, your life is on loan. I want it back, says God. And if you're hearing the story, you go, whoa. Indeed, as far as I know, this is the only parable that our rabbi Jesus ever tells, Where someone does something so despicable that it costs his life. So what did he do that was so bad? Well first, as I've already kind of told you a little bit, the level of poverty in Jesus' day would have made what he's doing here look like living in the middle of the Sudan. Where thousands of people, living in Darfur, thousands of people all around. You just look up and, whoa, there's some more. Starving in absolute destitute conditions. And you all of a sudden have all these resources. And living in that context, you have no idea what to do, you fool. Second, he then, again, he thought this stuff belonged to him. What shall I do with all my crop? Which God in the parable makes clear isn't true. The crop isn't yours. Not only, in fact, God doesn't say that. He goes further than that because all of us would go, yes, my possessions don't belong to me. We don't believe that, though we say that in church. We want to live that way. But God goes further than that. I'm not even going to do whether your crops belong to you. You don't even get it. Your life doesn't belong to you. I want it back. It even struck me that God in the parable calls him a fool. In Matthew 5, Jesus says, don't call anyone a fool. Apparently, he got an exemption here. I don't know what the deal is. Third thing, I don't know if you noticed it, but it says he thought to himself. Three times, three times. He thought to himself, he said to himself, which actually raises no flags at all for us. We think to ourselves, talk to ourselves all the time. But in Jesus' day, that would have sounded so bizarre. I mean, it would have been the first thing. He did what? He thought to himself? Because they so lived in community. That no one would be thinking to themselves, how should I store all this bounty? They would be wondering together, how do we distribute these resources? How do we leverage this? We got some bounty here. I mean, he would be so excited. He'd be going down to the gate and talking, you know, I got some bounty, and we can make a difference. Such an exciting conversation. I mean, these people would have gone, he thought to himself. Where does he live? Fact is, the question this guy is asking, what should I do with all my surplus? And the solution he comes up with, tear down my barns, build bigger ones for me, is an embarrassing question. I mean, if first century Jews would have been hearing that and going, what? Who would talk like that? The reason this is an embarrassing question and an embarrassing solution is because the only possible way you could ask that question, what should I do? And the only way you could come up with his solution, build more barns for me, particularly in the light of the overwhelming need around him, would be if you had managed to arrange your life in such a way that you literally didn't see anymore the need around you because your wealth had provided an isolation. You'd kind of been able to kind of build a wall around you. Because you were so wealthy, you could build a wall. And behind that wall, you could no longer see and you could no longer hear the cries of the poor. So you sit in your isolated, wealthy wall and ask questions like this. What should I do with all I have? I have, because you don't see and you don't hear. And God's really angry. Whoa. see this parable beloved is about a person it's about a people it's about a country it's about a church it's about people whose wealth made it possible to live in isolation separated from need blind to their own greediness which is why god calls him a fool you idiot that sounds kind of mean idiot. Interesting, in medieval times, the word idiot was used to speak of one who tried to live outside the village by himself. Sometimes the reason he was outside was because he was an idiot and they kicked him out. But an idiot was someone who tried to live in isolation. You fool. You just don't get it, which raises this question for me. Could this fool be us? Is it already us? I can tell you, I mean, anybody who was with us when we moved to Maple Grove, and by the way, what's scary about that question is if it is us, and we really are the fool in Luke 12, we wouldn't know because we'd be what? Blind. We wouldn't know. so we would need what God sent to Solomon prophets to say wake up well whether it is us or not is something I think we need to constantly be humble about and wonder about honestly but it certainly was true of Solomon in 1 Kings 10 so God sent the prophets he always sends the prophets he always does that and they said to Solomon what they always say repent repent comes from the Hebrew word teshuva which means to return and again the language here a first century Jew would hear it a little differently than us the word return would be come home people of God who know the story of Egypt and the story of Sinai where you got your identity and your mission from God repent means come back to your identity and return to the mission that I gave you as the people of God in the world because the further you go, Solomon, and the Solomons of the world, down that build your own empire for you road, the further you are from home, the further you are from your identity and your mission. So return, 2 Chronicles 36 says it this way. Verse 15, the Lord, the God of their fathers, sent word to them, listen to the grace here, again and again, the patience of God, again and again. he sent the prophets. Through his messengers, the prophets, but they continually mocked him. What are you talking about? Verse 16, despised God's words, mocking his prophets until the wrath of the Lord rose against his own people. First Peter talks about judgment beginning where? In the house of God. To call them back, to return from their exile. Well, those words mark the beginning of the Babylonian captivity. Because as you know, we talked about this a couple weeks ago, that soon after Solomon, the kingdom was divided. Soon after the kingdom was divided, they fell into the hands of the Babylonians. And that captivity was followed. They'd come out for a while, and then they'd get to Jerusalem, but then the Persian occupation came, and that was followed by the Greek occupation, and that was followed by the Roman occupation, and here we are. When 430 years after it all began, the cycle that started in Egypt and kind of came to Babylon is now in Jerusalem under the Romans, 430 years after that, a rabbi named Jesus came on the scene saying, among other things, this. In fact, in Matthew 4, it's the first words out of his mouth relative to his message of the kingdom. Remember the first word? Repent. For the kingdom of heaven is within your reach right now. repent which doesn't mean as N.T. Wright rightly points out in his book The Challenge of Jesus one that I really recommend to you if you'd like to go deeper in this understanding of exile language which it does not mean and the first century Jew wouldn't hear it in terms of a call to give up their private sins and get religion have some religious experience so it might have included that primarily what it means and what it meant to a first century Jew was return. I'm calling you again. Jesus, the rabbi, is calling them again to something they'd heard their whole lives. A return to their identity and mission as the people of God. For you, said Jesus in Matthew 5, are the light of the world. He wasn't making that up and saying that to the church. He does say that to the church now, but first century Jews would have heard that. I hear an echo. He's quoting Isaiah 49. He's reminding us of our mission, of who we are and why we're here. And he's calling them to return. But the big question in Jesus' day, as he wrote in on Palm Sunday on the foal of a donkey, the big question that would rise, maybe cynically, would be this, how? How are we going to return out of our exile? How are we going to get out from under Rome? How can we return to the fullness of our identity and our destiny when Rome is so big. Because still, the only solution they saw to their bondage was if Rome was crushed. And Jesus answered over and over, and it's why, we've gone over this for several weeks, many were amazed and interested in him, but when they heard his answer, they didn't like it. His answer was basically this, forget about Rome. I'm calling you to something, a different kind of life and become a different kind of people, whether your external circumstances change or not. So forget about Rome and follow me. And if you follow me, I will show you the way to return, to come out of your exile. For I am the way, the truth, and the life. I am the way home. And following my way is the way back to the fullness of your identity and the fulfillment of your mission, not only as the people of God, but as a human being because it's not just Israel who is in exile and needs to come home. Beloved, the story I am telling you this morning is the story of the human race. it is his lost creation to whom he is saying this phrase that we have kind of fallen in love with since we began the journey of the rabbi when the rabbi would look at people and go lost creation here's my advice come follow my way if you do they're all happy about Jesus few follow come follow me and if you follow my way of being and living in the world, I, if you put your feet where I'm put in mine, I promise you I will lead you up and out of your personal Egypt. I will lead you up and out into a land and into a life you do not know. But it's not a magic wand. You need to follow me. When people began to hear Jesus, first century Jews who had all this exile language. In fact, Philip was one of the first in John's gospel who, when he heard Jesus, he went and told his friends, he's the new Moses. He's the new Moses. And everything lined up. And one of the things you knew about Moses, if you were a person of God in Egypt and you were going to leave Egypt, you had to do more than go, Moses, I love you. You're great. You had to follow him. And if you didn't follow him, you never left. Are you saying we're not saved? No. These are the people of God. beloved Jesus' message of the kingdom was not just believe these three things about me and if you believe them you'll go to heaven when you die no it was more than that it was more like this you are lost and far from home so return and as soon as he would say return he would see the perplexed and maybe even despairing look on the faces of people and maybe on your face and then he would say something like this but you don't know how do you? You know you're lost. You know you're in bondage. You know you like a different kind of life but you don't know how. I know you don't know how. Well that's okay. Lechach aray. Come. Follow me and I will bring you home. I will bring you back to the fullness of your identity and destiny and mission not just as a person of God but as a human being who is becoming a person of God this is his call to the world all of that in mind let me close with a question where are you in the story this cycle of exile and return slavery and freedom having a sense of identity and mission then giving way to self-indulgence and sin keep in mind the three places we visited and maybe that will help you answer is it Egypt, Sinai, Jerusalem maybe in the days of Solomon where are you? Egypt that place of slavery personal and systemic Sinai that place of identity and mission where you're just full and gratefully so of the fact that you are his own possession. You are the beloved of God. Is that where you are? It's so good to be there. And a sense of your mission that God has made us a kingdom of priests in the light of the world. And then there's Jerusalem in the days of Solomon. That is the place of forgetting. There's the place of bondage. There's the place of identity and mission. And then there's the place of forgetting who you are and why you're here, where maybe even because of some success you became or we've become like the fool of Luke chapter 12, blind to the needs all around us. Here's the word of the morning. Jesus wants to save you. Jesus wants to save us from our sins, from our exile, from the fact that we have wandered far from home. So what's your Egypt? What's your place of exile where you feel far from home? And you don't know how to get back. Maybe even despaired that you could ever be free there. Well, if you, and by the way, if you have identified with that, you know what it is. You know what it is. and you know what if you're there maybe it's time for you to cry you know in Egypt I hear your cry when they went into the Babylonian captivity Psalm 137 they cried by the river and when the people of God cry out God hears and he says I have heard your cry I have seen your suffering and I have come down he will come down manifest life it's what he does. It's who he is. Jesus wants to save you from your anger and your rage that has enslaved you. Maybe it's an addiction of some kind that's enslaving you or a profound sense of how much you've just messed up your life. No idea how to get back. Can't put it back together. The rabbi says what he's been saying since the beginning of this series, Lechacharai. You can start. You can start leaving your exile. Come. Follow me. And I will bring you up and out and into a good and spacious land. A whole new kind of life. A couple weeks ago, I had the privilege, my wife came with me to go to Lionel Lakes Prison. And I was so excited to be there and so proud of our people. So many of you were there. Many of you were there, and you were there. And in fact, there are so many of our people who are there. I don't mean in prison, but they work in the prison. But, you know, we joke. Some of our people are in that prison because they've become... Lionel Lake's prison, I was told, has become known as Open Door North. Because they're around there and listening. And I met some men there. I was allowed to preach, about 250 guys there. But I met individually or in a smaller group with some men. And the picture I have as it relates to the sermon is these guys are in prison. They are in physical prison in Egypt of sorts. But as I listen to them talk, what I know about them, and I hope they get this tape, they will get this tape, and I hope they hear me talking about them. Because even though they're in a physical prison, they are following the rabbi out. and the picture that's so powerful about those guys who are part of the same journey we're part of but they're still in a physical prison their Rome didn't change they're still physically in prison but they are stepping out and into an entirely different kind of life because they heard the rabbi say come follow me and you can do that anywhere for others the place from which you need to be saved is Jerusalem in the days of Solomon so comfortable you're bored with a bloated sense of indifference isolated from any sense of need or pain around you you've forgotten your identity and mission as a person of God living in the world. Jesus wants to make you dangerous again. Remember when you were? Let me ask you some questions if that's the place you identify yourself as being in. When's the last time? When's the last time you rolled the dice for a kingdom cause? When's the last time you took a chance? When's the last time you spent more than you could afford to spend? for something other than yourself. Jesus wants to call you back to your identity and your mission, make you dangerous again and get you to wonder the way you used to about how, you know, there is some bounty here. I got some bounty, but how might I, instead of building a bigger barn and buying another one, how might I leverage this and how might I use this? message of the rabbi repent which means return how come follow me and as you do and as you learn to do that step by step he will bring us home he will show us how the journey home can start today for some of you today and if you would borrow the analogy of the prodigal which is if you now put the prodigal story into this story of exile it's all about exile language the guy who's gone far off that's Israel coming home to the father that's God saying welcome home but you got to go home but the journey home when it gets home he's met with a robe and a ring and a party to boot so come let's pray would you stand with me as we close oh my Lord the picture I have as I close is the picture I began with Palm Sunday you riding in on the colts of a donkey everyone singing Hosanna Hosanna and you were weeping because you knew they didn't get it. My prayer is this, that that not be true of us. That we are responding to our rabbi's voice who says, come home. Return to your identity and your mission as the people of God in the world. Give us, Lord Jesus, eyes to see, ears to hear, hands to help, and feet to follow, the way of our Rabbi Jesus. And all God's people said, amen, amen. I'm going to ask the altar team to come, prayer team to come and make yourself available to anyone who needs prayer, because some of you might need that, and you come and get it if you need it. God bless you as you leave. You're dismissed. Thank you.
