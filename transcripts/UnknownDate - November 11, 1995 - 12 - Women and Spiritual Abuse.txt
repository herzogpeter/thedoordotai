Yesterday, I believe God gave me something for this workshop. I was reading a newsletter from the Masters Commission, which is a discipleship training program for young people between the ages of 18 and 23 or 4, or something like that. And I was reading this wonderful article by a young man, and he was talking that the first book that they had to read in their training program was by A.W. Poser. Anybody familiar with him? Yes, wonderful. The Knowledge of the Holy is one of many, many publications by A.W. Tozer. And I'll just read this paraphrase from the article just to get you into the mode of the reflection, and then we'll go into a second. A.W. Tozer, in his book, The Knowledge of the Holy, states that a God who is infinite cannot be defined by any human trait or characteristic. To do so would contradict the meaning of the word infinite. God is beyond the definition of all we know. Our concepts of him do not constitute who he is. He exhorts us to go before God with an open heart. God is like a human race, but these things do not fully describe. So I'd like to invite you now to get just into a place of quiet prayer. The kind of prayer that I want to take you through is personal and quiet. Maybe you'd like to close your eyes to sit with old times. But just begin to let your awareness of all the other people around you drop your way and use this as a time to check in with God and be nourished by God. Isaiah 66, 13. As a mother conquerts her child, so I will comfort you. Let those words wash over you and over you keep on suffering. Let's feel it. As a mother, comfort your child. So will I comfort you. Some of you may have had negative experiences with mother. Go past that as you focus on it. Just with you. You may realize you can. As your mother comforts your child, so will I comfort you. Let God hold you. Now you may die. However you seek, if you seek with you, that's fine. If you seek with you, If you sing with your thoughts, begin to let God hold you as a mother with your heart. Be with another heart of God. Has she stroke your hair? Has she rocked you? Is she proud of you? Miss you? Thank you. Sing for you. Love your God. See her smile at you. in a way that communicates mother love. Like that. Do it. Begin to see yourself. Growing up with the mother's heart of God, watching change your age from a young age. Gradually, change the present. Watch your mother as a writer and as a writer. But then your mother comes. Father God says, I created you. I created you. Think about that. You as a man, I also created you. God, transcend us. And the you that is your spirit is created in the earth. God, you may see yourself as you reflect on the truth that you are created in your image. God says, I will never leave you. Never leave you. What does he say? Could a mother forget the child of her? Yes, even if she forgets, I will never forget. You are precious in your sight. You live the spirit of the motherly heart of God who wants the best for you. Who's biased in your faith. Who's on your side. Who befriends you. Just as another bear becomes the bear. I saw the mother inside of her. Beautiful. I created you and you were born. I wonder sometimes whether we be as women in our spiritual development with our churches throughout the decades that I've been in the world would have helped us know it's just something to wonder about as a woman I don't have a negative response to that at all I have a relationship with a father other women have lots of issues about that But I do think that there's an intrinsic message in the church that what is sacred is now. And what is holy is now. And I don't think that it necessarily is coming out of a malice or a loving heart that even is in the church. But it is something to conduct. How has that really impacted God? One, two. How has it affected me? And there's new love, when the prayers of this truth are more than it is gone. And most of the things that we hear in church are about the men. Like, how many of you know who or do you? Or purpose? But how come you don't know? How come you don't know? They're in the Bible. You know? So those are things to find. Would we as women have had a better chance at developing a relationship with the real God, the real Father and Mother of Jesus Christ? Yet, as we fill up, as we develop, this is just an intrinsic part of the teaching, the Sunday school, of the students. How would that happen? I don't have all the answers to that. But I believe, my hypothesis would believe that we would have developed into the godly women that God taught us to be a lot of shame. I think the lack of female energy of the sacred and female Christian language does not. And I think it's so strong, female power. Does anybody want to comment at all on the experience of praying in this way? I do have a comment, and then I'll address it. I do think that a male-dominant patriarchal church does hurt me. I do. So women are not the only ones that are being hurt by the lack of sacred feminine energy within the context of Christian. I'm not talking about the goddess movement. I'm not talking about new age, anything. I'm talking about the reality that it's in the scriptures and it's in the injustice. Yes, we're going to talk about that, yes. The comment was, didn't I put more things on the list of how we have to be accepted by God? Well, and you can't quite be quite, quite. Some instance of shame. Yeah, yes. I think we're highly better than we can. The person in the audience is mentioning is actually international. It may be international. I'm not sure. Organization, Christians for Biblical Equality, they have excellent publications that do address the scholarly issues. The biblical scholarly issues have a great deal of expertise. I'm extremely impressed with that organization. Thank you for being here. Anybody want to say anything just about the experience of the church? Yeah, it's not familiar. I agree. The comment from the audience was that he's not opposed to playing in that way, but it was hard because he's not used to it. I'm not used to it. Wouldn't it be a surprise if it's one Sunday if Dave started all of his prayers with mother? I don't even know if we can handle it. I just don't know. Yeah. There's imagery in Scripture like the one I just read with Abby Fishkin. They saw his mother. The person in the audience is concerned about the reality of the scriptures we preach about as Father, although she agrees that the scriptures where God refers to himself as mother as well. But it's just a difficult thing. I think I did a new line. You have a lot of stuff to talk about. It seems like we could do like an hour on this. Probably could. Maybe should. I think I did a new line. I'm going to attempt to say something biblically, scholarly, but give me lots of words. I talked to Dave about this, and these are the notes that I took from a conversation with Dave Johnson. So if you don't understand what I'm saying and you disagree, don't talk to me about it. I didn't tell him I could say that part. Just set up. I'm going to talk about submission and power struggles and stuff in a minute. And the scriptural thing to think about is that in Genesis 127, the scriptures say that we were created in the image of God both male and female. He says that the Greek word means them, it means both, to rule over everything, to co-reign, co-rule as man and woman over the earth. That that was the original plan. And then he said that in Genesis 3.16, the result of the fall is the result of the curse. and there is where it says you, the woman, will desire and then the Greek meaning of the word desire is tear down you will tear down your husband your desire will be for your husband and he will rule and the Greek means crush you what Dave is saying is that domination, male domination is doing the curse Think about whole workshops that are helping Christians to do the curse. Think about it. Works that have been written. Families that are trying to get that domination ordered, all in order, when a lack of equality in the relationship is about the curse. It isn't even the way that we look forward to. It's a key. That's a key. And Dave went on to say, and maybe some of you have never seen a preacher. I don't know how many of you are open-door people doing that. But when he talks on the phone, because I can't see his hands going out, he tells me what he's going to do. So he wants to make sure that I know. So Dave said, so right now my hands are, he said, God designed us to be one flesh. And he told me about life here, so I'm going with it. One flesh. This is how it was before the fall. Do I look like Dave a few years ago? This is how it was before the fall. and after the fall, then it started to come from Sunday, and that was the beginning of the college service. And as an Adlerian-trained psychologist, let me tell you, that's very neurotic to move into my field of expertise. Whenever there is a desire to lord it over, or dominate, or control, you have broken relationships, you have lack of intimacy, you have a never-ending college whether one person goes off and then the next person goes off, and then you have to think of a different way to get on top of that person in there, and then you have to think of a different way. So that's just a backdrop of some theological information as we move into the some of these issues. I'm going to share an abuse story. I'll just kind of lead into some of this, and then we're going to talk about the marital relationship a little bit and some of the abuse concerns in the Christian life. The story involves a young woman, who was herself an abuse victim, with sexual abuse with a family and emotional abuse with the entire group. Married young, was in a marriage with an abusive male, not physically abusive, but emotionally, emotionally, sexually abusive, and a non-believer. The woman got most of her moods mapped in church, with female parents, with her kids, developed all of her intimacy stuff outside of the marriage, because there wasn't much going on in marriage, She was more and more depressed, described a lot of internal pain and pain. So the women in the prayer group would regularly pray for her husband. But there wasn't much change. So the women in the prayer group decided that the woman should bless you the pastor because he's a spiritual head. And the counsel that he gives her will be the right to do something kind, something kind. So there's a setup. And I do want to underline that anyone at the church is a spiritualist. And there's an intergenerational problem. That the older women in the church, in many, many ways, do set up member names and spiritualism. So it's not just an individual. So the women in the church sent the young woman to see the pastor. And the woman tried to explain to the pastor how unhappy she was, how long she was, and how much pain there was inside of her. And the counsel that she received from her pastor was that he wondered if she had enough privileges. He really felt that God was telling him that she had some sexual problem. He couldn't really say what it was. He put himself up in a very mystical, all-knowing position that, while there's some sexual problem, suggested that the woman work on being more sexually available to the sexually addicted person. That she increased her lingerie wardrobe and that he really liked that in his way. And that that certainly should handle the negative. the woman took that information back to his court and they kind of just like didn't really talk about it and they were just kind of like, well, well, really? Well, do you have enough? Do you think that's what's going on? So then that woman was set up to be, to continue to be emotionally emotional. So that's an example of how the church I think that's that way now. There are all kinds of abuse. By the way, I forgot to say this. It's my belief that all abuse is spiritually abused. We are spiritually abused. That woman is spiritually abused, obviously. But most spiritually abused when you're children, when you're a physical animal, when you're a sexual abuse, it supports the development of the soul. The soul has to go into hiding. The soul is a pain. So all abuse. I didn't come to abuse. That's just the basic assumption that I have. Certainly we can use. Some of it as more obvious. Okay, so I'm going to just move out of that little story into a few points here. It just aren't necessarily directly related to that story. I think that's where it's going. But this is actually not a good one. Many people in evangelical and Catholic as well community are set up to believe that the woman is responsible for the hope and salvation. How many of you have ever felt that? Any of you? the message is women if you have an unsaved husband that is something you want you are doing something you want you better be nicer sweeter more neat more gentle you better do more of that because you should be one over you should be one to Christ by your conclusion that is that scripture is taken out of context and used as a cloud to leave women feeling responsible for something that God is responsible for. And God knows that. God knows that God's responsible for the relationship, and that man is responsible for the relationship. Those are the two that are responsible for the relationship. I think that there is a piece of truth that we as Christians do allow the light of God to shine through us, and it's attractive. And people are attracted by that. But it's misused and it's twisted around and the woman is left losing her life, praying for her unsaved husband. I cannot tell you how many women I have met who have lost years of their life, literally years of their life, trying to control something they can't control by praying, by fasting, by getting on the phone with six different girlfriends and praying some more, by praying over the bed, praying under the bed, praying around the bed, staying up at night. One thing is their life. What else could that, and of course I believe in an excessive care. It's one of my spiritual gifts. I'm not saying it should have been a sinful unsaved piece, but it's hard to be there. Most of us. But that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about a basic, abusive belief. You are responsible for the salvation of this one by your behavior. And the result is the man's turned off by the woman. Because she's so arrogant enough. He's saved. And the woman is mad at the man, but she's trying not to be because then he will never come to Christ. So she has to suppress all of that anger and all of that hurt. But she must just actually want to pick him up and shake him for heaven's sake. Don't you know you have 35 women praying for you 24 hours a day? More than a good day. It's not the grounds for us, I think, for much of it. And it happens a lot. It happens a lot, a lot, a lot. And there is deep, deep aim for the woman who is married to an unbelead. Deep, deep aim. I can't ask where the ministry needs to be. How lonely she is, how she is. How disappointed she is, how bad she feels. The questions that she must have somewhere inside the body of a man is to be. The question is just where her soul needs to be attended to. It's a codependent prayer format that's set up to control. Women are also set up, I believe, in the church in many cases, to be responsible for the husband's white fidelity. I actually very recently heard someone say that. I kind of thought that we were over that, but we're not. I just heard it in the last six months. A pastor say, you know, wives, you need to be free for a traditional, you need to be pretty. who needs to come home to someone he wants to come home to. He needs to come home to. How many of you know who the total woman is? How many of you want to come to a seminar I'm going to present on how to be the total woman? Yeah, tear the book apart. That's a scary, scary book. And those of you who aren't familiar with it, it's a book that basically says that in order to be a person to your husband, you should be a baby doll that's wrapped up in a ring. And there's a message here that if your husband strays or wanders, then you are doing feminine in marriage. And there's something lacking in you. I have, over my years as a therapist, treated for many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many marriages that have been involved with this. And I want to tell you that almost all the time, the woman has been taught. It's very rare in my mind. This is not what's going on. That's not what you have. Those issues have very, very little to do with the physical weight and makeup of their hairstyle in the age of their own. Certainly, you know, there's an argument for being good self-care in a particular issue, but that's a good one. So male infidelity or female infidelity hasn't had anything to do with your own. but there's a message that it does. But it does, and then I think women also then have set up not to talk about what's happening because they're good. If they have an unsaved, wandering husband, my gosh, they're just not walking with a message that they want to receive. Another issue is women being instructed to return to an abusing male and to give. To give as Christ could be. training at a teacher, having to do this training at a teacher, why don't you train at a teacher? And so, and you can always pray more and get a mom another church here. So that he'll start doing the things that he's doing. Women have been physically beaten up in an intimate life, and some women have died as a result of that. I know of one instance where women are. Thank you. and this was moments before his second invasion and he raised to the church and the Holy Spirit stayed in the house and then he was converted to death well I do believe God can save hands I do believe that but I would never never come to someone to do that I don't doubt that God's at Palatine but that's where he did And I believe that Jesus, of course, does call us to forgive, but forgiveness does not mean denial. Forgiveness does not mean pretending that what's happening is not happening. It doesn't mean not talking about it. It doesn't mean staying in a dangerous situation. It means confronting the evil that's going on, feeling it. And forgiving does not mean restoration of relationships. Those are separate issues in my mind. And there may be restoration of relationship, and certainly that's God's ultimate will for us all in the value of Christ's living. But there can't be restoration of relationship at the risk of one's life. And I want to add another piece about that. Also, emotional abuse. It's not. And we're quicker in the church to support a woman leaving an alcoholic husband or a violent husband than a woman leaving an anti-abusive husband because it's her being. Don't get proud of it. Those women die too. They may die by suicide. They may die by peace by peace in their spirit. So they have no support because you can't see it. It's invisible. It's invisible. But it's just as you can. What a huge, huge point. Thank you. Yes. He's sharing the reality that not all Christians are non-abusive people. And be careful about that fact. And in fact, I'll share two with him about that fact. One woman that I've treated was abused, sexually abused by her stepdad, which began right after they were baptized. So that's, yeah. Just because he was baptized doesn't mean that he would feel like this. That's a really good point. And you can be really naive if you think that just because someone's a Christian, that's a Christian. Certainly if they're a Christian, in my opinion, this is my opinion, when you're praying for a Christian, you get better results than you're praying for an unbelief. Anybody with a lot of prayer? I have. I just think the Holy Spirit's got something. That's a Christian. The last point here that I'm going to make is that women are held responsible for relationships in general. It tends to be a societal belief, not even just a case of belief. We as women somehow have signed up for the role, that we're responsible for the role of relationships. So if there's something wrong in the relationship, women tend to think it's something wrong. I do not do that. Somehow, they're boring, or the food's not right, or the conversation's not right. And I do think the church perpetuates that. And then again, it's a couple of topics. So if there's problems in your marriage, or problems in your relationship, with your boyfriend, or whatever, it's difficult to talk about. And that affects the culture and the abuse. Anybody want to comment before I go on? I'm going to talk about more dominance than one of them. She's talking about even top Christian speakers in the country today still trying to categorize women as the relation of people and men as the motivational people. How it's just building ideas and what a set up it is. The problems in your relationship. And, yeah, I agree with that. Yes. That's right. So ascribing all kinds of things to maybe the man with the knife just decided he didn't want to go to jail for the rest of his life. And the Holy Spirit is being given. That Holy Spirit was... Yeah. So to be, don't be vulnerable. Don't be vulnerable. One of my quotes, I'm on all these papers, is to accept the stuff to be vulnerable. Don't be vulnerable. That's how people get abuse sometimes. Okay, male dominance. I think women, certainly godly women, want to praise God, and if they're raised in a system of training or church where the message is male dominance, they want to praise God in the good section. The good section, which in me, in us, is one of the one. We are one of the one. And so we're going to figure out, we're going to adapt to the system. We're going to figure out a way to do it. So women who are insistence that teach about male dominance being a body thing, try to figure out how to adapt. And here's a couple of notes that I made about what happens when women adapt to that. And I'm open to people adding to this, but I just made a few notes. I think it creates just a huge ton of hostility, but it's a tough one. And so you have the woman. The woman is angry, but she can't express that. can deal with that, and most of the time it's fairly dissociated. She doesn't even know she's angry. She will have other symptoms. She has eating would be a very difficult one, because she's holding and holding and holding and holding. It's no wonder women have all the eating to do. They're holding me so much. Hostility has no other feelings related to that. And I also think it causes displacement over ages. So the woman who's got all that hostility going on is more likely to be my point is I also think a system like that creates divisiveness in the church I think that women are friends with women and men are friends with men and the two of the national two relationships that I believe are right and good and of God, the brothers and sisters, and the church relationships, are the same very much in this kind of system. You have a strong feminine side, you have a strong masculine side. And I think that's what's emotional and spiritual development because it's difficult. If you haven't ever really had a good friend with someone with the opposite sex, it's even difficult to have that friendship anymore. that should be a massive part of development. Non-erotic, non-sexual involved here. I think that that kind of system creates isolation and intimacy problems, including intimacy with her. A woman may feel sentenced to a lifetime of loneliness in a marriage, a particular situation, because the church is supporting behavior from her husband that leaves her lonely, empty, and unfulfilled. Somehow she's supposed to figure out a way to be okay with her and foolish. And she's really inside probably not okay with her, but believes that she is okay and there's all kinds of dyslexia, syncytology, that person. It creates, too, because it's suppressed hostility, this is a hard word to say, inauthenticity, consequently there's no way to see the woman and the man as well and have a whole bunch of trouble doing real enough to be able to get closer. And that, in my opinion, is wrong. So that's part of the spiritual reasons. Anything that gets in our way of our relationship of intimacy with God is spiritual. I think that it creates a distorted relationship with God, And God is seen as controlling, commanding, and probably God has a living in the world. And that's not that. That's not that. I don't know where it says this in the Bible, maybe somebody else does, but I know it says it in the Bible. That Paul says crafting God out of our experiences that we have with human beings is not even a distorted God. It's not even a distorted God, it's a total false God. That's a really scary concept. If you think that maybe there's whole church systems out there leading people to worship a pastor. Whoa, I don't even know where to go. I wonder if it's happening. Oh, yeah, yes. Just when the audience is bringing up the reality that churches tend to be so family-oriented that single people get just really black in the past a lot, a lot of times. And we're even discussing some of these. We're almost seen as male people. We're determined that. And in a male dominant church, the female women are set up to have female friends. The female is set up to have male friends. And I don't think that's necessarily good. I think a male dominant church sets women up to be childlike. And women that are childlike are easily between us in the world at night. Easily, easily, easily. Vullible, remember I mentioned vullible? I think that's a part of your child life. Not really knowing what's going on, not really knowing how to accept the situation, to remain in multiple, sexually, physically safe. So, you do that in a year. Well, you are touching on something that's on one of my pages here, and I'm just going to jump in and say this, because I'm just fired up by what you just shared. Tell me where in the gospel that Jesus Christ glorifies domestic activity. Would someone please tell me that? Where does Jesus Christ ever give a specific connection to women as women in the Gospels? In the Gospels. In the Gospels, Jesus Christ intergambles the fact that there is a human. Think about the biblical gospel. When a woman is in a human, he doesn't think that there is a human being. The nature of the kingdom of God. He uses a piano like a man talking in a mask. She's a beautiful woman. You should have a picture. Got it. Um, oh, she was talking now. She's an aunt. Okay. And when he talks about putting aspects of care, she just talks about the woman who was persistent with the unjust. And between men and the girl, she and her mother. Thank you. What the person in the I was sharing about was the disappointment in the female vision of how this could be started in her searching and the other issues identified the workshops identified the women had to do with hair styles and and how how and how virtual it is for her to be viewed as a radical feminist, because she's a feminist. Yes, the stereotype being a feminist. It's kind of special, isn't it? Sometimes I don't want to keep it. Sometimes I do. So subtle messages on how we are to be, and how long we are allowed to be, how we, and those kinds of issues. Certainly, if you have a mother or a father, those are really just to evaluate. If you have put each other in some space, if you have to decide whether you do that to your family. You're in your husband, you're in your family system. You're in your support. You're in your support. You're in your support. You're in your support. You're in your support. Okay, I see. Can you see if I can take a few of those things? Another topic. Big, big topic. in this period of history, of course. The church tends to teach this Christian abuse. It's a Baltimore community. I think that's Baltimore community. And I'm going to talk a little bit about what happens as a result of that. And because I work so much with abuse, obviously, I'm going to see this in my world, but I see really what I would describe on this is Christian. I'm thinking of these people that are really being used. I mean, systems that are good, closing things, and all the solutions. But what I see is like dissociation and abuse. So you might see someone come sliding to their chair or two on Sunday morning and they're only going to cut you there because they're expecting to be used. And they're going to step out of that and she'll be touched. So the half present or quarter present or the ace present during the relationship. Because that's how they help the CQP. If you can't talk about the things, if you can't have any feelings, if you have less feelings happening in the CQP, or anything, or whatever else you're going on in the CQP, you can have to do something with that. It's to cut in the last year, and it's removing the cells. So many now we associate with this type of thing with you. Those are two things that help you know what you're saying. So, by the way, is an inclusive class. So you might very well see the profile of PTSD. Someone who's an abusive kid, they may have an inclusive class about how they're going to happen. They're doing a particular thing. They don't know why they're there. They don't know where they're going to come. They have to look real hard to get them back down and realize the most particular, whatever. But pushing back inside, they may have disturbing dreams. They may have disturbing facts. And not only in the association. I just just said, what I see is that people have experienced experience with them. So that's something that I can say. Especially in the feelings, along with reading to association and non-men also, people who don't know what's going on inside, people who have checked out and told me I'm more likely to hear. So my opinion is not emotional. In a few situations, there's no abuse in people. In Sunday school, I'm not home. I'm not self-abuse. So the very first self-abuse is my life. The next point I have is to give a little topic. I'll just say it the way I say it. I think that in most pictures, feminine ways, typical feminine ways of life. I know you're concerned because we can be advanced about that, but typical feminine ways of life. And when I say that, what I mean is just a way of meaning this. with you, knowing but not knowing how you know what you know, knowing if you feel is very much discomfort. So in my opinion, that's the size of people to protect themselves against abuse. Most people with a history of tragedy abuse actually have very poor, poor, sensitive They know. They know what they know. They know how they know. But it's all mixed up in a lot of mistakes. Because of people who are interested. They don't do that. If you think about a person who grew up in a family where there was emotional abuse, and he couldn't believe, he couldn't listen. He couldn't believe it for 15 years. He was lying. He couldn't really listen. He could just go blind. And there was physical abuse. you had to stop feeling much and then doing a lot of your body. The sexual abuse, you had to live out of your body. Some of these things are still a place to do that. I think that way of knowing is not just sort of a piece of the thing in your mind, but also what we call a not-coming way of knowing. And then, too, this is something that you can do. And that's what you're saying. So they can walk into an abusive situation, something you try to do, let alert, let alert, let alert, don't do this, don't do this, but they've been freeing to dissociate from that. They forget, evaluate, how do you do what's happening? This part of the morning has been accepted. And they cannot. And I'm studying in the morning with other leaders of how I see it. And they need to have an alternative to the community, because I can be a particular community. I believe it's the result of churches being afraid of emotions and being afraid of family and family. Also, in the church, there's a discussion between the covert and the elderly system about not that. So what's out there is what's happening inside. It's kind of more of the same of what I just said. But the kidney system, sometimes in a dysfunctional family, when I work with people, It's a totally different thing than what is the image of the world. And there's a community connected message over the out there system. Don't pay attention. Don't pay attention to what's invisible. What's invisible? What you see is what you see. And that does how you set up your view. To set up the young people who do this and they're being dated. Because they know what they love, but they know what they love. They don't know. It's huge. Also, in a church with lots of feelings, women have to be selfish to a point that they tend to come out of how old people. So we don't have a process of that. That makes for a real boring person. It makes for a real boring person. And I believe that also is the spirit of God. I believe that God is now. And I believe that is the spirit of God. And it's your tip that teaches how to do it. You'll have the points that Jeff has about in the use of systems, and I'm glad I'm a little more to that. The points I just went through really quickly because I knew that you were going to be about cross-power, cross-leadership, not leadership. But God has raised that, but the Holy Spirit comes out of leadership for people who have power. You'll have submission against the world, can you? In the use of systems. I'm sad I'm going to use that. Thank you. Lots of unspoken rules. We want to talk about problems. Cancer or fear. We want to check out your perceptions. We want to talk about what you're feeling and experiencing. We want to choose to talk about a healthy system. We want to talk about what you see, what you see, what you hear, what you hear. If they match, they're talking. And if they don't, then nobody else will validate that you're not in the opposite direction. If not, that's the greatest place to be. And that kind of environment, you're not going to need to set up for it. Think about, you know, the young woman coming in to see the abuse of pastor who can relate to her children. No pastor to be on, no pastor to see, no pastor to feel. We must be on it. We're going to pray. We are not. We should suffer. We have it. Okay. I also think you can share people that are afraid of the expression, the part of the expression. There's a mix about that, but we can make that happen. I mean, I know that there's a piece of truth there, but there's a piece of just craziness there about I don't think the Jews necessarily have the corner on the castle anymore than a private piece of it, but to ignore the part of who you are as a human being is a very Jewish. I think we need to learn how to defend and be a emotional state and make decisions based on that reality as well as the cognitive reality and put the two together. There's a cutoff right here in the church. It's a glory, this whole place, where the feelings have. Feelings certainly are connected to, possibly connected to issues in your life that might distort your perception. You should be able to talk about it and figure that out. You should be able to talk about it and figure that out. You know, the way that people feel is not just going to be this kind. So that would be my good experience. It's not a black and white thing. Let's just make a quick commercial for boundaries. God has boundaries. God sets himself up as a musician. We are not God. God is God. We are his creation. We separate. That's what we come together. God, I believe, respects boundaries. I believe God, a body of boundary stance would include that a person has physical, spiritual, emotional, and mental boundaries. And I think our church systems have turned away to students. I would invite you to reflect on, I'm just going to give you a look at that time. What do you experience when you set boundaries? Do you have a look at that issue? What are your beliefs about that you have? What do you really believe if you think that maybe God's asking you to teach the faith and Bible experience? We've touched on major issues. There's so much here. The teaching issue is a big one. When we're teaching in the church, we're in our nation's room. It's a big, big issue. One that I firmly believe is about. That's my son. And I'm not going to defend it for the case. That's my son. And I know because I know in so many ways that I am. But other people have a different, a different sense. And I think that that's a very important topic. But it's time to cover them off the bed. It's time to cover them. I would encourage you to begin to think about a new private chair, taking your bathroom space to care, and assuming you're going to come. Just to let yourself. And drink that in. See what happens? That's nice. To let yourself in. And see what happens. To watch them. So, dearly, I would invite you to do that. Oh, yeah, okay. I'm just going to put the names and authors of these books that I brought on tape. Woman of the Word, Art of the Story by Mary Lee, S-L-E-E-V-I. Just a little reflection. Sisters in Practice by the same author. Woman Gifts, little fair reflection. If you read this book, you'll find out who's B.B. is. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm the author of Women's Gifts. There's one more over here. This is more of a theological discourse. The books that I just showed are reflected. I'm making this. This is media. This is family and family is in a conversation. It's kind of right. I had published a book. Keep in mind, I had a few more. You might be able to just read it and read it, but I just kind of show up. I'm not enjoying it necessarily because I haven't read the whole book. I think it's a little bit different. Okay, so we need to move into the closing of the book. I would just invite you to, again, be with yourself. I would just let these words minister to you. This is coming from the book, Women of the World. I'm going to read it through, and we're going to just pray it through, and then I'm going to quote the scripture. We'll read the scripture here. A woman at the wall. An enduring, enduring future of an anonymous woman is that she didn't apologize for the sake. Jesus, I live from a long hatching, sat down, along by a wall. A woman with a jar came by to go out. Giving a drink to the opening, he opened that sinker to give me a drink. He surprised her by sleeping, and she was just as polite. Why is it that you asked me to sink in the drink? When silence was broken, he was in a small water. Among his two men who bypassed the water, water in the jar of a snake in the room was considered in a pure. Your eyes are not downcast. Your look at us, who are you? It is an ongoing dismay. It is an ongoing dismay. It is a relationship that breaks through strength or safe or shallow communication. Jesus, the outsider, was cursed among the priests. evangelizing outside, a woman. One without identity was among the first person she told her to be honest. And one of the biggest ones was the beginning of an investigation. The man who thought about the awkward part, the living of God. Amazing, fastened her eyes, and a key. A skeptic well acquainted with the ways of religious, she invaded his awkward place. Warily and wearily, she brought her real everyday earthy body, and she stayed with the dialogue and even picked it along. Then we spoke to truth about her lifestyle, and we did it to the world. It was a time to talk with the bunch of sacred places, and he went beyond his spirit and truth, and struck her at the core. I know the Messiah is coming, she went to. The woman of the south is the open vessel of the King Jesus, the Lord of God, with God. I, who is the spirit of the King. There was a consecrating word, the scripture saw to the spirit, come through with the darkness, where she beheld the Son, a brown star, walked through the night of the Holy Spirit. How much the world of excitement, Unwetuous, this place did this land as an offering of gifts. And she traded it in and she drank it on me, living water in the tree. But perhaps, this water could ever be in the land. Entrusted, she was frustrated. And for more, she stood in this place, the greater risk was lost. She left the water jar, ran up, she ran up to bring back the town. Jesus needed that promise, though. It was pure, extraordinary confession. You need to destroy the woman in your eyes. I thought this was not the truth. I'm sure you have been a great person, but you have been a great person. You have been passing through the lips that you have been a man. But then, did Jesus ever meet a woman when he started growing the lips? Waringness has been found since the old well everywhere, almost as long as salvation is found. A monarchy identifies all of us who are tired from the beginning. There's a well at a genesis where there's Jesus. Who are you, Lord? Who are you, Lord? Give me a hand. In the close ear, this feeling tonight, you are a chosen man, a royal Christian, a holy nation, God's own people, and other that you may proclaim the mighty acts of faith to call the out of heaven into his own name. Thank you.
