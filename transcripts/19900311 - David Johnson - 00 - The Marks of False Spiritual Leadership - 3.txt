Matthew chapter 23, we're picking up our study in verse 13. Most of you are aware of the fact, if you've been here these last few weeks, that we find ourselves in the middle of an incredible drama, a tremendous amount of tension. It is the final week in the life of Christ. It is Wednesday of that final week. On Friday, He will be put to death on the cross. Specifically in chapter 23, we find ourselves in the courtyard of the Gentiles, and that is in the temple. He has come to the temple, that is, Jesus has come to the temple, the day after he has cleansed the temple. The fact that he came back has absolutely enraged the scribes, the chief priests, and the Pharisees. And in chapter 22 and chapter 21, they assaulted Jesus with every question and every device they knew to try to somehow separate him from his following and discredit him. But by chapter 22, verse 46, it is clear that he has silenced all of them. And as we came to chapter 23 a couple of weeks ago, it became very clear that while the Pharisees and the chief priests were finished, Jesus wasn't finished. In fact, it's as if in chapter 23, He begins with an assault upon the Pharisees that is unmatched in any of the other Gospels or anywhere in Scripture. With the Pharisees and the scribes, all of the leaders standing there, He begins to warn the disciples and the multitude, again in the context of the temple courtyard area, he begins to warn the disciples and the multitude relative to the marks of a false spiritual leader, the marks of a false spiritual system. It may be that one of the most significant things we've learned over these last two or three weeks in verses 1 through 12 is that the marks of a false spiritual leader or system are not that hard to spot. We have a tendency to believe that they are hidden in such a way as that the only way for us to respond is to be shocked when the evidence of falseness is sometimes or at some time finally disclosed. What we have learned is this, that while there is indeed deception involved with false systems and false leadership, there are indicators that we can see. There are signs. There are visible. They are clear. They are objective. They are also revealed in verses 1 through 12. The first sign of a well without water, a false leader, is found in chapter 23, verse 2, when it says the scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses. The chair of Moses, if you recall, is that place of authority. And the basis of their authority, that they placed themselves in that position of authority, was not that they were saying true things. Their basis of authority was not that they were right. Their basis of authority was not that they knew the Word or being sensitive to the Spirit. Those all would be adequate and legitimate bases of authority. Their bases of authority was on the fact that they held the position. They had the rank of a Pharisee. They had the rank of a scribe. And because I am the Pharisee, I am the one who has authority. And they didn't have to be right. Transferred to today, it would be as if someone would come and say, because I'm the elder, that's why. Because I'm the pastor, that's why. And it's a wonderful system because you don't have to be right. You don't have to be sensitive to the spirit. You don't have to say the true thing. You just have to hold the office. And when you see that kind of attitude in a system, in a church anywhere, even if the theology might be correct, if that attitude is there, you are dealing with the seeds of a false system. Run. Do not pass. Go. Do not collect $100. Get out of there. That's the first sign, the little indicator. The second indicator was in verse 3 of chapter 23. They lack integrity. They lack congruity in their lifestyle. They say, but do not. And oftentimes we discovered, as we discovered in our study, that there is even a double life going on that we find out about after years of deceit. The third sign is that they tie up heavy loads on people, verse 4. Put them on their shoulders. Don't do anything to lift off those loads. The loads that they put on people are the loads of legalism, external performance to get your value from God is something you have to earn. And they constantly put that load of guilt and shame on people. and the system and the way it works is this, that with that load on you, I can control you and manipulate you and move you to do what I want you to do. And so we put the load on people. Legalism and performance is not the only load that the Pharisees would put on people. Another load was, remember, that role reversal issue. Rather than the shepherd being there for the sheep, the load would be put on the sheep being there for the shepherd. And the shepherd would begin to shear the sheep and use the sheep to exalt him or herself. use the sheep to advance his kingdom or her kingdom and not at all be using the resources that God has given to build God's kingdom. They tie up heavy loads. That's one of the ways you can spot a false system. Does it feel heavy? Is the burden getting heavier? Is it all up to you? Or is the burden constantly being lifted by the power of grace and the power of the Spirit? And are we constantly being pointed to Jesus as our only hope? Or are we giving each other? Or I give you yourself and your own effort. as the bearer of the load. That's a false system. Another sign is verse 5. They wear their religion on the outside. They do all their deeds to be noticed by men. They broaden their phylacteries. They're very interested in creating an image of spirituality. Once they have created that image of spirituality and external piety, they then spend a lot of energy protecting their image. And what has happened is that there has created a system where it is more important that you look spiritual than you really are spiritual. And you've maybe been in systems like that. It's something that is in your spirit. You can't even put words on it, but you just are constantly projecting this image, hoping you look good rather than be real. It's a sign of a false system. Jesus identifies it here. Not only do they wear their religion, verse 5, but in verses 6 through 10, they require the accolades of men and women. They love the place of honor at banquets. They love the chief seats in the synagogue. They need that stuff. Respectful greetings in the marketplace. Being called rabbi, the Latin equivalent, was doctor, reverend. They need that stuff. Titles, degree recognition are very important. A lack of humility. In verses 8 through 12, Jesus says to the disciples, Do not be like that. Those are all marks of a false system. As we approach verse 13 through verse 39, What I want us to see is Jesus taking this entire issue of false leadership in the church, false leadership in a spiritual dimension, and he takes the whole issue a step further. He does not let up when we come to this verse. In fact, in verses 13 to 39, what I hear him saying is this. I have already identified to you what a false system looks like. Now I want to indicate to you the impact that those false systems have in the lives of people. The reason I think he's doing this is to take people to a place where they are not allowed to minimize the danger of the characteristics we've talked of these last couple of weeks. That they are forced to look at the impact these things have. What I believe Jesus is making clear in verses 13 to 39 is that when we see these characteristics, as I've already given you in verses 1 through 12, we are not talking about subtle differences of ministry style. We are not talking about maybe a guy's got a different approach. That's okay. We're not talking about a subtle difference in direction or even a difference in personality, as if to say, hey, you know, we maybe do things a little differently, but we're all on the same side. What Jesus is saying in verses 13 to 39 is this. When you see the characteristics I have described in verses 1 through 12, we are not on the same side. These characteristics, when they are in a system, when they are part of the leadership, do more than just cause an irritation. They are not just a benign thing. They shut off the kingdom to people. Let's read our text. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees. He is directing his attention to directly the scribes and Pharisees now, but be keeping in mind that the multitudes and disciples are still there. So even his confrontation directly on the leadership is for the multitudes and for the disciples. You shut off the kingdom of heaven for men. you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows' houses, even while for a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore, you shall receive greater condemnation. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel about on sea and land to make one proselyte convert. You evangelize. But when he becomes one of you, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourself. whoa we're not going to get any further today than verse 13 I wanted to go through verse 15 so you could get a flavor of the tension that is involved in this text this is not a happy word but it is a vital one let's pray as we begin Father God as we come to this text again that has begun to emerge as a very important series we want to receive it as I think it was intended, and that is to be a warning to us, to be protected from that which is false, but also, God, that we would be protected in our own spirits and in our own movement in the kingdom from having even the seeds of the characteristics in verses 1 through 12 from beginning to take root in any of us. And Father, as we go through these things, we want to be wise as serpents. We want to understand where systems like this need to be resisted, but we also want to be open to the ways in which we let this rebuke fall upon us as well. For our own purity, for our own health, and moving in the kingdom life, we pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. It is very clear from the very beginning, and then all the way through verse 39 that Jesus is not spending a lot of energy trying to be diplomatic in this section. He is not spending a lot of energy trying to be nice, trying to say it just a certain way so nobody gets upset. He's not trying to tickle anybody's ears. I don't see him using a text like this to be the background for a book on how to win friends and influence people. Pretty straight talk is what we've got here. Through verse 39, he calls these false systems and he calls the the leaders or the perpetrators of these false systems, such things as blind guides. He calls them fools. He calls them sons of hell. He calls them murderers and sons of murderers. He calls them serpents. He calls them a brood of vipers, sentenced to hell forever. He calls them hypocrites. He calls them hypocrites seven times. You hypocrites, you hypocrites, you hypocrites. I think they got the point by the end of this section. Hypocrite is a Greek word. Hupakretos refers to an actor on a stage. Barclay had an interesting insight on this in simply calling them theatrical, having theatrical goodness, theatrical goodness. Now that kind of projects certain images of someone with theatrical goodness. And the problem with these people who were perpetrating this system of external performance, putting a load on people, a false basis of authority, was that they had played the role of external religiosity so long that they never got out of the role. Do you understand that? their whole life was playing the role, so they even got deluded into the fact that they were playing a role. They actually began to believe it themselves. So not only were they deceivers, but they were themselves the deceived. Preceding all of these indictments, preceding all of these words of condemnation to this kind of system and people is a little phrase, woe to you. seven times again woe to you the greek is interesting in this particular place woe is an onomatopoeic word an onomatopoeic word is simply a word that sounds like its meaning there really isn't a specific meaning it's like a bee goes buzz and the buzz is the sound it makes woe is an onomatopoeic word like that i can't even accurately say it i don't think it sounds something like this way that i mean it's weird but it's way like that it's a guttural sound from the inside of a man or a woman's spirit it is a painful sound the hebrew equivalent of this is hoy meaning to howl you people who've got this false basis of authority it isn't based on truth it isn't based on sensitivity to the spirit it's just because you're the pastor you have who are operating on that you who are putting heavy loads on and not taking it off with the power of god's grace and the reality of his spirit, you who have this external religion who are perpetrating this phony baloney, broadening your phylacteries, projecting his image, you get the howl of God, the howl of God to you, the inner painful guttural response of God to you. And all of that is designed to fully establish how deadly serious the things we have described in verses 1 through 12 really are. They cannot be minimized. So all we're going to have time to deal with this morning is that people and systems with the characteristics of 1 through 12, verses 1 through 12, shut off the kingdom to people. They shut off the kingdom to people. In dealing with the verse, I just want to take it a phrase at a time. The first one is the one I just gave you. They shut off the kingdom of heaven from men. Literally, shutting off there simply means to slam the door in the face of those who are trying to make entry. Making entry impossible. They are slamming the door in a person's face, making entry into the kingdom impossible. I think the word kingdom here is significant too. The word kingdom here means the rule of God, the reign of God. We've known that from a previous study in Matthew. The word kingdom here means the sphere of God's rule. What's significant about that that we need to just intersect with is this. Jesus is not saying here, you Pharisees, you people with a phony religious system, have not shut people out of your synagogue. You've welcomed people in your synagogue. In fact, you guys are very zealous in converting people to your religion. Verse 15 says that. You travel about on sea and land to make one little proselyte. You don't want to go and lift their load. You don't want to give them life. You want to add them to your number so you can feel better about you. you haven't shut them off from your synagogue you haven't shut them off from your church you want them to come to your church and you want them to to be bound up by the same legalistic weight that you're living under understand that he's not saying they're shutting them out from church membership they're shutting them out from religion they're shutting them out from some form even of christianity It doesn't say that. It's shutting them out from really ever being able to experience the vibrant, alive, joyful, free, powerful reign of God. You are shutting people out from the reign of God. You are shutting people out from experiencing the rule of God in a church, in a tabernacle, in a synagogue, in their individual lives. because what is ruling their lives is overbearing leadership, legalistic performance, and external religion. None of that speaks of the reign of God. When I think about this concept, what dawns on me is this, that a lot of people have experienced church, a lot of people have experienced temples, synagogues, religion, a lot of people have experienced some form of Christianity, with the word Christian on it. It's significant. It doesn't say Christian. You know, I don't have time to develop all these things. My brain just goes nuts sometimes in terms of all the different directions it wants to go. That's why I write things down. I mean, we don't even know what Christian means anymore. Everybody's a Christian. Lots of people have experienced some form of Christianity, some form of church. What we need to hear right out of this text is this. If your experience of church, if your experience of the temple, if your experience of religion, if your experience of some form of Christianity has come in the context of verses 1 through 12, meaning this, come in the context of a false basis of authority, if it came in the context of laying heavy burdens on people and not lifting it off by the power of the Spirit and the work of grace, if it came in the context of an external focused performance, broadening the phylacteries and projecting an image, You have not experienced the free joy, power of kingdom, reign of God, life. That's a scary thought. What you have experienced in the context of the church, religion, some form of Christianity, is a false authority. What you have experienced is an external performance. And what you have experienced is false religious pride. It's very interesting to me, again, somewhat troubling, that Jesus in this final sermon, he's about to die in two days, and giving us one of the last things he wants us to know about and be warned about. He doesn't come to these Pharisees and scribes and warn us about their flabby theology. This is one of the little pieces we get because we've been in Matthew for three years. And so we know who the scribes are. We know who the Pharisees are. From chapter 2, we discovered something about these scribes. Their theology was good. they had a good theology remember when Herod came to the scribes and asked them about this prophecy of a king to come they came and gave the biblical answer they always knew the biblical answer they just didn't know God she's gonna be an amen her she grows up You know why they shut off the gates to the kingdom of the people? Well, obviously because of the characteristics that we've seen. But I'll tell you why they shut off the gates, because they haven't entered themselves. That's the next phrase. Look at that. For they do not enter in themselves. When you see systems and people described consistently with verses 1 through 12, Number one, that system or those people will shut off the kingdom from you. Number two, they will not experience it themselves. And that is why they shut off the kingdom. That is why, you see, they have a false basis of authority. When you see somebody going, huff and puff, I am the pastor, that's why. That means like a neon light. I don't have authority. That's why I'm huffing and puffing. If I had authority, I wouldn't have to get big about it. It's incredible when you're moving in the truth. You just kind of say the truth. If people like it, they do. If they don't, they don't. You can just kind of hang on to the truth. The reason they're tying heavy loads is because they're under a heavy load. The reason their righteousness is external is because they don't have internal righteousness. If they had internal righteousness, there would be external righteousness as well, but it wouldn't be a show. It wouldn't be a performance. There wouldn't be actors on the stage broadening their phylacteries so that you would know how very spiritual they are. Wouldn't be acting, they would be real. Why would somebody put a performance out here? Why they would would be because it's not real in here. When he says they have not entered in themselves, he is explaining to us why they perpetrate the system that they do. They can't give away what they do not have. Back off this a minute and just think. this is really scary it's really big let's put ourselves in the courtyard of the gentiles right now Jesus is saying to the religious leaders of his day you shut off the kingdom to people and you haven't entered in yourself and the people I have a feeling my impression is that Jesus in the minds even of the multitude at this point is maybe going a little too far no come on Jesus I mean I can see why they irritate you a little bit but I think you're going a little too far here maybe. I even wonder if the multitude is beginning to pull away from Jesus now. By Friday, they're going to want him crucified. See, Jesus, you don't understand, these guys have run the show. You're saying they aren't even in. These guys have made the rules. They have been the ones all our lives who've kind of had us under their thumb and told us who was going to come in and who wasn't and who was doing it right and who wasn't. They are the operators of the door and you're telling us they're not in the door. Jesus is saying here they are not the operators of the door. They made you think they were the operators of the door and the controllers of the door because verse 2 they seated themselves in the chair of Moses. They put themselves in a position of authority but they didn't know God. Romans chapter 2 we see the very same dynamic. Just so you know, it's not like a one-shot thing. Speaking of false teachers, he said this, but you bear the name Jew. Update it. But you bear the name Christian. And you rely upon the law and you boast in God and you claim to know his will. And you approve the things that are essential being instructed out of the law. You're very confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness. You think yourself a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth. What a guy you are. Therefore, you who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You preach that one should not steal. Do you steal? You preach the law. Has the law broken you? Verse 23, you boast in the law through your breaking of the law. Do you dishonor God? The answer is yes. And then he says in verse 24, for the name of God because of you is blasphemed among the Gentiles. The name of God is blasphemed. You claim to speak for God. The message of God is blasphemed because of you. The distortion is coming right out of your life. And people then come hoping to meet with God. They meet with you. They get a distortion of God, and God is then blasphemed. And all of that flows out of verses 1 through 12, a system in people who've got a false basis of authority, put on heavy weights, external, pious, phony religious performance. Maybe the most troubling piece in all of this comes at the very end of the verse when it says this, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in. What that tells us is the kind of people that are having the kingdom experience and the kingdom entrance blocked off to them by this kind of system. What you need to note, and I'm sure you've already captured it in your mind, is that the people who are having the kingdom shut off to them are not people who are actively and rebelliously rejecting God. They aren't people who are walking away going, God, forget him, I don't want anything to do with him. The people who are having the kingdom shut off to them are people who are seeking to know God. They are looking for God. They are desiring to come into some sort of relationship with him. They are responding, and maybe at the beginning their response is very minimal. They don't even know where to go. They don't know what to do, but they get a heart that is responding to a God-induced desire to somehow know, to somehow discover. They're moving toward the kingdom. They're desiring to enter in. And as they enter in, they go to a place that seems logical that you would go to if you were looking for God. They go to a temple. They go to a church. Thinking of all the places on the face of the earth, I'll find it in a church. I don't think I'll find it in a bar. I've tried the bar. There isn't any life there. I'm going to go to a church. and when they came into this church that was characterized by these things in verses 1 through 12 what they ran into were people who did indeed welcome them into their church welcomed them into their synagogue got them involved in the movement welcomed them into their Sunday school class but as it relates to the reign of God the life of God the joy that comes in the spirit and freedom they came into contact with people who stood at the door of the kingdom and shut it off from them. I think the shutting off of the kingdom, by the way, just to kind of backtrack here just for a second, comes in two ways. Some of these systems can shut off the kingdom absolutely in terms of even entrance into salvation. We talked last week about one of the forms of legalism is a works righteousness legalism that says you've got to earn it, you've got to do it, you've got to crank out these behaviors and you can't be accepted by God for salvation unless you do it just right. that keeps people from ever entering the kingdom. We also talked about systems that put the load on even after people are saved. They make it very clear that you are only saved by grace through faith. Our only hope for salvation is Jesus. But for sanctification and for service, your only hope is you. Crank it out, try harder, follow the formula. And we end up living our entire Christian life, again, carrying the load. And they have entered into the kingdom in terms of salvation, but they never enter into the kingdom in terms of experience and freedom and joy. Because whenever you've got systems of false authority, heavy loads on people's backs, externally focused religion rather than internally induced by the spirit holiness, you shut the kingdom to people. You shut it off. And the people who have it shut off to them are the ones who are desiring to come. They're the ones in the pew. trying to discover how they could possibly know God some way. Every once in a while you'll hear a testimony like this. You know, I was in a church all my life, and after years and years and years of being in the church, I finally found what? Jesus. Now, sometimes that's not the result of the system they were in. Sometimes they were hearing the truth all their life, and for whatever reason they weren't paying attention, they were trying to get their life someplace else, They were rebelliously rejecting it the whole time. And finally they said, I've got to listen to what I've been hearing my whole life. But sometimes a testimony like that comes from somebody who has been in a system where they might have been hungry, they might have been yearning, they jump through all the hoops hoping that if they do it just the perfect Baptist, Lutheran, Catholic, Alliance, whatever way, God will like me. And it never got enough. And then they met what? Jesus. Then came life. Then came power. Then came joy. Then came freedom. Then came the kingdom, the rule of God first time. I think this is really heavy stuff. It causes me to ask questions like this, and I think we ought to all be asking, am I a door opener or am I a door closer? Do I turn the light on for people as it relates to the kingdom of God, or do we turn it off? Do we make the water clear as it relates to his revelation, or do we muddy the water? And by the way, more people can do this than just leaders in a church. Parents can do this to their children. They can muddy the water. Friends can do it to their friends. Sunday school teachers can do it to their students. Schools can do it to their students. Systems can do this to the point where people are so confused about what the gospel is, they don't have any idea or any capacity even to receive grace. One of the things we hear on a frighteningly consistent basis is this. I hear this grace message. I hear how much God loves me. I can't let it in. I can't let it in. I can't let it in. It just never seems to come in because my whole life I've been in a system where the authority was a false basis of authority. It never came from truth. It wasn't based on being sensitive to the Spirit. The load was put on me my whole life, and I've been trying to carry it. And even when somebody comes to me and says, like Jesus, come unto me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, I'll give you rest. Take my yoke, give it to me. I don't even know how to do that. I hear the words, it feels real nice, but I've had the kingdom shut off to me my whole life. Not just from the pastor. Sometimes it came from there. Sometimes it was from your parents. Sunday school, on and on and on and on. I think it's scary. most graphic picture that i that i can come up with of this person who is desiring to enter into the kingdom but they're having it shut off is a picture we dealt with just a few weeks ago in matthew chapter 21 it's the day before this day in terms of the context when jesus came into the temple and remember he cleansed the temple and what we did was some research we found out why jesus was really so angry about the temple and what was going on there And we found out it wasn't because they were selling tapes in the foyer. There was more involved than that. The picture we developed was this, and this is what made Jesus angry. The picture would be that of a family coming from far away to Jerusalem. And this family was coming on the Passover, and they were coming to the house of God, and they were desiring to meet with God. And just like these who were desiring to enter into the kingdom, they figured, where else could I go to meet with God but to the temple? I'll go to Jerusalem. That seems like a logical place. And what they brought with them to this temple was what was for them a sacrifice of love. They would bring a lamb or a dove or a pigeon. And very often the lamb that they would bring would be the family pet. They had raised it all year long. They loved this thing. It felt to them like God would read their heart. And I'm giving to you something that is a metaphor of what's in my heart. I'm going to give you the best that I've got. Something that I love because I love you or I at least want to learn how to love you. And then they came to the temple. and when they got to the temple they saw two things first of all they saw the temple itself whose very construction spoke to them and what it spoke to them is this you can't get to god the kingdom is shut up from you and the way the construction of the temple communicated that was this there was the outer court remember that the courtyard of the gentiles where jesus is right now but after the outer court of the gentiles there were six ascending inner courts until finally you got into the holy of holies where god was and a high priest could go once a year it is significant to me and it ought to be to us that upon the crucifixion of jesus when he gave up the ghost it says that the veil in the temple was rent in two and now we can move boldly into the very presence of god almighty by the blood of christ not by our performance but by the blood of christ I can now come into the presence of God. Jesus came to give access, open up the kingdom of heaven. These people come to the temple. The very construction says, you can't come, you're shut out. But there was another thing that communicated that they were shut out. And that was what was going on in the courtyard of the temple. The marketing. Remember the picture. They would bring their lamb, desiring to offer it in love. The first thing they would have to do would be to go to the booth of approval. The booth of approval was run by the pharisees they would bring their lamb to the booth and it would have to get approved and the pharisee would say oh yes this is acceptable sacrifice to give to god or not and what they had a scam going every time you'd bring the lamb it wasn't acceptable in fact how in the world did you think god would accept your puny sacrifice a good heart give me a break i'll take this slimy lamb but if you go to any one of these booths out here you can buy a lamb from any one of these people here any of one of these marketers out here that has been temple approved and so they would go to one of these booths and they would maybe go from booth to booth uh trying to figure out what the pitch was from each individual one maybe trying to get the best price but what they would find out in this particular marketplace was that the lands they had to buy were 10 times what they were really worth and they began to pay to get to god and they began to pay to get to God, and they began to pay and pay and pay and pay, and no matter what they gave, it was never enough, and they never got to God, and they ended up spending their entire spiritual life jumping through religious hoops in the outer courtyard of religious activity and never getting to God, and they went from church to church to church, from denomination to denomination to denomination, jumping through all the hoops, buying the wares that they were selling, jumping through, again, all the hoops, spending their life in all these different kinds of ways to do it, never getting to God. We need to be warned that these dynamics can rise up even in the context of a redeemed community. We'd like to think that isn't true, but if we don't believe that these dynamics can rise up in a redeemed community, we're naive. All we'd have to do is hear Galatians. Let me say it this way. Whenever or wherever, the characteristics of verses 1 through 12 rise up. Wherever and whenever, we see a false basis of authority. People putting heavy loads and not extending the strong arm of grace to lift it off. An external performance creating an image of godliness that isn't really coming from the work of the spirit inside whenever and wherever you see those systems know this the reign of god among those people will be shut off let me say it a different way the degree to which we see these characteristics in verses 1 through 12 moving through a system or a church it is to that degree that the kingdom of god will be shut off that kind of gives me a little latitude here to say something. Again, sometimes the kingdom is shut off ultimately. They don't even enter in for salvation. But sometimes what is shut off is the experience of the freedom of Christ, the power of the Holy Spirit. Because we're in a system where the leadership, the authority is false. The load is up to us to carry. And the holiness is an external performance, not an internal reality. This is graphically seen in the redeemed people at the church in Galatia. They were indeed saved, and after they were saved, the group came to them that they ought to have been able to trust. They were from Jerusalem. It would be like somebody coming from another church to visit us. They were going to have some special meetings. They were called the Judaizers. In fact, the way I have it in my mind is they were coming to do spiritual emphasis this week. We're going to do it really spiritual this week. But instead of really getting spiritual, which would mean encouraging people to hang on to Jesus even tighter, what they came was with a message that put the load back on. After that had been taken off, they came and put it back on. And they didn't come into this group and say things like this, Galatians, Jesus is a curse. If they'd said that, the Galatians would have spotted that. They didn't come and say grace is a lie. The Galatians would have spotted that. They didn't come in and say, hey, you've got it all wrong. Salvation really is by work. They didn't say that. They came and said this, Jesus is great. And I'm so glad you love him, and that's in your heart. But don't be naive. It's not enough. We're going to have deeper life this week. And grace is wonderful, but you better understand, if you want to get grace, you're going to have to earn it. You see, Jesus is wonderful, but it's Jesus plus. If you want to be accepted by God and be one of the upstanding people, you're going to have to get circumcised. And the message began to be Jesus plus circumcision. Jesus plus observing days and months and years. Jesus plus tongues will really set you over the edge. Jesus plus church attendance, Sunday school pens, daily devotions, taking communion, getting baptized. And all of a sudden, all of those things are fine, but all of a sudden, my whole focus has changed from on my knees looking into the face of my Savior you're saying, Jesus, I just need you to know that my only hope is you. And I recognize that my only hope is you for salvation. And now I want to be holy. And I could try to crank it all out. But I recognize that my only hope for sanctification and genuine holy living is you. And my only hope for ever having effective service in the kingdom is you. Now my only hope is you, kind of. But really, it's me. Circumcision, tongues, baptism, communion, daily devotions. And I'm cranking it all out, hoping that that will qualify me. And Jesus says over and over again, the only thing that qualifies you from beginning to end is the blood of Jesus who has bewitched you. Let me ask you a question. He said in Galatians chapter 3, did you come into your salvation by the works of the law and by your own striving? The answer to that is no. Did you think then, having begun by the Spirit, You're now going to be perfected by your external performance? What are you, nuts? That's the way I would say it. He said, you're bewitched. So he said it nicely. That's the way he'd say it. What are you, nuts or what? We need to understand something. You know, if you've been at Open Door for any length of time or in the training center, that little spiel I just gave you about Galatia is one you've heard before. But it's been a long time since we've heard this part I want to give you right now because Paul does not only confront the Galatians in Galatians for buying the lie, he also confronts the liars. And he does that in the very first chapter. Turn to that real quickly. We're going to be wrapping this up here. Galatians chapter 1. It is this place where he confronts those who are bringing the lie. And essentially what he's saying here in chapter 1 is exactly what Jesus is saying in Matthew 23. I do not want to allow you to look at teachings like this as if they are just some subtle slant on the truth. You see, it's still the truth, but they say it a little different. It's not just a subtle slant. We're not on the same team. Paul says the same thing. I'm amazed, verse 6, that you are so quickly deserting him. You are deserting not a theology. You are not deserting a church. You are not deserting an organization. You are, when you have bought this bag of Jesus Plus, Deserting Christ. The word deserting there is important. When I think of deserting, I think of a military scenario, and I think of someone who has left his company, the army, and he's AWOL. That would be deserting. But there's two ways to desert. One would simply be to leave my company. The other way to desert would be to leave my company and join the enemy. Now, in the Vietnam War, a lot of people went AWOL. They left their army commitment. They left their marine commitment and they ran up to Canada. They deserted. They didn't necessarily join the enemy. This word here means you have left Jesus and joined the enemy. That's what this word means. What's he saying? Among other things he's saying, this is not a subtle slant on the truth. This is not the truth, but it's just a little different. It's not the truth. He goes on to say that more deeply when he says, You've deserted him who called you by the grace of Christ for a different gospel. Now, when it says different gospel there, it kind of leaves you the impression that it's still the gospel. Just kind of different. Just a little bit. That's why in verse 7 he clarifies when he says, wait a minute, it's really not another. Now, let me explain that. When he says a different gospel and it sounds like it might still be the gospel, it would be like if I took a watch. I got my watch here. I have a watch here. It's a certain kind of watch. And I could get your watch up here and I could put my watch next to your watch. You know what I'd notice about them? They're different. But you know what else I'd notice about them? They're both watches. So, hey, lighten up, okay? You know, it says, you know, it says we're late. Oh, my goodness. Oh, boy, oh, boy. They both tell the time. So it's okay, no big deal. That's what he leaves the impression with in verse 6. And that's why in verse 7 he says, now, wait a minute. This is not just two watches. We do not have the gospel, and they just kind of look a little different. I'm talking about something that is another gospel. It is not the gospel. And then he begins to speak of those who would bring this gospel that is not the gospel, verse 8. Even though we are an angel from heaven to preach to you a gospel contrary to that which we have preached, let him be a curse. I don't care how nice he is. I don't care how slick his performance is. I don't care how spiritual they sound. I don't care where they got their degree. I don't care if he's the pastor. I don't care if he's an elder. I don't care if it's an angel from heaven. I don't care if it's me, Apostle Paul. If they bring you a gospel that's different than the one of grace and grace alone, and my only hope is Jesus for every aspect of the Christian life, let them be accursed, consigned to hell. In verse 9, I'm going to say it again. This is big when he says it again. I've studied the Bible a lot, I think, and I don't know any place where a writer says the same thing in the next verse. I think he wants us to get to the point. As we have said before, so I say again, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you have received, and that is a gospel of grace alone, let him be a curse. Then in verse 10, it indicates to me that Paul knew that what he was saying was a big, heavy, controversial, going to get him in trouble thing. For am I now seeking the favor of men or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were striving to please men, I wouldn't be saying this. put it all together when there is and when you see a false basis of authority where the authority is assumed on the basis of the position not on the basis of the truth emanating from the person when there is incongruence and a lack of integrity in life they say but do not when there is a piling on of the load of religious rules and traditions and rituals and guilt and shame designed to manipulate and control people, when there never is the strong arm of grace extended to lift the load, when the religion is worn on the outside, external, when it needs to be noticed, when there is a categoric lack of humility, when titles, degrees, status, and recognition is demanded, know this, those things are not benign. They are not irritating but harmless things. They literally shut off the kingdom of heaven from people who are trying to get in. And it makes Jesus absolutely livid. Close with two things. I think it's important how we close here. This is a negative message. I've been sharing with people, I don't like negative messages. They're not fun. They're important. One of the things I think is important to do in light of what we're doing is recognize that this text is causing us to identify systems that are false, identify systems that we have possibly been in. And as I bring some of this stuff, some of you might be getting angry, and the truth is some of you might need to be angry. some of you might need to grieve that for maybe a long period of time the kingdom of God and some aspects of the kingdom of God were shut off to you because of some system that's described very clearly in verses 1 through 12. But in the middle of all that, I think it's important, it's been important for me as I've been kind of in this up to my eyeballs, this whole thing, it's important for me to back off a little bit and now I think for us to back off a little bit and think not only of those who have turned off the kingdom and shut the door, but to think of some people in our lives who have done just the opposite of this, who have been those kingdom people who stood in the middle of a lot of lies and said, you know something? The kingdom of heaven is open to you. Someplace in my life where somebody came to me and in one way or another said, David, you need to know something, little guy. It's not by works of righteousness which you have done, but according to his mercy, he saved you. By the washing and regenerating of the word. And David, you're a good guy, but you know what? Your only hope is Jesus. I'd like you to bring me to Jesus. I'd like to open the door for you to Jesus and you know what, as I think about that I've had some people lie to me, so have you I've had some people shut the door of the kingdom to me and so have you I've had some people in some systems make me feel like I could never get to God because I was never good enough I never quite cranked it up but I've also got some people in my life who gently, without fail consistently opened the door and opened the door and lifted the load and offered grace for some of you it might be a mom or a dad some of you it might not be that person at all some of you it might be a husband or a wife a friend for some of you it might be your kids we had a baptism service several months ago and it was an incredible thing for me to watch a son baptize his mom and son the son opened the door of the kingdom to his mom that's a neat picture could you could we be in the middle of this war here can we look up for a minute and think of the people who've ushered us into the presence of Jesus and be grateful. It's just kind of, I need that breath in the middle of this. There's something else I want to close with, though, too. As we're dealing with this this week and then even next week again, there is obviously the need and the instinct to identify all the systems we know about that are like this, to identify the systems that we've been in like this, to identify the people that we know and leaders we've followed who were or are like this, then there might be a real strong tendency to leave here and be on the warpath and straighten them out. And I don't know that there isn't a context for that. I mean, I think there is. Jesus is surely doing it here. I'm not always sure what that is, but there is surely a time for that. But I think for us today, there's another tendency that would be more dangerous even than that, and that is if we left feeling somehow superior because we don't think this could be us. feeling somehow secure in the fact that boy oh boy I'm glad it's not us and I need to tell you how dangerous I think that response would be see it's whatever degree to which these things are there that degree the kingdom is shut off I think that anybody, not anybody I suppose there are some false systems that began so false and so deeply ingrained in something that was false that from the beginning was false but I have a feeling too that there are many systems that are putting heavy weights on people and are operating from a false base of authority. And it's all an external performance that maybe didn't start that way at all. And somewhere along the line, pride came in. And all of a sudden, we needed to protect something, and we needed to make sure we were looking just good. And all of a sudden, the snowball began to go downhill. And before we knew it, without even knowing we were doing it, we were putting loads on people. And before we knew it, our authority wasn't coming from the Spirit of God anymore. It wasn't coming from truth. It was coming from this need to control. And I have a feeling when those things happened, it started small. I think it's very important that we walk out the door in some sense, looking at ourselves and saying, God, first our hearts, keep us a pure people who are recognizing over and over again that our holiness cannot just be an external performance. It has got to be something that we are allowing you to do in our hearts, that we are allowing you to come in and expose the sin, the inconsistencies, and bring the purity and the holiness and the anointing and the filling of the Spirit. So what is out here is really an accurate reflection of what's in here. That's why I want to close with a spirit that just says, search us, God, know our hearts. Are our words and do our lives open the doors to the rule of God, Or are we more interested in being the rulers ourselves? In our families, in our Sunday school classes, in our church. I'm going to sing a song as we close. Simple, simple this. Open our eyes, we want to see you. Open our ears and help us to listen to the ways in which this might even be part of us. And we just want to see you. I have one other thing, though. See, there could be some people here who are under a load and the kingdom has been shut out. Good word for you. since therefore brethren we have confidence to enter the holy place not by our performance but by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way which he inaugurated for us through the veil that is his flesh and since we have a great high priest over the house of God here's the good news you don't have to jump through any hoops to get to God just draw near with a sincere heart and full assurance of faith that your heart can be sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and your body washed with your water I got a word for you. The kingdom of heaven is open to you this morning. Thank you.
