Let's pray together. Lord, I pray that you would help us to respond well to that very simple invitation. Come and listen. Come and listen. And what I pray today relative to that invitation is that what we will hear is the voice of the rabbi. Help us to hear the voice of the rabbi, who is Jesus. I pray that in Jesus' name. Amen. Last week in our continuing study of the healing miracles of Jesus, we came upon a story that raised a question. It's a question directed by Jesus to a man who had been in his sickness for 38 years. The question was this. Do you really want to get well? A question that on the surface of things seems strange. I mean, who wouldn't want to get well? More than strange, it in certain contexts could be quite offensive. Why would someone think they didn't want to get well? But it turns out that there are quite a few people who don't want to really get well for a variety of reasons that we talked about at length last week. Today, another question. Actually, two that at first blush may not seem to be connected, but they are. First question is this. Who is really sick? Now, not just physically. We've been in a series on healing here, and we've been careful to point out that there's more than one way to be sick, more than one way to need healing. So when I ask this question, who is really sick, it's not just physical, but spiritually. Who is really sick? Spiritually, who is unclean, unwelcome? Which leads to the second question. It ties back into the first. The second question is this. Who is welcome at the table? Who belongs at the table of God, as it were? The answer to that, at least in part, is this. Not sick people. Not unclean people. But that answer brings us back to the first question, thus connecting these two questions, because if sick people aren't welcome at the table of God, who really are the sick ones? Who really are the unclean ones, the unwelcome ones? Those questions may be a little weird to you right now, stirring a little bit in your mind. Open your Bibles to Matthew 9. Matthew 9, picking our study up in verse 9, We've been using, as most of you know, Matthew 8 and 9 as the basis for our study of the healing miracles of Jesus. And we come now to a story that raises the questions I just began to raise. Let's read verse 9. And as Jesus passed on from there, from there would have been from the healing of the paralytic in Capernaum that we dealt with a couple of weeks ago. He saw a man called Matthew sitting in a tax office. Keep in mind, this is important to connect, that this is the same Matthew who wrote the gospel that bears his name. It's the gospel we're reading out of right now. At one time, he was a tax gatherer. A publican is another term for tax gatherer. And because of what we know about publicans from other studies we've done, you might as well just call him a sinner. In other words, he's one of the sick ones. He's one of the unclean ones. at least in verse 9, the gospel writer in verse 9 is one of the unclean ones. He would be one of the unwelcome ones. So his name, the very presence of his name in verse 9, stirs up this question. I guess I kind of wonder now, who really are the sick ones? And Jesus said to him, still in verse 9, follow me. And Matthew rose and followed him. I don't want to make a big thing about this, but a little side teaching here. Jesus didn't say, accept me as your personal Savior. You have a personal computer? No, you can have a personal savior. He doesn't say that. He says, follow me. Now what that is, a little teaching here on the side, important for the rest of the talk. That's rabbi talk. That's how rabbis talk. Rabbis, not just Jesus, but rabbis in Jesus' day would say things like that to students. Follow me. And what they would mean by that is, I want you to follow my way. And their way, actually, would be, among other things, their interpretation of scripture, the Torah and their teaching of the scripture or their way would be what was technically actually called a yoke. So rabbis, not just Jesus, but rabbis would say, take my yoke upon you, my interpretation of scripture and what it means to be righteous, what it means to be healthy, what it means to be whole, and you will be all those things. And you might dial into the fact that there were many rabbis in Jesus' days whose yokes were very, very heavy, overwhelmingly weighty with religious behavior, and Jesus was constantly confronting that. In fact, in Matthew 23, he said of many of the rabbis, you put heavy weights on people's shoulders and do nothing to take it off. You just give them all of these religious external behaviors that they have to do, and you keep piling things onto them, hoping that by doing all those things, they would become holy. It's interesting that Jesus, when he talked about his yoke as a rabbi, he had a yoke too, and he said things like, This my yoke is a different kind of yoke. It's easy. It's one that's going to cause you to lay down your life. I thought that was easy. Well, it's easy in a different way. It's not external religion. The point is this. If you were to take on a rabbi's yoke and follow his way, in many ways, you would become just like the rabbi. So if you're a crotchety, religious, mean rabbi, and you took on his yoke, followed his way, you would become just like the rabbi. When Jesus says, follow me, When Jesus says, follow me, and Matthew got up and began to follow him, it meant he took on Jesus' yoke, and it's in the following of Jesus that sick people become well. It isn't just signing this little card, except Jesus is my personal Savior. That might be the beginning of your following his way, but if you don't follow the way, you'll never be healed. Okay, that's a little free thing over there. Back to the text. It's going to tie in later. It happened that as he, that is Jesus, was reclining at the table in the house, Matthew's table, Matthew's house, and many tax gatherers and sinners came and were dining with Jesus and his tables. Another sidebar here. We're not even getting to the text here. Can't hardly read it. I got to do all this teaching. It's very important to understand what we're reading. This issue of reclining at table that's mentioned there in verse 10 is more significant than guess who's coming to dinner or table fellowship, though who you have at your physical table, or house, as it were, is included in this. But you need to get this. In Jesus' day, reclining at the table, that very phrase all by itself, had powerful and deep-seated messianic and kingdom connotations. In Jesus' day, one of the primary symbols or pictures that people had in mind for the kingdom of God was a banquet. It was a great feast. Isaiah 25, verse 6 and 8 says this. On this mountain, the Lord Almighty will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples. Big table, all peoples are invaded to this banquet. And let me tell you about it. It's a banquet of aged wine, the best of meats and the finest of wines, and he will swallow up death forever and wipe away all tears from their eyes. It's the messian. It's an incredible picture. So whatever else the kingdom of God is like, in the mind of a first-century Jew, whatever else it is like, it is like a banquet. It's like a great feast. But always the question surrounding the banquet was this, who was invited? who belongs at this table of Messiah in the kingdom of God. And the answer to that question always had something to do with who is clean and who is unclean, who is acceptable and who is not, who is sick and who is healthy, who is righteous and who is unrighteous. Which is why, which is precisely why, when the Pharisees saw this in verse 11, this being Jesus reclining at table with all this kingdom significance with the wrong kind of people. Look at verse 11. They said to his disciples, why is your teacher eating with tax gatherers and sinners? Because this just didn't fit their kingdom perspective, their messianic expectation. But when he, that is Jesus, heard this, verse 12, he said to them, it is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick. Now, that makes sense, but it also raises a question. When you think of who is in this story, Matthew, who is a sinner, but he's actually the gospel writer, and the Pharisees who are, who is, it raises this question, who is really sick? I came for the sick. Who are the sick? Go then and learn what this means. I desire compassion and not sacrifice. Sacrifice there, being the strict adherence to religious ritual as a means of feeling holy. For I did not come to call the righteous. I did not come to call the righteous, but who are the righteous, but sinners. But who are the sinners? Who belongs at the table and who doesn't? The story stirs all of those questions. Matthew's at the table in this story, but does he belong at the table? He's a sinner. Or is he? The Pharisees in the story aren't at the table. They're just watching this whole thing happen. They aren't at the table. They're the righteous. Or either. I wonder if you can see in this story, Jesus is doing something that rabbis do. It's something Jesus does quite often. He's turning things, intentionally knocking people off center, Both those who would consider themselves to be sinners and those who would consider themselves to be righteous. He's kind of knocking all of them intentionally off center to hopefully awaken them to the upside down realities of the kingdom of God. You see, the Pharisees thought they knew who was healthy and who was sick. They had a pretty clear idea in their mind of who belonged at the table and who didn't. It was real clear to them they belonged at the table. they were the righteous ones. But as it turns out, the healthy ones in the upside-down realities of the kingdom of God, and particularly in this story, the healthy ones are actually the ones who know they're sick, like Matthew. And because they know they're sick, they also know they need help. More than help, they need a healer. More than a healer, they need a redeemer who can show them an entirely different way. So when Jesus says, follow me and my way, not sign this card here, no, no, I'm going to invite you into following my way. They do. And it's as they follow Jesus' way, sick people become healthy, whole, clean. But the sick ones, turns out, are actually the ones who think they're healthy, who feel really good about themselves, and because they think they're healthy, they have no sense of need. They Have No Sense that they need a helper, or a healer, or a redeemer. They have no sense that they need to find a different way. So they don't get one. They don't get a healor. They don't get a redeemer. They don' t get a different way. They just get what they think is their righteousness. What it is, is an illusion. In fact, it's something Jesus was poking at and getting at in just the previous chapter, in Matthew 8 and 9. We've been in for actually a few months now, in Matthew 8, 11. You might recall Jesus was dealing with the centurion. The centurion, remember that? He came to Jesus on behalf of the paralyzed slave, his paralyzed slave. And Jesus, at the end of the interaction, said, I've not seen faith like this in all of Israel. And that was an incredible thing to say because the centurion, according to the religious people of Israel, the religious elite, thought the centurion was unclean. And Jesus is saying to this unclean Gentile, I've never seen faith among religious people like I see right here. And remember the little phrase we kind of came up with? It was one of those things on our journey with the healing thing was Jesus blesses faith wherever he finds it. But he finds it in the strangest places. You'd think you'd find it in the synagogue. You'd think you'd find it in church. Turns out, a lot of times where you find authentic kingdom faith, it's just in the strange. It's in these weird Gentiles over here who don't know how to say it. And it's all about Jesus turning things upside down, coming with questions that disturb and confronted us why in Matthew 8, 11, Jesus said that many will come from the east and the west, from places you didn't expect, like this centurion right here in Matthew 8, and they will recline at the table. There's that phrase again with messianic significance. Any Jew hearing that would go, you're talking about who's at the table in the kingdom and not. Many will come from places you don't expect and recline at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, but the sons of the kingdom who think they're at the table will be cast into outer darkness and everybody here in that would go, are you kidding me? What is he saying? If you wondered why Pharisees hated him, don't wonder. It's called the great reverse. What's going on in this text? The upside down reality of the kingdom of God And when you start to see it, and some of you begin to see it. It's like through a glass darkly. You can smell it a little bit. But when you start to see it, the more and more you see it, the more you see it, the more it raises questions. Particularly around this. Who is really sick? And who is really healthy? Who really are the righteous ones? Because I thought I knew, but Jesus is turning things weird on me here. and who really are the sinners because I thought I knew that too and who is welcome at the table and who is not one more question that this story will call forth who is welcome at your table and my table because it's not the healthy it says in verse 12 we need a physician but the sick but who really is sick and how do sick people get well? Another little side note here, so I can kind of explain what I'm doing with you today. One of the teaching techniques that was used by rabbis, not just Jesus, but all rabbis in Jesus' day, was to not just give answers. That's kind of the teacher mode we have in Western culture and in most churches. It's like my job is to give you the answers and make you feel good and I'll tell you how to think and hopefully you resist that and you're here because we don't do that. There is a place for giving some answers. We're not just wandering aimlessly, I don't think. But one of the primary teaching techniques of all rabbis was to ask questions. Often very disturbing questions designed to disrupt people's thinking and, again, knock them off center, not to just kind of irritate them with that, but the intent was to drive you deeper into real understanding. Now, Jesus was a master at this. Just read through the Gospels and his interactions with the Pharisees in particular. He would often answer questions with another question. He wouldn't answer their question. They would ask him something seeking to trap him, and he wouldn't answer. He would just ask another question. Last week, he came to someone who was sick, and the whole thing revolved around a question. Do you really want to get well? What? And it just stirs up all sorts of things. That question in this text we're dealing with today, he ends by saying, go and learn what this means. That's not a question, but he doesn't give the answer. Go and learn what this means. I desire compassion, not sacrifice. See, figure it out. I'm not telling you what I mean. You go figure that out. Rabbis did that all the time. Sometimes Jesus would make statements designed to raise questions, but it was always about that. Let me give you an example of that. In Matthew 5, Jesus said, you have heard it said, don't commit adultery. But I say unto you, don't even lust. Let me tell you a couple things about that. That little thing, you have heard it said, but I say unto you, that is not just something Jesus thought up to say. That's how rabbis talked. You have heard it said. This is the yoke that some rabbis will give you. Don't commit murder. Let me give you another way. And he is establishing himself. When he talks that way, he is saying to everyone who's listening, I am a rabbi, and I have an alternative way. I have an alternative yoke You have heard it said by many rabbis Don't commit adultery I say if you look on a woman to lust after her You've committed adultery already in your heart Now I'm not going to unpack all of that What that all means And what he's really doing But what he's really trying to do Is raise a question You know what the question is? What? That's the question It's designed to confuse you Make you wonder What did he mean by that? If you want to find out what I mean by that Follow me Get it? Follow my way and we'll figure out together what I mean by that. He raised questions in a variety of ways. That's how, that's a powerful teaching technique and it made people, it taught people how, among other things, to think. In fact, sometimes what he did raise questions. It wouldn't have anything to do with what he said. And they were supposed to raise questions. I think an example of that is what we're looking at in Matthew 9. How many of you know that among the many things that got Jesus into trouble near the top of the list was who he continually invited to and included in his table? And not just here in Matthew 9, which it's obvious that that's what the story is about, but in Luke 15, 1 and 2, it says that all the tax gatherers and sinners were coming near to Jesus to listen to him, and both the Pharisees and scribes began to grumble, saying, This man receives sinners and eats with them. Again, with their messianic thing, that would just be not okay. In fact, in Luke 4, they concluded that because of that, he's gluttonous man and a drunkard. New Testament scholar Scott McKnight indicates that there was actually a Hebrew phrase in Jesus' day that described the kind of people that Jesus hung with. The phrase is this, em ha eratz, which simply means the people of the land. That's who Jesus hung with. Now generally that term, emha'arat, was a derogatory term, but it wasn't necessarily sinful, but it kind of indicated second-rate kind of person. They were generally uneducated. The emha'arat, they didn't know the Torah, the scriptures, and they were regarded by the religious elite as ignorant, backwards, uncouth, embarrassing. In more contemporary terms, we would consider them tacky, trashy, sleazy, common. Their idea of art was pictures of Elvis painted on black velvets You know Their idea of diet food was like light beer You know I'm on a diet So it's not so much, here's the picture It's not so much that they were sinners As they were common And the fact that Jesus hung with people like that More than hung with them That Jesus liked people like that Served as proof to the Pharisees that his messianic credentials were less than stellar. John 7, 46, the Pharisees were confronting the temple guards and really ticked off at him because some of the temple guards were beginning to be swayed by this new rabbi, Jesus, and they were trying to pull him back and they say to the temple guards in John 7, 46, you mean he's deceived you also? Have any of the rulers of the Pharisees believed in him? No. But this mob, and the word for mob there is emhaarats. These common people who know nothing of the law, they listen to him. There's a curse on them. See, the Pharisees had very clear ideas about who was okay and who was not, about who was clean and who wasn't, who counted with God and who didn't. And the emhaarats didn't count with God. They didn't know the Torah. They didn't observe the law. They didn't go to synagogue. They didn't go to church. And if you were serious about righteousness, and the Pharisees were really serious about righteousness as they defined it according to their yoke, you would not associate with these kinds of people. And above all, you would not eat with them. The rabbis actually had, some rabbis actually had a saying that said six things are a disgrace for rabbinic students. The fifth of the six was to recline at table with a common person. Indeed, the Pharisees had a very clear process that was required for you or anyone to have table fellowship with anyone. Again, it's all inspired by this kingdom messianic view of who reclines at table, but it translated down into their everyday who they invited into their kitchen, as it were. there was a specific process that were required. If you're going to have table fellowship with someone, excuse me, here. Boy, you're going to have to do that. It's okay. Interesting noises. Thank you. He's trying to help me. Anyway. Several things you had to do to be made acceptable at the table. First, the person would have to repent of all sin. Then they would have to purify themselves with ritualistic cleansing to become clean. to become acceptable, and then you could invite them to their table. They were dirty. Well, you have to become clean before you come, and then they were okay. All of which gives us a little more insight into how controversial. If you know that, it makes this scene in Matthew 9 even more inflammatory. Because what Jesus has done, given what I just told you about what you had to do, you get clean first to have table fellowship, Jesus in Matthew 9 has reversed the order. He has absolutely reversed it because Jesus had table fellowship first before they got quote-unquote clean or healed, healthy. And he did this not accidentally but on purpose. Not once in a while but day after day after day. Because Jesus was a rabbi. And rabbis don't always teach what they teach by speaking. Sometimes they engage in symbolic actions that teach and speak more profoundly than words. So every single time Jesus sat at table, like he did in Matthew 9 with the emhaarats, it was like a real life parable. I mean, he could have done a 90 minute sermon and it wouldn't have been a better sermon than having dinner with these people. Because it was designed to make a statement and raise questions. And the questions it raised were questions about who is really sick and who is really righteous. Matthew's at the table, but he's a sinner. Or is he? The Pharisees aren't at the table, and they're righteous. But are they? Raise questions about who is righteous and who is not, about who is welcome at the table and who is not. Now, maybe the best table story that Jesus ever told is the one he told in Luke 14. In this story, the scene is a little bit different. He's not at table with publicans and sinners, but with some pretty powerful people who had invited him to dinner. It's a special kind of dinner in Jesus' day, in this culture, the kind of dinner that is spoken of in Luke 14. In fact, if you have your Bibles, turn to that. Luke 14. We're going to be there for a bit, Matthew Mark. Matthew, Mark, Luke. John, okay, it's before John. These are very public affairs. The best picture in your mind would be that it's like a big reception at a fancy hotel with celebrities and media. You would have guests who were invited. You would have gawkers on the outside, outskirts of things, watching. And Jesus, who was an invited guest at this, so he would have been at the center table, reclining at the table. As people were coming in, Jesus began to notice how people were jockeying for position, for places of honor at the table. It says that in Luke 14, 7. Jesus had begun to speak a parable to the invited guests. That would have been the ones reclining at table. I'll explain that in a minute. When he noticed how they had been picking out spots of honor at the table. Actually, and this is where I need to fill you in here, there were three places that you could be at a banquet like this. The first was in a sofa-like chair where you would be reclining at table. There's that phrase again. And these sofas where you would recline at the table was for the people who really belonged there. Second place you could be would be at the table. You were invited. You were at the table, but you weren't reclining. You weren't quite as important. The third place you could be would be in the room but not at the table. You could watch from the perimeter. Generally, these people weren't invited, but they were allowed to kind of watch what was going on. All of that is what Jesus is watching in verse 7. When in verse 12, he makes this suggestion. And you just really have to admire Jesus because as a dinner guest, he's the dinner guest. What you're supposed to do is make social nice talk and talk about sports or the weather. And he makes all sorts of trouble. Watch this. which is what I love about him, among many other things. Amen. Well, he's irritating, just like me. Anyway, it's true. Well, not just like me, but he is. Let's look at verse 12. Shut up. Shut up. And he also went on to say to the one who had invited him. Now he's speaking to the guy who invited him. So again, this is some of you should be nice to. He says, you know, when you give a luncheon or dinner like this, don't invite your friends and your brothers and your relatives or your rich neighbors, which is who he invited. Why is he correcting the host? Don't do this, Jesus. Talk about the weather. Lest they also invite you in return and repayment come to you. But when you give a reception like this, when you put some on, you know what you should do? You should invite the poor and the crippled and the lame and the blind. This is not going over really big with the person who is listening. You don't have to have a lot of historic background here. to know that there's some tension being raised when Jesus says this. But it is interesting to know that the Essenes, which is one sect of the Pharisees, actually had a list of those who would be included in the Messianic banquets and who would be excluded in the Messianic banquets. And among those specifically included, and this is why it's so bizarre what Jesus says here, among those specifically excluded were the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame, the very people Jesus mentioned. So it's not just like he's picking randomly. why don't you pick some people who need some food? He is picking people who he knows that in terms of their theology, they would never include at their table or the Messianic table. I mean, he's sticking them. In verse 15, in what I think is a lame attempt to diffuse the situation, like somebody at the dinner table, I'm going to make the peace and we're going to change the subject so we can talk about happy things. Maybe to find something that we can all agree on. It says in verse 15 that one of those who were reclining at table and heard what Jesus said said to him, well, I see this as a big fact. I don't know why, but I see him saying a big fact. Whoa, blessed is everyone who shall eat bread in the kingdom of heaven. And I almost see them clinking their glasses as if that were a toast. Whoa, blessed is everyone who eats. Hear, hear. Okay. As if they didn't hear at all what Jesus said, but they did hear, trying not to hear. Jesus undeterred then launches into another story that's gonna be even harder to ignore. Beginning in verse 16, Luke 14. But he said to him, the guy who just spoke up, a certain man was giving a big dinner. I'm gonna tell a story of my own, says Jesus. And he invited many people. And at the dinner hour, he sent his slave. When the dinner was ready, the time was then announced. He sent a slave to those who had been invited already and said they would come. Come, for everything is ready now. But they all alike began to make excuses. The first one said to him, I have bought a piece of wood. Look at it, please consider me excused. Another one said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out. Please consider me excused. And another one said, I have married a wife, and for that reason I cannot come. And the slave came back and reported this to his master. And the head of the household became angry and said to his slave, Then go out at once into the streets and the lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and the crippled and the blind and the lame. There they are again. And the slave said, Master, what you have commanded, we've already done. And still there is room at this table because my master's table is a very big table. And the master said to the slave, then go out into the highways and along the hedges and into the alleyways and compel them to come that my house may be filled for. I tell you, picture where he's saying this. Picture who he's saying this to you too. For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste of my dinner. One chapter previous, he said, many will come from the east and the west, from places you would never expect, people that you would never accept, who will recline a table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, but the sons of the kingdom who think they're the sons, who think they belong, will be cast into outer darkness. Jesus was fearless. He ought to be your hero. If he isn't, you don't know him. You don't know him. Now, to really understand how edgy, and I think even just, I mean, you don't have to know a lot of inside stuff for you to know that that's very confrontational, that story he just told. But to really get it, we need to know some things. First, first, the people who are begging off to party here in verses 18 to 20 were people who had already been invited and said they would come. The reason we know that is not because it's in the text, but because historically we know about the process of invitation for an event like this and what that process would be. The process was two stages. One, the host would extend the invitation, and it would be indicated at the time of the invitation that it would be on such and such a date, but the time was not included. That's why when the dinner was ready, it says, the slave would go out and tell them the dinner's ready. But people, when the invitation was sent out, would accept or turn it down. And so the slave, when the dinner is ready, is going to people, he's not going to everybody. He's going to the people who said, yeah, we want to be part of the kingdom party. There are people who said yes, that the slave is going to and saying, dinner is served. But now when the slave goes out to say dinner is on, you said you'd come, they all begin to beg off. And they beg off with these really lame excuses. I don't know if you noticed that. And in fact, when you realize, they already say, oh yeah, we're kingdom people, we're sons of the kingdom, we belong at the table. When you know that's the kind of people he's talking about, and now they're saying, oh no, I can't come now. That's when actually the excuses begin to look even more lame. I bought some land and I need to look at it. That's like saying, I just bought a house and I didn't see it, so now I've got to go look at it. And I have to look at it right now. I bought some oxen and I need to try them out. It's like saying, I bought a car, but I didn't drive it, but I need to drive it today. Just when you're, bummer, just when you're banquets. Here's what's happening. The people in Jesus' story, Jesus is concocting a story where the people in it are deliberately attempting to snub and humiliate the host by refusing to come when they already said they would because they know that they're the A-list guests. And if they don't go to the party, ain't no party. So we ain't going. Now, connect the dots to what's really going on in this scene. Jesus is telling the story to who or whom or who or whom. Email me and tell me which. he's telling this story according to verse 1 to the leaders of the pharisees to the invited guests to those who are reclining at table he's telling the stories the story to people who saw themselves as the righteous as the ones who belonged at the table they were the sons of the kingdom in the story jesus himself is the one who like the servant is announcing the banquet is ready i mean that has been jesus ministry he came preaching the kingdom of heaven is within your reach. The reign of God is here, and the way you will enter into it is my way. Who are the ones refusing to come in Jesus' story? They are the very people he's reclining at table with, and they know exactly what he's saying because every one of them reclining at this table relative to the kingdom party thing are people who said, we will be at the table. we're just waiting for the kingdom we are the sons of the kingdom but when Jesus came proclaiming it's here through me they all said no way not you but guess what guess who else is sitting guess who else is around this table listening to what's going on remember you have people reclining at table you have others at the table not reclining and others on the outskirts watching. On the outskirts watching, they're hearing Jesus say what he's saying to those reclining at table. And on the outskirts are the unclean, the misfits, the riffraff, the em-ha-erats. And while Jesus is talking, the Pharisees are feeling their temperature rise, but these guys are feeling their hopes rise. If what he's saying is true, this rabbi here, who is probably going to get killed for what he's saying to these Pharisees. But if what he's saying is true, there is room at the table for me. Jesus continues, verse 21, go out at once, quickly, as if to say drop everything you're doing. This is in his story. Why? Because there's just nothing more important than inviting people to this banquet. So go to the streets and the lanes or the alleys. Who's in the streets? Who's in the streets? in the metaphor, symbolically, the people who are in the streets are just regular people. They live in houses. They're just the people you're going to meet this afternoon walking around. Who are in the alleys? You know who's in the alleys? The wrong kind of people. That's the symbolism there. Bring in, bring in the lame and the poor and the crippled and the blind. Who are they? Again, the wrong kind of people. Verse 22, the servant responds, we're all over it, master. We are in full invitational mode and they're coming. And then, and then one of the greatest kingdom phrases in all of Scripture, if you're an underliner of Scripture, you might want to underline this. It says at the end of verse 22 there, and there is still room at the table because our Father's table is a very large table. And do you know who he wants at it? Everybody. Everybody. So go out again, he says, to the servant and compel them. What does that mean to compel them? Well, believe it or not, this is bizarre, but this verse, compel them to come to the table, has been used historically by some to force conversion. Isn't that weird how people, I mean, in the Crusades, this was one of the verses they had in their little packet of their obedience to God. Compel them, force them, cut their heads off if they don't. God bless you. Anyway, its meaning is clear, though. And it wasn't anybody listening to the story and understanding anything of the social etiquette of the day. Just think about it. If you were at the bottom of the social scale, if you were the Amharat, sitting at the outside of this banquet, feeling like you didn't belong at the table, in fact that's the message you got your whole life you don't belong you're not invited and all of a sudden you got an invitation to the party which said no no we're going to put you at the head of the table you're invited to the party and the invitation came from a wealthy master would you assume he was serious or not serious would you assume that maybe he was kidding you might assume not only is he kidding you might assume he's inviting you to set you up to bring you to the banquet so he can make fun of you when you come because you're so common. What are you doing here? Who let you in? So compel them, he said. That's why Jesus said compel them. Go out of your way to convince them that they really are invited to the table. And maybe one way you can convince them of that is by inviting them to yours. No, you can't force them to come. This is not some Pollyanna, everybody will want to come if you invite them. No, they won't. Get out of here. They won't all want to come. But do everything you can to convince them that there's room at the table, that there's room at your table, and that they can come the way they are. Why? Because Jesus reversed the order. Remember the Pharisees? I love it. It's so great. Anyway, I've told you this before. I like it when you talk back, but I always cut you off. So anyway, we have this dysfunctional relationship here. and the other thing about clapping is when one person claps and other people clap because they're going i don't want him to be alone okay okay i feel sorry for him yeah yeah right oh yeah uh that's fun yeah if you're visiting this is a loony church yeah yeah Yeah, that's what gets the applause. That's good. I like it. I love it here. This is why I belong here. Okay. Remember the Pharisees. Jesus reversed the order. Remember the Pharisees said, you get clean first, you get well first, then you can come. Jesus said, come the way you are. But here's the key. It's not to just stay. Just come the way you are and follow me. Yes, what he said to Matthew, he didn't say, oh, it's great that you're ripping people off. off Matthew. He didn't say that. He said, Matthew, I love you. I'll welcome you to my table. Follow me and learn my way. And I promise you, if you follow the rabbi and you learn the rabbi's way, you will become clean. You cannot follow the rabbi's way and not become clean. You cannot follow it and not become whole and not become healed. all of which raises the question again the question that Jesus raised in a variety of places in a variety of ways he was such a good rabbi in the way he taught the questions among others are these who was welcome at the table and who was not more pointed who was welcome at your table and who is not because it's not the healthy who need a physician but the sick Matthew 9 but that raises the question who really is sick? Is it the righteous who thinks they're healthy or is it the sick who knows they're not? And how do the sick get well after all? Turns out the first step for some of them is knowing that they've been invited to the table of the king and turns out that sometimes the way they figure out that that really is true is that they got invited to your table. So you want to have a healing ministry, do you? Well, don't start by renting a Target Center. Start by inviting a sick person over. But when you're sure they're sick, ask yourself a question as you condescendingly invite a sick person. Who really is the sick one? I'm serious. It constantly raises questions. Are you into that? You need to do that. It's the way of the rabbi. It's the way of the rabbi. And you invite this sick person over, and you sit at a table, and all of a sudden you start learning things from them, and you go, I'm the sick one, and they're the healthy one. Oh, well, they're the sick one, and I'm the healthy one. And round and round and round it goes, and there's humility and grace, and people start getting healed. Let me close with some questions while I'm in this rabbinic mode. I'm serious let me just leave you some questions where do you find yourself in the story it's some good journal fodder where do you find yourself in the story are you pretty sure you're reclining at the table if you see yourself as one who's reclining at the table why is it because you believe the right thing about Jesus that you're a son of the kingdom that you signed a card? Or is it because you're following the way, the rabbi's way? And because you're following the rabbi's way, not perfectly, you're stumbling, but you're following the rabbi's way, you just know the rabbi, I belong at this table. Then, or do you identify a little bit more with the Amharats, kind of on the outside, wondering if you belong? Hearing this is really good news that maybe I can come. Another question, it's just good journal fodder. How big is your table? How big is your table? See, that's an interesting question because it puts a spin on the question I just asked because if you find yourself identifying, yeah, I really identify with the Yamaha Rats. I don't identify with those Pharisees at all. I really identify with the ones who kind of know they're sick and need a savior. But when I ask how big is your table, if your table's really small and just it's kind of everybody just like you, then the truth is you're way more like the Pharisee. I hate to spoil your day there. Odd thing, actually. How big your table is tells you something about whether you're at the table. So go and learn what this means. I desire compassion and not sacrifice. Okay, aren't you going to tell us what that means, Dave? No, no. Go. You can do this. Go and learn what this means. Bring it to God. Play it over in your mind. What does it mean? I desire compassion, not sacrifice. One place it will bring you to is a much larger table. You know what? I'm a pastor of this church, and you know what kind of church I want to have? A really big church. I want to have a really big church. How many of you know I'm not talking about numbers? I want a big church with a real wide door that says, people, come just the way you are. Let me make it real clear what we're doing here. We are learning to follow the rabbi. We are learning to follow the rabbi. And we absolutely believe that as sick, I don't know who the sickest person here is. I don't know who you are. If you, like us, begin to learn to follow the way of the rabbi, you will become clean. You will become whole. You will become healthy. You will become a son or a daughter of the kingdom of God. And I think that's the gospel. Let's pray as we close. Would you stand with me? Some from the prayer team will be up here to receive anybody who needs prayer for whatever might have been stirred in your spirit. Some of you might need prayer. Some of you don't. I would encourage you to just kind of take some of these questions and go with them today. But let's just pray. Father, I thank you for your son, Jesus. We're thankful for him for so many reasons. But today, we're thankful that he's such a good rabbi, such a good teacher. such a courageous one who's willing to ask questions that make some people angry and stir people up but it's all to call them to life I pray the work of the rabbi the voice of the rabbi I pray would have been heard today by the sinners and by the righteous by anybody who wants to come to the table and I pray Father that you would make us a bigger people a bigger church with bigger tables full of people who are learning to follow the way of the rabbi. And all God's people said, Amen. Amen.
