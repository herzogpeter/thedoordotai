Um, it's going to be on the screen if you don't want to do that, but there's, uh, some interesting verses there. This, these verses are the bookend, uh, between some verses at, uh, the beginning that talk about Jesus beginning to heal and preach the good news. And then we, Dave's gone through various of those healings and he may, he may come back and do a couple more of those texts, but this, this is the other end of that. And Jesus did healings after this as well, after some, there's some teaching passages in Matthew, but here's what it says. Jesus went through all the towns and villages teaching in their synagogues proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness when he saw the crowds he had compassion on them and here's the words because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd now one thing I know because of another passage we're going to look at in a minute is some of that harassing was the fact that not all of them in fact many of them didn't get healed and Jesus looked on them with compassion and it wasn't that he couldn't heal them it's just that as he took on this body of flesh and blood like us he was limited and he did what he could but he'd get tired and also his mission wasn't to heal everybody here it was to bring the gospel and these healings were to be signs of the kingdom that was already coming with him but not yet fully here we live in the already and then not yet. And so this fact is kind of proved by Mark chapter 1, 32 through 39. If you want to turn there, it'll be up on the screen. Jesus has just healed Simon Peter's mother-in-law. And that evening after sunset, because it was the Sabbath, the people started coming to a house there. That evening after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. The whole town gathered at the door. And Jesus healed many, not all, who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons. Not everybody who had a demon got the demon driven out. But he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was. And then it says that early that next morning, as it was his habit, not the habit of the disciples yet, he would go out to pray way before dark and be with his father for replenishment. see spiritual replenishment and in this time early in jesus's ministry before the disciples figured out what was happening in those prayer times and that you needed to take a break they come running after him and they're searching everywhere and peter's a little upset kind of like jesus's parents was when he was 12 and he stayed back in jerusalem and where where are you jesus and they find him and Peter says, everyone is looking for you. And he turns to his disciples and he says, come on, let's go. And he doesn't meet those people back at the town and he leads his disciples to another place to minister. He says, I've come to preach the good news. So he didn't heal everybody and yet the kingdom is already here and there are times in revival, in renewal, and God bring it to us when he heals a bunch of people. Huh? You want that? He can do that. He doesn't do it unless you ask. Sometimes he'll just land because he wants to do that. But most of the time, for most of the people in this life, we need to think about what we do when God says not yet or no. Now, I also have another reason why I'm preaching. it's because I have continuing pain that I live with, chronic pain, every day. Some of you heard my halo talks. I've had like halo talk one, halo talk two. What's a halo? Well, let's look at this picture. Now, that is not some kind of open-door church discipline that was exercised on me. That's this thing that keeps your neck straight. What happened? I didn't have a, so you can heal, and there's actually spikes, and I've got the thing right here. They chip holes, two in the front, two in the back and they set these pins into your actual bones so it held straight so I got the marks right here and I can't see them back there and then I got this scar on my neck where the operation was you might ask what kind of did you get in an accident or something no I just had a congenital spinal bone thing with my vertebrae a disease that just all of a sudden showed up with a lot of spurring and some of the things and then I started to lose all the strength in this arm so my wife could just push this arm down. That tells you something's wrong. And she usually doesn't win wrestling matches with me. So, and if that had continued and I hadn't had the operation, I could have been paralyzed because it was continuing to adhere to the actual spinal cord. So for eight hours in the surgery, I got a plate. They cleaned everything up, took off top two vertebrae, put some donor bone in there and then put a plate with two screws at C3 and then two screws at C6. Now those of you who know about cervical and lumbar stuff, you're watching movies and a guy gets it right here with an arrow, you go, oh, C4, C4. You know the neck, you know the back, you know the spine. So you know what I'm talking about. Now we've had a lot of fun with this whole thing during that time. I was home for two weeks, and if you could show the next slide. This is actual. I didn't make this up. I became a living Christmas tree for the staff because I was home for Christmas, and the operation was early in December. So they dressed me up, and I sang a carol to them as Terry videotaped me because I couldn't be there. And God does give joy in the midst of that stuff, but I've got a lot of pain. Some days it's lower. Some days it's higher on a pain scale. what I used to call an eight is now a four and what I mean, the pain hasn't gone down it's just that actually my pain level is rising the general pain of it and I'll probably go in for another look at the medical stuff but I keep on asking God to take it away some days it's so bad I start gagging the muscles in my the operation had some kind of residual effect on my body where my body doesn't like it and so my muscles cramp up my head sometimes feels like it's starting to happen right now because I'm tired. And like I have a big concrete block on my head. And then sometimes the pain will go right down my back and across my shoulders like a cross. And so, you know, how do you deal with that kind of stuff, huh? That's what we want to talk about today. I know many of you might deal with chronic pain. Well, we're going to see that there's a lot of pain in our lives. And it's kind of relative. When I was in high school and a girl wouldn't go on a date with me, I thought I was going to commit suicide. So your pain is kind of all relative, right? It's relative. And God wants to do something in whatever pain you experience in this life. Just before we read some verses that have become for me an incredible teaching passage from 2 Corinthians 12, verses 7-13, I want to pray and ask the Holy Spirit to come. Because I believe today God can heal some people. Today he heals. The already is here. I've seen people be healed. I've been a part of praying for people and they've been healed. And I've prayed for other people who don't get that healed and they're still asking but they need sustaining grace. Let's pray right now. Lord, as we read your word, we ask that you be with everyone here today. That your spirit would fall on us. That you, the great healer, the great physician, Lord Jesus, you would come and touch us. Speak your word that heals. Just you say it, and it will be done. And we ask this in your name, to your glory. Amen. Let's look at that passage. Let's read that. It's up on the screen, starting with verse 7, chapter 12, 2 Corinthians. To keep me from becoming conceited, Paul says, because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness. Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses and insults and hardships and persecutions and difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it. I ought to have been commended by you, for I am not in the least inferior to the super apostles, even though I am nothing. The things that mark an apostle, signs, wonders, and miracles, were done among you with great perseverance. How were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was never a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong. The title of my message today is, What do we do when God says, not yet, to your healing? Some of you in that place. But I want to back up and just first do some exegesis of this passage because there's some things in here we've got to understand. The first one is this. What is this thorn in the flesh? And there have been all kinds of conjectures about it. The first thing you've got to know, when it says that this thorn was a tormenting thing, this isn't a pebble in your shoe or a sliver in your thumb. You know, it's a little thing. You kind of get used to it. And, you know, maybe you don't do anything about it. And the body works its way out of that. Or stop your car and get out and take that pebble out. Let's think. What could we... A kidney stone. How many of you had a kidney stone? You know what that's like? The nurse, when I had mine, said to me that this might be a little bit of what it feels like, Keith, for your wife when she had that baby. Just a little bit. And I waited for that thing. And you know, when that thing finally passed, it was just a tiny little thing. If it was in my foot, I wouldn't even feel it. But it was in the right place. And at that time, it kind of served as an interesting thing, because I was really in pain at that time. And it was like, God, he allowed me to have this kidney stone. It was like he was stepping on my toes so my head wouldn't hurt anymore. Pain's relative. What was this thorn? Well, there are all sorts of possibilities. We can't get into this, but it could have been physical. A lot of people land on that. It might have been malaria when he traveled in areas and he just picked out and couldn't shake it. It could have been his eyesight, his eyes. In Galatians, he says to the Galatians, you would have given me your own eyes. That's how much you love me. It might have been when he was blinded on the way to Damascus, even though he was healed of that, that maybe there was some residual healing that didn't happen. So he could see, but maybe there was still some pain. Yeah, some think epilepsy, speech impediment. some head pain, some neurological chronic pain. Well, when you're flogged five times, and think the passion of Christ right now, okay, when you're beat three times, when you're stoned one time, and that was halfway through his ministry, you might have some pain in your body. I was talking to John Perkins. How many remember John Perkins, African-American pastor, was here? He talked about how he was beaten, and that was so instrumental in his life, God got a hold of him and cured him of his anger at others of others' races that were inflicting pain on him. I was in the car with him. We were taking him over to the upper room because he was speaking over there with Kurt and Stephan. And I was talking to him about Paul and my own pain. And I was thinking, you know, I wonder how Paul dealt with that. And John all of a sudden said, you know, I still get pain. I wake up at night and I can still feel those people beating me on my head. It's just as painful as that evening. And he had to have a year and a half of outpatient care. They took a fork and after he, he didn't tell you this, took a fork and took it up his nose. See, the body can remember pain. And some others think it might have been emotional, some kind of depression, a sadness. You ever feel sad? You ever feel so sad that it makes you despair of living? Paul talked about that in 2 Corinthians 1. You read that. He was so sad about whatever was happening, the attacks on him. Or maybe social relational. Some think that this was the opposition of people who were using his own thorns. He can't speak well against him. He can't even get a healing himself or his eyes. Don't listen to him. So some think it was the opposition of someone who was opposing. Do you have someone opposing you? An enemy, thorn in your flesh, robbing you of your joy? So some think it was spiritual. Maybe a severe temptation. A severe temptation. If you deal with addiction, your addiction, some people are just healed like that one, become Christians, lifted off. Other people, most people, takes a long time. And that addiction's power, when you start to face that with Jesus and help, that thing starts to really kick in. You know what I'm saying? Because you're now stopping medicating with that, and now it's going to be a battle. And for some, that battles a lifetime of staying sober. And they receive some peace, but that thing's always there. So what is the thorn? Well, we can't go on. I've got to finish this sermon before 1215. We don't know. So sometimes when God does that, it's like fill in the blank time. What thorn do you have? Can you relate to Paul? Can you relate to Paul? The second is, what is this messenger of Satan in verse 7? What is that? Does God bring evil? Does God bring thorns? He doesn't. You know where thorns came from, right? The evil one brought it to the Garden of Eden. Not God. The evil one brought this fallenness, and then God's judgment had to come because sin had come into the world and evil. So God allows those things to happen because we live in a free world where he's created us free, created the angels free, created you and me free, And we have chosen to turn away from him, bring in evil. So God's one, he does not bring any evil. It's not from him. There's no shadow of turning in him. He does not bring temptation. So what is this language? Well, this language is what I call sovereign language. And it's in the scripture. Often when God allows something, he's so powerful, it's as if he does it. See what I mean? It's sovereign language. And I love sovereign language because it does another thing for us. Sometimes we can think underneath our thorn that God and Satan have about the same power. And they're like, you know, it's like an Xbox. And God's got a controller and Satan's got a controller. And it's who presses the hardest or something. It's not the fact. Sovereign language reminds us that God is in control. He's going to take it away. He's going to deliver you. May not be yet. So what is he going to do for us in the meantime? Well, that brings up this last question. What does this verse mean? Well, here's what the verse means. It means that God's going to heal you. If he hasn't already, he will. But he wants to do something else in you if right now he's not delivering you, he wants to sustain you and do some things in you. Now, we've got a practical question. Does Paul know what healing's all about? I mean, has he ever attended Dave's messages on healing? I mean, would he? No, well, actually, he wrote some of the books that Dave is preaching from right now, like 1 Corinthians 12. so I think he knows that but let's really kind of put this on Paul what about Paul? well first of all he was healed himself he was healed himself and so he knew that people who get healed they turn out some of them if they stay in that healing and it's not just physical because some people walk away from their physical healing like the ten lepers only one really kept their healing going that we know of maybe the others did But for some, they take that healing and they don't live a thankful life for God. But for some, that's God's wake-up call. And maybe you need that. He knows what you need. Maybe he can just lift that thorn from you, and that will be the beginning of a tremendous ministry and life for you. But what if he doesn't? What about this experience Paul has? It was used against him. Well, look at how powerful. He preached one time so long, and I'm not going to do this today, but he preached so long, up until midnight, it says, and there was a guy up on the third floor, wherever they were at, he was preaching, and the lamps, you know, all the smoke was getting up in this high window this kid was sitting in, and he fell out and died, and then Paul rushed down, and he laid his body on him, breathed on him, and asked God to raise him from the dead, and he rose him from the dead, and then Paul went back up preaching again. You know, doesn't he learn? You know, he's preaching, killed one guy. How many people can you raise from the dead in one sermon, you know? he knew healing did he really want to be healed? maybe that's his problem he just didn't want to enough man this is the word pleading here he wanted to he really wanted to so what do we learn? let me give you four lessons here in the time that we've got four lessons that I've learned and I'm learning I'm beginning to learn I haven't learned these I'm not ready to pass a test on any of these yet but I'm beginning to learn these, but Paul did. He passed the test on these. First, it's right in the passage. First, we want to back up and say, if you have a thorn and you have never asked to be delivered of it, before you ask for sustaining grace, or as you ask for that, start asking for deliverance. To really ask for sustaining grace and you've never asked for delivering grace, you haven't asked enough yet. See, the already is here. do you believe it do you want it start asking now this pleading that paul did was not three little prayers oh lord you know heal me if it's your will three times these were three and they weren't even three times coming to the altar for healing this was three protracted seasons maybe months, maybe years, when he went and pled with the Lord. And you know, it's no gimmick to this, right? Dave's already talked, no formula. So he pled for a while. I'm in between seasons of pleading. I'm still pleading. But God says, you know, it's okay. I'll just walk with you for a while. I haven't healed you yet, but, and I'm going to enter into another season of pleading. Because see, I've seen people be healed. I've prayed for people and they've been healed. On our message team is Shani Parker. Shani Parker had a condition here that afflicted her for I don't know how long it was, but her eye was closed and her face would droop, almost like kind of a facial palsy, and then her shoulders had droop. Doctors couldn't figure it out. We were praying for her. Todd Hunter was here for a series. She got prayed for. It was shortly after that. She said, I'm out of town. She calls me, Keith, I'm healed. Praise God. He still heals, right? And so I got back and here was her face open, her eyes open. It was incredible. God heals. You believe it. Maybe today at the prayer time, you need to begin. Maybe you'll heal you today, but maybe you need to begin today to ask to be delivered and sustained. The second lesson is if you have asked and the thorn hasn't been taken away yet, he will make a way through for you. Some of you, maybe this is new news. For those of you, this is a good reminder. The last couple of services, I have people say, thank you, thank you. I needed to remember that again. He'll make a way through. You see, there's two kind of graces here. Paul was asking for delivering grace in verse 8. Take it away. Take it off. Deliver me. The other grace that Jesus said to him, my grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness. That's sustaining grace. You should ask for both of those. But after you've asked for delivering grace, and as you've asked for that, God wants to give you sufficient grace. Now, one is not greater than the other. Although it might be argued that, well, look at the delivering power. It's so, wow, when that happens, shiny, wow. I mean, that's like heaven just hitting earth. But see, sustaining grace is more like a rain. And some might argue that that's more powerful. Some of us know about that. Sustaining grace is going to take us to heaven to be finally delivered. It's going to take us through anything. So don't put one against the other. My daughter, Kara, both of my kids, they have thorns that we've passed on, and thorns of their own. We all have that stuff. But Kara had a thorn. It was a speech anxiety in high school as a sophomore. She was scared to death to speak in front of people. And so Kara was just pleading with God to take it away, And I was pleading with her. And then I said, Kara, you know, if God doesn't take this, this is before I had any of my pain, okay? I taught this stuff. I didn't really know it. But I knew it was true because the Bible said it. And I said, if God doesn't take that anxiety off of you, just trust him to get you through it. What's the worst that could happen? Well, I'll get red in the face and I'll stumble and I'll maybe even leave the room crying. And I said, and so what? Can God take you through that? I suppose. and she began to just be with God in it. And that began a prayer life for her. You see, if you start asking, you might start praying more. And that sustaining grace can begin to build a real relationship with Christ. But if you never ask, you never really get the depths of that relationship. So she did that. A little bit later, when my pain was in, and it was just before the operation, I was in tremendous pain. I was upstairs hoping Kyle or Kara couldn't hear me because I was mad at God. It was a Job chapter whatever, you know, a black moment, a dark moment for me. That next morning, Kara says, Dad, I heard you. I didn't know that. I'm like, oh, honey, I'm so sorry. I wouldn't want anybody to hear my pain but God around that. She said, Dad, you know, I got something to share with you. If he doesn't take this off of you, might he take you through it and my own daughter don't teach your kids to pray pray back on you you know well let's go to our third lesson Jesus I want to camp a little bit on this one Jesus if he doesn't take your thorn away if he says not yet to you he's going to bring some other things that are in the already in the kingdom here they are some other kingdom benefits other than just delivering grace. Sustaining grace can build in you. I'm just going to say them in rapid fire here. First, a deep, and we've already kind of talked about this, a deep and abiding secret intimacy with God. You want that? One little holy of holies in your heart, a little retreat center you can go to all the time, often through a thorn. God will create one of those. second if you do that long enough you'll begin to have more of a Christ like character of long suffering love a Christ like character and I don't have time to unpack all these I don't need to you just start asking they will come Jesus has this mystical way of doing what you ask for you don't need to even know how it all works he'll teach you a third would be a confounding and confusing ministry effectiveness a confounding in other words I haven't been healed but people are being healed through me what's this? and then finally and I love this one a bold kingdom obsession with heaven so that you're really good on earth and you bring joy in the midst of sadness in the midst of sorrow in the midst of pain just like today this thing's on me but I've seen joy spill out in two services heaven can break through well let's look at the first one deep and abiding intimacy with God this one is so cool you know if you start talking to somebody and telling them your deepest pain it might be a counselor it might be your spouse it might be a friend but make it God first if you start doing that on a regular basis he talks back if you'll just listen for a minute and he'll begin to talk to you about his love and he'll talk over the pain. You know, the pain talks and it tells you he doesn't love you. It tells you he's really not going to ever take this away. You're consigned with this forever. It feels like it. But if you begin to talk to Jesus about that, he'll talk to you and you will get close and there will be this garden of Eden in your heart that grows and the thorns will just, Well, they'll just take their place. You want that? I do, and I've experienced that. I've begun to. The second benefit is that of a Christ-like character of long suffering. There were two Christians. Now, Paul says here, Jesus said to him, now I want you to get this, this intimacy thing. Jesus began to get in with Paul. How many of you have a red-letter edition of the Bible, And you see that the Gospels are full of Jesus' own words, right? When Jesus speaks, when somebody else says it's in black. In the book of Acts, Jesus speaks less. You know, he starts it out. But then he does reveal himself to Paul sometimes and speaks. And then back in the Revelation, Jesus speaks. But the only place in the rest of the letters where Jesus' words are in red is this verse here. When it says, but he said to me, that wasn't his thoughts. That was an actual saying, appearing of Jesus to Paul. Like he did on the road to Damascus, he actually appeared and talked to him. Paul, Paul, why do you, Saul, Saul, why do you kick against the goats? Okay, here, my grace is sufficient for you, for my power is perfected. And the word there is about character. The power to change you is perfected in the midst of weakness as you come to me and we get intimate. You'll become like me. You look at me enough, you'll become like me. You go to me enough, you'll become like me. There were two Christians in my family history. On my mother's side, and then on my dad's side, my grandpa, Teddy Ebner, my great-grandma, Lynette Reif. They both were the first to become Christians in their German immigrant families here in America. Teddy wrestled with a thorn. He died in his 30s. He hung himself in the basement of my grandmother's house, my mother's, and my mother was six. Teddy knew the Lord. Something happened there. I don't know if it's a chemical thing. Suicide is never the option. It's a permanent option to a temporary problem. But that thorn's been passed down. I struggle with that. How many of you struggle with depression? Yeah, how many of you struggle with keeping your place here in this life? God's taken me through that. But we had that. My Greek grandma, Reef, had a thorn as well. But she took it to Jesus. And I know Teddy tried to as well, but she was able to take it to Jesus. She fell away from Christ shortly after, the only person in her family, a Christian. Then she got sick. She had Parkinson. I just talked to my dad about it now. And she was bedridden and in pain the rest of her life. She sought healing from the Lord. People prayed healing over her. She came to a place where she didn't hear God's voice, but it was like, I'm just going to rest, that God's going to use me. And people would still pray for me when I'm not in a season of praying, and I'd take it any time. Todd Hunter, one time, first met him. Not when he was here at our church. He came to our church because I'd met him. And he heard from Dallas Willard of this pain I had. He said, Keith, I just heard about this. Can I pray for you? Man, I'll take John Wimber's understudy any time. So Grandma would let people pray for her, but Grandma didn't get healed. But you know what started to happen? Grandma, great-grandma Rafe, who I've never met, I'm going to meet, I can't wait, began to be a source of blessing and healing to others. People would just come to her to be cheered up because the character and life of God and intimacy was so deep. And so he can draw you closer to him, give you his character. Her life verse was this, Psalm 119.71. It's mine now. It was good for me to be afflicted. I just learned this from my dad. It was good to be afflicted. It was good for me to be afflicted so that I might learn your decrees. One of my favorite verses from that, Psalm 119, 45, is, I run in the paths of your commands for you have set my heart free. You know, affliction can kind of free you up. Even though it might feel like it binds you, it might free you up to be everything God wants you to be until you're delivered. Now, isn't that confounding? I mean, that's our third one. Confounding and confusing. that God could use us but not heal us. Huh? That's God. There's no formula to this. One day I was coming away to church and it was one of my days of bad pain when the kids tell me I'm like Eddie Munster or like Herman Munster. And you can see that in me when I'm really bad. I get so stiff. And we joke about it in our family. But I was not joking this morning. And somebody came alongside me and said, Pastor Keith, can I just say something? You know, let's walk and talk as we go to the service. I want to tell you, I've listened to the Halo Talk tapes, and I want to tell you, it is so ministered to me. Thank you so much. God has helped me in my pain. Well, you know, my first reaction was more like a Jonah. It was, you know, the part of me that still hasn't gotten that long-suffering thing. And I go, okay, God, that's fine. Use me. Yeah, use me. But then in the service, I came to my senses. And I said, dear, thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. How selfish of me. You're using me and I'm losing the joy. But I go in and out, you know. But I'm going to pass the test someday. Jesus is going to complete this thing in me. The last benefit, I love this one. Have you ever been obsessed with anything? everybody's obsessed with something addiction's an obsession deep obsession with something you can be obsessed with some really good things like young parents they're really obsessed with their kids have you ever seen a picture of this kid? our youth pastor Al Shuck I love that guy you know what? he just takes us a little too far I'll go out on my car and like almost every month there is this picture of Taylor looking at me underneath the windshield wiper. Now God will give, and I got a collection of those things if you want one. God will give you a kingdom obsession with heaven that will give you a different perspective on this life and its sorrows and sufferings so that you can be good for others and just spread joy. spread the joy of the already in the not yet you want to do that? you want to do that? what a great obsession the problem is we in America and this is an American dilemma we have it so good that we're beginning even in our teaching now both these books are good and both these pastors are good both these ministries are huge your best life now the purpose driven life now I'm not talking about the books but I'm talking about the fact that often, you know, those are bestsellers. I can't imagine that everybody's walking into this kind of life that's reading those. See? And I praise God, I hope we are. I hope there's a revival, but the signs of it aren't here. You see, we have more Christian books. I mean, Christian books and music is so lucrative that secular companies now bought those Christian companies and aren't producing that stuff. All right? We got seminaries and colleges and radio, and the level of Christian living here is just low. The fruit is low and it's getting lower all the time. Christians look more and more like those who don't claim any born again experience. More and more. Over in China, where the gospel is spreading the fastest and the strongest, they don't have any seminaries and the ones they have are underground or just the state ones. They don't have the kind of resources we have. But people are getting something. Where are they getting it? see they turn off they pray they meet with Jesus and people who are suffering in prison get delivered and they get sustained they get beaten up and sometimes God releases them they have miracles happen there all the time of sustaining and delivering grace you want to read about it read Jesus in Beijing incredible, incredible book Jesus in Beijing you won't find it at Northwestern but you will find it at Borders I'm not going to go commercial Northwestern people don't get mad at me but Jesus in Beijing David Aikman A-I-K-M-A-N it will just give you a blessing it will maybe help in your education in this stuff but we're so focused on this life folks we aren't like Paul who was obsessed with the already because he was living in heaven here listen to this verse it would be good if you want to begin to really see this happen in your life begin to memorize Colossians 3, 1 through 17. Our church would change dramatically. I just got through being at Denver Seminary, teaching the graduate course there for the first time on the lead course in formation there. I don't know why. Maybe I wore a halo. That's why they think I got something to say. But I asked those pastors to memorize the scripture. Do you want to know what happened? If we just had groups of family and friends and others just memorizing scripture and then in doing long passages like that, like that one will kill you. Good. It'll mortify your flesh and vivify your spirit. Since you've been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not things below, for you died to this life and your sin, and your life is now hidden with God in Christ. So you are living in the already. You are living, do you know, M.T. Wright says that when Jesus rose from the dead, it was like a second big bang. But it started in the spiritual world. And it's rippling through. You know, sometimes we get so orientated to this life and chasing our comfort here, we can even read a book like Purpose Driven Life and be driven as ever. We can read a book like Joel Osteen's book, and be careful with a little bit in there because sometimes it can be self-centered, that gospel. of health and wealth, and beat you up, beat others up, because God isn't going to give us anything we want on demand here. I don't care. We're king's kids, but like Paul said, this isn't our home. And see, you can be orientated to this life, doing lots of spiritual things but never getting spiritual. Or you can be orientated to this life doing all kinds of unspiritual things. a car, I had a truck that I bought in 97, put a lot of miles on it, 209,000 miles on that puppy. And here about two months ago, it got kind of silly because the window wasn't working. You got one of these things? I'm just, I get attached to things, you know, clothes, cars, food, all kinds of things. But anyway, I'm in this car, this truck, and the transmission starting to go 209th. I wanted to get to 300,000 miles in that thing. See, I want, there's a club actually for Ford owners, F-150s, right? I was at 200,000. So I brought it into my mechanic and he said, Keith, man, let it die. The life in this thing's gone. And so I had to try that on because I was so orientated to that car. And I did. I didn't get a new one because I hate that 30% depreciation the minute you leave the lot. You know what I mean? So I got this used one, but everything works. You know. I like new cars. I want to tell you, this body of yours could get delivered, could not. It's going to get delivered. This is not the body you're going to live in. You are going to live in a new, spiritually remade body. Now, he's going to take the same you, all right, with a new, whole new reality and make you new like your son. Don't get stuck on this life. Don't get stuck on whether you get healed here, delivered here. You're going to get delivered though. Last lesson. If God doesn't take your thorn now, it's not a question of whether he will heal you or if he will heal you. It's just when, because it's coming. There's no no in God's healing. It's just not yet. You can hang on to that one and pull you right into heaven. That's a promise of Jesus. Red letter promise of Jesus. My daughter, I'll close with this. I asked for permission for all this, and I asked the permission of the parents of this friend of my daughter. My daughter, during the summer, two years ago, took a job where she took a person who was severely challenged, severely challenged in lots of ways. His name is Mike, and Mike has to wear a diaper. He's 20 years old. He doesn't say any words except for bye-bye and da-da. He watches videos, almost the same ones, every single day. Kyle knows about this because when he comes to our house, when Kara has him during the summer, When she gets home from breaks, he'll just sit there and rock and clap as he watched the video. Ha ha, ha ha ha ha ha, like that. And sometimes he'll get up and dance around. And Kara, after two weeks, when she first did this, she said, Dad, I just don't know. Nobody was asking. She asked, you know, they asked, would you like this job? She wanted to try. I said, honey, you can take this off of yourself. Nobody's, you know, it's okay. You're not a failure if you can't do this. It's just not God's thing for you. I said, but let's do this. And I did it to her again. If he doesn't, you know, lead you to take Mike away, maybe he'll take you and Mike through. So she started praying, and she started being with Mike in a different way. And Mike and her are best buds. Mark and Terry just cry because there's nobody who takes an interest in Mike beyond those who have to, except for Kara. She has him on her cell phone. Picture? Smiling face, because when Sneezy sneezes in the video in Snow White, he likes that. It's one of the things that'll make him smile on his face. One of the few things. I'm almost the only thing. And so then he'll say to me, I'll go, and he'll just, and joy just fills his face. There's one other thing that fills his face with joy. And then he says, he goes, which means do it again. So he's got bye-bye and dada. All right? and I'll do it again but there's another person who brings a smile to his face that's Kara they have so bonded and she's given the gift to Kara Kara now wants as her major to deal with severely challenged autistic kids she took her time to discernment in the last few months and that came up with that and Mark and Terry will every once in a while say with tears in their eyes we just wish that Kara and you would know how wonderful it is Kara's been in Mike's life he knows the word Kara now he can hear that and sometimes one time he heard Kara on some news or some TV thing he ran to the door and was just waiting for her and we had to tell him she's not today I said to Mark and Terry you guys don't have to worry about Mike saying thank you he's going to say thank you he's going to be healed he's going to be in heaven and those two are going to have a thank you fest. With Mike saying thank you and Kara saying thank you and we're going to be standing there weeping going, da-da. Do it again. You know, you're going to be delivered to your thorn too. And we're all going to be going. Thank you, Lord. Praise you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Joel's got a song. I want to ask the Lord to tabernacle now. I think he's here. I know he's here. And for some of you, you maybe need to begin asking for your healing. You might have it today. There's going to be prayer people. I'm going to ask you to stand. And the prayer people, would you come down right now? And then I'm going to ask you, if God's speaking to you now, don't wait. Come now. Those of you who can stay, maybe you want to just sit and pray, but I'd ask you to quietly, if you can't, after the song is done, And Joel just keeps strumming, but after it's gone, to then depart, not until then. Just listen to these words. But if you need prayer, would you come right now? Sustaining grace, delivering grace. Some of you, right now, God's raising up faith in you to be healed. Come down right now. And let him do what he wants to do in you. Joel. Thank you.
