Open your Bibles to Exodus chapter 34. Be dealing a little bit in chapter 33 and all of chapter 34. Several weeks ago, in the course of our study in the book of Exodus, we began a series of sermons designed to answer a singular question. Born of Moses' desire in Exodus 33 to first know the ways of God and then to see the glory of God, the question was this. What are the ways of God that reveal the glory of God to the people of God? Well, as of two weeks ago, we had identified seven of those ways. As we came to chapter 34, we identified an eighth. Richly revealed in the text, it was this. That one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God to the people of God is the amazing grace of God. Amazing grace. Not as revealed in the Old Testament or in the New Testament alone. but here in the Old Testament as well was grace. Not only as the basis of the new covenant but also as the basis of the old covenant. Amazing grace, the basis of the Mosaic covenant. That's news to some people. For the amazing grace of God we discovered two weeks ago has always been God's way. It is one of the fundamental ways of God that consistently reveals the glory of God. Now, finding grace in the Old Testament as being central to the Mosaic Covenant was so exciting to me that it created a concern as to how to unpack this thing. The information we're dealing with spreads over a large section of Scripture from chapter 33, verse 18 through all of chapter 34, 41 verses in total. And it reveals a truth that many of us do not expect to find in the Old Testament. So the possibility existed, I thought, that we could actually look at this section and miss the truth. To make sure that didn't happen, we decided to do two things. Remember? Number one, we decided we were going to dive in, get the big picture all at once, as if this information was a pool. We were going to jump in, get used to the water, splash around a little bit, and then get out of the pool, towel off, go back to the beginning, shallow into the pool, and then today, by way of review, wade in. Number two, we're going to wade in, picking up important details, subtle nuance that brings color and texture and deeper understanding. Today, what I want to do is, by way of review, dive back in. Get used to the water again. Become familiar with the theme. Know what's going on and then get out. Deal then with the details. It all began in chapter 33, verse 18, with this audacious request of Moses to see the glory of God. God's response to that request, verse 19, was essentially this. I will show you my glory. Here's how I'll do it. I will make myself, verse 19, to make all my goodness pass before you. I will proclaim the name of the Lord before you, and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show compassion on whom I will show compassion. In other words, I'm going to reveal my glory to you, Moses, by doing three things. Number one, I will do it by showing you my goodness. Number two, I will do it by proclaiming to you my name. And my name is this. Number three, I will be gracious. That is my name. I will show compassion. That is my name. And sure enough, in chapter 34, verse 6, when he did show his glory. That's exactly what he did. Then the Lord passed by in front of Moses and proclaimed his name. The Lord, the Lord God. I am compassionate, gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving kindness and truth. I keep loving kindness for thousands and forgive iniquity, transgression, and sin. It's important to note and to be reminded again this morning that when God decides to pull back the veil and reveal his full-blown glory to Moses. What he reveals is his goodness. What he discloses is his grace. I will be gracious. And that is why I've been saying that one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God to the people of God is the amazing grace of God. Now, after God in chapter 33 tells Moses what he is going to do, I'm going to reveal my glory, he then in chapter 34 tells Moses what he wants Moses to do. That unfolds in verse 1. So the Lord said to Moses, here's what I want you to do. Cut out for yourself two stone tablets like the former ones. Remember the Ten Commandments? Exodus 20? We're going to do this again. And I will write the tablets, on the tablets, the words that were on the former tablets which you already shattered. So be ready by morning. Come up in the morning to Mount Sinai. Present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain. Verse 4, so he cut out two stone tablets like the former ones, and Moses rose up early in the morning, went up to Mount Sinai as the Lord commanded him, and he took two stone tablets in his hand. Verse 28 confirms now, if you had any doubt what he's doing. So Moses was there with the Lord 40 days and 40 nights. He did not eat bread or drink water, and he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments. What we obviously have here is the reforging of the Ten Commandments. shattered the first time by the spiritual adultery of the people when they erected the golden calf. God in Exodus 34 is saying an amazing thing. He's saying this, let's try this again. The question we answered last week or two weeks ago was this, why would he want to do it again? Here is why. Because the passionate love of God is not willing to relinquish his bride. So he passionately pursues her, that being Israel at this time, even in Israel's sin and spiritual harlotry. Verse 10, behold, I am going to make a covenant. There is a persistence, a determination in those words. It's as if God in verse 10 is saying this, we're going to become one. One way or another, it's going to happen. I'm going to make a way. And if that means rewriting these covenants, then that's what I'm going to do eventually, by the way. The way that God made was fully fulfilled by the precious blood of his only begotten son, enabling ultimately the bride of Christ to be what she could never be on her own, washed clean, holy, and blameless. But it's important for us to see as we study Exodus 34 that even before Christ ratified this new covenant with his precious blood, the Mosaic covenant built on the Ten Commandments was not just a list of rules that people were given and they had to do it in order to get God to love them. The fact is this, that the passionate love of God for his people was already a done deal. The covenant embodied in the Ten Commandments is God amazingly saying this. What he has always been saying to people he is calling to himself, I want more than an arrangement where I am the king and you are the subject. I want more than an arrangement where I am the ruler and you are the slave. What I am proposing is marriage, where I am the groom and you are the bride. In that scenario, the Ten Commandments are best understood as wedding vows. I, David, take thee, Bonnie, to be my wedded wife kind of vows. And I pledge myself to you and to you alone in a commitment that will last as long as life. That is the Mosaic covenant spirit. That is the new covenant spirit. I have no other lovers. I have no other gods but you. There was a problem, however. We discovered it in the story two weeks ago, and that was this, that while these vows were originally being written, before they could be exchanged between God and his people in Exodus 20, Israel had found another lover. Exodus 32, verse 8, and they made for themselves a molten calf and worshipped it, made sacrifices to it and said of it, this is our God, this will be our husband, this is who we want to marry, this will be the object of our affection. Picture that this way in a human arena. If you could see this in a human, anyone watching this scene unfold with eyes to see would say with incredulity You left him for that? You could have had the real deal and you settled for a cheap imitation. I suppose the golden calf is pretty. It's flashy. There is something attractive about it. But it doesn't take long to realize it has nothing of substance to offer. And if my friend was acting like this, I would say to them, with no small amount of irritation, I hope you had a real nice weekend fling. I hope you really enjoyed your little one-night stand because I think you really blew it this time. And if it was in the human arena, and I had a friend who acted that way, wounding the heart of someone that they really loved with a one-night stand, the proverbial golden calf deal, I would say to them, you know what? The problem you're going to have now is he's never going to want you back. the incredible thing about Exodus 34 is that in Exodus 34 God is saying to that kind of conversation be quiet David because I do want them back I do want her back verse 10 I am going to make a covenant with them and it will not be a marriage of quiet toleration if you give your heart to me God says in verse 10, I will do amazing things, perform miracles which have not been produced in all the earth, nor among any of the nations, and all the people among whom you live will see the working of the Lord, for it is an awesome thing that I am desiring to do in and through you, if you will be my bride, and enter into the covenant that is sealed by these vows. all I ask is this don't be dating anybody else saw that in verse 12 and 13 watch for yourself this is all I want from you that you make no covenant with anybody else don't get married to somebody else rather verse 13 I want you to tear down their altars smash their sacred pillars cut down their asherim I liken that last time to saying and I want you to take the pictures of your old boyfriends off the dresser, take their phone numbers out of your book. For you shall not worship any other god. You shall have no other husband. For the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous god. And the reason is because we're married. This is not just an arrangement. It's a marriage. I'm not just a king. I'm a groom. You shall make for yourself no molten gods. This let's try it again reality that we find in chapter 34 is simply this amazing grace. For one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God is the amazing grace of God. Okay, all of that I just gave you as review. So everybody out of the pool, we got the big picture, we're used to the water. Let's go back to the beginning. Now I'm going to show you the details. Three things in detail. I want us to see as we wade back in. I want us to see how the glory and grace of God are revealed. Number one, in the name of God. Number two, in the judgments of God. And number three, in the covenant of God. Let's look first of all at the proclamation of His name. Chapter 33 verse 19, 34 verse 6, I will proclaim my name. When I show you my glory, one of the ways I'm going to do that is by proclaiming my name. Now, the reason this caught my attention was because God did this once before with Moses in Exodus chapter 3. You may remember Moses in Exodus chapter 3 was struggling with the call of God that had just come to him through the wonder of this burning bush. And the call was this, to lead God's people out of slavery into freedom. Of that call, Moses had two questions. The first was this, who on earth am I to do this? Why should I have confidence, said Moses, that I can do what you're calling me to do. God's answer to that question was Exodus chapter 3 verse 12. Moses, it's not about who you are. It's about who I am, and I am with you. So go in the power and the authority and the confidence of who I am. Moses' second question was a really good one off of that answer. Okay, who are you? I mean, the first part was, why should I have confidence in me? Now my question is, why should I have confidence in you? To which God said this, I am the Lord, Yahweh. What God does in Exodus 3 to Moses in his need is proclaim his name, just like he does in Exodus 33, 19 and 34, verse 6. But in Exodus 3, get this, very important, The aspect of his name he proclaims is not his goodness and his grace, but in Exodus 3 when he proclaims his name, the aspect of his name that he reveals is his eternality and his power. Exodus 3 verse 15 says this, Moses, I am the Lord. Let me tell you what that means. I am the God of your father. I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He is speaking there of eternality. This is my name forever, And I will bring you up and out of your affliction, meaning I have power to do what I am telling you I will do through you. God proclaims his name to Moses in Exodus 3. He is saying to him this, I am eternal and I am powerful. I can do what needs to be done. Why did he do that? Why is that the aspect of his name that he proclaimed in Exodus 3? Here's why. Because at this time in Moses' life, that was the aspect of God's character he needed to know. It was as if Moses was saying to God this, God, if I'm going to say yes to this frightening call of going into Pharaoh's court and doing what it feels to me like it can't be done, here's what I need to know. I need to know that you're there. And God's answer was, not only am I there, I am eternally there. I am. I also need to know that you're strong, that you're capable, that you will be involved in this. And to that, when God proclaims his name, he says, I will bring you up and out and into a land that you do not know. But in chapter 34, when God does exactly the same thing, that is, proclaims his name, the aspect of his name he reveals is not, I am eternal and I am powerful. This time he reveals this, I am gracious. compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in love, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin. Why? Because that is precisely the aspect of God's character. Moses and the people of God needed to know, for they had been unfaithful. They had broken their vows. They had played the harlot. They had betrayed their one true love. They were, in fact, an obstinate people. And what they needed to know desperately at this time in their life, if they were going to continue on with God in any way, was this. God, can we come back? In fact, their relationship with God is unfolding. And like you, even though you're in a relationship with God, they were coming to know God. And so where they were in this particular juncture was asking this kind of question. Literally, what kind of God are you? are you a vengeful God do you pay back in kind how do you respond to people whose hearts are broken over their sin how do you respond when people come back to you realizing they've not just broken a rule but they have betrayed your love are you the kind of God that might say okay you haven't come back but I'm going to pound you when you get here is that what we're going to get when we come back so reveal to us your character show to us your glory Moses when he was asking to see the glory of God was not just asking for a fireworks display show me your character explain to us your ways what kind of God are you and God said Exodus 33 verse 19 I will reveal my glory here's how by showing you my goodness by proclaiming to you my name, and my name is this. I will be gracious. I will show compassion, for I am, chapter 34, compassionate, gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love, forgiving every kind of sin. So if what you need to know is whether God will take you back, the answer to that is yes. And I would make that as personal as I possibly can. If you are here this morning, and what you need to know is if God will take you back, the answer to that is yes. How do you know? Because of his name. That's how we know. And his name is I will be gracious. His name is I will show compassion to you if you want to come home. But know also this, that with all of this grace and mercy, God is not a chump. He is not like some insecure groom afraid of losing the affections of his bride if he places too many restrictions on her thus saying, okay, it's okay, you can sleep around I don't mind, I just want you to be happy so if you want to sleep around, no big deal you don't have to be faithful, wouldn't want to put those kinds of restrictions on you God does not say that in fact in verse 7 the middle of verse 7 right in the middle of all this grace love talk this same God says but by the way I will by no means acquit the guilty leads to the second detail thing we touched on this last time but not in detail now the detail thing I want us to see number two I I want us to see how the judgments of God reveal the glory and grace of God. Last time I told you that the problematic reality of this verse, when he says, I will by no means acquit the guilty, the problematic reality of that is this, every one of us are guilty. And we're kind of left with this stunning reversal, almost, as he talks about his compassion, then he's going to nail the guilty. The problem with that is all of us are guilty, so where'd the grace go? well that problem is solved with a question the question was this since everybody is guilty who are the guilty that god will acquit who are the guilty that god will forgive and who are the guilty that god will by no means forgive or acquit the answer to that is really quite simple it's this he will forgive those who see their sin who repent of their sin who desire desperately to return to the love of the groom, but he will by no means forgive those who don't repent, who have embraced, indeed love their sin. He will by no means forgive those who play God for a fool, who presume on grace as they play the harlot. I've got news for you if you're playing that game. the news for you is this verse 7 he will by no means say it's okay if you want to have another lover he will by no means acquit the guilty the second part of that verse i didn't touch at all last time as we just kind of dove in the second part of the verse is actually worse because it goes on to say this not only will i not acquit the guilty but i will visit the iniquity of the fathers on the children and on the grandchildren to the third and fourth generation. What's the deal here? This is very chilling. I mean, it's especially a concern if you're one of the children, wouldn't you say? Or a grandchildren. It's almost like, you know, I'm going to get hammered by God, not for anything I did, but because grandpa was an idiot, I'm going to get nailed. Is this an automatic, unavoidable curse? If my father was or my parents were, so will I be? Is that what this is saying? No, let me explain. Need to do some teaching. One of the curious things about this dynamic and ultimately helpful is this, that we have other scriptures that absolutely, actually, say exactly the opposite. So we need to work with this. Let me tell you what I'm talking about here. Ezekiel 18, 20. It says the opposite of Exodus 34 verse 7. Ezekiel 18 says this, the son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity. And the father will not bear the punishment for the son. I'm confused. What's the deal? It sounds like the Bible is contradicting itself. You need to know it's not. The answer to this apparent problem is found if you attend to the context of both. Listen to this. In Ezekiel, the sons, as it were, that is the children, the following generations, had chosen a different path from the father. They had broken the cycle of sin. They had changed the pattern of iniquity. They had recognized and turned from generations of sin in their family to walk a different path. They saw what was going on. They said, it's time for this to stop. We're going a different direction. That, by the way, is verified in Ezekiel 18, 19, when it says, because the son has chosen justice and righteousness, that is, a different path from other generations in their own family, this son will not bear the punishment of the father's iniquity, but he will surely live. In Exodus, there's a different story. The children or subsequent generations of fathers and grandfathers, grandmothers and grandmothers as well. In that situation in Exodus, the children had embraced and continued in the patterns of the father, for they were, chapter 33, verse 3, 34, verse 9, and obstinate people. Pull it together. Understand this. This is not an avoidable curse, some unavoidable curse. You can choose a different path. And if you do choose a different path, You will not for your father's sin be punished. But this is where it gets sticky and we need to do some work. While you will not be punished for generations of sin in your family, you will be affected. Even if the only effect on you is that somewhere along the line, you have to wake up and notice, what are the generational sins in my family? And you have to reject them and renounce them, consciously turn from them and walk a different path. And all by itself, that's a lot of work. Work you wouldn't have to do if the generation before you had noticed the generations of sin in their family that they had inherited and were passing right along because they hadn't broken the cycle either. We're talking in this verse about generational sin. And generational sin is like a contagious disease. No one actively teaches their children how to be irresponsible, how to lie, manipulate, be addicted or codependent. And what I mean by that is, I don't think a parent ever sat down with their child and said, here's a little piece of paper. Let me teach you how to lie. Okay, here's how you lie. Oh no, that wasn't really good. You got to be a little more deceptive than that. You don't teach them how to lie. Oh, let me show you how to be manipulative. Let's sit down. We're going to spend some time this afternoon and I will show you. I'm going to teach you because that's the value I would like to pass on to you. Let me show you how to be sexually addicted. Here's a really good way. Start looking at pornography when you're nine. That'd be a good way. Here, let me show you some. No, parents aren't doing that. Most, I don't think. You don't get it that way. You don't teach your children. They catch it like a cold. They will catch your generational sin like a cold. You know why? Because you like a cold, like your disease, you bring it into the house with you. And you don't go, I'd like to breathe on you and make you sick. No, you even try to stay away. They catch it anyway. Let me give you an illustration of this. Some of you in this room right now are addicted to pornography. It may be identified by you as the struggle of your life. Around it you may have lots of shame. You may really hate it. And among the things that you would despise about your struggle would be if in some way your kids got affected by it or afflicted with it. And so for a number of reasons, one of the reasons being this, you hide it. Again, there are other reasons that you would hide it, but you don't want them affected by it or afflicted by it, so you hide your pornography. Here's the deal. The things I'm talking about here are spiritual. And even if you hide it and they never see it, they're going to catch it like a cold. I use pornography just because that's one that's kind of obvious. I promise you the same is true of your bitterness. You mask it, you hide it, I promise you. You can try really, if you are bitter, if that is your spirit, you can take them to Sunday school all you want and you can tell them how they're supposed to react and you can give them the right response and tell them to write it on a paper. they will catch your bitterness like a cold. Same is true of malice and greed, worship of money, manipulative pursuit of power. They'll catch it like a cold. All of that, by the way, speaks to us in two ways. In fact, I thought of this for me, and so I'll just make it about me, you can make it about yourself. This truth of generational sin speaks to me, first of all, as a father. I'll just make it a male thing. It speaks to me as an adult. And what it says to me is this, that the truth about my character, what I mean by that is what is really there, what you may not see on a Sunday morning, what is really going on in my home, in fact, what may not even be visible to my wife and to my children. I'm talking about what really goes on inside of me. That the truth about my character has power either to bless my children or to curse my children. It has the power to either make their life easier or harder. It has the power to make their load either lighter or heavier and make their way clearer or more confusing. And I can't cheat that. They will catch my disease like a cold. Which tells me that the greatest gift I can give to my children is the passionate pursuit of my personal sanctification. I'm not talking about external legalistic do's and don'ts here. I am talking about a ruthless dealing with my own sin, honesty about my own stuff, bringing it to God, showing them repentance, turning the path of my life, myself, in ways that sometimes they'll see, in ways that they never will visibly see. Me doing, well, this is kind of the therapeutic talk, my work is the greatest gift I could give them because not only will they catch my disease, they will catch to some degree my health. Beloved, as we pursue sanctification, are honest and ruthless about our own sin, we, believe it or not, Clear a path of righteousness for future generations. I want you to think about that possibility because while this is kind of a negative verse, what I just gave to you is a thrilling proposition that by you dealing honestly with the issues of your own life before God, claiming grace for it and walking a different way, you have the potential to lighten the load for future generations, to make the light easier to see for future generations. speaks to me as this truth. As a father, it also speaks to me, however, as a son. It speaks to me as a child. For it tells me that I have some personal responsibility to identify and reject the sins of my father. I love my father. I honor my father. One of the ways I think we honor our fathers and our mothers and the generations before us, one of the ways would be, in fact, to tear down their altars and to smash their sacred pillars, verse 13. And every one of us has to do that work. To use, again, recovery language, It's called family of origin issues. I love it when this, not that. I love it when this happens. Newspaper this morning was reading major full-page article about Bill Goldsworthy. Now, if you're a Minnesotan and you followed hockey years ago, you know Bill Goldsworthy was a tremendous hockey player. years ago. I think it was in the 70s. But this was a Father's Day article about not just Bill Goldsworthy, but his daughter named Tammy. Tammy Goldsworthy grew up with a father who was afflicted by everyday alcoholism, widely known promiscuity, and life-threatening rage. She was in fear for her life more than once, this article indicated. For some time in Tammy's life, this article revealed, she took the same path as her dad. She was lost in alcoholism. She was involved in an overwhelming kind of promiscuity, but instead of rage and murder, she went into deep depression and suicidal tendencies. November 13, 1994. Bill Goldsworthy, and it was in the news, you probably remember this, was diagnosed with AIDS, of all things. She was shocked. Quoting now from the story, it says this of her, suddenly the connection between her own drinking and her father's, his sexual promiscuity and hers, his mercurial fits of rage, and her depression hit home. She had a decision to make. Would she follow her father's path, who, by the way, had followed his father's path. For Bill, in his victimization, was a victim himself of alcoholic parents who beat the living daylights out of him. Would she follow her father's path into sickness and death? Or would she find the courage to uncover the roots of her family's tragic story and change the direction of her path? Well, by God's amazing grace and by her amazing courage, Tammy Goldsworthy broke the cycle. And she would probably never know this verse. Here's what she did. She tore down the altars of her father and she smashed the sacred pillars. She did some very hard work and now she's doing what she ought to do with that story. She's going around and telling people about it to give them hope that they can break the cycle too. And guess what? When we come to God desiring to do that kind of work, God, I need to break the cycle that I've been in. Guess what God does? Here's what he does. He proclaims his name. And what is his name? His name is the Lord, the Lord God. Compassionate and gracious, I am slow to anger, abounding in love, forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin, even the sin that has had your family in its grip for generations. That is called amazing grace. so even the judgments of God beloved reveal the glory and the grace of God the third and final thing that reveals the glory of God are the covenants of God in particular the Mosaic Covenant we'll close with this quickly I think I've already made this clear what this covenant is but let me close with this one thing saying the same thing a different way most people I believe think that the Mosaic Covenant can best be understood by picturing God as an employer and the covenant people as employees. The Ten Commandments in their mind is the job description. And if you do the job description, you'll be paid accordingly. In fact, God will owe you because you earned it. It is a covenant in their mind of merit and works. It is not a covenant of merit and works. Much more accurate is this. In the Mosaic Covenant, God needs to be seen as the groom the covenant people are the bride the ten commandments are not a job description but as I've already said they are wedding vows they are I David take thee Bonnie to be my wedded wife kind of vows think of those vows being exchanged now with God to have and to hold from this day forward for better for worse for richer for poorer if I'm healthy if I'm not according to God's holy ordinance I hereby promise you, God, my faithfulness. I will have no other lovers. I will have no other gods. And beloved, the promises of blessing that attend these vows are simply the passionate desire of the groom to bestow upon the object of his love everything he's got. I will perform miracles which have not been produced in all the earth and all the people among whom you live will see the working of the Lord for it's an awesome thing that I have prepared for you, my bride. You know what? We got time for a wedding. Right now. It doesn't have to take long. All you have to do in response to this offer of amazing grace and proposal of marriage from the groom who is in fact Christ is to say simply this. I do receive you to be my God. Some would enter into these vows for the very first time. Some would feel things in their spirit that would confirm not for the first time but there is a need to renew these vows. Some would maybe need to respond this morning to the breaking of generational issues and requiring the groom at this time to come to the aid of the bride and help me do my family stuff and break the power of sin and death and choose a different path. Beloved, one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God is the amazing grace of God lavished on people like you and me who don't deserve it. But he gives it anyway. Let's stand and be dismissed. Father, I pray simply this, that you would take this word, breathe life into it, drive it deep into the hearts of your people, stir them up, all of us, to respond to the things you're speaking to us through it. I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
