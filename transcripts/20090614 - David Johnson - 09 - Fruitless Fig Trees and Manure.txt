So if you have your Bibles, open them to Luke's Gospel, the 13th chapter, beginning in the 6th verse, where Jesus begins to tell this parable. It's a parable that actually we almost skipped. I kind of didn't notice it at first as it sits among other parables that I'm more familiar with and more kind of naturally drawn to. But this parable in Luke 13, verse 6, is about a certain man who had a fig tree says in verse 6, which had been planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on this fig tree, which was a reasonable thing to expect, that there would be fruit on this tree, but he didn't find any fruit. Let me set this up a little bit here, because finding such a tree in a vineyard in Jesus' day would not be an unusual thing, nor would it be unusual for Jesus to use the symbol of a fig tree and the fruit that the fig tree produces to speak metaphorically or parabolically about the fruit that is a natural result of authentic life in the kingdom of God. The reference to fruit as a symbol of life is used all throughout the scriptures. The Apostle Paul, for instance, calls it the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians chapter 5. And the fruit that's born of God's spirit at work in you looks like love and joy and peace and patience. And it's the natural result of an authentic life with God, empowered by the Spirit of God. Indeed, you'll know them by their fruit. There's that fruit thing again, said Jesus back in Matthew 7, verse 16, which is a text we dealt with here at Open Door just a few short months ago as we came near the end of our dealing with the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus went on to say grapes, because grapes aren't gathered from thorn bushes, it says in verse 16, nor figs from thistles are they. Of course not, is the logical conclusion of what he says there, because figs come from fig trees. They're the natural result or the natural fruit of that kind of tree, just like love and joy and peace and patience is the natural fruit of a certain kind of life with God that's empowered by the Spirit of God. Even so, says Jesus, or in like manner, says Jesus, again in Matthew 7, now verse 17, every good tree bears good fruit, and every bad tree bears bad fruit or no fruit at all. Indeed, verse 19 then says, and this is where it gets a little edgy, every tree, says Jesus, that does not bear good fruit is ultimately cut down and thrown into the fire, which makes me just kind of think, whoa, pretty cut and dry and harsh as well, but clear. No fruit, cut it down, which is precisely what this certain man in the parable of Luke 13 that we're dealing with this morning wanted to do when he found no fruit on this fig tree of his, because in verse 7, He says to the vineyard keeper, look at the text again in verse 7. Behold, he says to the vineyard keeper, for three years I've come here looking for fruit on this fig tree without finding any. And if you think about it, that means he's been patient. Three years is a long time to have no fruit at all. Might be time to decide this thing is dead. And one of the things that makes this three-year period kind of interesting and compelling is because of some things we know about fig trees. I want to tell you a little bit more about that, just kind of add to the picture, because one of the common characteristics of a fig tree in Jesus' day, and I suppose it would be true of fig trees in our day too, because fig trees are kind of like fig trees, was that when they were healthy, if it was a good, healthy tree, they would actually produce fruits generally 10 months on a consistent basis, 10 months out of the year. So there'd be this expectation that pretty much any time you go to this tree, 10 months out of the year is pretty much the majority of the time, you're going to expect to find some good fruit. And sure, there'd be times of dormancy for this tree when there was no fruit, but generally, 10 months out of the year, there'd be some kind of fruit, some evidence of life, which again makes this fig tree thing just a rich parable to me, a fascinating metaphor for life in the kingdom of God because again, the natural fruit of an authentic life with God, empowered by the Spirit of God, will be this general flow of love and joy and peace and patience of fruits. But not all the time. I mean, you get a couple months off, it's just 10 months out of the year. You could be a grump for two months. Actually, I don't want to stretch this and, you know, take every aspect of the fig tree and say that it has some deep spiritual significance. Let's consider the bark. I'm not going to consider the bark of the fig tree, but this 10 months out of the year thing. It actually, when I first kind of dialed that into my life and people I know who are full of God, there's some grace in that to, you know, kind of be human. And it's realistic as well as I think on my life and the people I know who have the authentic life of God in them. It's kind of like that because all of us lose our way sometimes. And we stumble and we fall and in the course of a life, in the course of a year, not a lot of fruit today. You bump into me on Wednesday, it's kind of grumpy, not much fruit. What's wrong with Dave? He says, there's not much fruit today. But after three years, I mean, I could understand, you know, here and there, generally there's fruit, but after three years, this parable is talking about something for three years. No fruit. What do you think then? What do you do then? Because you've been more than patient. I guess you cut it down. Because we're sure it's really dead. Which is precisely what the guy in the parable of Luke 13 in verse 7 says near the end of the verse. Here's his conclusion. Cut it down. I've been looking for a fruit three years. No fruit. Cut it down. Then adding this. Why does this tree even use up the ground? So he's lost his patience. But if you pay attention to the flavor here, he's angry too, saying in effect, you're taking up space and soil and nutrients that other productive plants and trees need. So you're out of here. I'm done with you. Just cut it down. A little side note here, again, that just adds a little bit of flavor and expands our understanding and ability to see the picture here. Kenneth Bailey, in his book Through Peasant Eyes, points out that the Greek verb here in verse 7 that gets translated as cut it down is actually a word that literally means to dig up and to uproot, not just cut it down, which, according to Bailey, is consistent with agricultural practices in Jesus' day. In the West, Bailey says, woodsmen cut trees down. But in the Middle East, the tree is dug out. The tree with its stump and some of its root cluster falls as one block and is removed. Which you might be saying, big deal. Cut it down, pull it out, doesn't matter. But if it's true, actually I think it does matter. It kind of gives a more graphic picture here as to what is actually happening because it is more, in some ways, more violent than just cutting it down because to pull it up from the roots speaks to a kind of eradication. Because if you cut it down, you still have a stump, which gives some sign of previous existence. But if you pull it up by the roots, there is no trace that this tree ever existed. so dig it up by its roots, says this man in Jesus' parable who had a tree that bore no fruits. But what if it's not a tree that you're giving up on? What if it's not a tree that you're cutting off or pulling up by the roots? What if it's a person? What if it's your son or your daughter who this time went too far, who this time did too much, said too much, that's it, I'm done with you? Because sometimes you know it's true. Sometimes parents give up on their kids. I'm done with you. you're no daughter of mine sometimes kids give up on their parents because you become convinced you just know for sure they'll never change I see no fruits I've three years I've waited at least three years I'm tired of waiting I'm done with you so what if it's not a tree that's being eradicated from your mind as if they never even existed anymore. What if it's a person? Expand it out beyond that. What if it's a group of people or a kind of people? You know those kind of people who bear no fruit. You know it's true. So you decide in your infinite wisdom, and we've been patient that it's time. I've been patient long enough. I'm cutting you off. I'm pulling you up by the roots. As far as I'm concerned, you don't exist. The time of day I wouldn't give you. Which actually sounds, though harsh, uncomfortably consistent, actually, with what Jesus seemed to be saying. In a verse I read previously in this very talk back in Matthew 7, 19, about trees that don't bear good fruit being cut off. and thrown into the fire, which is kind of chilling, and I'm not always sure what to do with that. Well, here's part of what you need to do with that is hear the rest of the parable in Luke chapter 13. Pick it up in verse 8, because the vineyard keeper, who, by the way, in this parable is the God figure. Now, that's not always true, and we're not always going to connect the dots this way for you as we do with parables, but it's important to know that in this particular parable, I do think that the vineyard keeper, dialed into the vineyard keeper, being the God figure, says to the man, to the human, to people like you and me, who are convinced that they're justified in cutting down and pulling up this tree, the vineyard keeper says, to this certain man, sir, leave it alone. To give it some time for this year too. And just kind of dial into the symbolic language there. This year isn't 365 days, and on the next day you can cut it down. Give it some more time. Give it some time, a season, if you will, until I dig around it, says the vineyard keeper, and put in some fertilizer. It's speaking obviously here of the soil. I'm going to dig in the dirt, says the vineyard keeper, and throw in some manure, and then we'll see, verse 9, if it bears fruit. And if it does, that's great. Fine. But if it doesn't, then cut it down, which brings that chill back to me because it seems that there does come a time, apparently, when you do cut it down. But maybe it's not your job to do that. Maybe God does cut it down, all of which, at least for me, stirs up a number of questions and concerns as well. I think probably for you too, theologically, see, there's a picture here in this parable of judgment. that I can't avoid and can't deny and neither can we. Where God eventually says, enough, enough. But here's the key. And this is really the overarching picture of this parable where many different elements are being held. This reality of judgments in this parable is, it may come, it will come, but it's never what he wants. We, in the parable, actually, we're the ones, the people, people like you and me, in this parable, we're the ones who've run out of patience. We're the ones, the certain man are the ones who think we know. It's time to decide. It's time to decide about you, about them. In the parable, God's the one who's saying, wait, wait, wait, you guys. Wait. Slow down. Not yet. Give it time. another year. I've already waited too long. Another year. It's too soon. And if you're getting upset that God's not judging me enough, taking care of business enough, and he's slacking off some way, just remember 2 Peter chapter 3 verse 9, because God is not slow, as some would count slowness. But what you need to understand about God, especially as it relates to judgment, He hates it. That's why God is patient toward all, not wishing for anyone to perish, but for all to come to repentance and everybody to come to life. That's the heart of God. And it's revealed in this parable. Remember Abraham? I want to talk about this judgment thing in the heart of God for waiting. Abraham came to God in the Old Testament. And in the story, he's kind of interceding. You might remember this on behalf of Sodom and Gomorrah because the judgment was going to come. And so he asks God to withhold his judgment and says, if I could find two righteous people, will you withhold your judgment? And God says, absolutely. That's my paraphrase. Sure. And part of that is because there is no delight that God takes in judging. But here in the parable, and this is where the spin is that I love, it's like the roles are reversed. In Genesis, when Abraham comes to God to intercede for the people in the parable, God's the one who's interceding on behalf of this tree that's been barren for three years. And God, it's as if God is asking us to wait and to slow down, to be patient, to kind of tell us, listen, you guys, there's still hope. Don't give up on this person or these people too soon. You do not know what you think you know. Leave it alone. Leave it alone. Matthew 13, the parable of the wheat and the tares is the same thing. It's an interesting, this is a little side note about the parables. One of the things Steve and I have been talking about, and Jen and anybody who's speaking on the parables in this series, is that there's a lot of parables, but a lot of them are saying exactly the same thing a different way. So how often do we land on this theme anyway? The parable of the wheat and the tares is the same dynamic as this one, where Jesus is saying to you that parable, in effect, yes, there is authentic wheat. there are real trees that bear real fruit and the fruit is good and there is mixed right in with all that real authentic stuff false stuff the wheat in the parable is the thing that is real and nurturing, not nurturing but life giving and it has something of value to give the tares are actually weeds and yes, there will come a time and this is right in the parable of the wheat and the tares there will come a time of separating the wheat and the tares that which is real and that which is not, and there will come a time of separating and judgment. But the whole point of the wheat and the tares was you need to wait. Do not go pulling all that up thinking you know which is the wheat and which are the tares, because you don't know. And quite frankly, as the wheat and the tares do grow up together, it's very interesting actually physically looking at them at certain stages, they look very similar. And if you decide you know who the good guys are, You know for sure you are going to make mistakes and you're going to end up pulling up things that really have life and have enormous potential, but you acted too soon because you thought you knew. Don't act too soon. You'll get it wrong. That's why these stories of judgment bring us back to places where God's the one who's got to do that. I've got to stay engaged with these people some way. The story of Jonah comes to mind as it relates to this, where God says, in effect, to Jonah, the prophets, Jonah, you need to understand something about the Ninevites. As much as they disgust you, there is hope for them. There is hope for them that I see, Jonah, that you don't see. This is God speaking. So Jonah, I want you effectively to go to the Ninevites and start digging in their dirt. And I want you to throw in some manure and call them to repent. And Jonah says, in effect, you know what he says. In effect, what he says to God about the Ninevites is this, to hell with them. These people make me sick, God. And I'm pretty sure Jonah felt righteous in feeling that cut them down. The whole lot of them. And God said to Jonah, No. You want judgment more than I want judgment. If you're going to be my prophet, you're going to need an attitude adjustment here. And the reason the answer is no, Jonah, is because there's still hope for them that you don't see. It's too soon to give up. The time to give up may come, but it's too soon today. So Jonah, go and engage these people and interact with these people. And finally, you know the story. I think you do. He did. After that, you know, unfortunate fish thing happened, which is a fascinating thing. I don't have time to go into it, but let your own mind go into the dealings of God with even his people, because that was kind of a judgment on Jonah. I mean, which one, I think God's more upset with this prophet who has no compassion for lost Ninevites or the Ninevites? Jonah, I'm going to deal with you. I'm going to swallow you up and it's going to feel like death for a while. And it wasn't even about Jonah doing some ministry that he was running away from. It was he didn't care about the Ninevites. God did. So finally he went and began digging in their dirt and throwing in some manure, as it were, and the Ninevites, you know the story, again, did repent. And because of that, God held his judgment. And this is the funniest part of the story. I love this part of the story. When God withheld his judgment and began actually to bless the Ninevites, Jonah got angry. I love this. Look at this. Jonah chapter 4, verse 2. Jonah says this, I knew it. I knew it because you're a God. You're a God. Because you're a gracious and compassionate God. You're slow to anger and abundant and loving kindness. You know, if you just had that verse up there and didn't know the context, it would look like a worship song, wouldn't it? It'd be like, you are gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abundant in love. He's ticked. I knew it. I got it. I hate those people and I knew you would love them. Hmm. Isn't that weird? Isn't that? We laugh. I'm glad we can laugh. Because we need to let that one go in. Because some of us hate people that God loves. And he's not giving up on them yet. And we can't either. You know, Jonah wanted, or Jonah, yeah, he did want the Ninevites to get what he thought they deserved. Cut them down. Pull them up by the roots. God says, no. I'm not going to satisfy your lust here for what you think is right. God says, wait. It's still too soon. There still is hope. Let it alone, sir. Let's back to verse 8 of Luke 13. Give it some time, sir. Don't be so sure, sir. Let this play out, sir. All of which means, among other things, this. That whatever time it is, that whatever time you think it is, it's still not time to finally judge. Now, a couple months ago, I think, at the end of the Sermon on the Mount, or somewhere in the Sermon on the Mount, we talked about don't judge, lest you be judged. And we made a real clear distinction there that that does not mean we don't make discernments and assessments between what is right and wrong, what is good and evil. I'm talking about that final judgment where you drop the gavel on another human being or a group of people because you think you know they'll never change. It's too soon to decide that. You don't know what you think you know. So instead of cutting them off, now comes the best part I think of the parable, and disengaging from them, what I'd like you to do is go dig in their dirt and throw in some manure. I love this analogy. You think about it, it's a fabulous picture. anybody ever go digging in your dirt throw in some manure well if they have you know something about that experience it's very irritating get away from me indeed as much as i wouldn't want anyone to give up on me this whole thing of don't too soon to give up as much as i wouldn't want anybody to give up on me maybe worse is that they haven't given up at all but they keep digging in my dirt and throwing in manure. Get away from me. I don't know if this works for you, but it sure does for me. I remember years ago, I mean, it just kind of unfolds for me in a number of ways. Years ago, I've told you about this before, a season in our life and in our marriage where Bonnie and I went into counseling and I just, it was going to be great. We're finally going to deal with some issues and Bonnie will get fixed and this will be great. And I know, I've talked that way every time and every time you laugh, but we ended up with a counselor. He was wonderful. And what made him wonderful was he wasn't scared to dig in my dirt. I hated that. It was very irritating. And he didn't mind throwing in some manure as well. We have four kids, Bonnie and I, and they're all grown now and have kids of their own. And some of you have kids. And some of you kids have parents. You all have parents. But some of you kids have parents that you're real mad at right now. But it's not because they've given up on you. It't because they're digging in your dirt right now. And they're mixing in manure, and some of you parents have kids that you're kind mad at right now. But it's not because your kids have given they're digging in your dirt and they're throwing in manure, refusing to pretend that the dysfunction of the family that you have was really okay or that what actually did happen didn't really happen. It did happen and they're digging in your dirt. It's creating some tension. We did. I just told you have four kids still do. They're grown now, as I said. And each one of them, our kids, as I was reflecting on this relative to the sermon, had seasons in their life where there wasn't any fruit in their life. All four of our kids went through times like this. And if there was fruit at all, it tasted so bitter no one could stand it. And while I could tell you stories about all of our kids in this regard, as I was thinking about this parable, the person I thought of among our kids was our second daughter, Erica. And part of why I feel free to tell this story is because I asked her if I could, which I always do. But part of it is she's a young woman married now to a guy named Hain, living in North Carolina with a beautiful little daughter whose tree today is full of really good fruit, at least 10 months out of the year. But in late high school, Erica lost her way a little bit, as all of our kids did at one time or another. And then some of the stuff she was kind of exhibiting was just teenage stuff that kids do, and it didn't bother us, and we really didn't care about the color of her hair. I mean, every three days, it was a different color, red, blue, orange, green, whatever, pick a color. It didn't matter. It did. We weren't going to fight there. And Bonnie and I would go to Wayne and say, I'm not, I'm not, that's not what we're going to fight about. And she wants to pierce all these things. I don't care. And, and the tattoo thing, we found out about a tattoo. You know how we found out about a tattoo? This, she, she had appendicitis. We rushed her to the hospital. The doctor, whoa, whoa, looky there. Busted. She's dying. Just fix her. I don't care about that. But then there were other things stirring in her heart that we could tell something was wrong. And then high school kid, there was alcohol on her breath and smoke in her clothes. And we started to get scared for her. And we got scared for us. As parents, what do you do? I think we're losing her. So what do you do? Well, one one thing you could do is you could chop her down. You could just pull her up by the roots. I mean, I'm a pastor, okay? This is going to look bad. No, daughter of mine, you're out of here. Okay, you could do that. The other thing you could do in order to, because everybody knows you shouldn't do that, you know, maybe everybody doesn't know it, but the other thing to do in order to avoid uprooting them is just go passive and just kind of sit and look at, well, there's no fruit in your life, but we'll just go, I hope they get better. Kind of pathetic. Instead, and we weren't using this terminology then, but we started digging in our dirt. And we threw as much manure as we possibly could into it. I remember just this season of every time, it felt like every time we would talk to Erica during this season, it was a confrontation. I mean, it was like another consequence, another consequence, another confrontation. Erica, what do you do? I can smell it. Don't tell me. Here's another consequence for you. You're grounded for life. You only have one. I do remember we were talking about this. We talk about it every once in a while as a family because I remember there was so much tension between us. I would stage times when we'd have a pleasant interaction and I'd come into the kitchen and I'd go, Bonnie, is Erica in the family room? Yeah, is she by herself? Yeah, nothing today? No. I'd walk in and I'd go, hey, Erica, how are you? Love you. And walk out just to have something good in the pot, in all of our interactions. You know what? None of that was easy. And all of that takes time. And energy and creativity and actually lots of love. So much easier and quicker to just cut it down. To pull it up by the roots. You're no daughter of mine. I'm done with you. And you can feel real righteous when you draw that line. It's interesting. Eugene Peterson in the book that I've been referencing in the context of these parables entitled Tell It Slant refers to this particular parable as a manure story. He calls this whole parable a manure story. And whatever else manure is or isn't, says Peterson, it isn't a quick fix. And if it's results that we want, then chopping down the tree is just a thing, a much better option. And it's what we know best. It's what we do best, says Peterson. When we come across something or someone who offends us, some person who is useless to us, they're just taking up the ground, we lose patience. And either physically or verbally, get rid of them. We chop them down, we cut them out, it solves the problem, immediate results. Manure, on the other hand, says Peterson, is a slow solution, which is part of why we don't like it. But like it or not, the fact is this, that when it comes to doing something about what is wrong in the world, Jesus is best known for his fondness of the minute, the invisible, the quiet, the slow, the yeast, the salt, the seeds, the light, manure. But it's not just that manure is slow that makes manure unpleasant. It's that it stinks a lot. In other words, manure experiences aren't pleasant ones. But something's going on that you often cannot see as the manure, a weird illustration, works itself into the soil. Even so, says Peterson, manure does not rank high in the world's economics. It's refuse. It's garbage. We organize efficient and sometimes elaborate systems to collect it, to haul it away, to get it out of sight and smell. But the observant and wise know that this apparently dead and despised waste is teeming with life, enzymes, microorganisms that in the right measure can actually help things grow. And can we know that about manure? I'm a city guy, and I think you know that. If you know me, I grew up in Chicago. So growing up in Chicago, I didn't know a lot about manure and what it does and what value it might have. So I remember very well a trip that we as a family took through the Midwest of the country. When our kids were little, got in the station wagon and went and decided to spend a night in the course of this trip in Dubuque, Iowa. Dubuque, which by the end of the trip I had renamed Dubuque, Iowa. Because, true, true story, because when we get out of the car to check into the motel, I was greeted by a smell so strong, did it burn the hair in my nose. Oh, we were in pig country, and I didn't know it. So when I'm checking into the motel, it's true story, I get up to the check-in, check-out desk, and ask the lady, what is that disgusting smell to which she said, without skipping a beat, that's not a disgusting smell, it smells like money to me. oh so it has some value see that's a fact that's a fact that this manure thing might have value that without some wisdom you can't understand or appreciate you'll just assume what I assumed smells bad must be bad let's get out of here better yet let's get the manure out of here. What possible use could it have? It doesn't smell good. It can't be good. Let me close with a question. Because I think all of us, everybody, and in fact not just church people or Christian people, I think every human being actually wants fruit in their life. They might not say it that way, but who wouldn't want love? and joy and some peace and some patience. I can't think of, maybe there would be some, but I can't think of many, you know, relatively sane people who wouldn't say, yeah, that's what I want. But given that, here's the question. Are you willing to let anyone dig in your dirt and throw in some manure? you know when I tell you the story of Erica I don't know what you think boy you must be good parents no no no the story of Erica was not that we just dug in her dirt but that eventually and I emphasize eventually because she pushed back a lot and from all four of our kids when they went through their seasons and we dig in their dirt they would push back a lot and we got all the I hate you yeah yeah yeah I know I don't hate you and I'm going to not hate you forever but eventually I'm going to tell you about Erica and Caleb and Chris and other people she let us and when she did and let other people too the fruit started to come I have a very dear friend who actually may not know how dear he actually is to me though I think he understands some of it who some time ago allowed his heart to get attached to something that eventually dried up a good portion of the fruit in his life. And it began to strain relationships in ways that became more and more obvious and hard to manage. And this last Wednesday night I was around a fire with a group of guys who I kind of do my life with. There's other guys who weren't in that circle that I do my life with, But this guy I'm talking about was in that circle that night. And we started talking about this talk. There's a parable. I was just kind of getting my head around it. And I was kind of fascinated by it. So I threw out the question to the guys who were talking about other things. And I just said, anybody ever give up on you? Or have you ever given up on somebody? And what does that feel like? And da-da-da-da-da. And Joel Hansen, who I'm talking about, said, you know, this church could have given up on me. and Dave, you could have given up on me and he told me some things that actually I forgot that I had said and that we had said to him and if you remember, some things came that we just said, Joel, you can't be here on staff anymore but we want to be your friend. When I said back to Joel, and this is something you may not know and the reason I'm telling is I asked Joel if I could tell this story too but this is like an open door story to me because the biggest part of the Joel Hansen story to me is that even when we said, Joel, you don't have a job here anymore. He said, okay, okay. And it hurt him. But he said, I want to stay in relationship. And we said, we want to stay in relationship. And then he said, he didn't say these words, but this is what he said. I'm going to let you dig in my dirt. And he did. He invited us. And he invited his friends in a circle of people to dig in his dirt. And then he went further. He got a counselor. And he basically said to the counselor, I want you to dig in my dirt. And then he said to his wife, I'm going to let you dig in my dirt. Do you know how easy it is to run? Do you have? Yes, you do. And as the Spirit of God also began digging this dirt, fruit began to come. Fruit began to come. And we noticed the fruit, and it began to grow. And some of you have noticed it. And nobody ever thought this was going to happen. But then Joel came back, and we said, there's a place for you on our stage. And he leads us in worship again. and I think you taste the fruit, don't you? I do. So here's the question. Are you willing to let anyone dig in your dirt? And you might think, well, there's nobody that I trust. Let me ask a bigger question. Are you willing to let God dig in your dirt and mix in some manure? Because sometimes that's exactly what it takes to get fruit on your tree. And I think everybody wants fruit. Are you willing to have your dirt moved around a little bit? Let's pray. Would you stand with me as we close? let me just close with this benediction 2 Peter 3 9 you guys you need to remember God is not slow as some count slowness but is patient toward all not willing for any to perish and that doesn't even mean just go to hell that means to live a life of barrenness and no fruit but eager for all to come to repentance so you can live life in the kingdom of God Lord I thank you for your patience I thank you that you are a wise a wise vineyard keeper who knows how to dig in the dirt and just how much manure to put in. Help us to be receptive. The kind of soil that receives the things we need to go grow good fruit from one generation to the next generation to the next generation for generations. I pray in Jesus' name and all God's people said, amen. God bless you. You're dismissed. Go in peace. Thank you. Thank you.
