Father, I thank you for the workings of your spirit among us. I thank you, Father, for just the time of meeting with you in a different place that affirms again to us that it's not about the place. It's about who you are and who we are in you. And now as we break open the word this morning, we pray that we would be able to hear your voice and your truth and your heart in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. So what's God up to with all this stuff? What is it that he is saying to us these days? What is he doing? Where are we going? It's a question that just kind of comes into my mind more than normal, just because of where we are this weekend, meeting in a different place physically. I think you have to admit that this journey we've been on for the last few months and even years physically, as it relates to where we physically meet, has been, to say the least, interesting. I want you to think about it just for a minute. We have a permanent facility in Crystal we call the Crystal Building. One person I know, having heard that, never having been to the Crystal Building, actually thought it was a Crystal Building. Went looking for it and was very disappointed when they saw what it really was. I mean, you could be disappointed in that building even if you weren't expecting much. We meet in Robbinsdale. We're building in Maple Grove. Our annual meeting is going to be at Armstrong, but all summer long we're meeting at the Earl Brown Conference Center. Except for Saturday nights, we'll be at the Crystal Building. It isn't really Crystal. Except for July 14th, no Saturday service at all because the Earl Brown Center is not available. We'll be meeting at the Northrop Auditorium on the 15th of July. One service, only 10 o'clock, But that's only one time because on the 22nd, we're back at a Roboran, except on Saturday where we're meeting at the Crystal Building that isn't really Crystal. I feel like I'm in a pinball machine. I mean, how many of you know Armstrong, Robinsdale, Maple Grove, Roboran? You just kind of feel like, send me a card when you get to Maple Grove and I'll be there. We're by a church some time ago. They had a sign out in front. It said, we're a church, and it said, come grow with us. We're a church on the go. I'll show you go. You don't know go. This is go here. With all this stuff, it feels good to be here. I walked in this morning, it was very exciting. It was a lot of positive energy. Even the people who were at 6 o'clock in the morning were going, this went so smooth, and it'll be nice to hear that at the end of the summer. But it raises for me this question, just the fact that we're physically here. What's God up to in all this? What's he saying? What's he doing? Where are we going? Well, what I think he's up to, where I think we're going, what I think he's saying right in the middle of all of this physical movement as we journey to our ultimate destination in Maple Grove because this is all part of that ultimate destination. I think that what he is saying has an awful lot to do with the text we have been examining the last several weeks in 1 John 5, 21, where John says this, Little children, guard yourselves from idols. Guard yourselves from bowing down to and becoming ensnared by false gods, false sources of life that make to you promises of life but have no power to give you life. Make it more specific to Church of the Open Door. Little children at Church of the Open Door, As we continue this journey of faith, a journey that we have been on for several years, and as we now anticipate an attempt to prepare for, a part of that journey that is going to, in a little over a year, feel like an arrival of sorts, where we have no more physical wandering, but a permanent home in Maple Grove, a permanent home that represents not only a new location, but new opportunities for ministry effect, new dangers as well. What I believe he is saying in the middle of all of that is this. Guard yourselves from idols. From bowing down to and becoming ensnared by false gods. Be very careful about false sources of life that make to you promises of life but have no power to give you life. During this season, this little window of opportunity, while you're still kind of physically wandering and haven't exactly landed in this permanent place. Use this time to identify them, renounce them, do everything you can to remove them so that when we come into this new place physically, prepared for us by God, we can be living free from them. Beloved, I see us as being on a journey. I've spoken to you of it before, a journey that on this Sunday is manifesting itself to us very obviously in a physical way, but it is a spiritual journey as well. And that's what we've spoken of most of in the past, a spiritual journey that over time has manifested itself to us in a variety of ways through seasons of life where God has moved on us in different ways, spoken to us in different forms. God has called to us and he has healed us and grown us, disciplined us and deepened us. We've had seasons here at Open Door and many of you have been through many of them. Seasons where we have experienced success and then we've had seasons of stumbling. We've had seasons of repentance and seasons of laughing and singing and dancing for joy. We've had seasons of great advancement and other seasons not near as fun of significant retreat and even our obedience in those retreat times was responding to God recognizing that this is a time we need to retool and redefine who we even are and where we're supposed to be and who we actually are. The season I believe that we're in right now is a season that will be marked, I believe, by, among other things, two primary things. And it's just something I think as a church we need to recognize, and I want to bring it to you. I think, number one, it is a season of preparation. And number two, it is a season of consecration. Those two things, and they'll take different forms in this next year. But those two things are what we need to be doing this year as we anticipate where we're going physically. It's a time of preparation. It's a time of consecration. And it is precisely by way of preparation and consecration for where it is we're going that we need to be actively hearing 1 John 5, 21. Little children, guard yourselves from idols. That's part of your preparation and consecration. Identify them, renounce them as best you can, remove them so that when we get to where we're going, we can be free from them. Now, over the next several weeks, it might even end up being a few months, I don't know, by way of preparation and consecration, I want to identify and talk openly about what I believe to be three of the most prominent, pervasive, and powerful strongholds of idolatry that dominate our culture and have, in fact, leavened the church as well. The three false gods or strongholds of idolatry are these, money, sex, and power. I don't think it requires much on my part to convince you of the fact that we do indeed live in a culture that worships money, sex, and power. that bows down to those three things, that draws life from them. But if the people of God are no different in relationship to money, sex, and power than the culture is, then the question, frightening question is this. What on earth have we to say to the culture? What on earth have we to offer them beyond just prohibition? And basically, and this isn't necessarily a fair criticism, But often I'm afraid that the world's or the culture's perspective of the church's message about money, sex, and power is just prohibition. It's like, don't do it. And as it relates to sexuality, the only really holy option you have is a vow of chastity. Well, I think for some that's an appropriate embrace. But is there something healthy? Is there something else that would embrace the fullness of healthy, God-honoring sexuality? It isn't an idolatrous thing. Same thing with money. I mean, you could take a vow of poverty. And for some, that's an appropriate, God-honoring, God-directed choice. But is there another thing that can be shown of a healthy, holy relationship, not bound to, but free around money thing that the people of God can demonstrate to the world? I think it needs to clearly be said that as I identify money, sex, and power as a stronghold of idolatry. It needs to really be clear in your mind and mind that none of those things in and of themselves are sinful or bad. Indeed, all of them, money, sex, and power, when rightly ordered under the reign and rule of God, have the capacity to wonderfully reflect the image of God, to powerfully reveal the glory of God, to richly bless the people of God, and to in amazing ways advance the kingdom of God. Even in a culture that does not recognize Jehovah as God unless the people of God are bowing down to and being enslaved by those same false gods as well. And if that is the case, then sadly we have very little or no capacity to reflect the image, to reveal the glory, to advance the kingdom in these vitally important real life, every day where people live realities of money, sex, and power. And you know what? Money, sex, and power are every day where people live realities. So, beloved, by way of preparation, by way of consecration, guard yourselves from idols. During this season, it's important for us to identify them, renounce them, do everything we can to remove them so that when we get to where we're going, we can be free from them and from that freedom be in a position to in life-affirming ways offer that freedom to others. Now, before I actually get down into the specifics of money, sex, and power, which actually we'll get to next week, I want to invite you into a picture that I have that provides some context for where I believe we are as a church right now in our journey of faith. And it will help you understand why I believe it's so important that we speak of these things now in anticipation, in preparation for where we're going. The picture is that of an incident, a season in the life of God's people on their journey of faith that is revealed to us in the book of Joshua, Chapter 1, verse 1. If you have your Bibles, open to Joshua, chapter 1. If you don't, the verses are going to be on the screen, so you can follow along there. Just to get the ball rolling, I'm going to read the first three verses, and we'll kind of just set the scene for what's going on. Here's how it reads. It came about, after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spoke to Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses' servant, saying, Moses, my servant, is dead. Now therefore, arise, cross this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel. And every place on which the sole of your foot treads, I have given it to you just as I spoke to Moses. I'm just going to set the scene here and pick apart what we have here. The fact that Moses is dead marks the end of an era. The fact that Joshua is the new leader marks the beginning of a new era. The fact that they are on the shores of the Jordan River about to cross over and enter into the land of promise marks the fact that they are about to enter into some very new things. Things that they have never experienced before. Things that they're not real clear about relative to what they're actually going to be. What they know for sure is when we cross this river, it's going to be a whole new thing. Now, I don't think that it takes great powers of perception to discern the fact that as a church, we are ourselves on the threshold of some very new things. We don't know all of what they will be, but they are new. Whether we know it or not or like it or not, we're entering into a whole new era of church ministry. A whole new season of life that's going to be marked by many things. I'll just give you one. And this is like the most obvious because it has to do with the physical reality of our move. We are entering into an entirely new kind of presence in the community. And this is just one tiny little thing. Among other things, the newness of our presence in the community will be that it's permanent. That's going to be a new thing for us. It will be visible. Visible more than we've ever been before. It will be a whole new thing. Quite frankly, I do not think we have any idea, and it's not because we're kind of dull. It has nothing to do with that. It's that for 13 years, we have had temporary space. I don't think we have any idea how permanence is going to change us. It's going to be a whole new thing. It's going to be, I believe, a season of incredible opportunity for success in the best kingdom sense of the word. It is also, however, going to be an incredible season of potential danger as well. Well, what do you do? Here's what you do. Prepare yourselves. Chapter one, verse 11 says that before they crossed the Jordan river, Joshua said to the people, pass through the midst of the camp and command the people saying, prepare provisions. And quite frankly, the provisions there was a recognition, the preparation there was a recognition that there are some physical things we're going to have to do. And I mean, can you imagine the physical things we had to do to meet here this weekend? You get maybe a taste of it, but believe me, over the next year, there are gonna be physical things that we need to be preparing. But the preparation is not just physical, it's spiritual as well. Here's what we do, chapter three, verse five. Joshua said this, consecrate yourselves. Then Joshua said to the people, consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, the Lord will do wonders among you. Back to the story. This miraculous crossing of the Jordan River by the people of God is recorded for us in Joshua chapter 3. Just read with me, beginning in verse 15. So it came about that when those who carried the ark came into the Jordan and the feet of the priests carrying the ark were dipped in the edge of the water, for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the days of harvest, that the waters which were flowing down from above stood up and rose up in one heap. An incredible thing to see, I'm sure. Move up to verse 17. And the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan while all of Israel crossed on dry land until the nation had finished crossing the Jordan. A miraculous crossing of the people of God through the water. Now, that miraculous crossing is very reminiscent of another one. And it could even be that some of you didn't know that there were two. I mean, we always know the people went through the water. You get confused with the Red Sea and the Jordan River. Well, there were two crossings. The first crossing, miraculously, of the people of God through water was in Exodus 14. The leader in that time wasn't Joshua, it was Moses. It wasn't the Jordan River, it was the Red Sea. And they weren't entering the promised land like they are when they crossed the Jordan. They were escaping an evil land. And this picture and these contrasts are important. When they were crossing the Red Sea, it was a different era. It was a different season in the journey of faith. And God, among the people of God, was doing a different thing. Differences are notable. For instance, crossing the Red Sea. When the people of God with Moses came to the Red Sea, their whole life situation was different. Pharaoh was chasing them. They had been in slavery for many, many years, and all they wanted was to escape slavery. That's all they cared about. In fact, they had at times grown despairing of the possibility that they could ever be free. So the possibility that that was even real was an amazing thing to them. As you probably recall, Pharaoh, after the ten plagues, had finally relented to let the people go. But as soon as they left, he changed his mind and began to chase them, wanting to re-enslave them and maybe kill them. And in the drama of this whole thing, as they came to the Red Sea, the people of God were trapped in front of them. The Red Sea was there and it appeared to be impassable. Behind them, Pharaoh's army was coming. Miraculously, with this great adventure unfolding before them, God parted the waters. They crossed on dry land, just like it would happen 40 years later, crossing the Jordan, Only this time it was the Red Sea. The picture of where the people of God were at and what the dramatic tension around this crossing was is very significant. During this season, Red Sea season, of their faith journey, they were not so much running to something as much as they were running away from something. It could be said, you know, when they were crossing the Red Sea that they were running to God. But I think more clearly, they were running away from Egypt. Get me out of here. So the crossing of the Red Sea, just get this little nuance in your mind, was not so much about going there, the promised land, as much as it was escaping there, this evil, slavery, abusive, death-dealing Egypt. Picture I have in my mind as they're crossing the Red Sea, if the Red Sea is here and they're wanting to get across, they're not wanting to get across so much because they're feeling this call. It's more they're wanting to get away from what's coming after them. And so they're walking this way across the Red Sea, but they're looking that way. Ah, so they're going this way, and that's a good thing, but they're looking that way. As across the Red Sea, the picture you want to have in your mind's eye redemptively is that as they're doing that, they're being redeemed, they're being healed, they're being delivered, they're being set free. And as all of those wonderful things were happening, as they came to the other side and they saw the Egyptian army defeated in the water as it came back and brought judgment on them, they were deliriously grateful. And they sang the song of Moses, the horse and rider thrown into the sea. God has dealt wonderfully with us. They were deliriously grateful for about 10 minutes. When, as you know, they began to grumble and complain. Even some of them wanting to go back to Egypt. You know, when they were in Egypt, it was terrible, and they could taste the death, and they could taste, the sin tasted horrible and terrible, and they didn't like it, and they wanted to get out. And then when they had the chance, they ran for their lives. But as soon as they got to the other side, as soon as their big battle in the wilderness was, I didn't hate everything about it. I kind of liked some of that back there, and they began to pine for the good old days. of slavery and sin and death. Now before you judge them too harshly or quickly, I just want you to understand as we're talking about, I want you to get this picture of a journey. They're on a journey in different seasons and different times and God deals with us differently at different times that when they cross the Red Sea, this kind of grumbling, it's kind of where they were. They were beginning. Perspective I want you to have around that is this. There's nothing wrong with being a beginner when you're a beginner. It's because you're a beginner. That's okay to be that way then. Put it another way. There's nothing wrong with being a baby when you're a baby. Bonnie and I had four kids. When they were little babies, I would hold them and they would cry. And I would look at them and I'd go, you are such a baby. And Bonnie would say to me, they're babies. They're supposed to cry. the one who shouldn't be a baby is you nothing wrong with being a baby when you're a baby like newborn babies this is where the people of God were when they crossed the Red Sea like little chicks in a bird's nest I mean I get a real picture of that in spring we had a little bird's nest around our house and they're constantly with their mouths open screaming I'm hungry feed me I'm thirsty quench me it's all they do their whole relationship at this time in their journey of faith was about what God would do for them what God would do actually to them so the first cry was this save us and he did and he parted the Red Sea and they walked across on dry land next cry feed us and he did manna from heaven every single day next cry quench us we're thirsty and he did water coming from a rock. But here's the problem. In his saving them, feeding them, quenching them, leading them, it was never enough for them. And that is where it began to be problematic. For instead of just starting that way, like demanding babies, demanding babies are demanding, and that's okay to start that way. The problem for the people of God was that they got stuck that way. So that their whole relationship with God was about, again, what he would do for them. Their paradigm, if not spoken, lived out was this. He is provider. And by the way, he is provider. But this was the only dimension that they understood or entered into. He is provider. I am consumer. And as long as God does for me what I want him to do, when I want him to do it, as long as he says how high when I say jump, I will pay homage to him as God. But as soon as he didn't, you know the story. They made for themselves other gods. And this issue of idolatry pops up again that John is talking about in 1 John 5.21. They found for themselves other sources, Exodus chapter 32. They dug their own wells. They lit their own fires. And as a direct result of that, they wandered in the wilderness for 40 years. Sure, they escaped Egypt. Hallelujah. We're free. We're saved. But they never entered in to the fullness of what we call out of our study in 1 John, the fullness of kingdom life. They never entered into what the word of God in Exodus and Joshua and Judges refers to as the land of promise. Now come back with me to the story of Joshua. The people of God in the story of Joshua, chapter 1, are in a different place. Standing on the shores of the Jordan River. They're in a different place physically. They're in a different place spiritually. Physically, they're not at the Red Sea anymore. They're at the Jordan River. Spiritually, they're in a different place as well. You see, this wilderness experience had done some things in them and to them. And the wilderness experience for many of them was a very important place for a question to be answered. And the question that needed to be answered was this. Are you going to believe me and obey me even in the wilderness? And by the time we get to the people at the Jordan River, This people had said, we are going to follow you. There had been a growing up in them. Spiritually, they were no longer looking to God to help them escape the old. They were now beginning to learn to look to God to help them enter the new. They were no longer just running from something. They were running to something. Here's the difference between the Red Sea crossing and the Jordan River crossing in a spiritual sense. This time, nothing's chasing them. This time, something's calling them across the Jordan. Remember I told you when they crossed the Red Sea, they were going this way, but they were looking that way. Now they're at the Jordan River, nothing's chasing them, and they're at the shores of the Jordan, and they're looking across, and they hear a voice, and they see a vision, and there's something calling. It's really a different place. and the question as they're standing at the shores of the Jordan River from God to them is this will you believe me obey me and follow me those three things which are characteristics we spoke of all through 1 John will you believe obey and follow me into the fullness of this land that I have promised into the reality of this eternal kind of life that John spoke of in his epistle not just to escape the sin, hurt, and death, but to possess the freedom, health, and life. Will you come to me across the Jordan saying, not only save me, heal me, feed me. You can still say that. But would you add to your vocabulary, empower me, strengthen me, partner with me, God, as we possess and enter into a different way of living. I want you to know something else about this picture of them crossing to Jordan into what's called the land of promise. When I hear that phrase, the land of promise, the word that kind of grabs my ear is promise. It makes it sound easy to me. I mean, when I first look at that promise, it's easy because it's what? It's a promise. And so my posture toward getting the promise is that I kind of can live my life in the proverbial family room of life with my little channel surfer just kind of shifting the channels and going, hey, promise, I do the promise, Lenny. You get all this wonderful stuff. And every once in a while, I just stop and go, is it here yet? Well, guess not. Go back to this mind-numbing way of life that isn't connected at all with what he's saying or calling me, I'm just going to sit in a family room waiting for him to land a promise on me some way because it's a promise. That perspective is encouraged in Joshua 1 verses 2 and 3 where God, Joshua said, arise and I'll cross the Jordan, you and all the people to the land that I am giving to you. He's going to give it to me. I'll just kind of stay here oblivious and every place on which you put your feet, I will give it to you. Again, I could get the impression that I can be passive. Verse 5, no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Sounds like a done deal. Again, like something I can passively receive. The first hint, however, that this is maybe something that is not passively received. It is something that God is going to do, but I do not passively receive it, is in verse 6. Where he says this, but be strong and of good courage, Joshua. Again in verse 7, only be strong and courageous. Again in verse 9, have I not commanded you? Sounds like maybe he's not getting the message. He says it over again. Be strong and courageous. Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you. See, that kind of puts into a spin my idea that this is a done deal, that I can passively receive it. Because if this is something I passively receive, and I don't actively enter into this at all, why on earth would I need to be strong or courageous? Why would he warn me not to be timid? We're afraid. Here's why. Because the promise needs to be possessed. And to be possessed, some things need to be dispossessed. Chapter 3, verse 10, And Joshua said, By this you shall know, that the living God is among you, and that he will assuredly dispossess before you. The Canaanite, Hittite, Hivite, Perizzite, all these ites. They're kind of symbolic of spiritual strongholds that need to be dispossessed. They need to lose their grip in your life, in your land. And you need to put your feet where they are. You don't sit in the proverbial family room of your life, channel surfing, expecting any of this to happen. by the way I don't want to be confronted about channel surfing this afternoon it's father's day and I get to do that a little talking about you know the whole way you do your life are you with me here guys I'm not abandoning you entirely okay it's an illustration here You need to move your feet. In fact, in chapter 1, verse 3, when it sounds like it's this easy thing, every place on which the sole of your feet treads, I have given it to you, but I have given it to you sounds like you're passive. No, right before that, you are putting your feet someplace, and when you put your feet there, I will give it to you. Go toward this thing you're scared of. Walk into that stronghold of your life. maybe around your sexuality, maybe around your money, maybe around power and how it has maybe hurt you or how you instinctively use power to manipulate and crush people and moving toward this stronghold in your life that maybe has been in your life or your family or your marriage. It's marked your marriage maybe for generations. I'm calling you, I am calling you out to come across the Jordan and begin to possess these things that some of you have given up believing you could ever possess, you could ever be free from. Remember back in the Red Sea, wilderness wanderings, they sent out the spies to go into this very land. And the report came back, two came back, Joshua and Caleb came back saying, oh, the giants are huge, they're unbelievable. It really is frightening, but God can give us the victory if we will just go. But the rest of the spies says, oh, they're like giants, we look like grasshoppers in our sight. And that stronghold of my sexual addiction or my problem with money, we just don't have any chance. So let's just wander here in the wilderness and sing our churchy songs all our lifelong. But never really possessed, never put our feet anywhere. And we pass on that kind of mediocrity to our sons and to our daughters and on and on it goes and wandering in circles until some generation stands up and says, I'm not running from this. I'm hearing a call to cross this river and take these cities because God said, I can bring down this stronghold of disordered sexuality and disordered money and disordered power and we can live a different way. Picture you need to have of this crossing. It's wonderful just the way this whole thing plays out but when they crossed the Jordan River into the promised land, the promised land was full of cities. Again, they didn't cross the Jordan into the promised land and just go, oh, give me a little fruit drink here and sit by the pool. It was full of cities, fortress cities that were literally strongholds of the enemy. And all of the book of Joshua and Judges, I think, can best be understood if you understand it as a parable or an allegory of sorts of spiritual warfare. Jericho was probably the best known of these fortress cities. It wasn't a real big city, but the walls were just intimidating. And when the people in Jericho heard that the people of God had crossed the Jordan, they all went into their city and they walled it up and nobody's going to get inside. They were safe in there, they thought. And as the people of God crossed the Jordan and began to come to one city after another, cities, they didn't know which one was next. God would just show them the next one the next week and the next one. one by one by one as the people kept on believing and kept on obeying and kept on loving the Lord their God with all their heart, soul, and mind and as they kept on putting their feet where God told them to put their feet one by one by one these cities began to fall. The walls began to crumble. Insurmountable odds were overcome. Impregnable forces were overrun. Undefeatable foes were utterly destroyed. And the people began to live free in the land of promise. and bondages that had hindered those people for generations were being broken. Now, I say all of that to say this. That where I believe we are in our journey of faith as a church is on the threshold of the Jordan River. We're not on the threshold of the Red Sea. Now, one of the problems with bringing up these analogies, Red Sea and Jordan River, is that everything in this story doesn't correspond directly to where we are. And so when I talk about, I can kind of in my mind, after being here 20 years, feature a time when it felt like we were more on the shores of the Red Sea. It's not everything about that is the same, but I do remember a season. Some of you were here, many of you were here during a season. And when I describe it, you'll know what I'm talking about. Where not every person in our body, but the spirit of the church was very consistent with where the people of God were when they crossed the Red Sea. It was kind of like this, save me, heal me, feed me. And for many among us, the primary relationship they had with God was what he would do for them, what he would do to them. And it was where we were. And, you know, there's nothing wrong with being a baby when you're a baby, but when you get stuck there, it's not okay. And we got stuck there. What was the word that God gave to us eight, nine years ago? If you were here, you remember. Grow up or what? Die. Now we're grown up. I don't know if we're grown up. Here's what I do believe and know, that as a people, every single person, probably not, as a people, as a people, we took very seriously that word. We took that word very seriously. And we don't even know what that means or how to do that. But we are going to put our heads down and open our hearts to whatever God has for us in terms of what it means to be a people who grow up. I don't think this church would still exist, at least not in anywhere near the form it is right now, had we not responded to that pretty harsh word eight, nine years ago. We're in a different place. I'm glad that we are. And as I now consider what it means to cross the Jordan, whatever that means, What dawns on me is this, that when you cross the Jordan, you're not just in a different place physically, but you're in a different place spiritually. You're not just looking to God to help you escape the old thing, you're looking to God to help you enter the new thing. The difference between the Red Sea crossing and the Jordan River crossing is that when you cross the Jordan, you're not running from something, you're running to something. When you're crossing the Jordan River, nothing's chasing you, something's calling you. And many of you feel things stirring me when I talk that way, you know exactly what I'm talking about. And beloved, I believe the call of God on us in this season of life and faith is this. And by the way, this call I'm about to give you is not one that's starting today. We have been hearing what I'm about to say for a long time. It's this, God to us saying, I want to be more than a provider for you. I want to be a provider for you, but I want to be more than provider for you who does things for you and does things to you, to whom you are only saying, save me, heal me, fix me, feed me, quench me. I want to be partner with you. How long have we been hearing that word? Well, at least in very specific ways since we began 1 John, I think before that. But the message of 1 John is this, come partner with me in this eternal kind of life. Partner with me to take possession of the promises to break down strongholds and fortress cities in Maple Grove. Forget about Maple Grove right now. To bring down strongholds and fortress cities in your own life and in my own life. And then as those cities that maybe I thought one day would never be free, walls that never would come down as they do come down, we as individuals and as a people of God in this community can with an authority we maybe never had previously help others do the same and walk into freedoms of their own. So what do we do? Prepare yourselves, consecrate yourselves. The three strongholds in particular, three fortress cities that we're going to talk about over the next few weeks that need to be identified, renounced, and redeemed are the idolatrous strongholds of disordered sexuality, disordered money, and disordered power. They are fortress cities. And for some of you as individuals, they may feel impenetrable, undefeatable, impregnable. They might even feel like fortresses and strongholds of the enemy that you've looked at before and kind of moved toward a bit but now have just given up ever believing that you could ever have real freedom there. And the picture I have in my mind is an odd one. I picture some of us living next to these strongholds of the enemy in our lives and we're just kind of sitting there tilling the ground and we've just gotten used to them being there. And the thought of ever having freedom there, we've just kind of given up on that. Let me close with a word from the scripture. that speaks to all of that and will allow me to pull this whole word together. It begins in Deuteronomy and then moves to Joshua. This is God speaking. People of God, and on this particular Sunday, I'll be as bold as to say, Church of the Open Door, this commandment which I command you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it out of your reach. It is not in heaven that you should say, who will go up to heaven to get it for us so that we can hear it and then observe it? Nor is it beyond the sea that you should say, who will cross the sea for us to get it for us and make us hear it that we may observe it? But the word I'm speaking to you today is very near to you. It is in your mouth. It is in your heart. Already there in order that you may observe it. See, I have set before you today life and death, blessing and curse, that I command you, here's the command, to love the Lord your God with all your heart and soul and mind, to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments that you may live and multiply and pass this on. Does this stir in you to pass this on for generations? It's Father's Day. You know what? I think about passing things on for generations. You know what you get to pass on? Obedience. You know what you get to pass on? A legacy of putting your feet where God tells you to put your feet. men and women choose life in order that you may live you and your descendants by loving the Lord your God by obeying his voice and holding fast to him therefore arise church of the open door cross this Jordan you and all this people to the land which I am giving you and every place on which the sole of your foot treads, I will give it to you. But be strong and very courageous. Do not tremble or be dismayed for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go. So now prepare yourselves. Chapter 1 verse 11. Consecrate yourselves. Chapter 3 verse 5. I was preparing this this week and some of these pictures were coming to mind. I wondered how to close. I felt we were to do that some way. Prepare ourselves and consecrate ourselves. I didn't know how. Only this. That what we should do is pray. And to pray in a way that was enough different that it marked this day off as a different thing. So I could just close in prayer but I decided not to do that. I've asked Tom and Jan to come. And part of this is symbolic, to just take some purposeful time at the end of this word to, in prayer, recognize this call to preparation and consecration. And we're just going to begin with Jan. I would like you to stand as we receive this word and this prayer. Jan and then Tom. as I was here in the first service I got a picture of something and that was that we were to take off our shoes God promised the Israelite people that he would give them the land that they would possess and it would be the soles of their feet that would possess that land So in agreement with that, as a people of God, I invite you to remove your shoes and acknowledge that our almighty God, our almighty Father, is leading us to a new place. And I would like to symbolically invite Tom and Dave, if you could put your hands on me, to symbolize that we are here together in this. and we will be together as he leads us. Holy God, I ask now that you would extend forth your hand upon us and that you would pour out your mercies from heaven, that we might be given and we might follow you in obedience in this time of consecration and preparation. Holy God, we ask that you would forgive us the sins of despairing you, of not believing that you are big enough and able enough to lead us and break down those strongholds in our lives and in our children's lives. God, we also ask you to forgive us the sins of presumption that we do not have to do anything. God, give us courage in this season of time to listen to you and to obediently follow you that we might see the glories of your hand and know the wonders of your love. Thank you, Jesus. Father, as you stand here with our shoes off, we are real aware of our vulnerability before you, that everything we have is a gift from you. We have done nothing to deserve it. And you've invited us into a partnership, which is one of dependence upon you, one in which we come bringing nothing but ourselves and saying we are available to you. That's the way we're going to win, no other way. So we declare our dependence upon you. We acknowledge our vulnerability. And we ask that you would grant us the grace to be able to move into that and live that way before you. Lord, part of the ways in which you have said warfare is won in our lives and strongholds come down is through the weapons of our warfare, which are not carnal but they're mighty through God, to the pulling down of strongholds. and every vain, empty thing that should presume itself to vie for truth and that exalts itself against the truth of who you are. That is a stronghold, and we choose, Lord, to enter into the weapons that you've provided for us, your word and prayer. That as we enter into that relationship with truth, learning to hear your voice and learning to respond, that we will see these strongholds come down. We pray for that grace and the movement of your spirit among us, individually and as a church, that we could see where we have erred and we could own it because the truth has spoken and we have responded as dependent, vulnerable people being led by you. Spirit of God, we pray that as we move against the strongholds that we are up against, that you would be gracious to us in leading us along in these battles one by one as you see fit. We pray that you would protect us and you would shield us, that you would grant us the gifts of repentance and forgiveness and confession, that we would be a people who would be marked by you and that you would invite us into that journey of love where we would learn to begin to prefer one another above ourselves and be the kind of people when others would look at us that would say, look how they love one another. Jesus must be real. We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. Just as we dismiss, a couple that might help you. One, you know, when they went into the land, they didn't take every city all at once. God was gracious. It was like one at a time. And so just kind of go at this that way. a couple of assignments, if you will. I would encourage you on an individual basis when you get with God to pray. I'm just very confident of his ability to speak to you around this. Just have the courage to say, God, would you reveal to me any fortress cities in my life? Dave is gonna be talking about some and they might apply to you, but they might not. So what are some fortress cities that you would be gently but very firmly like a God to a Joshua saying, I want you to put your feet over here. And this city that you've kind of living with in your family or your marriage that you've kind of gotten used to and you think it's just okay, it's just part of the scenery, the walls from that thing need to come down. And just ask God about that, and I think he'll give you some amazing things. And then the second is, as you partner with us, as you are part of our body, just be praying these weeks as week after week we talk about some of these fortress cities of sexuality. I think it's just huge for our culture, for our church of power and money that God would give us just to stay on them as long as we need to. You know, one of the analogies of every city when they took Jericho and then they went to these other places, that every city was taken, the walls would come down or they would be taken a different way. So as we talk about one, there may be some things we need to do around that. But that doesn't become the way. There might be a different thing as we talk about other issues. So just inviting you into the prayer journey around this whole thing as well. Father we thank you for the workings of your spirit among us for the journey of faith that you have been on with us I thank you that you are the God of our journey so grateful for that be with us now as we respond to your call to be strong and courageous pray these things in your name and all God's people said Amen God bless you the altar team will be here for people who need prayer this morning before you leave you can do that the rest of you are dismissed God bless you as you leave Thank you.
