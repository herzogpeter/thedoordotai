I want to remind you of a few things as we continue the study, and that is, first of all, we are still dealing with the Olivet Discourse, where Jesus is answering a two-fold question posed by the disciples to Jesus in chapter 24, verse 3. The question was, number one, what will be the signs of your coming? And number two, when will your coming be? In verses 4 to 31 of chapter 24, Jesus dealt with what the signs would be. In verses 32 to 41, Jesus dealt with when his coming would be, and the bottom line answer to when he was going to come was simply this, nobody knows. Not the angels in heaven, not even the Son, only the Father himself knows when the sign of the Son of Man will appear. Therefore, or because of the fact that no one knows the day of his coming, and no one knows their day, speaking of my personal end, my death as it were, because that is true from verse 42 to 51 in chapter 24, Jesus gave a warning. It was threefold. Be alert, be ready, and be faithful. As last week we came to the beginning of chapter 25, what we discovered was that what Jesus was doing in chapter 25, still part of the discourse, was restating these warnings about being alert, being ready, and being faithful with a series of parables, the first of them being the parable of the ten virgins. That parable, which parallels and restates verses 42 to 44, was a call to readiness, a call to preparation. The haunting aspect of that particular parable, however, was that all ten virgins appeared to be ready. They appeared to be prepared, but they weren't. All of them were at the wedding. All of them were waiting for the groom. All of them were in the assembly. All of them appeared to be dressed and ready for the celebration. All of them had their little wedding jobs. They had their little ministries in the church. They had their torches. But as everything was sorted out at the coming of the groom, it turned out that only five of them actually had the oil or the life of God, the saving grace of redemption, and five did not. Five of the ten were not prepared. Be alert, be ready, was the parable of the ten virgins. Today, the parable of the celebration, all of them had their little wedding jobs. They had their little ministries in the church. They had their torches. But as everything was sorted out at the coming of the groom, it turned out that only five of them actually had the oil or the life of God, the saving grace of redemption, and five did not. Five of the ten were not prepared. Be alert, be ready, was the parable of the ten virgins. Today, the parable we're dealing with is a parallel to and a restatement of the principles disclosed in verses 45 to 51 of chapter 24, where Jesus contrasts a faithful slave to a faithless slave. Specifically, this parable is called the parable of the talents. Let's read the text, verse 14. For it is just like a man about to go on a journey, who called his own slaves together and entrusted his possessions to all of them. And to one of them he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, each according to his own ability, and he went on his journey. Immediately the one who had received the five talents went and traded with them and gained five more or profited five more talents. In the same manner, the one who had received the two talents gained two more. But the one who received the one talent went away and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them and the one who had received the five talents came up and brought five more talents saying master you entrusted me with five see i have gained five more his master said to him well done good and faithful slave you were faithful with a few things i will put you in charge of many things and this is an eternal ruling with me is what they will be in charge of now this is at the end of the day the end of the age. Enter also into the joy of your master. The one also who had received the two talents came up and said, Master, you entrusted me with two talents. I have gained two more. And the master said to him, well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. Enter also into the joy of your master. And the one also who had received the one talent came up and said, Master, I knew something about you that the other ones didn't know. And that is this, that you're a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed and I was afraid and went away and hid your talent in the ground see you have what is yours but his master answered and said to him you wicked lazy slave you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I scattered no seed if you knew that then you at least ought to have put the money in the bank on my arrival I would have received my money back with interest there still would have been profits therefore take away the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten. For the principle here is that everyone who has shall more be given and shall have an abundance, but from the one who does not have even what he does have shall be taken away and cast the worthless slave into outer darkness. In that place there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Very interesting parable. In some places, somewhat troubling, maybe even somewhat confusing. I know it's long from verse 14 to 30. There is no way that we're going to land on every single nuance of this text, but the main thrust of it, which is most important, I really believe we're going to be able to get a handle on it. Well, let's pray as we begin. Jesus, again, as I consider this section of scripture that we're in, we are mindful that this isn't, again, the final week of your life. And these are among the final words you are saying to the disciples, designed to prepare them for kingdom ministry. And now, 2,000 years later, these words are being given to us as ministers, as slaves in your field, in your kingdom, designed to prepare us as well for ministry, for entering into your kingdom. And Father, in Jesus' name, as we would attempt to delineate the truth that is here, I pray that there would not only be an ability for us physically to comprehend the parable, but Father, far more than any physical insight or intellectual perception we might be able to come away with. There would be that supernatural work of the Spirit among us that transforms us on the inside. We ask for that work to be released among us, even as we go into your word in Jesus' name. Amen. As is almost always the case, when we come to a text, it seems like we break it down into how many parts? Three parts. I think there's something very supernatural about that. There's something spiritual about that, something about the Trinity and all this kind of neat stuff. But we're going to break this one into three parts as well. Three things I want us to understand. First of all, the resources that were given will help us understand what he's saying. Second of all, we want to examine the response to the resources that were given. There were two responses. And the third thing is simply understanding the reckoning of the king to the response that people had to the resources they were given. First of all, the resources we received. The way we get to this is simply by beginning to break down the elements of the text. Verse 14, For it is like a man about to go on a journey. Stop right there. For it is like. What is it that we're speaking of? It is the kingdom. It is the kingdom. I want us to make a special note of this at the very beginning when Jesus here in this text, as he has been in the last several texts, speaking of the kingdom, he is speaking of the kingdom in a broad sense, in the sphere of the kingdom, as it were. When he is speaking of the slaves that are in the context of his kingdom, they are like the virgins that we dealt with last week who all appear to be part of the assembly. All of the slaves, like all of the virgins, appear to be part of the celebration and the congregation, the community. They all appear to be part of the kingdom. But the problem is there is a mixture of those who are genuinely belonging to the king and committed to the king and knowing the king and those who really aren't part of that. That dynamic, that reality, is a common theme of teaching all through the Gospels. Because it is a common theme, one of the things that communicates to us is that it is very important. I believe that one of the reasons it is important is because of ministry. In preparing the disciples for their ministry and preparing us for our ministry, I believe that if we don't understand this dynamic, we are going to be terribly disillusioned in all of the kingdom work we do and all of the activity we get involved in, even in the church. what you need to understand ministers of the kingdom of God is as you get involved in the kingdom you're going to run into people who are real and are false and that is going to be part of the explanation for the frustration you sometimes have you see the kingdom of God is like a field and in the field there are two kinds of crops there are wheat and there are tares there are those who are real and there are those who are not you have to know that the kingdom of God is like a dragnet and when the dragnet is pulled up onto the shores of eternity there's two kind of fish there is good fish and there is garbage fish. In the kingdom of God, it's like men who build their house and everybody's building a religious house, a spiritual house. But one person builds his house on the rock of salvation by grace through faith. It is built on the rock of Jesus' performance and that's the house that stands. Other people are building a house, looks the same as that one on the outside, but it's built on the shifting sand of their religious performance. And in the day of judgment, when the water of judgment comes, the one that's built on the sand of your performance, gets washed away. There's two different kinds of houses. In the kingdom of God, there's two different paths. One is wide and one is narrow. There's two gates. One is wide and one is narrow. There's ten virgins. Five have oil. Five do not in the kingdom. It's like a man going on a journey who calls all of his slaves unto himself, but there are two kinds of slaves. And one kind of slave is going to enter into the joy of the Lord, verse 21, into the joy of the master. The other slave is ultimately going to be cast out into outer darkness to a place where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth but he entrusts to all of them his possessions what are his possessions what are his possessions his possessions are speaking i believe of privilege a sense of privilege and giftedness if you will the concept of being entrusted is speaking of responsibility to respond in some way to the privilege that you've got. Now what are the possessions specifically? All of what possessions could mean, I can only speculate at that. In the physical sense, when the master is giving to all of the people of all of his slaves, in the context of the kingdom, his possessions, I suppose in a physical sense, it could mean the world, it could mean the earth, it could mean their life, their breath, the fact that they have the gift of life at all. But this is speaking of, again, the sphere of the kingdom. And so there would have to be spiritual possessions that he is giving or giftedness that he is giving everyone. It is, I believe, part of at least what is being spoken of here is gospel, the gospel, the gospel privilege, to hear it, to understand it, to be exposed to it. The possessions are the gifts of the spirit, the kingdom of God itself, the grace of God, the Holy Spirit, everything pertaining to life and godliness. But in verse 15, it says this. While he gives to all of those who are kind of in the sphere of the kingdom, the possessions, they are kind of meted out differently in some way. There is a different measure of his possession given to one and to another and to another. To one there is five, to one there is two, to one there is one. And that's where we begin to move in verse 15, speaking of talents. In order to understand this at all, we need to define talents. What is a talent? I need to ask you a question. How many of you, especially if you grew up in Sunday school and maybe some Christian home, got the message that what a talent was was your ability to play the piano. It's like when you were a little kid, your mother brought this verse out to you and said, if you don't practice a piano, you'll be burying your talent and you'll be cast in outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. So practice your piano because you don't want to bury your talent. Now, maybe you didn't hear that, but I talked to a number of people this week when they knew I was talking about the parable of the talents, told me that's exactly what they always thought. What is a talent? Let's erase our blackboard for a minute and begin to do some building of teaching in terms of what it really means. A talent is nothing more than a measure of weight. It would be good if visually you could just kind of picture just a weight. If you lift weights, maybe just a weight, just sitting there. That's what a talent is. We have measures of weight. There's an ounce. There's a pound. There's a ton. There's also a talent. In the research I did, it was kind of hard to figure out what it exactly was. There was some speculation. Where I'm landing is that a talent weighs anywhere between 50 and 100 pounds. Okay? That's what a talent weighs. So if you have a talent of something, a talent of gold, you have anywhere between 50 and 100 pounds of gold. One talent would be a lot of gold. So if you get one, you have a treasure that is beyond counting. But in this particular parable, each slave is given a different measure of talent, a different measure of not talent, ability, talent of weight. Okay, what does that mean when it says I've been given a different measure of weight? What's the picture here? Well, I believe that what the picture is speaking of, or what the different weight speaks to, is two things. Number one, I think it is speaking of different weights of opportunity that every one of us have, and it is also speaking of different weights of capacity that every one of us have to deal with or flesh out the opportunities we get. Let me elaborate just a little bit. The weight that we have been given, some five, some two, some one, is the different kinds of opportunities that each one of us have, for example, had to hear the gospel. That's a weight. It is gospel privilege. I don't think I have to do much talking to convince you that if you would just kind of let your mind skim across the world, that people have different weight in terms of their opportunity to hear. If we were to compare ourselves sitting in this room with some tribe in Africa, we would all probably be able to acknowledge that the weight of opportunity we have been exposed to in terms of just being able to hear the gospel is far greater than those who've been in some little foreign country, in some little tribe where the name of Jesus has been barely heard. What that means is in the bag of our opportunity, as it were, we've got a real heavy piece of gold. We have heard and heard and heard. We can go home and turn on the radio on your car on the way home. You can hear another message after this one about the grace of God, about the kingdom of God, about the one that we all serve. And over and over again, we get more weight added to it, it seems like. I could go past that picture and make it even more specific for us. Within this room, there are people who have had more opportunity than others. And because of that, your bag is a little bit fuller than someone else's. What I mean by that is this. Some of you are from homes that are wonderfully healthy. There is a graceful environment in your home, and the message of the gospel of the kingdom is straight and it is solid. The teaching there is wonderful. Some of you are from churches where the atmosphere is the same. You are from a very healthy church. That is your background. The atmosphere there was graceful and wonderful, and the teaching was solid. What that means is that you are coming from a background where you got a lot of opportunity in your bag. The weight is significant. You've heard, it's been clear, the atmosphere has been graceful, and that is wonderful. Some of you come to us with an entirely different dynamic in your bag, as it were, of opportunity, because you did not have a healthy home, a healthy church, a graceful home, a graceful church. Solid teaching was not something you had, and so compared to maybe someone else, You got a two, they got a five. All this simply means is that as it relates to opportunity, some get a five, some get a two, some get a one. Now, I don't have time to develop this entirely, but an awful lot of us spend a lot of time going, oh, I got a two, how come I didn't get a five? Well, I'm going to deal with that a little bit later. Well, let me just keep going and explaining the concept here. Not only do we all have different weights, as it were, of opportunity in our life, but we all have different weights of capacity to respond to the opportunity we've gotten. Let me explain that. Every one of us here have different mental capacities. Every one of us have different physical capacities, emotional, psychological, financial, spiritual. We all have different capacities. And while we all have different opportunities and we all have different capacities, put all those opportunities and capacities together and add it all up and put it in one bag and what you have is the weight that you've been given. Some are five, some are two, some are one. Some of you have been given great opportunity to hear and hear and know and be in a graceful atmosphere, but for one reason or another, really, quite frankly, it isn't your fault at all. You have a limited capacity. To just give you an extreme example of this, I would think of someone who is simple, just simple, lovable, loving, lovely person, but in their thinking, in their capacity to respond to even all that they're being exposed to, they're just they're simple you've you've known simple people the good news about this is this you are not responsible for what you're incapable of that's just what's in your bag and be okay with that on the other hand there are some people who've had very little opportunity they've heard very little of the gospel very little deep teaching but because somehow god gave them a five in their weight of capacity they took the very small opportunity they got and they just began to soar some got five some got two some got one now let me let me just apply this a little bit as i kind of sit on my desk and i try to think of how this lands i think of a couple ways people could respond again i already gave you one some people could respond and go yeah i can look at my bag i can tell i got a one and everything i think i got a half i didn't even get a full one of anything okay okay we can sit and grouse about what we think we got in our bag or not but but the truth is, I think if we understand this principle, it is incredibly liberating. Let me tell you why. My job, this parable, confirms to me as an individual, and now as a redeemed person, see, I even think this would have, see, someone without the Lord, if they would get this principle, would be a little healthier. But now as a redeemed person, what I'm beginning to understand is that my job as a person is to look into the bag of my life and consider what it is that God has given me in terms of the weight of opportunity, but also I've got to kind of balance that with the weight of capacity God has given me, which is something I have no control over, just the weight of capacity God has given me to respond to and flesh out the opportunity God has given me. And when I do that, to begin to use that weight of gold, as it were, that weight of silver, as it were, in a way that is consistent with who I am, in a way that is consistent with what is in my bag. The reason that is liberating is when I begin to focus on my life that way, there is no longer any comparing with anybody else. There is no longer any trying to be like anybody else. My job is to figure out what the opportunity God has given me and what the capacity God has given me and flesh that out. I'm not trying to be like anybody else. Think about the men and women of faith in the Bible. My mind goes back to Abraham and Moses and Noah and Jonah and all these guys and Paul and Peter and be like Paul. Be like Abraham. Okay, okay, fine. Okay, okay. If what we mean by be like Paul, we need more Paul. If what we mean by be like Paul is be faithful. Just take the opportunity God gave you and the capacity God gave you to do something with the opportunity God gave you. And give it away. And just be faithful in giving away what God gave you. then let's all be like Paul. But if we start to think I'm supposed to have the same kind of product as Paul and produce the same and be that way, like we're all supposed to be missionaries, we're all supposed to be pastors, we're all supposed to be speakers, we're all supposed to be seminary leaders. What? Baloney. That's baloney. I'm not supposed to be like Abraham. Abraham was supposed to be like Abraham. I'm supposed to be like Dave. And I get worn out just trying to be like Dave. It really is tiring when I try to be like Dave and somebody else. It's very weird then. But we do two things to ourselves. We decide what really has value in the kingdom in terms of somebody's performance. And I do it to me. I look at somebody and I go, oh, I want to be like him. And so I start emulating what it is that their five was. And I got a two and I'm frustrated all the time. It's a wonderful thing to realize you're not supposed to be Billy Graham. You're supposed to be Dave Johnson. It's one thing. You know, a good thing for me was when I realized I wasn't supposed to be my dad. I love my dad I admire my dad I'm not supposed to be my dad he was supposed to look in the bag of his opportunity and his capacity and flesh that out I'm not supposed to look in his bag get away from his bag I'm supposed to do my bag you know a few years ago I went to a conference that radically changed my life it was a it was a signs and wonders conference not only did it radically change my life it changed our church radically the leader of this particular conference was a man by the name of John Wimber. I had an experience that is still with me. It has affected me. It was a work of the Spirit. Most of you are aware of that. What some of you aren't aware of is for a significant period of time after that, I was so affected by the agent that God used in my life, and that was John Wimber, and so admiring of the gifts God gave him that I was trying like crazy to move in exactly the same gifts that he did. Now, I didn't go and try to gain 200 pounds or anything. Have you ever seen John? He's great. And I didn't start wearing Hawaiian shirts or anything like that, but it was close. It was close. And I kept asking God to give me these gifts, and all of a sudden, and I wasn't all of a sudden. I'm not that smart. It's never all of a sudden. It takes a long time with me. It's always a long time. After a very long, tiring, tiring period of time, something dawned on me, and that was this. John Wimber is supposed to look in his bag of opportunity and capacity and flesh that out, and Dave Johnson is supposed to look in his bag of opportunity and capacity and flesh that out. I'm supposed to do my bag. And when I discovered that, you got your pastor back. It was wonderful. Dan Adler. I was thinking about him today, or this week, as I kind of processed through this whole thing. I'm a Dan Adler fan. And this is, I just feel like we're so blessed by the music that God gives us through him. And I just kind of applied what I see in him to this here. And he didn't ever consciously do this as it relates to this parable. But basically what he's done is he's looked into the bag of his opportunity and the bag of his capacity. And what he saw in there was what? Music. And a capacity to write music. And he put it to work and for the kingdom. And in some sense, there's been a multiplication of that in terms of the profit for the kingdom. Okay? Now, I'm pretty confident that what I'm about to say, this picture I have, isn't going to happen this way. but it's the one I got, so it's weird. Anyway, what I see is in the final day when we're all there and Jesus is standing before us and Dan is right before me, you know, and Dan is going to get, well done, thou good and faithful servant, okay? And what's going to be there possibly in some sense is the music he wrote, okay, all the music there. And it was an expression of his life and it was just consistent with what was in his bag. I'm next. I get up there and what I'm pretty sure, it better not happen because I'm in big trouble if it happens. What I'm pretty sure is not going to happen is this, that he's going to, God's going to look at me and go, so where's your music? You know, Dan write all these nice slow songs. How come you didn't write any? If I get asked that question, I'm going to be really scared because my whole theology is right down the tubes. I was probably wrong about everything. But if I get asked that question, I'm ready. Here's my answer. The reason there aren't any songs here is because it wasn't in my bag. I looked. It wasn't there. Okay. Okay, get this. The diversity of talent is weight. It is weight. And those talents are different weights of opportunity, different weights of capacity. And the weight of opportunity God has given me and given you, and the weight of capacity to flesh those things out that God has given me and given you is a gift. It's a privilege. They are resources. They are also responsibilities. They have been entrusted to us, and that moves us to point number two, the reactions to these resources or responsibilities, and that starts in verse 16. There were two responses, reactions. One was the response of the faithful redeemed slave. The other was the response of the faithless, unredeemed slave. Let's talk about the faithful first, verse 16. Immediately, the one who had received the five weights of opportunity and capacity went and traded with them. Stop right there. The first word itself speaks to me about something of the faithfulness of this first slave. It says, immediately. What that communicates is this, that the instinctive response of the internally transformed, washed in the blood of the Lamb, person who has now got the resident Holy Spirit living within him, the instinctive response of that kind of person is to begin immediately to give away what God has given him. Now, I want to allow for the fact and affirm the fact that sometimes even truly redeemed people stumble. And when they stumble, they don't really function very well. They stumble in sin, and they need to be picked up and built up and got back in the race. Get back in the race. And sometimes truly redeemed people get wounded. And when they get wounded, they need healing. But I want to tell you something. One of the marks of a truly redeemed person is that what moves through his spirit and the desire of his heart, what moves through the desire of his heart, is an instinctive desire to give away what God gave him. It says immediately, that was his response. He went and traded. The word traded there is interesting. It literally means to engage in business. literally to put to work he put to work the opportunity god gave him and he put to work the capacity god gave him to understand it now let me let me just explain what that would look like in real life let me start with the simplest concept of the fleshing out of this principle as it relates first of all to salvation just the salvation to put to work the talent that i had the weight I've been given would look like this. It would simply mean when the opportunity to hear the gospel came and it was linked with my capacity to understand the gospel, I could have that and do nothing with it. When it is put to work is when by faith I believe it. I believe it. All of a sudden the opportunity I had to hear, the capacity I had to understand is energized by faith. That's what it means to put it to work. Understand? Let me tell you about a people who didn't do that. They did the opposite. And it comes in a form of a warning in Hebrews chapter 4 verse 1. It says, there still remains for some to enter into his rest. And they are a people who, although the word had been heard by them, they what? Had the opportunity to hear it. They had the weight of opportunity in their bag. They did not profit. And it is the same word in verse 16 as the one who gains five more talent. they did not gain. It wasn't fleshed out. Why? Because what they heard and what they had capacity to understand was not united by faith. As it relates to salvation or opportunity to hear, capacity to understand is linked with faith. Redemption is the result of that. When redemption happens and grace comes, what happens then is we come up grateful. And when redemption comes and we come up grateful, you know what we discover? We discover that, oh my, I got more in my bag now than I had just a moment ago. All of a sudden, I got spiritual eyes, I've got spiritual ears, and I've got capacity I didn't have before. and after redemption there begins to be this lifestyle, as it were, of consistently giving away what God has given me. And as God gives me more in my bag, I give it away. And as I give it away, God gives me more in my bag, and I... On and on and on. And the result of that kind of lifestyle is gaining five more, profiting five more. This is also where I need to stop here for a minute and do some talking, some teaching. they doubled what God originally gave them it was doubled what I need to teach is this that the doubling the product was generated by God God is the one who produced the five turning to ten now that is not dealt with here in this passage because that is not the point of this passage it is dealt with in other places like first Corinthians 3 6 where Paul says things like this I planted, Apollos watered, but what? God is the one who caused the increase, right? And it's even interesting, that little metaphor as it relates to our. Paul is saying is this. I looked into the bag of my opportunity, and I looked into the bag of my capacity. And you know what I saw there? I saw that I had the capacity to plant. I'm not a very good waterer. Sometimes I wish I was, but I'm a planter. So I planted, and I planted, and I planted. And Apollos was over here, and he looked into the bag of his opportunity and capacity, and he saw I'm a water and he looked over at Paul once in a while and said oh I wish I was a no he didn't he just did what he did and as they were faithful with what God had given to them who caused the increase God caused the increase the reason I think this is vital to say out loud and land on this very hard is because the primary issue in this text is not getting people to go out and produce a product or double what it is that God gave them like okay you know I've been sitting on my five for too long. And I tell you too, I think in the 16th verse, it's almost like I see a fork in the road where even in the teaching of this, we could go off in two different directions and we need to be very careful which one we go in. The primary issue in this text is calling on people to faithfully give away what it is that God has freely given them, to faithfully put to work the weight of opportunity and the weight of capacity God has given them. It's important. If the focus at this point becomes the physical product, the result of that, I can tell you, even in our body, if the focus became the physical product, there would be as if a spirit was released among us, and the spirit would be spiritual competition. There would be this competition going on. And what it would look like would be this. The most spiritual would be measured by what? Their product. What they what? Produce. You know what? The most frustrated would be the people who just don't have the capacity in their bag to produce what other people have the capacity to do. And all of a sudden, this incredible striving would be released. I was thinking about this this week, and I was just kind of playing around with it in my mind, and I kind of imagined things, you know. and I sat there I thought okay let's be a two I'm a two and I just got saved and here I am I'm sitting here being a two and and I just got led to the Lord let's say and the person who just led me to the Lord I'm looking at him and I'm going there are five in terms of the opportunity God's given them and the capacity they had to understand it there are five and and I just came to the Lord I don't know anything I don't have hardly any opportunity or capacity and this guy's way ahead of me but and I kind of feel bad because I'm behind by three you know he's a five I'm a two I'm behind by three and i'm thinking i'm thinking well i guess i should try to get five in in my bag but all of a sudden i hear this message that says no no no no no no no you're you're all off no what you need to do is just just open up the bag of your opportunity to hear and you've had this much opportunity so far and you've got this much capacity so just just be faithful with the bag you got okay it's okay and all of a sudden with freedom you know you're a new christian you go boy that's kind of a relief you know i was all of a sudden to start to strive i'm just gonna look at what i got and what i know and i'm gonna faithfully give this away and so you're doing it and you're just kind looking down and you're keeping your eyes on christ and you're taking one step at a time and and all of a sudden in the process of your growing as a believer you do something that we all do from time to time and that is you look up and you go oh well looky there i'm a four it took a couple years but i didn't even know it but all i was doing was faithfully giving away what god gave me and without even knowing it there was a there was a profit there was a growth happening and here I am a four. Now it would be wonderful if we'd stop there, just stop there and go, thank you Lord, I needed that encouragement and he gives you that from time to time. It's good to know you turn from a two to a four. It's okay. God, there's product here. There's an effect in the kingdom and that's what I want to do. And if we would just after that look back down and keep doing what we're doing, keep looking in the bag and giving away what we got, it'd be wonderful. But what we do is all of a sudden a thought dawns on us, at least on me. I go, you know what I'm only one behind now you know I gotta go find that guy and just kind of walk by him maybe or something and I find the guy who was the five oh but you know what it's real discouraging because he was doing the same cotton picking thing I was doing for two years so now he's a ten so now it's really frustrating because now instead of just being one behind I'm not even three behind I'm six behind. And I grew. Then my mind brightens up a little bit and I figured out a way that I could catch up. And that would be if he could be in faith. It's not a race. It's not a race. We're not in competition. The good news from this parable, if it's appropriately applied, I believe is this. God has not called you to be productive. He has called you to be faithful with the opportunity he has given you, with the capacity to flesh out the opportunity he has given you. He has called you to be faithful. But there was a hard reality that comes in right behind that. If you are faithful, know this for sure, there will be a product. Some of you will chafe because you want more product. Get away from that. God has not called you to be productive. He has called you to be faithful with the bag of opportunity and capacity he's given you. But if you are, there will be a product. There will be. And when there is no product, you've got to go back the other way, not try harder to produce. You've got to go back the other way. Is there faith? Is there reality? Do I got oil in the lamp or not? I think this is exactly what James is saying in James 2 when he says faith without a product or faith that is not put to work isn't faith at all. Give me a break. That's not, whatever it is that you're calling faith isn't faith. Because genuine faith issues in life. You're called to be faithful. That's affirmed, by the way, in verse 21 and 23 when we see what is rewarded. Well done, thou good and productive. No, no, no. Well done, thou good and faithful servant. The slave with two who came back with two more gets the same reward as the slave who started with five and now has 10 in the world. Award they get in verse 21. It's a verbal commendation. Well done, thou good and faithful slave. By the way, just a little note here. I think that one of the ways you can even mark the redeemed and even mark your own heart is that in the heart of genuinely redeemed people who see themselves as slaves of God, and by the way, a genuinely redeemed person doesn't mind that kind of phraseology. Some people, you're a slave of God. I'm a slave of nobody. Well, then fine. then you may not be redeemed. Because genuine people who belong to God say, you've got that right. I am your slave. I am your betrothed. I belong to you. And there's nothing in my life that would give me more joy than the anticipation and hope of realizing that one day, Jesus, my Redeemer, is going to look in my eyes and say, well done, thou good and faithful slave. Verbal commendation. The second thing is this. You were faithful in a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. This is in the end. And what he's saying here is, forever you have the right to rule and reign with me. Enter now into the joy of your master. Enter into the joy of the Lord. What is that? Again, I don't have time to go into all the nuances of this, but I think part of this is those who have been faithful and given away what God gave them will have in heaven a capacity to simply enjoy the kingdom of God. It will be an incredible capacity to actually experience the very joy that God experiences, and to feel his pleasure. We talk a lot about, well, not a lot, but I mean the phrase, the concept is alive in us of heroes of the faith. We are heroes of the faith. And generally when we think of a hero of the faith or try to come up with a name or someone, we would generally use the scale, if you will, of who produced the most, you know. When I was growing up, and again, I would borrow simply from my past, who were the heroes of the faith, I keep thinking of Billy Graham. I mean, I haven't heard Billy Graham speak for years. I have a feeling he's preaching the same message that he did when I was a kid, but it was like Billy Graham was the hero of the faith. Or a great hero. Here's what I think about that. You know, the fact is, I think Billy Graham is a hero. But, if he is a hero, and using that goofy term, if he is a hero, it's not because he preaches sermons. It's not because he's on TV. If he's a hero, it's not even because people come to Christ after he talks. If he's a hero of the faith, and if there's anything in him that I want to emulate, it's that he simply one day or consistently through his life looked into the bag of the opportunity God gave him, and then he looked at the capacity that God gave him, and after he did both of those things, he took the opportunity and capacity God gave him, and he decided to spend the rest of his life giving it away, and giving it away, and giving it away and given it away and God produced what he produced. And when I think like that, all of a sudden what dawns on me is we got lots of heroes. There are a lot of heroes, but all of a sudden the measurement is totally different. It's not about looking for a product, it's looking for a faithful heart, someone who has taken what God's given him and given it away for free. The first person I thought of when this dynamic dawned on me was somebody who impacted my life back when I was in college it was the janitor at Bethel College of all people his name was Keith Teacock I don't think if he I don't even know if he knows me I think he does doesn't matter when I grabbed my graduating class asked Keith to speak at our commencement now most goodness is probably speaks about the group I graduated with but but most people you know they asked the president of the United States or at least try to get him or you know some senator we asked our janitor to do it. And the reason was is because he impacted that class in such a way that consistently what he seemed to emulate to us was what it meant to be a slave of God, what it meant to be a servant of the king in a simple but a profound way. I think he's a hero. Why? Because so many people have been saved from his, he's on TV. No, nothing to do with that. Keith is a hero if there is such a concept as that. There's a hero aspect to this because he looked into the bag of his opportunity, looked into the bag of his capacity, and he said, I am a slave of the king, and what God has given me, I'm going to give away. And he is the one who, along with the Billy Graham types of the world, are one day going to hear, one day, well done, thou good, and what? Productive. No, faithful servants. but there was another slave there was another slave in this dynamic and that was the faithless slave who took the weight of opportunity that he had and the weight of capacity that he had and he stuck it in the ground verse 18 he received the one talent went away dug in the ground and hid his master's money and I saw that Jesus was angry about that. When I first read that, I thought, you know, Jesus feels a little unreasonable to me here. I mean, it's not like he took this talent, this weight of piece of gold, whatever it was, and he didn't lose it. I mean, he was responsible. He didn't squander it. He didn't toss it away. In fact, he gave it back. I mean, what's he complaining about? Well, verse 24 reveals something of his character to me and made it clear why this burying was so offensive to God, to the master. Verse 24, and one also who received the talent came up to him and said, master, I knew that you were a hard man. The Greek word there is scleros. We get sclerosis, arterial sclerosis. I knew that you were all jammed up. I knew that you were an unbending reed and you just weren't going to get, you're a tyrant. I knew that about you. And by the way, that just by itself indicates to me that he does not know the master I serve. There is no way that I can look at Jesus hanging on a cross for those who he didn't even know yet and didn't even love him yet and come up with the picture of a tyrant he doesn't know my master but he says the reason i think you're a tyrant is because you're reaping where you didn't sow and you're gathering where you scattered no seed what does that mean sounds like a riddle well i think what's going on here is that this one who buried the one is maybe even just reflecting on what he just saw, the reward going to those who gave everything God had given to them, to the Lord. And he's looking at them and he's saying, you know, these guys that you just rewarded, they took all the resources you gave them, and they took all the energy of their life, and they took the opportunity that they had in their bag, and they took the weight of capacity that you put in their bag, and they put it to work for you. And when there was a yield from their life of giving away what you gave them, they gave it to you. And I got a problem with that. You know what the problem is? That you didn't sow. They're the ones who did the work. They're the ones who did the scattering. They're the ones who did the sowing. Why should you get the credit? Why should you get the profit? The fruit, the glory, the dividend, it's not yours, it's theirs. Those guys are chumps for one thing, for living as if everything I do is directed toward the king and the kingdom. What chumps? And you are an unbending tyrant. I mean, it's not reasonable to expect that people should just live for you. Give you the glory, live for you, serve you, get real. This God stuff is fine. Gospel, kingdom, I like this. You know, I'm okay with Jesus. Doobie Brothers wrote a song a while ago, Jesus is just all right with me. Well, yummy, good for you. He's just all right with the Doobie Brothers. You know, I respect this Jesus stuff. In fact, I'll protect it. I'll take this piece of gold, I'll put it in the ground there and make sure nobody tramples on it. But my life, take that thing and act as if my whole life is generated towards giving that away. Give me a break. I'm going to live my life myself. I'll put my religion in a hole over here. You stay there. That's real nice. All this God, Jesus stuff. I'll go to church on Sunday. But every other day of the week, I'm doing my thing, my way, and every piece of yield I get is for me. And God will say, to that worthless slave you are cast in outer darkness and in that place there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth you don't know me and i don't know you you are none of mine we need to hear loud and clear that the mark of a redeemed heart the mark of a genuine slave is this that the greatest joy of a genuine slave is a servant king nothing pleases it more again sometimes we stumble sometimes we get wounded sometimes we come up bleeding. Sometimes we wonder if he wants us to serve him because we feel so unworthy. That's a whole other issue. But the genuine heart of a truly redeemed heart is that there is no greater joy on earth than serving the king. Just the thought that I could give my life and my heart and my energy to the king. It's incredible. And if that sounds sappy to you and stupid to you, then you're none of is. Democrips' redeemed heart is this, that their greatest hope is that one day from the lips of one who gave his life for them, they could possibly hear these words, well done, thou good and faithful servant. You goofball, you know you are a goofball, but man, you took the opportunity I gave you and the capacity as limited as it was, and you just gave it away, and you gave it away, and you gave it away. You're faithful. Come in and rule with me forever. True servants, genuine slaves live like that gladly. And if that's not in your heart, then you need to examine whether you're one of his at all. That's the last thing is the reckoning. Just to tie this up, verse 19. After a long time, the master of the slaves came and settled his accounts and sorted it all out is what he did. because in the assembly, see, at the wedding, at this community of all these slaves, everybody kind of looks like they're, you can't tell. I don't know all my neighbors here, you know, and whether we're really living this way or not or love God or the oil is really there. But he's going to sort it out, and the faithful ones will rule with him forever and enter into the joy of the master, and the faithless will be cast in outer darkness. The fact is this, that in the kingdom, the sphere of the kingdom, that in the assembly of those who would attach themselves in some way with Jesus, in the community of the apparent servants of the king, there are those who have indeed been made alive by the oil. The life of God is in them, and in ways that are consistent with the life that is in them, they are giving away what God gave them. They're serving, how we say it around here, is they're serving out of fullness. What God gave them, they just give away. There are, however, also in the same community of people who are all apparent servants, those who are not alive, they are not prepared, the genuine oil of the life of God is not there, but they are outwardly doing stuff, they're outwardly serving and doing their little wedding thing, and they would be captured in the parable of the five virgins, five who had oil, five who did not, everybody looked like they were there waiting for the groom. And then there's another kind of person in this whole community, this kingdom sphere, and that's the one who is not prepared at all. And while he or she likes to keep his little religious peace there, you know, kind of there, protected and respected, there is absolutely no view in their spirit and there is no hint in their living of living for the kingdom and living for the king. And when the master returns, all of those distinctions will be sorted out. All of those different hearts will be separated, made clear, and revealed. Therefore, verse 13, be on the alert, for you do not know the hour when he comes. What strikes me as I close about this word is this. Whether you realize it or not, just in the hearing of this word, what you have had added to your bag is another weight of opportunity another talent another piece of weight of opportunity of the gospel has been added to your bag and the word from the spirit of God today from me from those of us who are redeemed to any of you who have buried this thing is this when you get this talent or this weight added to everything else you've got in terms of what you know about how to come to Jesus by faith through grace don't bury it. Today if you hear his voice don't harden your heart. Put what you hear and what you're able to understand to work by faith. I want you to stand as we close. Like last week we discussed at length how to close and we thought of songs and every song we came up with seemed to diffuse and say in a way that wasn't really what we were saying. things. So it is in closing, I want to extend an invitation to those of you who the Spirit of God is speaking to in some way, if you need ministry of some sort. Maybe you're in a place right now where you can say by the illumination of the Spirit that I'm somebody who's had the opportunity and I even have the capacity to understand this, but I really have buried it in a hole and the time has come that I want to dig that up and by faith bring it to life. I want you to know that the ministry team people will be waiting for you in this area here. And in kind of a metaphor, in prayer with you, they'll take the shovel of the Spirit and help you dig it up and bring it to life by the work of the Spirit. I want you to know that the invitation is extended for you to come and receive ministry. And I want to pray that those who the Spirit of God would single out for that particular ministry would have the boldness to come and then will be dismissed. Jesus, again, I'm aware we can't talk anybody into the kingdom. We can't yell them in. We can't laugh them in. We can't trick them in. We can't convince them. We can bring the truth as clearly as we know how, consistent with the capacity we've got to do it. But, Father, every person who's ever been redeemed, it was a work of the Spirit, ultimately. It was a supernatural moving of your Spirit on a man or woman's heart. And in Jesus' name, we, redeemed, call upon you to bring that miracle to this place. And God, maybe there are some here who haven't heard a word I said. They just cannot wait until I'm done. And that's okay, because you're so powerful and big that you could overwrite all of that and just pierce through their heart and convince them and make them aware that they desperately need a redeemer. They desperately need something other than a piece of gold stuck in a ground called religion. They need a relationship with the living God through Christ, by grace, through faith. I pray that those that you are singling out for that gift this morning would have the boldness to come and receive it. I even pray for the ministry team people, that you would anoint them with ministry gifts, capacities, to usher people into your kingdom. Father, we would invite even believers who, even though they know they're redeemed, in ways that they haven't understood, have needed to move into the freedom of realizing They only need to deal with the bag you've given them of opportunity and capacity and quit trying to be like other people and just be who they are for the glory of God. Liberate us, Jesus. Redeem us, Jesus. In your name. Amen. Amen.
