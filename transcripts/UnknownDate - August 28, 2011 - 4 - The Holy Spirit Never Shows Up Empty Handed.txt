Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. And so we pray, Holy Spirit, come. with your rain that, in a metaphor, brings life. To dry and barren places. Come, Holy Spirit, with your wine, which brings joy. Come with your breath. Holy Spirit, come with all of your gifts. We pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Before we get to the Word, I'm going to kind of loop back to Al's announcements, and I'm going to avoid the humor or attempts at it. I was thinking, Woody Allen used to say that humor, there are people who say funny things, and then there's people who say things funny, and then there's people who say stupid things, and they're funny, and that's our dearly beloved Al. Anyway, anyway, I love it. But this thing about the kids, and ministering to the kids, and we really have a need and all that, but as I was sitting here, I was thinking, I'm always thinking of inviting people to minister to the kids, but I want you to dial into the fact that the ministry we have to our kids is also a profound ministry to their parents. We have moms and dads coming in here. You have no idea. Or maybe some of you have an idea because you're the mom and the dad. Some single parents, single moms, single dads, dropping off your kids. And that hour and a half where somebody else has my, to take a breath. I'm a grandpa. No, my wife is a grandma. It works that way. But we take the kids. I love the kids. I love the grandkids. I just can't wait to be with them. And sometimes we take them because we love them. Minister to them. But sometimes it's a minister to mom and dad. My son and our daughter-in-law are daughter-in-law. Dial into that. I'm going to call out the spirit of grandpa and grandma. I'm serious in our church. To go and minister to our kids for their parents' sake. And even some of you younger people. I'm a babysitter. No, no, no. It's not just a babysitter. You're ministering to those kids. and you're ministering to those parents. And this is really important. So some of you maybe have not even thought of this. Think of it. And there. Yeah, okay. Last week, if you were here, I'm sure you would recall that for reasons I explained to you last week, including how this topic is connected to and flows from our study in the book of Colossians, we began to talk about the Holy Spirit, about the filling of the Spirit, first of all, because Ephesians 5 talks about the filling of the Holy Spirit, and Ephesians 5, as I explained last week, is a parallel to the text we're actually in, Colossians 3, verse 16. But we also talked about the baptism of the Spirit and the power of the Holy Spirit to, among other things, give life, to literally breathe life into dead and dying places, into dead and dying people. So speak to those bones, says God to the prophet Ezekiel in Ezekiel 37, because God had just given to the prophet a vision of his people. And it's a vision that I think might have taken his breath away. It's something that he might not have known about the people because the people were all doing kind of the traditional things relative to religious activity. So it looked like things were fine, but God gave this prophet a vision. And what he did was bring him to a valley, and he showed him a vision of a valley full of bones, which speaks to death. And they were very dry, which means that these bones or these people spiritually were not only dead, but they'd been dead for a very long time, which speaks to a kind of hopelessness. And from that place of hopelessness that gives birth to desperation, there comes this question. Can these bones live? In other words, is there any hope for these people? Or for my marriage? For my heart or for this person who I love? for the church or for our church, can these bones live? It's a question that you've probably asked, maybe not with those words, but the intent of it, the spirit of it is the same. And it's a question to which the Spirit of the Lord in Ezekiel 37, 4 answered by saying, prophesy over them, speak to those bones and tell them that I, the Spirit, will cause breath to come into them. So there is hope and they will come to life. And I will put sinews on them and make flesh to grow back on them and cover them with skin. And I will put my spirits in them, my breath in them, and they will come to life. Which is at least part of why we pray what we pray. When we pray this prayer around here and we pray it a lot, Holy Spirit, come. Come and be who you are among us and do what you do among us because when the Holy Spirit does that, He just does what he does and is who he is. When he shows up in some way, in some manifested way, he always brings with him, among other things, life. Life. It's just who he is. He is the breath of God. It's just what the Holy Spirit does. Indeed, as I was thinking about this a little bit more this last week, I started liking this picture of the Holy Spirit being kind of like that person who whenever or wherever they show up at the party, they never show up empty-handed. You know anybody like that? They just always bring something. They always bring something with them. And when the Holy Spirit comes, never showing up empty-handed, the Holy Spirit most often brings life. It's life, as it were, of the party. Indeed, sometimes it's how you can tell the Holy Spirit was there. Because when the presence of the Spirit is being made manifest, when the wind of God is blowing and the wine of God is flowing, dead things come to life. It's just what happens. Dead people come to life. Barren places are restored and hope is rekindled. Indeed, it's how you can tell that the Holy Spirit was there. So you say the sermon was great and the music was awesome and the lights were flashing and the banners were waving. It was quite a production. Very cool. And it's great to do all that stuff. But there's a question that arises out of that. Did anyone or anything come to life? Because, see, that's how you can tell that the Holy Spirit was there. Because the Holy Spirit doesn't show up empty-handed. He comes with his life and with a strong desire to give life to anyone who wants it. The Holy Spirit comes with his breath and he comes with his gifts. he comes bearing gifts they're called the gifts of the spirit that's what i want to talk about this morning the gifts of the spirit and according to places like romans 12 and first corinthians 12 there's a variety of these gifts which speaks to among other things the generosity of god because the holy spirit doesn't show up empty-handed and he isn't stingy either indeed among the gifts he gives are gifts like these gifts of healing and deliverance and quite frankly those are gifts that some of you have experienced even in the context sometimes of what we do in this room where God has brought healing to your heart or to your soul maybe even to your body and deliverance from bondages even as you sit here sometimes in the context of worship and tears are streaming down your face gifts there's a gift coming to you of life gifts of prophecy and knowledge, gifts of wisdom and discernment, even the affecting of miracles, it says in 1 Corinthians 12, verse 10, which I know sounds kind of out there, but the literal translation of that phrase, the affecting of miracles, simply means the operation of power, because when the Holy Spirit shows up at the party, the Holy Spirit never shows up empty-handed, comes with His life, comes with his breath, and he comes with his gift. It's how you can tell that the Holy Spirit was there. Now, well, there actually are a number of reasons I wanted to talk about this topic today, because for one thing, it kind of flowed well from last week, I thought. But one of the reasons has to do with some things we talked about at our annual meeting this last Wednesday night. Because if you were there, I'm sure you recall that we shared with you what we believe God is calling us into as a church in this next season of our church's life with God. It was an amazing meeting. I don't often talk about annual meetings on a Sunday because this was an amazing meeting. There were over 400 people there, which is far beyond any number we've ever had before. Interest was high. Energy was good. There was a sense of rightness about what we're doing and a sense of engagement. And it was more than a business meeting. There really was a sense of God's presence and a sense of yes in our spirits to the way God is leading us. But among the things we talked about and shared with you were the things that over the course of this last year as leadership, we have been trying to identify. And among the things has to do with this embedded life. What is the embedded life of God's spirit in our church? In other words, what is the spiritual DNA of Church of the Open Door? Because that's what we have to remember and embrace, maybe re-embrace, because that's what we have to pass on to the next generation. Because that's the inheritance. And it all kind of boiled down to this. that we are a people, and this is now the expression of our mission, vision, and values. And Steve went through this, and they were all up on the screen on Wednesday night, that we are a people, first of all, rooted in the story of God. It's part of our DNA. It's part of our mission, vision, and values. Number one, we're a people of the book. Number two, we're a people of the kingdom. We're a people of grace. We're a people who are designed by God to call out the life of God from other people. And we are a people of the Spirit. entirely dependent on the gifts of the Spirit to do what he's called us to do and to be what he's called us to be. In fact, it's right after where people of the Spirit are completely dependent on the gifts that the Spirit gives to do what we could never do on our own, to bring life where there is death. Because when the Holy Spirit shows up, he never shows up empty-handed. He brings with him life. He brings his breath. He brings his gifts. Now, when it comes to the gifts of the Holy Spirit, the truth is, I mean, I don't know your background, but for a lot of people, there's a lot of fuzziness around the gifts of the Spirit, sometimes even fear and anxiety. Maybe you've been exposed to some expressions of the gifts of the Spirit that felt weird to you and out of control to you and maybe real coercive and manipulative and somebody's, this isn't really God's, people are just acting weird. And what it does to some people, and I'm one of them in terms of my own journey, is you just kind of back away. We can do just fine without that stuff, and you can do fine without the counterfeits of the gifts of the Spirit, because there are counterfeits of these gifts. There are false expressions of the spiritual gifts of the Spirit, but sometimes when they get messy at all, we kind of back away, put them on the shelf, kind of, I don't need to go there. Problem is, the Apostle Paul in places like 1 Corinthians 14, maybe he's knowing this, because he says things like this. 1 Corinthians 14, verse 1. Pursue love. I mean, that really is the priority. And we talk about that a lot around here. Love wins. It's all about, well, that's where we started. Keep it simple. It's all about love. 1 Corinthians 13 is all about, it's the love chapter. So in 1 Corinthians 14, he says, yes, pursue love. Priority one. But earnestly desire spiritual gifts as well, because that's what empowers you to do what God's called you to do and be who God's called you to be. 1 Corinthians 12, 1, Paul says, kind of same spirit. Now concerning spiritual gifts, I don't want you to be unaware of them. And a lot of us are unaware. That word unaware is interesting. In the Greek, it's the word, the Greek word agnosis. We get the word agnostic. Think of that. I don't want you to be an agnostic when it comes to the gifts of the spirit. An atheist is someone who doesn't believe. An agnostic is someone who doesn't know. I don't know. I'm just kind of, And I'm telling you, says Paul, given the mission to which we have been called, as a church in Colossae, as a church in Maple Grove, we can't afford to be agnostic. We can't afford to be not knowing, to be not accessing these things, not unwrapping these gifts and putting them into play. The word gift relative to gifts of the Spirit is an interesting one, and I think helpful in our understanding, kind of broadening your mind a little bit, making it a little bit more accessible, is the Greek word charis. We get the word charisma. And people who move freely in the gifts are called charismatics, or charismatics, which translated further means really weird. But all that word really means, charis, all it really means is grace. Oh, I can put my guard down a little bit now. All it really means is grace, because all the gifts God ever gives are rooted in his grace. Amazing grace. How sweet to sound to save a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found. Was blind, but now I see. But what I want you to see and us to see this morning is that the amazing grace of God does more than save a wretch like me. It does more than forgive us and heal us and redeem us. Part of the grace package, if you will, is also to enable us and empower us to do what he's called us to do and to become who he's called us to become in the world. And all of that is why as a church, our church, we might actually dare to hope and believe that God actually could use people like you and people like me at a time like this in a world like ours with circumstances like these to do the things that Jesus did and to say the things that Jesus said to literally be his body in the world. But all of that is a gift. It's all grace. And all of that is why we can't afford to be agnostic, not knowing about these things. Ephesians 4, verse 7 actually says it this way. Look at it on the screen. Ephesians 4, verse 7. But to each one of us, grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift. What is Christ's gift? Well, Christ's gift, kind of see it as a great big package that has all sorts of stuff in it. Because Christ's gift is inclusive of everything that he accomplished in his incarnation, his crucifixion, and his resurrection. So it includes forgiveness and redemption and salvation. But it also includes the impartation of the Holy Spirit. And the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. And the gifts of the Holy Spirit that are distributed by the Spirit to each individual. just as he wills, and they're given for this purpose, Ephesians 4, verse 12. Look at that on the screen. Here's why the gifts are given, the empowerments, for the equipping of the saints, for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ, so that we can do what he's called us to do, and be who he's called us to be, the body of Christ in the world. This is not a new concept to many of you, but dial into it again. Think about it this way. 2,000 years ago, The manifestation of God in the world was Jesus. Physically, one person. John 1, 14, the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, we could see it. Today, the manifestation of God in the world is His church, His body. And by church, I am not necessarily talking about the organized church, though you can sometimes find the body in there somewhere. And I'm certainly not talking about a building that we sometimes call church. I'm talking about ordinary men And ordinary women In whom the life of God By his spirit nigh resides That is the body of Christ And as that body Made up of ordinary people Like you and me Learn to reverence And receive and put into use All the gifts of God's grace That are part of the measure Of Christ's gift That body, wherever it exists Begins to be built up and by that building up has made strong enough to do what he's called us to do and to become who he's called us to become. So now in the time I have left, I just want to reduce this whole thing down to two things for you. Two things that I think will be helpful to us, not just in coming to understand the gifts of the Spirit, but to stir in us this sense of desire for them, maybe even a sense of reverence for them. The first thing is this. I want you to know that the gifts of the Spirit began with a promise. Second of all, I want you to know that the gifts of the Spirit were won at the cross, which stirs in me, among other things, a sense of reverence. Literally, when I get the picture, and I'll give it to you in a bit, it takes my breath away. Let's look first at the promise. I shared this with you before, and this was kind of a paradigm change for me when this first occurred to me. Matthew 16, verse 18, which is not a passage we often connect with the gifts. It's where Jesus is speaking to Peter, and he's making this declaration to Peter. Peter, I'm going to make you a promise. I will build my church. and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. First thing I want you to note about that statement is that the church in this picture is not passive because sometimes we get this picture that the gates of hell will not prevail against the church, meaning that the gates of hell, in a metaphor, there aren't actually any gates, but it's just this picture, are kind of moving on the church and Jesus promises that as Satan moves on the church or the gates of hell, you know, the church will be protected and not fall over. The picture is not, however, that. It's not a picture of a church being built into an impenetrable fortress where we huddle and hide from in the middle of a little circle holding each other's hand singing kumbaya with the promise being that as the gates come at us, we can huddle and hide here and it will never get like the big bad wolf. He can huff and he can pop, but he won't blow the house down. It's not the promise. It's bigger than that. In fact, the picture is this, of the church, the body of Christ. Ordinary men and women, just like you and just like me, not only indwelt by the Spirit, because the Spirit is richly dwelling among us, but full of the Spirit, under the influence of the Spirit, baptized into and immersed in the Spirit, clothed with power from the Spirit, moving in and utilizing all the gifts of the Spirit. The picture is people like that saying to God, Under the influence of the Spirit, we will move to the darkest of places. In our marriages, in our families, in our own interior lives, those dark places that we're scared to go, we will move into the darkest of places in our church that nobody wants to talk about and just kind of leave that alone. We will move into the darkest places. They're in a metaphor. Those are the gates of hell, you guys. Those are the places where the enemy has whatever he has his way. We will move there, says his church. Storming the gates of hell. And the promise of Matthew 16, verse 18, relative to that, is that the gates of hell will not prevail against that kind of church. Let me spin it a different way as it relates to the gifts of the Spirit. And this is kind of my paraphrase of Matthew 16, verse 18, relative to the gifts. Jesus says, I will build my church. Promise. I will build my church. And what I mean by that, among other things, is this. I will get to my people what they need, when they need it, in order to storm the gates of hell, in order to go into the darkest, scariest places of your own personal life, in your family, in our church, in the community. And I will get to you what you need, when you need it, in order to do that. And what you need to go to the darkest places, what might that be? Maybe something beyond yourself. like supernatural enablements from the Holy Spirit of God. You might need some gifts at that point, like gifts of wisdom and discernment. What's really going on here in our family? Even the discernment of spirits, because it's not always just something human that's going on. There's something spiritual that's going on in our church or in our family or in this community. We need gifts to see those things, and gifts of faith and healing and prophecy and deliverance, and the list goes on, which, by the way, if I'm right, about that little thing I gave you, actually reveals something about sometimes how these gifts of the Spirit are activated. Now, this is not the only way they're activated, but sometimes this is how the Holy Spirit activates his gifts. Here's how. When we attempt to do something that would actually require a supernatural enablement, something that would require something beyond my own human wisdom or knowledge. I need something that, God, you would reveal to me that really is a gift from you. As we attempt to do something that would bring us into the darkest and desperate places, to dead and demonically controlled places, and in those places dare to pray, maybe with stammering tongue and a shaking chin. Holy Spirit, come. We're in way over our heads. Come with gifts that we can't stir up by ourselves. Come with gifts of faith, because I've lost my faith. Come with gifts of knowledge, because I just don't know. Come with gifts of wisdom and power and healing and deliverance. And those gifts often are activated in an environment like that. So the gifts of the Spirit begin with a promise. second there one at the cross. I love this. Ephesians 4, 7 through 10 says this. I read the verse 7 already, and now you kind of have the context of it. But to each one of you, grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift. And in Christ's gift, there's lots of things. Therefore, it says, when he ascended on high, he led captive a host of captives, and he gave gifts to men. That's a quote from Psalm 68. I'm coming back to that. Now, this expression, he ascended, what does it mean? Except that he also descended, into the lower parts of the earth. And he who descended is himself the one who ascended far above all the heavens that he might fill all in all. Now, if you've been in an open door for a while, you know that that's a passage. It's like it's one of my favorite passages at Easter. And we kind of pull it out every couple years and just kind of just let this thing fly. Because what it's a picture of is that in Jesus' physical death, Jesus descended, as the text says, into the lower parts of the earth where he tasted death for every man with the sin of the world on him. he went to hell as it were and while he was there first Peter 3 19 says this that he made a proclamation this is weird he went to hell sin of the world on him so all the all the punishment of hell was being meted out on him but at one point he stood up and made this proclamation to the demons of hell as it were and the proclamation was this in essence my paraphrase obviously I wasn't there so I don't know but I think it was this Satan and all the demons of hell what you meant for evil, God meant for good. What you suppose was your greatest victory is in fact your ultimate defeat. I win, you lose, bye-bye, and he blew open the gates of hell, because he who descended also ascended. And when he ascended, now we're back to verse 8, it says he led captive a host of captives. Now this led captive a host of captives is a part of that verse. I don't talk about it Easter, and haven't unpacked for many, many years, but this brings us back, led captive a host of captives, to this whole thing on the gifts of the Spirit. Let me explain. Because this verse, Ephesians 4 verse 8, is actually, as I said a moment ago, a quote from Psalm 68. You can look at it up on the screen. When he ascended, he led captive host of captives, and he gave gifts to man. Now, what this actually is, and dial into this when you think of this verse, it's a picture of something that was real in biblical times, of an ancient king having gone to battle. He wins the victory of that particular battle, and then he returns, having a big parade as they enter into the city, and he's bringing with him two things. He is leading captive a host of captives. Who are they? Well, they are soldiers of the defeated army that they didn't kill, but they bring them with them to parade them through the streets, as if to say, and he disarms them. All of their weapons are gone. All of their shields are gone. In fact, there's kind of a, the history talks about the fact that sometimes they would dress these captive soldiers, take all their armor off and dress them in silly clothes and things like that and make them look silly as if to communicate to the people, why were you ever afraid of them? They've been disarmed. And they're bringing them through the streets kind of to humiliate them, but also to communicate this thing that you don't need to be afraid of them anymore. And also they would bring gifts. The conquering king would parade these toothless soldiers, but also they would give gifts to men. The king would give gifts to men, and the gifts that they would share with the people of the city were the spoils of war. The spoils of war was kind of what you won in the war. You go in, you captivate the city, you take all the gold, you take all the stuff, all the bounty, you take all the weapons that the soldiers had, and you don't just keep them. Now, some kings do, but a lot of the kings, they would go, people, people, I got some gifts we won, so here's some gifts. Enjoy the bounty. Incredible. picture. It's called the captain's train. And what's really kind of wild is that Paul was really into this imagery of the captain's train, leading host, leading captives, leading captive a host of captives, and giving gifts to men, and disarming principalities and powers. In fact, in Colossians 2, verse 15, the apostle Paul, quite matter-of-factly, and this is a verse that Steve and I dealt with, but I don't think we drew this out of it when we came to it. Colossians 2.15, he matter-of-factly says this in the context of describing what Jesus accomplished through his death and resurrection. It says this, that he literally, look at it on the screen, stripped the principalities and powers of their power. He disarmed the rulers and authorities, making public display of them, having triumphed over them. What does that sound like? It sounds exactly like the captain's train, stripping them of their weapons, making public display of them? What were you afraid of? Anyway, they're toothless. These principalities and powers, so get your hopes up. But then he gives gifts to men and the gifts. And in the old days, with the captains coming back, the gifts were the bounty. The gifts were what they won in the battle, the gold and the silver and the weapons that had been dropped by the enemy, picked up, and here, take this, here, take this, here, take this, because this is going to help us keep going and keep doing what God's called us to do and be what God's called us to be. I don't know if that picture stirs in you anything, but it does me, and this thing of the weapons is significant, too, because it just keeps expanding. See, these principalities who, by Jesus, have been disarmed, have real power. They have real power, even today, to deceive and to blind, even redeemed people to blind us, to confuse and oppress us, to steal, kill, and destroy, because that's what Satan and his army, if you will, does. In fact, 2 Thessalonians 2, verse 9, says they have real power to actually do miracles. So, sometimes very impressive. whoa, must be God. Not necessarily. Perform false signs and wonders. 2 Corinthians 11, 14 says, these principalities and powers literally have the ability at times to appear as angels of light. Look like truth. Look good and sound right. So that some of us even kind of get led to, whoa, yeah, that's kind of good. Not necessarily, which means sometimes to know whether it's good or not. You might need a gift. Gift. gift you might need a gift like a gift of discernment that would know a spirit from God and a spirit that's not and that's not just about being smart these are gifts that come from God's spirit and gifts of wisdom and discernment connect all that now to Ephesians 4 verse 8 Colossians 2 verse 15 because when Jesus threw his victory on the cross disarmed stripped of their weapons, the rulers and authorities. He didn't just let the weapons fall to the ground. You can kind of see that. They just fall to the ground and everybody walks away. That's not what happens in this analogy. Again, it's all a metaphor. No. These weapons of the enemy that they've been stripped of are also part of the spoils of war. And the king, Jesus, distributes them now to his people. For when he had disarmed the rulers and authorities, He's making public display of them. He led captive a host of captives. And then he took those weapons that had been used by the enemy, actually, 10 minutes ago against the people of God. And he gives them to the people of God. Again, this is just a fascinating metaphor and analogy. And he gives them to them as a gift. So that now whatever supernatural power Satan has to deceive, God's people now have to declare and reveal the truth. Whatever supernatural power Satan has to steal, kill, and destroy, the people of God now have to restore, resurrect, and rebuild in whatever power Satan has or had to blind, oppress, and make captive as the people of God now have to heal, to give sight, and to set free. They're called the gifts of the Spirit. They're the spoils of war. They were won at the cross. They were paid for by the blood of the Lamb. Amen. Amen. But whatever else that does to you, I would want it to make you a lot more curious about that. Like maybe we can't afford to be unaware of something this essential to what Jesus did even in his work. It's part of Christ's gift to the church. Don't need that. Yes, you do. Why do we need it? Well, part of why I think you already know, but part of why we need these gifts and to become more aware of them and learn how to access them and even notice them because some of you move from these gifts and you don't even know it. They're there already. so you need to help you connect the dots here's why we can't be unaware of these things because we're not just trying to build a good organization here and pack all the seats with people who are going like yeah hooray hooray well there's something much bigger going on here so you see what we're really involved in is something that has nothing to do with flesh and blood we wrestle not against flesh and blood ephesians 6 verse 12 but against principalities and powers that's that's the ministry, guys. Against world forces of this darkness, we wrestle, whether you see them or not, or we are wrestling against spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places, which I know sounds very weird. But if that's true, what's our plan? Well, be creative, okay? Be contemporary, Okay, not a bad idea. Don't be stupid. Be funny. Okay, be really, really smart. Okay. And that might build us a really big organization, which is good to have, but you know what? There's more involved in this. God's plan, plain and simple, is that his people, hear me now, in every generation, God's plan is that his people, men and women in every generation, would teach the next generation how to pick up these weapons that for some have fallen to the ground. Pick up these enablements, these gifts of the Spirit that they would, in a sense, claim these spoils of war that were won at the cross, paid for by the blood of the Lamb. And in doing that, what you're actually doing is rejecting the lies of the deceiver who says, among other things, to people like you and me, things like this. Those gifts aren't for you. I grew up hearing that message. the gifts of the spirit are not for today okay they were for people who were doing real ministry 2,000 years ago I don't know they're not for you in fact who do you think you are thinking that the gifts of the spirit could flow through you what do you think you're an apostle so don't pick them up leave them on the ground don't even be curious just kind of walk away and ignore them many of us have many of us do we need to stop doing that we need to change our mind about that it's called repent and at least become a little more curious I guess the spirit can be confusing and sometimes weird so don't dive in just become right here a little more curious about this a little more aware because if we're serious and I think we are as a church about doing the mission to which we have been called in this community and becoming the people to whom we have been called we need resources and enablements and empowerment beyond our own we're just not smart enough you're not cool enough you're just not and so we pray what we pray all the time around here it's a prayer of dependence desperation Holy Spirit come with your breath with your rain with your wine with your life with your grace with your gifts Holy Spirit come and richly dwell among us completely fill us we pray I want to read a benediction over you and just leave you with this I am going to ask the prayer team to come and make yourself available to anyone who needs prayer for anything at all because sermons like this can indeed stir in you a desire for a touch of the spirit and sometimes people praying that for you is very helpful but I want to just wrap this with a benediction I want you to stand as I speak this over you now this is a prayer that Vicki Degner actually prayed at the end of her annual meeting and it really caught many of you we put it online so you could get a picture of this but I feel like it fits very well right here Holy Spirit we plant our feet into the soil of the living God we turn our ear toward the voice of the calling Christ we lean our life into the wind of holy change. Be fierce. Be gentle. Toss us. Turn us. Shape us. Dishevel us. Oh, Holy Spirit, in gratitude we wait. In gratitude we pray. Holy Spirit come with your breath and your life and all of your gifts and all God's people said Amen Thank you.
