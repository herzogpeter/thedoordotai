we are entering this morning into our 14th week of studying the Ten Commandments. You know, every once in a while I get a little curious about how long we've been. I just lose track. You know, I started into something. I think it will be a little while. We started this in June. And Exodus, it's been interrupted. It's not just me. But Exodus is what, you know, we've been in Exodus, and that's how we came to the Ten Commandments. We've been in Exodus since February, so we're closing in on a year, which just boggles my mind. I thought this was going to be a very short trip, which is what the people of Israel thought as well. And I do think we'll be out of Exodus before the 40-year mark. Fourteenth week. And we've been in three weeks. This is our third and final week. And the seventh commandment, recorded for us in Exodus 20, verse 14, it says this, You shall not commit adultery. That's all it says. Rather straightforward, clear, and direct. Let's pray as we begin. Father, in Jesus' name, I pray again this third service that by the power of your Spirit, you would be at work in the Word. But Father, beyond all the power that there is in the Word, we pray that you would do the work of your Spirit to heal and restore and call to repentance where that is necessary. Do your work around the word. I can't make that happen by requesting that or yelling loud. We call on you to do that in Jesus' name. Amen. To adulterate, we have all come to know by now, if you've been with us these weeks, simply means to contaminate or to make impure. Literally, it means to add to the mix a foreign element. In the case of marriage, the foreign element, the ingredient that has no business at all being there is another person. Often but not always, adultery includes sexual activity. Not always, because we have come to affirm that emotional attachment can sometimes be just as adulterous as sexual activity. Why? Because you have allowed into your marriage a foreign element, an ingredient that doesn't belong another person. God is in effect by this commandment saying this. People of God, I am putting around your sexuality a boundary, a wall as it were. The boundary is fidelity and I would even encourage you in your mind's eye to see that around this precious reality called your marriage, a wall that God has designed called fidelity. The purpose of that boundary is to protect marriage and family. It's designed to protect your children and your children's children for generations. Every marriage we discovered last time, even those marriages that are protected by a strong wall of fidelity have what the Apostle Paul called in 1 Corinthians 7.28, trouble. Remember that? He was talking about singleness and extolling the virtues of singleness, almost recognizing that he had gone too far recommending this as a lifestyle choice when he said, I want you to know that if you marry you haven't sinned, but I also want you to know that if you marry you will have trouble was what the translation I had said. We discovered that the Greek word for trouble there is philipsis, and it simply means to press together. And when you press together two people, a man and a wife you get, we discovered two things one is a good thing, you get babies which indicates that at least part of being pressed together is not an entirely unpleasant thing. But the second thing you get is you get friction. All the normal humanity and unresolved issues of my life begin to rub up against all the normal humanity and unresolved issues of my wife's life. And as you get that rubbed together, you get what Paul calls trouble. This trouble is normal. The best of marriages among us has it. This trouble is not a bad thing. Someone after the first service indicated to me that, you know, when you sand wood, or when you rub a stone, or you rub metal, and even buff out paint, the rubbing thing is necessary to bring out the shine. It's a good thing. This trouble, this rubbing together, is a manageable thing. It is not necessarily fun, but it is, as we indicated a couple of weeks ago, It is a powerful tool in the hands of God to bring sanctification. Because as we rub together, all of the issues and all of the sin of our life is exposed. And it's also a tool that God uses to create intimacy in a marriage. You know, years ago I used to think that intimacy was something that a few lucky couples got to experience. And you maybe look at somebody else and you go, they're just so lucky. They were a match. They just kind of fit together. And he was able to marry her and she was able to marry him. And if I had just married someone like that. The issue is they were lucky. And I've been married 25 years, and I've come to discover that luck has nothing to do with intimacy, that what intimacy is is the product of two people who have honestly before God, and with buckets indeed, oceans of grace with each other, had the courage to deal with, honestly, the issues of their life that come up in the context of this sanctifying rubbing together. And as they do that, guess what they get after all? Intimacy. It isn't just because you got lucky. Picture now with me, however, adding to the mix of this pressed together reality, a foreign element, an ingredient that doesn't belong. And when you do that, as we've already indicated, you make the normal pressure of marriage abnormal, unmanageable. For you have exposed your marriage that is already vulnerable to what may be a fatal blow, if not fatal. it is a major breakdown at which point you start from scratch rebuilding this wall of fidelity that was designed to protect your marriage in the first place this rebuilding of the wall I am happy to report can be done but from those who have gone through this process they will tell you that it is an incredibly painful process and like a car that got in a wreck and gets fixed the car gets fixed but it's never quite the same again and again if you were to talk to couples and I have and know them dearly who have gone through the agony of adultery in their marriage wondered if they would ever survive but pressed past that original pain began to deal with their issues ignoring not a one would press through all those things and not even settle just for living together for the sake of the kids but pressed through their issues until they honestly came to a place of intimacy, delirious love for one another again. Even those couples would say there is something, however, in their marriage that we'll never be able to get back. And that is why God in love, not desiring to spoil our fun, but to call us to life, has said don't do this. Don't let this wall around your marriage crumble. Why? Because it's going to cost you more than you can afford to pay. because it will bring you trouble and create pressure beyond that which is manageable, beyond that which I ever intended for you to handle. And here's the deal from God. Some of the pressure in your marriage, I intended for you to handle. It's a good thing. It's going to polish you and sanctify you and produce intimacy among you. But you break down that wall and it makes it unmanageable. So don't do it. problem. We already have done it. The warning to not commit for many is too late. I confess to you some weeks ago when the series began that in light of adultery's pervasiveness in our culture and its infiltration even into the church that I felt a kind of despair in approaching the topic. A little voice in my head that mocked me as if adultery itself was speaking to me this. Johnson, you're going to speak against adultery, huh? Are you going to say it's bad? Are you going to tell people not to do it? Ooh, said adultery. I'm really shaking. Do you really believe a sermon against adultery is going to do any good? The fact is this, whatever you say won't make one bit of difference, even if you say it really well, because the fact is this, people are going to do what they want to do. In fact, people who name the name of Jesus and will be in the gym raising their hands are going to do whatever it is they want to do. And I confess to you a few weeks ago that speaking against us felt like, in some respects, us spitting into the wind. Well, that feeling of despair over the weeks of dealing with this issue and even seeing the positive effect of it in our people still hasn't gone away. That mocking voice hasn't gotten quieter since this series began. In fact, in some respects, that voice has gotten louder and even more convincing. Bonnie and I early this week at lunch with friends, the issue of this sermon series came up in the course of conversations and stories began to flow back and forth. I'll tell you a few. Tom and Marge, obviously not their real name. Married 30 years. All the trappings of success. The houses, yes, plural, houses. Cars, travel, six-figure income. Solid Christians, highly regarded. Tom was a nationally recognized Bible teacher. So in addition to his career, which was a six-figure income, he was well-known and sought after nationally as a Bible teacher. Not long ago, Tom left his wife of 30 years for a woman his daughter's age. he made a list of things that he was willing to lose in pursuit of this woman he just had to have and he gave it to his wife imagine receiving a gift like that and it was this I am willing to lose my health, my career my marriage, my money, my houses, cars, status my good name in the community and I am willing even to lose my children well guess what he did lose all that guess what else he's likely to lose as well that pretty young woman he lost everything else for in fact you can pretty much set your watch to that because when the money and the houses and the cars and all that stuff is gone I got this weird feeling she may not be as interested oh but if that guy would have just been here that Sunday that you preached about adultery I ought to turn that whole thing around. Maybe. And you know what my prayer is? My prayer is that if there are some men and women among us on these weeks when we're talking about this, and you're right that close to making a decision that is going to have incredible ramifications on the rest of your life, that some of the words here will serve to yank you back. I do pray that. But I just got to tell you, sometimes it feels like we're spitting into the wind. Another story, pastor's wife. Married for 14 years, three little kids. Met a man recently on the internet. This man lives overseas. I mean, think about this. This is a big thing these days. We call it cyber sex. Relationships that develop over the internet. And this guy's overseas. You know, it occurs to me, I mean, he may be who he says he is, but it occurs to me, you don't even know if this guy actually exists. This could be a woman writing letters saying she's a man and sending pictures of somebody else. You don't even know they exist, and now you're in love. And she's beginning to talk like this, say things like this. I've never been so in love. I feel alive for the first time in my life. He thinks I'm talented and encourages me to develop my gifts. Being what I thought was a good Christian, I buried all of my gifts so my husband could develop his. Stop right there. That little scenario could send me off into a whole other room of confrontation on men who are absolutely blind to the beauty and the giftedness of their wives. Because they're so absolutely committed to themselves. Wake up, men. But she's still responsible. But this woman is still responsible. feels so good she says I'm willing to bail my marriage I'm willing to abandon my kids my husband doesn't have a clue what's going on which by the way gives us a clue as to what's going on how do you keep him from finding out her friend asks her I mean this is right under his nose well to be honest she says it actually has begun to scare me how good I've become at lying. It used to be I couldn't tell a lie about the smallest thing, but I've gotten really good at it, and I don't have any feeling at all for my husband, and I don't have any feeling at all for God. Maybe if she'd heard a sermon that said, don't commit adultery. Well, you know, she's a pastor's wife. Hello. 14 years. I just have this weird feeling she might have heard a sermon or two about adultery. Maybe even some good ones. Ben and Bev have been married 40 or 15 years. Both went to a Christian college. They didn't go to Bethel or Northwestern or Crown College, but they could have gone to one of those. It could have been one of those schools. That's where they met and now on staff at a prominent church out west. Not long ago, Ben had an affair with Bev's best friend. Well, Bev's best friend, who Ben had an affair with, got pregnant. And she had a baby, a little girl. The solution is this. We are never, ever going to talk about this. The ultimatum, number one, never speak to or see that woman again, which interestingly does incredibly painful things to that woman who used to be this best friend and now she's totally cut out and also never ever acknowledge this child as yours. To this day, no one close to them knows about the affair or about the little girl. And there is a little girl who doesn't know she's got a dad who lives a few blocks away. But they stayed together. They're still married, bless God. but in their marriage that from the outside might look good they are like the walking dead and they could come to life but it feels like death that process of coming to life because the coming to life would mean getting this out in the open where God can heal it would that be scary? oh by would there be a lifestyle change? no doubt about it Would you like to come to life or not? Then repent and tell the truth and ask for grace and healing which is lavished on people who come broken to God. We'll call her Alice. Obviously, again, not her real name. She lives in Eden Freary, a picture-perfect Sunday school teaching PTA, bring the kids to hockey practice, mom. She left her husband some years ago after being married for 10 years for another woman. after years in the homosexual lifestyle God's grace amazingly broke through on her there were gifts of true repentance that she experienced the turning of her life back to what was right and good and healthy for her and she now today has an amazing story to tell of hope and healing of amazing grace and it would stir you if you heard it But that marriage could never be repaired. That wall of fidelity could never be rebuilt. And now the kids who were little when she decided to do whatever I got to do, whatever I want to do, I'm going to fulfill me. Her kids were little then, are teenagers now. And now in their teenage years are acting out both rage and despair. Do you know what rage and despair look like when they're together? Here's what they look like. They look like one day, literally, really wanting to kill somebody. And the next day, literally wanting to kill themselves. Killing somebody else is rage. Killing themselves is despair. And as I give you that scenario, it's not that much of a threat. It's not that much of a stretch. We see that played out in the headlines of the Star Tribune. When little kids, 10, 12 years old, get their daddy's rifle, bring it to school, and start slaughtering their friends. The slaughtering of their friends is what? It's rage. Guess what happens the next day? Isn't it weird? The next day, where were the kids? In prison? Yeah, in prison. On a what? On a suicide watch. Because the next day they're trying to kill themselves, and that's the spirit. And the real sad thing is that to these stories I've given you, I could add many more, and to mine you could add your own. The picture I got as these things began to grow in front of me over these last three weeks was that of a flood. The Bible says, by the way, Isaiah 59, that when the enemy comes, he comes that way like a flood. We get floods in this part of the country, and maybe that's why the picture worked for me. A year ago last spring, we watched as record-breaking floods devastated the lives of our neighbors in East Grand Forks and even closer in Stillwater. And I remember day after day, as I'm sure you do, watching on the news as these people, men and women, boys and girls, standing on the wall of the sandbags, fighting and scratching, staying up all night to build a wall of sand. And feeling, as I was safely in my little bedroom watching the news, feeling a despair come on me for them. You know, you're throwing bags of sand at this thing. Do you see the wall of water? Do you really think a bag of sand is going to help this? That's how I feel. Do you really think a sermon today is going to help this? Do you see the wall of water? And despite their noblest efforts, the water began to spill over and break down the walls and spread. And when it spread, everything got touched, damaging and defiling everything. Nothing escaped. And wouldn't it be great if when the wall broke down and the floodwaters came in, that the only things that were affected by the flood were big businesses that were really insured and covered well. But you see, the water doesn't just discriminate that way. It hits the businesses and it hits the homes that are insured and it hits the ones and defiles them all that aren't insured and they're going to destroy people's lives. And wouldn't it be great if the only thing that was affected was buildings? Because we can rebuild buildings. But it's not just buildings, it's people. And wouldn't it be great if it was not just people but adult people? Because adults, even though it's terrible and hard, we all have a sense as it relates to children, let it land on me, not on the kids. But the water doesn't discriminate, it gets on the kids too. It's really distant so we don't get drawn in as much, but I think we've been affected by the scope of this thing. Nicaragua, the rains and the floods, I don't know if it was Nicaragua or not, But I saw a picture this week in the paper of mud that had come with the floods. And the guy was inside his house and the mud was up to the top of the window. Inside the house. I think the mud is an interesting metaphor. See, as we see this flood dynamic applied to adultery and the dissolving of marriages in unbelievable ways. It's not just married people who get affected by the flood. but single people as well, scared to death because of the constant dissolution of marriage and the very high probability of adultery, scared to death to marry. How on earth can I have confidence to open this heart of mine? How can I trust anybody? Especially if their dad did it or their mom did it or they lived through that very thing. They guard their heart. They're not bad people, but they guard their heart. And it's not just the people who've committed adultery. who get the mud on them. All of us have been by this affected. And even this morning as we lift our hands in praise to God, the fact is this, we are knee deep in this thing ourselves. And by that I'm not saying that you have committed adultery. You may never have and may never do it. The problem is the water has come over the sandbags. And it's gotten on us in ways that we don't even know. In places like churches, we are the proverbial people on the sandbag wall. Men and women, boys and girls, scratching, fighting, staying up all night, preaching our sermons, having our seminars, recommending counselors to our friends. And when we see our friends, they're either men or women. We go to them and we confront them with the truth because we love them. Don't do this. Don't let the wall be crumbled. we come to them harshly and we're even willing to let them be mad at us for a while because we love them and we see them pull away and say hey maybe that's too hard and we offer them mercy and we offer them grace and we warn them of consequences that even when there will come grace you're going to pay a high price for this don't do it, don't do it, we're doing our best hold the wall back but the water keeps coming and the levels keep rising what do you do? Well let's preach a sermon listen if you've been around Open Door long enough and you know me at all you know that I believe that the word of God is catalytic I believe that the preaching of the word of God has effect but we need more than a sermon to push the waters back two weeks ago I was on a on an airplane on my way to a speaking engagement. I pulled out a book I'd been wanting to read. It had nothing to do with adultery or nothing to do with marriage. In fact, it was right in the middle of the series, and I kind of needed to get away from that. And I pulled out a book called Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire, which was simply a story of a church in Brooklyn, New York, and how the Spirit of God landed in this place and began to move on them out of their desperation. And it sounded a lot like what God has done among us, as we have learned in years past of brokenness and dependence and how God moves toward that stuff. Thumbing through it, trying to decide whether it was worth the effort. Did you ever do that? Just look through a book and go, look at the headings and go, I don't know, I don't know. My eyes landed on words in the middle of the book. That's something I make fun of when people do. You know, they open their Bible and they put their finger on a verse and they're like, oh, gee. Well, now you can make fun of me. My eyes landed on these words. Over the last 30 years, more books have been written, more sermons have been preached, more seminars have been held on marriage than in all the preceding 2,000 years of church history. But you ask any pastor in America if there aren't proportionately more troubled marriages today than at any other time. We have more how-tos than ever before, but our marriages are still falling apart. How bad does it have to get before we begin to honestly and desperately call on God as our only hope to stem the tide and turn back the flood. Turn back the flood was my metaphor injected here. The writer of the book of Hebrews in chapter 4 verse 16 says this. Let us therefore, because of the trouble we're in, let us therefore draw near with confidence to the throne of grace. And at that throne of grace we will receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Help to do what? To stem the tide. Where do you find help to stem the tide? At the throne of grace. not just with a sermon. Help to turn back the waters that would overflow and consume us. Where do you find that help? At the throne of grace, not just with a sermon. Preachers, he went on to say, who are really doing their job, get people to come to the throne of grace. That's the true source of grace and mercy. That's the help that can help. If we, and he's speaking of himself as well as a preacher, if we just entertain them, if we simply tickle their ears with cutesy stories and give them a warm, fuzzy moment, woe to us. At the throne of grace, people's lives can be changed. So, Mr. Preacher Man, he says, did you just dazzle people with your cleverness, or did you make them hungry, even desperate to come to me? If a meeting doesn't end with people touching God, what kind of meeting was that? What did you have it for? if we haven't encountered God we haven't met with the only one powerful enough to change our lives in quotes well those words hit me like a thunderbolt as I was sitting on that plane and immediately I got a picture and the picture began to expand the picture was of how we were to close this service indeed how we were to conclude this series on adultery, the picture was clearly and simply this, that we were as God's people on this Sunday morning to cry out to God as our only possible hope to stem the tide. A sermon wasn't going to do it. A sermon was important, but we needed more than that. We needed to cry out to God to turn back the waters that would overflow and consume us, that we were to come to the throne of grace as the people of God and ask there for help and healing and forgiveness and gifts of true repentance to ask God at the throne of grace for a rebuilding of the wall where it has crumbled, for a restoration of hope where it's been lost, for a building of trust where that has eroded, for a rekindling of love where that has died, and for a spirit-born experience, maybe for the first time of intimacy in our marriages, and to pray for the courage and strength that all of that most surely requires. It was also clear to me, as this picture began to develop, that we were to do all of that prayer, recognizing that married people aren't the only ones who need this prayer. For by adultery, the souls of our children have been wounded. And while they're little, they might look okay, and they're adjusting well, and they keep their grades up. We have no idea. We have no idea. I've already mentioned singles in ways that are single men and women among us even now in massive numbers terrified of marriage with what I'm saying, I remember a couple weeks ago I said and there's wisdom in this, some of you ought to be, who can I trust? the next thing that became clear to me was okay, we're supposed to call on God. What is that supposed to look like? How are we supposed to do that? Well, the first thing that came to me about that in terms of how to was I wasn't supposed to do it alone. This felt bigger than a pastoral prayer. And immediately I pictured my wife. I want my wife to come up here and that we are going to pray about this thing. And I want you to know that as I call my wife up here to pray and we in the context of our marriage pray for marriages, that I'm not calling her up here and then setting us up here as the perfect marriage. We don't have the perfect marriage. I don't know what that would even look like. but we've been married 24, 25 years, almost 25 years, and I adore my wife, and she likes me pretty good too. You know what? We've got our own flips. We've got our own stuff, and over 25 years, we've had the courage, I think, both to look at that, and we're experiencing levels of intimacy that we've never known, and it's coming out of pain. It's coming out of stuff we're looking at. I want my wife up here. I want my wife up here when I pray about this. But I thought, this is not enough. It's bigger than just me and my wife. We need to pray for singles. Well, I could pray for singles. No, no, no. We need a single to pray for singles. Who would that be? I thought of several people, men and women among us, who would do a magnificent job calling on God for our singles. But the person that wouldn't go away in my mind was a person I think is a powerful woman of God among us. Her name is Sarah Anderson. Sarah, who several years ago was recognized by our Board of Elders as an elder. she became an elder and is currently serving as our chairperson on the elder board and that felt good and I'm going to ask Sarah to pray for her singles both those who are single because they've always been and singles who are single right now because they are a direct victim of this very thing we're talking about but it felt bigger than that and I thought what am I supposed to do I have 50 people up on the stage all praying and I finally pictured this our congregation surrounded by people and we're going to do this in just a moment I want to tell you who they are as they come some of the people who are going to surround the congregation in just a moment and those of you who are going to do this I just want to give you this instruction that some of you just kind of watch how you're spaced and some of you I would extend your prayer this way and some of you extend your prayers up into the bleachers but some of the people who you're going to see are married and they are not going to be standing in the circle because they have the perfect marriage either But we know this about the people who are coming, that they have surrendered their hearts to God in love and are staying in the dance. Some of the people you're going to see surround the congregation are single. Some of them are single because they've been single all their life. Some of the single people, men and women, around the congregation you'll see are going to be people who've gone through this very issue of adultery. And they felt the mud on them. And some of them are people who've done adultery and God, by amazing grace, has brought them back and cleansed them again. and there's hope for you. Some of them have gotten the adultery on them, not because they did it, but because they had a spouse who walked away. And the pain is still fresh, but Amazing Grace is strong, and they are going to be here to pray as well. And some of the people in the circle are going to be young people, not because they've done adultery or know any one of their friends who has, but because our young people, in ways that they haven't even been able to figure out, and while we were busy doing whatever felt good to us, They felt the pain of it, and that's why they're going to be around it too. Right now, I want all of you to come. Bonnie, I want you to come, and Sarah, I would like you to come. And those of you who've agreed to be part of this prayer time, I would like you to come from wherever you are and just begin to surround the congregation. I'd appreciate that. As they come, I want to just wrap this up with two questions. Why are we doing this? Why are we ending this whole series with prayer? Well, as if I haven't already made that clear, Let me tie the answer to that question into the outline that we've been using for three weeks, but I haven't made reference to at all. The first reason we're ending this thing with prayer and calling on God as our only hope is because of adultery's pervasiveness. All of us, whether we've committed adultery or not, or have ever even seen it in our family, all of us have been by this affected. All of us have mud on us and need the cleansing of God. For the second reason we're going to call on God is because of our culture's pervasiveness. The flood has overflowed the banks. Adultery in our culture is a good idea. It's a viable option. The third reason is because of adultery's painfulness. Pain that some of you are experiencing, either because you've done adultery or it's been done to you, meaning a spouse has abandoned you that way, and you're feeling right now the pain so intensely you think there could not possibly be a recovery. Well, there is grace for you. But it's so intense. We need to pray. I have a second question. Will it make a difference, this prayer? I mean, big show of people around and this thing we're doing different up here. Will it make a difference? Isaiah 59 says, as I've already indicated, that when the enemy moves, he comes in like a flood. But guess what happens when the wind of God begins to blow? what happens is the waters begin to be turned back and using an analogy right out of the book of Exodus which we've been studying when the wind of God begins to blow the waters are parted and God creates in the middle of the sea a place for his people to put their feet and walk with safety and sanity and integrity and purity and God can restore when the wind of God begins to blow we need more than a sermon and guess what happens when the wind of God begins to blow, renewal, revival repentance, healing and amazing grace will it make a difference you know as I thought of that question you know what the bottom line truth for me is will this make a difference was this I don't know what else to do than pray well that sounds like a desperate feeling but the good news about that statement is this Matthew 5, blessed are those who don't know what else to do but pray. Blessed are those who don't know what else to do but call on God. Blessed are those who are desperate because they ask for help. Blessed are the broken because they recognize that they can't clean this up themselves. So let's pray right now. Father God, I pray in Jesus' name. As my mind can't even conceive of all the different ways that healing needs to come, whether it be young people or married people or single people or people who've committed adultery and need to know now that they can be washed clean and come back, or people whose spouses have left them because of adultery. Father, the wall has come down, and we are into this up to our knees, and I pray your spirit would blow. I pray, Jesus, that you would come and minister beyond words. Do your work. Minister your life. In Jesus' name. Jesus, I ask that your word has asked us and told us what to do. Call unto you, and you will answer us and show us great and mighty things which we do not know. So Jesus, we are asking for this. We are calling upon you and asking you for the great and mighty things which we do not know. Jesus, that you would come into our marriages and that you would tenderize our hearts. That we would be drawn to you and drawn to each other. And Jesus, I specifically want to pray for the children and the youth in our church and in our nation. Lord, I see you weeping with the children that are left alone. You are weeping with the children that are scared and don't know what's happening to their parents. Jesus, the parents have a selfishness and a self-centeredness that we need to repent from. And I just pray that as you hold the children and you hold our youth, you hold them tightly and that you would help them in their healing process, Jesus. You are the God of healing, and we are calling upon you to heal them and to build them and to rebuild them and to strengthen them in you. And I ask these things in your name. Holy God, on behalf of all of us who are single by choice, and single by the choices of others. I ask first, Holy Spirit and precious Jesus, for your mercy, that you would forgive us, Lord God, for our resentment, for our bitterness, and for our fear, for our self-righteousness, for the ways that we have chosen not to engage in order to protect ourselves, and the ways we have judged others in order to protect ourselves. Holy Father, I pray that you would begin a work by your powerful spirit within our lives, that we would be transformed into those who seek you first, Our first love. And that we would follow your voice into relationships as you call us in obedience. Not because it makes us feel good. Not because it's popular. Not because it's what Hollywood would have us do. But because you are calling us to reveal your glory and your love in relationships. You're calling us to work out your love in relationship. Father, I pray that you would bless those you call to singleness, but I pray that for those of us you have not called to singleness, that we would surrender ourselves to you, and we would reach out and love one another in holiness and purity. Teach us to walk in your ways and to step out of the water. into that dry path you blow before us. That the sacredness of marriage and of the community might be upheld. And that our nation and our neighbors would know that we serve a living and loving God. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
