I hope you all had a good week since last week when we got together, and it's just really good to be here. I appreciate this opportunity. We're talking about answering skeptics. And last week, what we did very quickly is talked a little bit about the model of dialogue we should use. The attitude should be respectful, humble, and loving. Our approach should not be primarily a confrontational approach, but rather to find points of contact and to be informed. You'll recall all of that. I think they're getting the printouts for this. So you can probably see a little better this week than you could last week, can't you? All right. No? Pretend, all right? Go along with me on this thing. The crucial apologetic issues in contemporary American culture that we're dealing with, there's four of them. what is the nature of truth what is the nature of ultimate reality what is the nature of jesus christ and what is the nature of the bible and under the nature of truth we there confronted the dogma the very narrow indoctrination of our culture that there is no objective truth and that is for sure an objective truth and we confronted the dogma that all truth is relative and that is certainly a non-relative truth. And the doctrine that opinions are ruts, and that's a very important opinion for some people to have. So there's a lot of inconsistencies there, and when it comes to talking about truth, we need to really be equipped to help people out of some of the intellectual conundrums that they get in as they're thinking about things. Then we talked about the nature of ultimate reality and i there offered just one uh argument for the existence of god man it it feels like it's echoing in here it sounds kind of cool though it feels like i'm talking to some big auditorium or something but uh yeah it's kind of an interesting sound okay i remember when the whole church used to meet here i mean back uh what is it 1988 or whatever we all used to meet here this when I first started coming to Open Door. And now it frankly looks so small. I was like, what a little church we have here. But that, it wasn't so long ago, you know. Okay, a little walk down nostalgia lane. This was the argument from desire. And the basic line of reasoning here is this. How can, the question is, how can our desires outrun reality? And more particularly, how can we desire things to make sense if in fact there isn't an overarching sense maker to the world? How can we believe that reason works if in fact there's not an overarching rationality to the nature of things? Reason, if it comes about as a matter of chance, by definition can't be rational. Chance can't produce reason. If our reason, our whole scientific enterprise, is simply a rational oasis in the midst of an otherwise irrational desert, then there's no explanation for, number one, why we crave reason, number two, why we have reason, and most interesting, number three, why reason works. He can't explain it. It's what Einstein called the mysterious incomprehensible comprehensibility of the universe. The incomprehensible comprehensibility of the universe. He couldn't figure out why it was until he actually became a theist, not a Christian, but a theist towards the end of his life. But when he was an agnostic, he couldn't understand how it is that his mathematical theories fit reality. How is that? The world has an incredible, even beautiful mathematical structure to it. And he couldn't understand how it is that his mathematical theories shed light on the world, unless there was a mathematical mind behind it. If you understand that there's a mind, a super mind that created the world, then you can understand how it is that we dialogue with the world in science. That's what we're basically doing. And the language that nature talks is the language of mathematics. We ask questions and it answers. That's what science is. We're trying to find out. It's a communication with the nature of things. But communication presupposes that the two parties share some common ground. And the common ground that we share with nature is reason. Nature is structured in a rational way, and that's how we can understand it. So that seems to suggest that ultimate reality is rational. So also, if we crave morality, how can ultimate reality not be moral? We crave meaning in life. How can ultimate reality be meaningless? We crave love. How could ultimate reality not be loving? If the effect can never be greater than the cause, then the cause of us who are the effect must be at least as great as we are. You cannot roll a, you can't expect a ball to roll farther up the other side of a valley than it rolled down. The effect doesn't outrun the cause. We are the effect. What is the cause? It must be something, a super instance of us. And on issues like this, I therefore argue that we have a lot of good reasons to believe in a God who is personal like us, rational like us, moral like us, meaningful like us, loving like us, to an infinite degree to be sure, but like us nonetheless. Once you accept that, things make sense. You can understand why beings like us exist. Given that cause, this effect makes sense. Deny that cause and nothing makes sense. now there's one major problem that I this is where we left off last week that I want to get into I've got a lot to cover here and I want to leave some time open for questions as we're going through if you have a question write it out and then we'll collect it at the end but the major objection to the idea that the universe is run by a personal God is the problem of evil why if there is an all good all loving all powerful God how can it be that the world is so full of suffering. It is a veritable nightmare in some quarters. How is it that a God who's all good, all loving, all powerful would create a world where this sort of atrocities can take place? As the argument goes, either this God is unable to stop the suffering, though he wants to, in which case he's not all powerful, or he's able to stop the suffering but doesn't want to, in which case he's not all good. So how can you say that an all good, all powerful God is the creator of the world? And what I'm going to offer here is what I regard as sort of a bare minimum explanation. But I want us to just get a grip on this. It's not, there are a lot of people who would disagree with this approach to the problem, but I'm the one who's talking up here, and this is the only solution that I think makes sense. So here's how I would treat this. Let me give you four steps here. Number one, as we're talking to people who have this question, and this is the question that all thinking people have, why is there so much evil in the world? You can just share with them this response. Number one, God's aim in creating the world in the first place was love. You'd expect a loving being to do that. Parents, out of the fullness of their love, create children. Artists, out of the fullness of their creativity, create paintings and sculptures and whatnot. God, out of the creative love of his own triune being, created the world. He didn't need the world. He wasn't lonely for the world. But love loves to multiply itself. It overflows. God created the world with love to have other beings who could say yes to his love and participate in his love. And his goal is to invite others into the, as it were, the Trinitarian dance of eternity. Throughout eternity, God will be God, which means God will be loving within himself, Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, and he invites others to join in on that love, to be participants, to in their own little way reflect the glory of God, to be a mirror of this love, even as children are a mirror, or at least ideally, are a mirror of the love between a husband and a wife. John 17, verse 20 forward, talks about how the love that the Father has for the Son is now extended towards us. And the Father and the Son dwell in us and we in them. And we are to be one even as they are one. It's a beautiful, beautiful picture of reality. The goal of the whole thing, the point of everything, in the end, is love. We mentioned how that differs from the way Eastern monistic philosophies construe the goal of everything, which is ultimate absorption. In Christian theology, the ultimate thing is not to be absorbed into another, to have an undifferentiated unity, which is boring, but rather to have a loving relationality, which presupposes that there's a difference between you and God and you and each other. But, B, love requires freedom. Love requires freedom. If you are going to have beings who have the potential to love you, they must have the potential not to love you. And just think about this. This is an area that you really can do a lot of good if you can help a person understand the nature of this. There is a lot of thinking out there in terms of genetic determinism or social conditioning where people tend to deny their freedom even though they act on it every moment. But help people see this point. If I had, let's say, a microchip that I could plant into the mind or the brain of my wife. And that microchip I could design, and it would control all of her behavior. And so I make this microchip, and I secretly one evening blow it into her ear, and it gets planted there or something. And henceforth, she is the world's most wonderful wife. She is already, mind you, but this way, even more so. Okay, so I come home from work, And she's there at the door saying, oh, I've missed you so much all day. You're finally home. What can I do for you? How can I make your life a little bit easier? And, you know, she's dressed up in my favorite outfit. And she's just looking great. And the supper is there. And, oh, who wouldn't smile at that? And the next day, it's the same thing. And the next day, it's the same thing. And she loves with a perfect love, says all the right words, does all the right things. It's a wonderful life. except I would know that she's doing that because of my microchip, which is to say she's doing it because I'm really doing it to myself. I programmed that microchip, and what I've done is I've created a perfect automaton. Now, it may take a while, but after a number of eons, I get tired of that. I wouldn't take it out right away, But in the end, it's like there's no person there. She's not choosing to do this, and I know that. It doesn't matter even if she thinks she's choosing to do it. I could program the chip so that she actually thinks she's doing it of her own free will. But I know that she's not doing it of her own free will. So it's meaningless. It's a game. I just have a very complex puppet on my hand saying, man, are you a hunk of a guy or what? And it's like, this is really fulfilling. It's meaningful to me when she does it and she could do otherwise. When she chooses to do it, even though she could choose not to do it, and sometimes she has reasons to choose not to do it, then it's meaningful. This is the essence of personhood. This is the essence of personal relationships. Love requires a personal being there, and a personal being means there must be freedom, and freedom means you must have the capability of doing otherwise. God could have created a world that was perfect in every way, saying I love you and doing all the right things and never having a sin and never having a squabble or whatever, but it would not be a world where he got love, where there were beings who really participated in love, because we'd be automatons, and that'd be boring and it wouldn't be loving. What God wants is not just complex trees. He wants people, personal beings, so he creates them with freedom. And the meaning of that is that they have the potential to choose against God. And that's what I said here. Freedom entails the possibility of going against love. Freedom entails the possibility. To the degree that you're free to love God is the same degree that you're free not to love God, to work against God. And the one is built into the other. If you create a triangle, it's got three sides. If you create a mountain, it's got a valley. If you create freedom, it's got risks. And the risk is that the person can choose against you. I would argue that all evil in the world, everything in the creation that does not reflect the beauty, the wisdom, the design of the creator is directly or indirectly the result of free agents choosing against God. And it's not God's responsibility any more than it's your responsibility when your 33-year-old daughter decides to drive when she's drunk. We are free agents, we are responsible agents, and we make choices. So evil in the world, I would argue, is the result of misused freedom. Now, there's an immediate question that arises, and that is this, what about natural evil? Natural evil is things like earthquakes, things that occur in nature, tornadoes and hurricanes. You can maybe understand why God would have to tolerate rapists and Hitler and other creeps. Given that freedom is necessary for love, you understand why God has to allow for that. But why are there hurricanes? No one's choosing the hurricanes. No one's choosing the earthquake or whatever. How does one explain that? And let me just say two things about that. Number one, much, in fact, many would argue that most of the natural disasters in history could be prevented by humans, or at least they could be minimized by humans. For example, if we really live the way that God would have us to live, starvation on the planet would not be a problem. It's not nature's fault that there are starving people. The world is the kind of place where you have droughts, where you have floods and things of that sort. But if we were caring enough, if we were proactive enough, if we really were willing to live on less than we have so that those who have less than they need could have what they need, starvation wouldn't be a problem. That's one example of it. Most of the evil in the world is preventable if humans cared enough. A second thing, however, is this. And this is something to explain to people. when they're asking this question. And that is that the Bible teaches that we are a fallen race of people. We, as a race, have rebelled against God. We've turned against God. There is now a gulf between us and God. And that entails, as the Bible tells us in a lot of different ways, that we are less than we ought to be before God. We lost, God created us to have dominion over the world. But the first thing that happens with the curse when we fall, read Genesis 3, is that we're no longer the lords of the earth. We no longer have that dominion. Now it takes a lot of work for us to till the garden. It's by the sweat of our brow. Even childbirth doesn't come easy. Nature has somewhat turned against us. It's not hard to imagine that had we not fallen, we would have far more mastery over nature than we now have. It's possible that when you see Jesus doing some of his miracles, what he's doing there is not so much operating on God's power as he is operating on perfect human power. And maybe that when he rebukes the storm and commands it to be still, it's possible that we humans would have had the ability to do that had we not fallen. Even now, there's very good empirical evidence of individuals who exercise a remarkable degree of control over areas that most of us don't have. There are individuals who have an incredible mastery over animals that the rest of us don't have. There are people who have, and you can theologize this how you want, here's one way of doing it, who have sort of an uncanny psychic ability to know what you're thinking or to diagnose what's wrong in your body. And I'm not talking about Christians now, I'm just talking about people. Not that Christians aren't people, but non-believing people. And it may be that what you're seeing there is sort of a vestigial remain, an echo of, a leftover of pre-fallen humanity, powers that we all would have had, did we not lose it. And so it could be that we would have a mastery over animals and maybe even over weather patterns. We would be able to command them, being aligned with God the way we should be aligned with God, that we have now lost because of the fall. But there's another consideration here, and this is, I think, the even more important one. And this is kind of what God at War is about, the book God at War. well that's part of what God worries about the Bible tells us that we're not the only free agents in the universe in fact we're not the most powerful free agents in the universe there's a whole angelic realm that are also free agents and we don't know how many there are but they play a very important role in the Bible most importantly one of them called Lucifer the bright and morning star was one of the Lord's, in fact, probably the top administrator in God's kingdom. God always operates through mediation. It's a pattern of nature. God could raise children on his own, but he puts parents in charge of them. God could be the direct governor of everybody, but he has a governmental society. He could govern nature on his own, but he puts us in charge of nature. He works through the mediation of go-betweens. These angels had some jobs to perform just like humans did upon the earth. And many of them went AWOL. They broke rank. They rebelled. Including the one who Scripture suggests was the highest of the angels, the chief administrator, and he is the one that is now called in Hebrew Satan. We call him Satan. According to the New Testament, a lot of what we call natural evil in the world is the result of the activity of demonic spirits. The New Testament, the ministry of Jesus was full of him coming against deafness and muteness and blindness and things of that sort. And at least some of the time, in fact most of the time, doing so under the assumption that those things are there not by God's will, but by demonic wills. He casts out demons of deafness and muteness and whatnot. In Acts chapter 10, verse 38, Peter says that Jesus went about freeing people from the devil, healing them from all of their diseases. And in Luke chapter 13, Jesus comes against a woman who's bent over with scoliosis, and he says, how long should this daughter of Abraham suffer under the bondage of Satan? All that is to say this. In the New Testament picture, there is no neutral environment, this natural world out there. That's a scientific enlightenment idea that we've inherited. Rather, the whole thing, the whole of creation, from the inside of our hearts to the outside of the cosmos, is a war zone. And there's spiritual activity going all over the place. It's not inconceivable that some of the laws of nature have even been tampered with and screwed up. If spiritual free agents have the capacity to love, they have the capacity not to love. and like us, they can turn nature into a weapon. There's no reason why the second law of thermodynamics has to pertain. At least not that I know of. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've asked a lot of different scientists types about this. There's no reason. Why is it that everything has to wind down? Why is it that death is inevitable? Everything tends towards randomness. That's the second law of thermodynamics. I would have thought in a God creation, it would have worked the other way around. Things would get more and more beautiful. Why do they have to get more and more ugly? More and more chaotic? more and more, blah. Why do we have to age? Why don't we just get younger and younger and better and better and smarter and smarter? I would think in God's creation we would, and I bet we would, except that there is now one who the Bible says in 1 John 5, 19 is in control of the entire world. He's the principality and power of the air, Ephesians 2, 2. He's the God of this age, 2 Corinthians 4, 4. A being, a free agent of tremendous power, and he's got ill intents. So nature is largely screwed up for that reason. One final note here, and I talk about this in the beginning of God at War. And this kind of information really plays well when you're talking to non-believers in our culture because right now a lot of people are very aware of other cultures and the dignity of primordial peoples and things of that sort. And so the more you can find a point of contact between their views of primordial cultures and the Christian gospel that you're proclaiming, the better off you're going to be. Well, as it turns out, even though to a lot of Western people what I just told you about spiritual agents mixing up with nature sounds flaky, as a matter of fact, throughout history, almost every people group that we know of has believed that, or something like that. Primordial peoples took it as a, and I mean by that, you know, the Aborigines, different African tribes, excuse me, and whatnot, they assumed it was a matter of common sense intuition that the world is inhabited by spiritual agents. And these spiritual agents cause sickness and death and things of that sort. The Hevaro, they're now often called the Shuwar, Indians, they don't even have a concept of natural death. All death is demonically induced. Now, I'm not endorsing any particulars of their worldview, but I am saying this. If it strikes us as odd to think that there are spiritual agents involved in nature, we are the weird ones. It's only been our culture the last 300 or 400 years that has come to think that that's odd. Every other people group throughout history has seen it otherwise. On this point, the Bible agrees that the world is a war zone, and that's why it looks like a war zone. A few summary crucial points here to share with people or to share with yourself if you're one who's struggling with this issue. A few points of conclusion. Number one, if the argument that I just gave you, where's my chair I had here yesterday or last week? I've got to turn my shoe again. If the view I just gave you is true, then you can't assume that God is behind every particular thing that happens. I think what gets people in a lot of intellectual struggles is that they assume that because God's all-powerful and all-good, that he must have a purpose for every evil thing that happens. And we say this a lot. Well, it must be God's will and whatnot. But see, the New Testament doesn't operate under that assumption. If you assume that there's a particular reason, God has a purpose for creating us free, for sure. He's got a reason for allowing evil to happen. If he wants love in the universe, there can be no other way. So he allows evil in general for that reason. But if I choose on my own free will to abuse you, don't go looking for a God reason for that happening. That's a me reason, okay? The buck stops with the free agent. And people get into a lot of intellectual quagmires because they believe that there must be a meta-explanation, a super divine will behind everything that occurs. If you believe that God's will is behind everything, then you can't believe that creaturely wills, whether angelic or human, have any real significance in the way things flow. It means don't blame God for evil. Blame the perpetrator of the evil and look to God for help. Secondly, God is with you in the suffering, working to bring good out of evil events. I don't believe that God is causing evil events. Hitler's to be blamed and all the other people who participated with him. They're to be blamed for the Holocaust. But God doesn't go around exterminating races of people that he himself created. That's not the way God operates. But whatever happens, the Bible tells us that if we cooperate with him, Romans 8.28, if we are aligned with him, he will immediately be working to bring good out of evil. The promise of the New Testament, one of the areas of hope in the New Testament is not that. You can look at everything that's happening in the world and say, well, you know, God's doing it. That's not much hope. Rather, the hope is that whatever happens to you, God is with you. And he's always saying, okay, to what redemptive use can I put this atrocity? Number three, the promise of the New Testament is that the end will make it all worth it. The Bible looks a lot to heaven as the hope of the Christian in the present. This world is not a picnic. It is a veritable war zone. Sometimes life is a nightmare. Sometimes gratuitous, senseless, stupid, diabolical evil happens. The world is like that. It is right now under siege by a tyrannical evil being. You have to expect that. In fact, Jesus tells us to expect suffering. The hope is not that here and now we'll have our mansion and we'll have our perfect health and we'll have all of our wealth. The hope is rather that when all is said and done, God will be victorious. He'll reign on high. And then his will will be carried out throughout the cosmos. It's not right now the way he'd want it, but it shall someday be. The final point is this, and this is also a part of apologetics. Christianity is the only religion that proclaims a God who out of love dives into suffering in order to rid the world of it. The New Testament proclamation is outrageous in one way and incredibly beautiful in another way. The proclamation is that God so loved the world He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever would believe in Him would not perish but have everlasting life. The gospel proclamation is that God made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us that we may be made the righteous The New Testament proclamation in a word is this. Right now, God allows suffering because his aim is love, and love requires freedom, and freedom means you can inflict suffering on other people. He allows it. But he's not up there in heaven looking down at it and saying, oh, these poor, miserable creatures. This is a God who is love, and he dives into the hell of our situation in order to redeem it. The infinitude of God's jump from heaven down to the man Jesus reflects the infinitude of his love. The fact that the one who was infinitely great became infinitely small in the person of Christ Jesus reflects that God is a God of infinite love. A loving God who is more than normal love would do this. And so the proclamation that Jesus Christ was God on earth, in its own way it answers the problem of evil maybe right now you can't sort the pieces together but what you can know is that god has done in jesus christ everything possible to redeem the world of evil to to defeat the saint to defeat satan and all those who align themselves with him who perpetrate evil and you can know that god even right now in your life is doing all he can do to bring good out of evil. That's the hope of the New Testament. And that's, I think, the solution to the problem of evil. There may be points you want to follow up on that. We'll take some time at the end to ask them. I want to right now turn to another area. If I can find my overhead, I will turn to this other area. Here's the other area that I now have found on my overhead. All right. The third crucial issue that we need to confront in our culture is the issue of who is Jesus Christ. Whom do men say that I am? He says in Matthew 16. The most important question you can ever ask. I spent some of this afternoon talking to a young man about this very issue. This is whatever else you do in your dialoguing with people. You want to get to this question. Let me just say a word about method here. A word about method. There's three ways of witnessing to Jesus Christ in our contemporary culture. Number one, you can talk about the personal transformation that you have experienced through Jesus Christ. You can testify to how Jesus Christ has changed your life. That is a witness to the reality that Jesus Christ is Lord. If the Holy Spirit is operating in a person's life and if their mind is such equipped, wired a certain way, this may be enough to persuade them that in fact Jesus Christ is Lord and they can make Jesus Christ as Lord of their own life. But in our culture increasingly, personal testimony alone doesn't carry the day because there's a lot of personal testimony out there. A lot of people testifying about a lot of miraculous things and great things and things that have changed my life and super experiences and a course in miracles and all sorts of stuff like that. So give your testimony. You certainly ought to be in a place where you have a testimony to give. But it may be that, as a matter of fact, that isn't enough. The second thing is to talk about Jesus Christ from a worldview perspective. and what I mean by that is simply to say this that Jesus Christ fits to talk about the whole gospel of God becoming a man the God of love creating us creatures who need love and then God himself coming to us in Jesus Christ and filling that need there's something about it both at an intellectual and at a spiritual level that fits and so one way of approaching the whole issue of whether or not Jesus Christ is Lord is to talk about that doesn't this make sense to you? just tell the gospel story not your own testimony you can do that but this is talking about how Jesus Christ makes sense out of the world if God is like this then doesn't that fill the need in your heart and doesn't that make sense out of reality? so that's one way a second way of witnessing to the reality of Jesus Christ but a third way is this and this is what I want to spend a little more time sharing and that is the place of historical thinking about this, historical thinking. In the end, whether Jesus Christ is the Son of God or not, at least for many people, whether you believe that Jesus Christ was the Son of God, as the New Testament says, or whether you believe he was something else, stands or falls to some degree on the historical evidence. It stands or falls on the historical evidence. It's kind of like the situation the president's in right now. You just got to kind of hold your breath until the facts come out. And the facts are, you know, did the speech last night make them? Was it enough? Are the people going to buy it? Well, it all hangs upon what's going to happen in that courtroom when the facts come out. Will it be enough or whatever? And boy, am I tiptoeing easily here. But this is how it is with regard to any truth claim. When we say that Jesus Christ was the Son of God, we're making a truth claim about history. It's essentially no different than saying there once was a guy named Napoleon, or Julius Caesar was here, or Plato lived in the 5th century BC. We're making historical statements. And so we need to, in this culture that increasingly is unfamiliar with the Christian truth claims, we need to be able to give a reason for the hope that is within us. And I'm going to give you a real brief outline here of what some of those reasons are. If it was not for the material I'm going to give you now, I don't think I'd be a Christian. I don't think I, now that I've had so much experience with the Lord and stuff, I don't know how I could not be one. But on the other hand, I know that it was this sort of thinking that really persuaded me that this thing is true. God doesn't ask us ever to sacrifice our brains. He wouldn't have given us brains if he wanted us just to sacrifice them. There are times for sure when we have to accept mystery. But I don't believe that the Lord ever wants us just to insist that people believe blindly. Well, you just have to take it on faith. There's a point where you come to that, but first we have to give them all the reasons that they might have for believing that what we're saying is true. Okay, let me run through a couple of alternatives here that I'm sure many of you have at least confronted. One of the older views that people used to have about Jesus Christ was that he was just a good moral teacher. Hardly anyone today, least of all scholars, believe that there never was a Jesus. Of course there was a Jesus. But the question is, who is Jesus? And one of the common themes you get among people is to say, well, yeah, I think it's sort of Gandhi's approach to Jesus. Yes, he's right up there with Buddha. He's a great moral teacher. His wisdom is astounding, and his insights into living is spectacular. And, you know, I like the guy a lot. He's a good moral teacher. Now, what do you say to somebody who has that perspective? Three things. Number one, if you believe the historical records enough to believe that he was a good moral teacher, you have to accept those same historical records which have him saying things which good moral teachers don't go around saying. Like, if you see me, you see the Father, John 14. honor me even as you honor the father uh john chapter 5 verse 23 i believe it is honor me even what would you think of me if i come up to you and i said hey you guys i want a little respect some r-e-s-p-e-c-t you know dave johnson's gotten to you i want some respect why don't you just think about me the way you'd think of god okay uh honor me the way you'd honor god that's all is that too much what's you you'd you'd want to then you would be saying the guy needs his medication. So the thing is, is Jesus goes around saying, I'm the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father but through me. What kind of a good moral teacher says that? He says, I've come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me. What kind of a good moral teacher does that? I and the Father are one. Not the stuff that Jewish teachers go around saying. If you believe on me, and if you suffer for my sake, great is your reward in heaven. He puts himself in a position that good moral teachers never put themselves in. Jesus Christ doesn't give us the option of just regarding him as a good, nice, rabbinic type of guy. He's either a lunatic or he's out for someone's dollar or maybe he's even telling the truth. Those are your options, but to say, oh, nice, wonderful teacher, that's not an option. A second thing is he goes around doing things that good moral teachers don't do. Everything from multiplying loaves and fishes and healing the blind, healing the dame, the dame, the maim, the raising the dead, yes, many things he did. Exercising demons. Okay, as a central part of his ministry, he was doing miraculous deeds. While he's making these divine claims, it's easy to write somebody off as a lunatic if all they're doing is growing around on the street corner saying, I'm God, I'm God, I'm God. But if they start healing people like that and doing these miraculous deeds and then someone kills them and then they rise from the dead and you've actually got some good reasons to think that that's true, you might want to start paying attention to the guy. What happened once in history? And so as I said in the third point, he rose from the dead. He made divine claims for himself, he did divine deeds, and he rose from the dead. The bottom line then is that the option of being a good moral teacher just isn't there. He is in your face. He forces the issue. He doesn't leave you an easy out. You either have to mock him as a lunatic, hate him as a charlatan, or worship him as the Lord of your life. But don't insult your own misinformation by thinking that you can call him a good moral teacher. It just doesn't work. It's like saying that the President of the United States is your favorite pet or something. You're confusing categories. Okay, that analogy didn't work. But, you know, that's not an option. Whatever. Actually, I don't know where that analogy was coming from. Forget it. Delete that. You're confusing categories. He's either the Lord or he's either more than human or he's less than human, but he's not just a good human. All right. Second, here's a big one today. Was he a fully actualized person who was manifesting his inner divinity? Oh my gosh, I've got to really hurry here. Okay, this is a really big one. Yes, I believe he was God, and aren't we all? It's kind of a thing that permeates the age. He surely was the most actualized, this is a quote now, Jesus was the most fully actualized human being on the planet. And this is big, so now you can say, why accept all those things? He is divine. I'd even go so hard as to claim him Lord, and I want to be just like him. And how do you respond to that? Let me say a couple of things. Number one, first of all, Jesus rises from the dead. That's unique. He wasn't trying to be the best that we all can be. There's something unique going on here, as is confirmed by his resurrection from the dead. There's been a lot of sort of actualized people throughout history, but only one of them has a tomb that is now empty. Second, the thinking that Jesus could have possibly have been going around talking about a potential that is within us all is so utterly foreign to Jewish categories, I can't express it. In Eastern culture, people can go around claiming God and they fit right in. And increasingly now, in our culture, people can go around claiming God and they can fit right in. But in Jewish culture, certainly Jewish culture in the first century, if you go around claiming to get God, people stone you. That is blasphemy, which is one of the reasons why Jesus Christ ends up getting killed. That interpretation of who Jesus was is completely, utterly, totally, unequivocally, and unambiguously wrong. It's non-contextual. Jesus in the first century could not have meant something like that. But the third point, in some ways the most important point, is that Jesus, he didn't just go around saying he was divine. He goes around and claims that not only is he divine, but he's the only way to be related to the divine. He's the only way to be related to God. I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man goes to the Father except through me. You may have a lot of people in this culture going around saying, I am God, I am God. but they stand radically distinct from Jesus, who claimed to be the only way to get to God. His claim, in other words, is exclusivistic. He doesn't allow himself to be put into any larger category. Say, the category of all people who are God. No, he's one of a kind. Jesus Christ is one of a kind. Whatever else you think about him, if you think he's just one of the great gurus in world history who fully actualized himself, you haven't taken seriously the evidence that is there. Those are two responses to two of the primary ways that people in our culture try to skirt the Christian truth claim. Okay, let me do a quick analysis of this. People in our culture, and this is a reasonable question, often ask, why believe the gospel accounts? why do you wager your entire existence on what these four authors 2,000 years ago said about a man named Jesus why trust them excuse me at this point you can't just say one little tip here is that if you're going to do any public speaking do not go to Taco Bell 10 minutes beforehand this microphone is melting and I'm like help me, help me I'm suffocating anyways so you can't at this point say God said it, I believe it that settles it for me you can't do that because the question is why think that they're inspired now here's a way of responding to this at this point you can't invoke the inspiration of the Bible you need to talk history Let me give you two sets of argumentation here, two possible responses. First, a preliminary word. The study of history. Here's what we do when we do all history. This is a very general analogy, but here in essence is what historians do when they think about history. History is a matter of postulating a fire, that is a person or an event, to explain some smoke. That is to say, a particular artifact or writing. In other words, nobody sees history happening. If you saw history happening, it wouldn't be history yet, would it? It would be the present. We don't see the event, and we don't know the person. That's the fire. What we do see is there's smoke. That's the writings about them, artifacts concerning them, historical documentation. What historians try to do is we try to postulate what must this event have been like to account for this writing, for this testimony or whatever? What must this person have been like to make this kind of impact? Given this smoke, what kind of fire must there be? If there's a lot of smoke, you've got to suppose a big fire. If there's a little trickle of smoke, you suppose a little fire. But that's basically what historians are doing. We're trying to understand what fire accounts for this smoke. Now, let's apply this to Christianity. the question to ask is what fire explains the smoke of early Christianity what must be true for us or anybody to make sense of the early church this is the question that we're dealing with consider this the disciples whatever else you're going to say about them they sincerely believe what they're saying you can't by any stretch of the imagination suppose that they had ulterior motives for what they were saying. If they were going to be driving around in a Rolls Royce and wear Rolex watches and be famous and people eulogize them and appear on TV and whatever, maybe you'd think, well, they got together and created a conspiracy in order to gain riches or in order to gain fame. They didn't do that, however. That didn't happen to them. They don't have an ulterior motive for saying what they say. They believe, and they're saying this now within a very short period of time of the person that we're talking about. Jesus Christ died around 33 AD. Right around 33 AD, we find the gospel authors preaching this. They believe that Jesus Christ made divine claims for himself. That's the smoke. That's the writings. They believe sincerely that Jesus Christ made divine claims for himself. If you think that Jesus didn't make divine claims, what's your explanation for their belief that he did? They believe that Jesus Christ did some astounding miracles. And they're sincere about this. They're willing to die for this. In fact, most of them do under the persecution of Nero. If you don't think that Jesus Christ really went around doing miracles, then what's your explanation for them thinking that he did do it? Jesus Christ, they say, they sincerely believe that the tomb was empty. and that they saw him appear in many different circumstances for 40 days after that. They spoke with him. They ate with him and all sorts of different stuff. If, in fact, that isn't true, they didn't find the tomb empty and they didn't see Jesus Christ appear to them, what is your explanation for what they did see? Because they are sincere about that. In other words, here's two alternatives. The smoke is their faith that Jesus Christ made divine claims, their faith that he did miracles, their faith that he rose from the dead. If their faith is, if the fire that explains their faith is not what they think it is, what do you think it is? Think about it. If you deny that what they're saying is the reason for their belief is not true, if you're denying that it's true, then give me an alternative. Give me an alternative. That is, if we're doing responsible historical thinking, it is incumbent upon you if you reject the explanation that the participants in the event give, you must come up with an alternative, and I submit to you that there is no good alternative. Not only that, but they preach this gospel to a hostile audience. It's not like this is an easy sell in the first century by any means. People don't like this, especially the Jews and the higher-ups in the Jewish religion don't like this. If they could have refuted it, they would have refuted it, but they didn't refute it. If the reason for that is not that the story was simply irrefutable because it was true, then what is your explanation? If the smoke is that it wasn't refuted, what is the fire that explains that? People need to wrestle with that question. In the Mishnah and the Talmud, the Jewish writings that were mainly commentaries on the Old Testament, they never deny that Jesus did miracles. No one says that. They never claimed the disciples made the story up. What they claim is that he was a charlatan who was inspired by the devil. That's at least consistent. But you have to come up with some explanation. Finally, their message is consistent. These people go out. They preach this gospel. There's a number of them. Their message is consistent. It's not identical. You read the gospels, and they all have a different spin on things. It's not identical, but it is consistent. one way that I know of to explain that is that in fact they're telling the same story they were there and as individuals they all give it a unique twist they all see it a slightly different way but since they're all witnessing the same person who's making the same claims who's making the same who's doing the same miraculous deeds of course their story is consistent whenever you're talking about truth when different people are talking about truth there will be some minor disagreements perhaps, but the basic storyline is going to be consistent. When people lie, if they had a motive to lie, which they don't, but if they did have a motive to lie, you surely would have had a different Jesus being preached by each one of them. But that's not what you have. You have a real commonality. This testifies strongly to the truth of what they're saying. But that's not all. Do we have any other reasons? And I encourage you to get these down or memorize them somehow or take notes or get the tape or get my overheads. But this is good material to know on the top of your head if you possibly can. Why trust the gospel accounts? I've given you some historical reasons for thinking that their message was true. But we have a lot of reasons, only a few of which I can mention right now. We have a lot of reasons for just treating the writings themselves as inherently trustworthy. The bottom line is that they pass standard historiographical criteria. What I mean by that is this. If I'm an historian and I look at the donation of Pepin or I look at some other legal document or some supposed eyewitness to Julius Caesar or whatever, I will ask this, I will come up with certain criteria to evaluate whether or not I should trust this document as a reliable document. This is what historians do all the time. How much credibility should we give to the document in question? I think it's a fair question. I think it's even a necessary question that we ask that question of the Gospels. What reason do we have to trust them? If I'm going to wager my whole life on them, then I need to look at what reasons I would have for believing them and what reasons I would have for not believing them. Now, the reasons I just gave you about that smoke and fire, that's already a lot of reasons. If I'm not going to trust the gospel documents, I have to come up with an alternative explanation, which is very hard to do. Well, I was going to go down a road that I decided to go on. Okay, here's a couple of criteria, and then we're going to open it up for questions. Cooperating evidence. I'll just say this as a blanket thing. The gospel authors all corroborate each other. They confirm each other because they give independent witness to what each other is saying. But there's also testimony that to some degree confirms the gospel authors outside of the New Testament. I can't go into it now, but you can find in the writings of Josephus, Tacitus, Suetonius, Pliny, and others, references to the early Christian church. And insofar as they make those references, it confirms what the gospel authors say about the matter. Most significantly, there's no evidence outside of the New Testament that disconfirms, or that disproves, the story that they're telling. The Gospels are not sensational or fancy, or fanciful. They don't. When you read the mythology of the ancient world, you even read the mythology of the second, third, and fourth century, you can tell it's mythology. It's wow, bam, zoom, zow, you know, all sorts of mythological stuff. Jesus getting mad at some people and turning them into stone and making clay pigeons and turning them into real life. All sorts of stories about Jesus that are just mythological and fanciful. A cross coming out of the tomb that's 900 feet tall or goes up to the sky. You know, now there are miracles in the New Testament. But what's amazing is that those miracles are recorded in a very sober fashion. No one's trying to make it bigger. It's just there. So C.S. Lewis said this in a famous quote of his. He says, I've spent my entire life studying mythology. Whatever else the Gospels are, they are not mythology. He's a professor at Oxford, a specialist in mythology. Third point is that they contain vivid detail in them. A famous Homer scholar, he recognizes the foremost Homer scholar of the century, Wolfgang Schadenwoldt, he says this. I quote him in Sinning Sager, Son of God. He says that he knows of no ancient historical documents that are so full of vivid, realistic details as the Gospels. They just give the impression, the ring of truth, of having been written by eyewitnesses. They include detail that someone who is fabricating an account, if they had a motive, but they don't, but if they were fabricating the account, they would not include this sort of detail. What's most impressive here is that much of this detail is counterproductive to the cause they're making with their writing. For example, the Gospels all portray the disciples as being very dull, kind of nitwitty. You wouldn't expect the disciples, and frankly, they are. They're like, call down thunder from heaven, Jesus, let's silt them all. And they don't get it. They're all dull. But surely these disciples would have no motive for portraying the matter like that unless it really was like that. It shows that their motive is to tell the truth. If you look at all the art of the 3rd and 4th and 5th century, the disciples are all bigger than the other people. That was their ancient way of saying, whoa, super person. They started reverencing these disciples. They have halos over their head to show that they're kind of specially holy. The writings of the period, when common people would write stories the heroes. In one story, Peter, in a debate with a magician, flies around Jerusalem in the sky, literally. Now that's what you expect when people are just telling fanciful stories. The gospels are sober, they have a lot of detail, and the detail is not at all flattering to the disciples. That's a piece of evidence that they're telling the truth. Here's another good one. On the tomb, when they discover the tomb empty, who are the first people to find him there? It's the women. They don't find him there. In fact, they find the tomb empty. He's not there. Women in the first century were considered to be incurable liars. A Jewish author writing to a Jewish audience would have absolutely no reason to include them in any account because it's not going to help your account at all unless his interest was simply to tell the truth. This is why Paul, incidentally, being a more stereotypical Jewish man in the first century, he completely leaves out women in 1 Corinthians 15. In his account of all the people who saw Jesus up here, he never mentions the women. Why? Because no one's going to believe women anyways. So he leaves them out. Now, don't get too hard on Paul. He's a first century Jewish male. What's shocking, though, the men are always a little dull, right, women? What's shocking, though, is that the gospel authors have women being the first ones who discover the tomb being empty. One more illustration. Jesus on the cross. Okay, now the gospels are written to try to portray the message that Jesus Christ was the Messiah, the Son of God, God incarnate, here to save the world. What does he do when he's on the cross? He cries out, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me? What possible motive will someone tell me? What possible motive could anyone have had for making up a story where the Messiah you're trying to artificially sell cries out, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me? I'm surprised they didn't just delete that because it didn't fit in with their storyline. But they preserved it there. Their only motive could be that these people want to tell the truth. They tell it like it really is, whether it fits in their storyline or not. Two more things and then we're going to end. Archaeological accuracy, time and time again, time and time again. The Gospels have, as well as the whole Bible, which we're not going to get into tonight, but it has been confirmed archaeologically. Well, you know, the Bible's true. There you go. God said it, I believe it. That settles it for me. My mind's made up. Don't confuse me with the facts. I have a simple faith. But archaeology has repeatedly confirmed the gospel accounts. You know, it wasn't too awfully long ago when, well, it was 50 years or so ago, but they believe, a lot of critical scholars didn't believe there was such a town as Nazareth. Because in all of our archaeological data, No one ever discovered a town named Nazareth. So they thought that the gospel authors made it up. This is one of about a billion examples you could give of this. Now, why some people would make up, think about this now, why would they make up a town when they're writing to people in that vicinity? But it shows you how much prejudice. If I'm trying to tell you a story, I say, yeah, it's right next to Clairport down the road here. Clairport, you know, What planet are you from? But it was surprising because they discovered a number of different lists of the towns in the region, and Nazareth was never on there. So it's like, well, where's this Nazareth that Jesus was supposedly born in? Well, now we have, as of the last 50 years, discovered six different inscriptions, which include the town Nazareth. But it was a very, very small town. It was like probably a town of maybe 50 or 60 people. A real small town, which is why you have, was it Andrew? Or who says it? Can anything good come out of Nazareth? It's like, you small town folk, now you've got the Savior of the world. I don't think so. In Garden City, right now, Jesus Christ is born. It sounds odd. You'd think it'd be some metropolis or something, but no. He always goes to the small. Okay, so the Bible over and over again has been confirmed archaeologically. And finally, oh, well, almost finally, they avoid anachronisms. They avoid anachronisms. Anachronism is where you take something in the present and retroactively put it in the past and don't know that it wasn't there. For example, if I'm telling you about the Second World War and I say, you know, the Americans developed computer warfare way before the Germans, you'll know that I'm being anachronistic because they didn't have computers back then. I think they had one, and it took up about a 10-story building. but computers exist now and if I didn't know any better I would put it in the past whenever people are making up stories they inevitably do that the gospels don't do that at all in fact they give you a lot of evidence that the material they contain is material that comes right out of the time period that they're talking about can't go into that too much finally a lot of the material in the gospels is irrelevant to the later church what I mean by that is this one of the main theories as you get the questions ready we're going to question time in about 30 seconds begin counting now 29, 28 the theory is that these evangelists made up a great deal the vast majority of what goes in the gospels as a way of addressing needs in the church the church of say 80 or 90 AD so this is what we feel that Jesus must have been like and they would have him address the concerns of the church of the time. The trouble with that theory is that a great deal in the Gospels just doesn't fit the later church. A lot of the issues of the later church aren't even addressed in the Gospels. We know from the epistles what some of those issues were. Women in ministry, you know, the role of women in church, speaking in tongues stuff. How about circumcision, eating regulations, the Jewish-Gentile relations? All that stuff Jesus never even addresses. It would have been nice if he would have, because then they could have settled it nice and easy. But he didn't. But if the Gospels were created in that environment to address those needs, he certainly would have. But he didn't. For those reasons, I think we've got a lot of good reasons for believing that. The disciples were... Here's my conclusion. Here's my conclusion. This really is. This is the real conclusion. Here's a reasonable conclusion. A man named Jesus existed, who gave astounding teachings, who made astounding claims for himself, if you see me, you see the Father, who performed astounding miraculous deeds as confirmation of that, and whose tomb was empty and who appeared to various disciples. That is the only fire that sufficiently explains the smoke. Now, do you accept the interpretation that he was the Son of God? That's where faith comes in. If you're not going to say he was the Son of God, then please tell me what planet he came from. But the Bible calls us to make a decision about this. for my two cents I'm willing to wager my eternity I think it's a reasonable wager reason my eternity on the belief that Jesus Christ was who the disciples thought he was and that is the son of God who came and gave his life for my salvation and that by believing in him I can be saved and I can be reconciled to God and I feel that that is the central defining thing in any person's life, which is why part of my life mission is to introduce as many people into that Lord and Savior as I possibly can. That's part of what this whole class is about. Okay, questions from the floor. What do we got here? I got to get new shoelaces because these things are constantly coming undone. I want to thank Open Door for decorating this auditorium so nicely for me. I didn't know that they knew that pink and yellow were my favorite colors, and I'm very touched. The piñata especially is a very nice touch, fitting in with our entire apologetic, smash the skeptic kind of a motif. I don't know what that New Age symbol's about, though. I forget that. Okay, what do you got? Were letters and other historical accounts of Jesus not canonized because of main theme inconsistencies with the final canons? Say that. Sorry, I'm getting there. I was missing this. Were letters and other historical accounts of Jesus not canonized because of main theme inconsistencies with the final canons, why didn't some make it? Okay, I think I got the question. I'm not sure I do, but I think I'll stab at it. Why were some accounts not included in the canon? There's a number of criteria that the early church... How can I make... Succinct here, Greg. Okay. There's a number of criteria that the early church used to decide which books were going to be part of their rule. Now, know this. no one sat around trying to say, gee, let's put together a book called the Bible. The authority of the Gospels and of the Epistles was for the most part there from the beginning. No one thought about drawing up a formal list of books until certain heretics came up with counterfeit lists. And they started saying some books were inspired that weren't. So the church had to say, okay, we've got to decide for sure which ones are in and which ones are not. And there's a number of criteria that I can't go into too much here. One was authorship, one was proximity to Jesus, one was consistency with other things that the church believes and whatnot. But other accounts were dismissed because they didn't fit into those accounts. Now, they didn't fit into those criteria. There were some other gospel accounts that were out there that were written under the pseudonym of an apostle, the Gospel of James and the Gospel of Peter and whatnot. And the church decided those were not genuine Gospels. The church made some very good decisions there. If you ever read these accounts, you will see how obvious that decision is. It wasn't like there were any accounts that were at all credible, but told a slightly different kind of story of Jesus. The ones that were dismissed are the wacko accounts of Peter flying around Jerusalem and Jesus slaying kids that he doesn't like and stuff like that. So that's, I'll have to suffice right now. Okay, we've got a couple questions similar here, and I'm trying to find the other one. It has to do with God, you said God doesn't operate a certain way. Didn't God in the Old Testament destroy whole people groups because of their evil? This seems to contradict your saying God doesn't operate this way. And I've got another question just like that. Okay, so the question is, I'm not sure about God doesn't operate this way, but maybe the person's asking, how are these Old Testament accounts of God destroying people groups consistent with the thing that God is love, and if God's aim is love and he has to require freedom, what happens to the freedom of these people groups? Is that kind of it? I think that's very cool. Can't answer that one. No. That is a tough one. I would just say this. two points. Maybe three, but we'll see. Number one is, in trying to decide who God is and all this kind of stuff, this is an important point, I think, for dialing with people in our culture. It's always important to work from the known to the unknown. This is how all knowledge progresses. You start with what you know, and you go to what you don't know. I've got a lot of good reasons for believing that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that He's the definitive revelation of God, that he reveals God. That's what I know. Now I'm going to work from there to try to understand some other things, okay, that I don't know for sure. Like, why did God slaughter the Canaanites? But that methodological point is very important. Don't start with the problematic, like the Canaanite slaughter, and then try to reinterpret Jesus. You start from the known and go to the unknown. Doing that, I'd have to say this, that God must have had, oh, I bet I know what the other person's asking because I said the statement that God doesn't slaughter people. That's right, I said that about Hitler. God doesn't slaughter people, people who said he created. Good point. That's right, I said God doesn't operate that way. I have to qualify myself. Sometimes God does. Once, he completely destroyed the planet, saved for about eight people. And he's going to do it again. In the end, there's going to, 2 Peter tells us, there's this fire that's going to purge everything. I think it's a metaphor for purging influence that's going to go on throughout the whole world, but it ain't going to be pretty. Okay, so thank you. I have to qualify that. But when God does that, I have to believe, given what I know about God, given what the Bible says about God elsewhere, that the motive behind it isn't a Hitler motive. It's not a motive that is just destruction. God doesn't delight in that. The Bible tells us he doesn't delight in the destruction of the wicked, but sometimes he's got to do it. Sometimes when you have cancer, you've got to take out the whole thing, and it's going to leave you maimed. As God looked at all of world history, and I don't know the particulars of this, but as God looked at the whole world history, picture all of world history as a human being. There were a few foundational cancer points there that would have prevented his overall plan for world history from ever happening. One of them was the Canaanites. This was a barbaric people who occupied a certain point of land. They were, one of the ways, we don't know whether it was for punishment or for entertainment, but we do know that they would tie pregnant women's legs together while they were in birth and have them die that way, which I'm told is the most excruciating, prolonged kind of death a person could ever experience. And we have some evidence to suggest that they did that. They were just a barbaric people. And God's long-term vision about where he wants to go with this whole thing, this was a necessary evil that had to happen. It had to be exterminated. And so, yeah, I have to qualify my point earlier about God never operating that way. But he never operates that way for the reasons that free agents do, for the reasons that Hitler does. Thank you for bringing that up. Does argument... Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
