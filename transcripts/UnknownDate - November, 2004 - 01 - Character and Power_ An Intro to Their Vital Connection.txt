Thank you, Keith, and good morning to all of you. Keith was referring to the fact that I had asked, if you weren't here yesterday, referring that I had asked you to experiment with Colossians 3, 1 through 17 by having two or three times through the day, just sit down in a quiet place and meditatively read it. And if you feel that you're ready for it, begin to memorize it. Because as you do that, the Word of God, you see, actually is a substance. It is a spiritual substance. And I perhaps don't need to add to this group that it is the spiritual substance that underlies everything else. And when you take it in, in passage lengths, isolated verses are not as powerful as passages. So if you take Colossians 3, 1 through 17, for example, and just live with it, turn it over, and what you'll find is that you have to re-memorize it. And that's good, because every time you re-memorize it, you're going to see things and find things in it that you've never seen before. And as you do that, it'll gradually become something that is literally in your body. And you will be able to view it and say it as you turn it over without effort. And that's where you want to be. Now, that's what Joshua 1.8 is about, which we talked about yesterday. The word meditate, you shall meditate therein day and night, is really mutter. See, it gets in your body. That's the secret of the Russian and Greek Orthodox practice of breath praying. And I remember as a know-it-all Baptist, I thought, my, that looks so legalistic and mechanical. Because they talk about, you know, they have a little prayer, Jesus, Son of God, have mercy on me. They teach themselves to pray it with every breath. And finally, just to get it where it cycles through their consciousness. And it's a response to Paul's admonition, pray without ceasing. And it really is an interesting project. And actually that's what kind of turned me around on it was, I said, well, you know, how would you do that if you weren't going to do it their way? And actually there are some interesting things you can learn about that, and maybe we'll have time to talk about it as we go along through the sessions. But see, they knew how the body had to be involved in the spiritual life. And I would say the number one problem for folks such as you and I coming to the Gospels and looking at the life that is in the New Testament and saying, how can that be ours? It has to do with the body and with feelings. That those are the two things that tend to, in one way or another, defeat our access to the easy yoke of Jesus in which you take on his character and begin to walk in his power. And so we really need to take a passage like that or, you know, others. Romans 8 is wonderful. Or just simple things like the 23rd Psalm and just let that dwell in us. See, now, if you read Colossians, you'll see that one of the teachings there is, let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom. And it actually gives a little bodily stuff there. Teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. See, that's bodily behavior in the community. And if you are going to form kingdom community, you have to approach it in terms of bodily behavior. The second session this afternoon, I want to talk more about that, because I want to concentrate on the body and on social relations in the process of spiritual transformation. So, if you're coming in now for the first time, try to find a few spots through the day where you might just find a corner, lots of empty seats around here, where you could just go sit back here and let your mind go into Colossians 3, 1 through 17. Now, if you're looking at a schedule, you probably see that the topic for today is character and power, an introduction to their vital connection. And actually, I'm going to talk about that eventually. but it can't be too long too eventually or i'll miss it but you know there are just a few things hanging over here one is this a couple of people have written down questions and handed them to someone and they've given to me i'm glad to have those i think that's a good way of doing it i encourage you to do it now this afternoon i'm i'm going to spend at least a half an hour trying to respond to questions, the ones that have been handed up and the ones you want to raise in the meeting. So don't be discouraged if you handed those up, and I'm not going to talk about them right now. I just want you to know I have them, and I'm going to try to respond to them at the end of the second session this afternoon. Now, just a brief review, brief review. The kingdom of God is what? The range of God's effective will. That's the kingdom of God. It's God reigning, R-E-I-G-N-I-N-G, reigning. The kingdom of God is where what God wants done is done. And your kingdom is where? Where you reign. It's the range of your effective will. And you have a kingdom, and that's essential to you being a person. And people will take your personhood away when they deprive you of your say, your legitimate say, over, for example, your body and your mind. One of the worst things that we've learned in the 20th century was brainwashing. And brainwashing is where you take away the person's capacity to express judgments that are their own. You know, you remember all the cases of getting captured soldiers to say things that they didn't believe, but they didn't know they didn't believe them. That's brainwashing. And if you're in politics, you don't want to say you were brainwashed. You remember what happened of George Romney. Anyone here remember George Romney? Yeah. Well, see, George just disappeared because he said something that was a little off, and he said, well, you know, my staff brainwashed me. That was the end of George Romney. No one wanted him to be president, and he was a fine-looking guy. but he just disappeared now why? because that statement goes right to the heart of what God made us to be as creative will for good it takes away the creativity and says you belong to somebody else and when we think of things like slavery and all the kinds of discrimination that we have to deal with. And I, you know, sometimes we get tired of hearing about that, but really discrimination is just the failure to love your neighbor as yourself. That's what that is. And so when we're talking about that as Christians, we're not talking about some political issue. We're talking about something much deeper. And that doesn't solve all the problems to recognize it, but if we don't recognize it for what it is, then we can find a way of dealing with it which is successful and gets to the root of the problem and doesn't just work on the symptoms. So there's God's kingdom. Now secondly, God's kingdom is spiritual, and you're spiritual. You have a body, but you're not a body. Your body is essential to you. You will always be, I will always be the son of Albert and Mamie Willard. Ten million years into eternity, I will still be that. That's my identity. That's how God made us. And we're going to, as Paul says in Philippians, there will come a time when our vile body is replaced and it becomes like his glorious body, but now here's, it'll still be the same body. It will be the same body because it's the body of the same person. So now, you are a spiritual being and the kingdom of God is spiritual reality. And that's the most powerful level of reality. Everything else comes out of that. So Hebrews 11 talks about how the things that we see are made from things which do not appear. And you read that context and it is the Word of God. So God creates by sending His power through His Word out to form all the physical universe. So it isn't a matter of having a little God sort of flying around in a big universe. It's a matter of having a big universe lost in the great God. And now that kingdom of God penetrates everything that you are, except possibly your will. And one of the things that God has ordained is that you would have the capacity to say no to God. And that's your will. And he gave you a body and a physical universe in which for a little while you can stand and say no. And usually the form the no takes is me. I, where egos I go. I, my kingdom. And that's the way we normally say no to God. and that seeps into our collective existence as communities, seeps into our body, permeates our mind, and the whole system begins to fall apart. Corruption, you know, just means falling apart. And it falls apart because it is not subordinated to God's kingdom. The only way our kingdom will work is when it is subordinated to God's kingdom. because that's the only way that we can have the direction and power to integrate all of those dimensions that I put up and we're going to put them up and talk more about them today. The will, the mind with its thoughts and feelings, the body, the social relationships, the soul. That will only come together around God's kingdom. and when it isn't organized around that it falls apart and the main manifestation of that is conflict within the person and between persons and that's where Satan and his kingdom just has a heyday and he doesn't need to do a lot of stuff he just gets us going on the wrong ideas and feelings and he can just sit back and take a nap because we'll take it from there So the Christians in the early years of the movement, when they came into the movement, one of the things they did at baptism was forswear allegiance to the world, the flesh, and the devil. Now flesh is just our natural human powers apart from God, what we can do on our own. And that is in your Colossians 3 passage. That's where mortification comes in. See, after the declaration in the first four verses of who you are, if ye then be risen with Christ and so forth, the next move is mortify. Now, mortify means let it die. Let it die. See, a mortgage, you know what a mortgage is? mortgage? It's a mortgage. That's what it is, mortgage. It's something you kill off by degrees. Right? That's what it is. Study the Word. And now, that's a good word. But mortify. See, we as kingdom people coming together, expressing the kingdom in the form of a church, Every church should have clear teachings about mortification. Now say that again, because you probably haven't heard anyone say that in a while. Every church should have clear teachings about mortification. Passages like Romans 8.13. If you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the flesh, then you really begin to live. Romans 8.13. Look at that and think about it in your studies. It's very instructive because we do mortify by the Spirit. We have an activity here of turning away, of understanding and so on, but it is the spirit with new life that comes in and teaches us how to let the old stuff drop off. So that, for example, if I decide to give up the cultivation of lust, I don't find myself saying, Oh, I'm so deprived. I can't lust. I don't miss it. Why? because the Spirit moves in and gives me something better by way of my relationships. So I don't miss it. See, if you're apart from God and you learn a life apart from Him, written all over it is deprivation. And that just makes you more frenzied in trying to make your kingdom work. And that's what you have to let die. So that much in the way of review now. And the next thing we have to do is finish up what we were trying to talk about last time. Because you remember last time we were talking about how spiritual formation supports and empowers kingdom living. The kingdom living now is living from the kingdom. We're drawing our life from the kingdom. We've been born from above. That's how we got into the kingdom. Born from above. That is the initiative of God through the Word and the Spirit touches you. Now some of you are like me. You were touched way back there when you were young. And you converted and you really came to know the Lord. And something happened in you, you see. And what happened in what you was, you began to experience something coming from the kingdom of God and all of its instrumentalities. See, that begins to come. In my case, instrumentalities were my family and my Sunday school teachers. And I just learned to just love Jesus. And one of my greatest joys was flannel graph. You know, that's wonderful stuff. It's so fuzzy. And it just makes your heart rejoice. And I hope you still use flannel graph. Because it really, it just, it's a part of the way I was drawn to love Jesus. See, those were the instrumentalities of the kingdom. The stories from the gospel that were presented. And those things, and you know, we just want to make sure that those are going out. Especially to our young people, our children. And let's don't get too sophisticated. Let's just keep those simple stories coming. And fill the minds of young people with them. And now we've got a lot of competition from television. I mean, there's just an endless number of them that you get. Nemo. And who's this guy now that's the green sort of funny guy? Shrek. Now I'll tell you, he ain't David. he ain't Joseph he sure ain't Jesus he seems to be a pretty nice guy everything considered you know but when our children's minds are filled with that sort of thing it isn't exactly redemptive and I don't mean to say the kingdom of God couldn't come out through that but there's a lot of other stuff coming So we just need to keep those instrumentalities of the kingdom coming out and touching people and bringing life down there. And then the quickening that begins to come is the foundation of the life spreading out into every part. And you know, as we talk about this stuff here, Todd and I, I do want to emphasize that we're talking about kingdom living for everyone. and if we don't understand that we haven't really got the gospel of Jesus it doesn't matter what your situation is and of course the stories of the gospel are designed precisely to bring that out and if you'll notice the hopelessness talked a little bit about the leper last time and the woman with the issue of blood, the woman at the well. I mean, these are people whose lives had been ruined, sometimes several times over, ruined. And so we want to say that, you know, sometimes I think here I am flying around all over the world, putting me up, people giving me a place to talk and all of that. And I think often one might think, well, you know, that's just for people like Todd Hunter. I never do that. Nobody wants to hear me talk. And so on. It isn't just for preachers. It's for everyone to know the kingdom of God where they are. no matter what has happened to them. And this is the heartbreaking beauty of Jesus and his gospel. As we say, whosoever will may come. That's totally without any qualification no matter what has happened, no matter where you are. If you're some lonely person out there trying to make that Taco Bell work and it isn't working and there's trouble in your family, you've got financial troubles, maybe health troubles, troubles, troubles, troubles, troubles, troubles. That's the place where you get to know the kingdom of God. That's where you reach out to it and begin to make place for it. And it's when we do that that the kingdom begins to move in. You expect it. you wait upon it and then things begin to come together and you begin to see God moving where you are it's in action around you and the thing is no one can prove it to you I can preach to you until you're blue in the face and it will not become real until you begin to venture on it and when you have laid aside all of the guilt and self-condemnation and sense of failure and just begin to venture on it where you are like that little woman with the issue of blood who didn't even want to call attention to themselves but she knew that there was kingdom power in Jesus and she just slips up and touches the hem of his garment that's really where all of us are folks that's where I am that's how I have to live and when we begin to venture on it then we begin to know the reality of it we learn that the people who said things like they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings like eagles how do eagles mount up with wings is that how they do it that's right they let the wind lift them they simply turn their feathers to the air currents that's how we wait on the Lord and we come to know the reality of the kingdom and as we go along in spite of all that may have happened to us we begin to have this sense that God has done well by me can you say that see we need to keep that working God has done well by me. Now for many of us there will be some bad things that have happened. Some things that might seem irrecoverable. You see it's when we affirm the presence of the kingdom and begin to recognize the hand of God in our life perhaps long before we turn to him that we're able to know that kingdom living is for real life. And real life means the life I've got. That's what real life is. It's the one you've got. And when you begin to turn to that, then things begin to change. Now, as we proceed in spiritual formation, and remember now, spiritual formation, or we're talking actually about spiritual transformation in Christ, spiritual formation is the process through which our inner being, including our body, because our body is inner too, begins to take on the character of Jesus. See, the power of the kingdom was in Jesus' body. That's why when that woman touched him, he said, somebody touched me. And they all said, because they didn't know about the innerness of the body. They said, what's the matter with you, Jesus? All kinds of people are touching you. You remember that? And you say, who touched me? They all touched you. No, they didn't all touch you. they didn't all touch him. One person touched him. And the power that was in him, kingdom power that was in him, moved out. And you are given that same opportunity and responsibility. When you begin to change, your body begins to change. and it begins to be a touch point of kingdom reality to everyone around you. So I want to just list a few things. This is the last part of what I was saying last night. When I start out a conference, I always feel like I've just got forever, you know. And then it becomes clear pretty soon that I'd better stick to the script. So I just want to mention a few things here about how spiritual formation advances, empowers, and informs kingdom living. And the first thing is that it progressively harmonizes the self. It progressively harmonizes the self. You know, do you know peace with God is not the same as the peace of God? In Romans 5, being now justified by faith, we have peace with God. And now then, the war breaks out in you. Because after you have peace with God, you discover the reality of inner conflict and how to deal with it. So one of the things that happens, if you go back to those dimensions that I wrote on the board, we'll get back to them after a while, is the peace with God moves to the peace of God. be anxious for nothing that's a big step right there isn't it but in everything with prayer and supplication with thanksgiving make your request known unto God stop trying to make it work on your own and the peace of God that passes understanding will keep, set a guard around your heart and mind in Christ Jesus. That's Philippians 4.6. Philippians 4.6, be anxious for nothing, written by a jailbird. So there was Paul sitting in that prison being anxious for nothing. Because he had come to a place where he wasn't torn by all of the things that used to tear him and conflict him. And so he was quite ready. You see, that's the source out of which later in that same chapter he says, I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. He's referring to living in harmony and peace within himself because the peace of God has come down. Secondly, when we, as we progress, now remember I'm talking to you about how spiritual formation enables, strengthens, empowers kingdom living. And the second thing that I want to mention here is that we live outside of temptation. That is to say, think about it like this. Okay? Here are three stages. One, thought of sin. Now that's not a sin. Thought of sin is not a sin. Secondly, inclination to sin. That's not a sin either. That's what's called temptation. Thirdly, will to sin. That may not produce the action, but it's a condition in which the action would be produced if the circumstances were right. So I often tell my kids in teaching ethics, you know, that a thief is not someone who steals. A thief is someone who would steal if the situation were right. So you have to judge character in terms of what people would do. And that's what Jesus was doing when he said in Matthew 5, you have heard it said, thou shalt not commit adultery, but I say unto you, anyone who looks upon a woman for the purpose of lusting after her. And would you please include that when you read that verse? See, many of the verses, many of the translations, translate a misguided theology and psychology into the verse. and that's where you get people who think that if they have thought of something, killing, sex they have sinned already so Jimmy Carter confesses to Playboy that he also has sinned well I don't know, maybe he did but Jesus wasn't saying if you have the thought now what we want to do here is to if we have the thought go no further don't go to inclination don't indulge it it isn't just sex we get in trouble all kinds of things desire generally is our problem so don't go beyond the thought here's the saying you've all heard of Luther's about you can't you can't keep the birds from flying over your head, but you can keep them from building a nest in your hair. Now, if you just would like to have a nice little birdie hat, then you will let them build a nest in your hair. And that's what Jesus is talking about, where a person actually is welcoming this and cultivating it and fostering it. Right. So now, we live outside of temptation when we learn to stay away from thoughts that could lead to temptation. There's a sign at Heathrow Airport that says, Don't even think about parking here. Have you ever seen that? It's a great statement. don't even think about parking here. So there are a lot of things that we won't even think of. We have that in our language. We say it's unthinkable. And that's where we want to get. We want to get where it's unthinkable. Certain things are unthinkable. Now if you can't do that, at least you can stay out of inclination. Don't linger over it. Move on to what is good and right. That's what you stay out of. When you have progressed in spiritual formation, you stay out of lingering over things in the manner of temptation. And sometimes that will come and you can't help it. You have no control over it. But you want to grow to the point to where. That doesn't come as much as possible as lies within you. You just move on. It might be resentment. It might be envy. It might be a temptation to have contempt for certain kinds of people. We've seen a lot of contempt, haven't we, in the last months? We live in the midst of a politics of contempt now. And the people are unable to treat and speak decently of others who disagree with them because they actually have contempt for them. And see, that's where we need to stop that. Cut it off. And let me just say to you that you can live a life without contempt. And you ought to choose that because when you do that, it'll solve a lot of other problems. For example, it's very hard to be angry with people unless you have contempt for them. And if you have contempt for them, it's very easy to be angry with them. And anger tends to breed contempt, and when it does, then the anger becomes more powerful. Watch people in a family fight and see how quickly it moves to contempt and language that expresses contempt. So we can just stay out of that. We just don't go there. And that progresses as we were talking last night about we're learning how to see when this is coming up. and we just stay out another thing here that's very important to understand is that the Christian life is not just about avoiding sin and when we have progress as we progress in the transformation of the spirit the will, the mind thoughts and feelings and social relationships as we do that we will increasingly simply be focused on the good to be done. And what that actually does is to restore our creative will. Remember I said that God has made you and me as creative will for good. And there's just so much there to do. It isn't just like loving other people. It's loving good things. It's enjoying beauty. In nature. In art, it's producing things that are productive of good. It can be as simple as cooking. See, when you cook, now it's not true of me, but it's probably true of you, that when you cook, you're creative of good. And that's a wonderful thing, to provide food and clothing. The word homemaker has been pushed aside, but one of the most great, wonderful things you can produce is a home. And so we want to understand that as we progress, increasingly we turn to the good. There's a saying of John Wesley's that I wanted to share with you. It was a little saying that he used constantly with his groups and his teaching. Here it is. Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as you ever can. and that's now you don't do that legalistically and that means among other things that one of the things you'll do is to take a good nap naps are good Jesus took naps you'll notice in the scriptures how they had to wake him up if you can't take naps you probably need to practice solitude because often people tell me when I talk about solitude well I'll just go to sleep probably they need to sleep that was Elijah's discipline you remember after he had been engaged in conferences for a while and was worn out and exhausted. He was scared. I mean, he was unnerved by a little woman who said, I'm going to get you, and he ran. And as he ran, he laid down and went to sleep. And an angel woke him up and fed him. And then what did he do? Went to sleep again. Second naps often are very helpful. The first one just warms you up. That's the warm-up nap. No, actually, sometimes you need to do that. You need to concentrate on naps until you wake up and you feel rested. Again, that's the heart of Sabbath. and when we are focused on doing all the good you can by all the means you can in all the ways you can and so forth don't make it a burden make it a joy and that means you have to take care of yourself see that's a part of your kingdom is taking care of yourself now it's true that the best way to love yourself is to love others as Jesus loved you but that will mean among other things that you do take care of yourself and see there's much that you need to do for you that no one else should do you brush your teeth I'll brush mine it works better that way so you have to take care of yourself the part of the good you do is to yourself God intends that God wants you to love yourself He just doesn't want you to get messed up on how you do that and make yourself begin to think that you are the purpose of it all. Well, when you begin to move into spiritual formation in this way, one of the things you see is how it transforms social life, how it transforms church life. So much of our time in church life is spent trying to work around character failure or the possibility of it. Do you know that? It's really true. There's so much that we as leaders and responsible people in churches have to spend time doing that shouldn't even be there. I mean, just suppose the contempt and anger were pulled out of our religious groups. You don't have to worry about someone getting mad. because you know if they do get mad they'll get over it and won't hurt anybody or perhaps you know they've got better things to do than get mad. And so much of our problem in society in general is working around character problems. Now as spiritual transformation progresses you just don't have to do that. And that's a tremendous advantage talking about kingdom congregations and church life, the effect is amazing. It's amazing on missions. Listen to this word from origin, the early Christian. The communities of God to which Christ has become teacher and guide are in comparison with communities of the pagan people among whom they live as strangers like heavenly lights in the world. Like heavenly lights in the world. See, imagine a situation in which the people in the community realize that the most important thing that's happening in that community is in the church. Not in the political arena, not in sports, but in the church. Do you believe that's possible? Yes, that's what Jesus was talking about when he said a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. And it's tragic in the way that has been claimed, that wonderful statement about this by the early writer in America about America being a city set on a hill. And I don't know if you saw the movie Working Girl some years ago, but it has in that this idea that it's talking about New York City and working there, how this kind of the light of the world. No, it isn't the light of the world. The church is the light of the world. Christians are the light of the world. Paul says that, doesn't it? You remember he says, let everything you do be without murmurings and disputings. He talks about how if you do that, you will shine as lights in a darkened world. That's Philippians 2. You shine as lights. So now if you're shining as a light in a darkened world, do you need to have a sign that says, I'm a light? No, you're just shining. You're just shining. And that goes with Frank Laubach's statement. I love the way he puts it. He says, the simple program of Christ for winning the whole world is to make each person he touches magnetic enough with love to draw others. That's his program. So he sent out his people to make disciples, surround them in the Trinitarian reality, and teach them to do everything that he said. See, the Great Commission is Christ's program for moral reformation of the earth. And it's still going. It's the extension of the Abrahamic covenant through the people of Jesus to the world. And that's what we're engaged in. And to be missional is, first of all, just to be the disciple. And if we don't become disciples, then we'll keep thinking about mission as something that, oh, we ought to do that too. See, because if you're not disciple to Jesus, transformation, if it happens, will be irregular and rare. But if the regular program is discipleship to Jesus, then the growth in Christlikeness naturally follows. By grace, of course, but also by action. And one of the deepest things we can understand about this is that grace is not opposed to effort. And many people deep in their heart have heard a teaching, and this goes back to the activity, passivity thing. They have heard a teaching that has rendered them passive. But grace is not opposed to effort. In fact, you never see anyone in making efforts like those who have been touched by grace. These are the ones that really are on fire. Grace is opposed to earning. Earning is an attitude. Effort is action. And what you really believe about Jesus is seen from what you do when you find out you don't have to do anything. and if you really believe in the goodness and greatness of Jesus you will not be one who says well thank you Jesus for a little of your blood and I'll see you later in heaven where I guess I will have to put up with you for eternity we have to really understand that about grace grace is the opportunity to move into this world where our life is genuinely transformed now a few words for the topic of the morning see there is an absolutely vital connection between character and power. You remember the bionic woman, Lindsay Wagner? I remember one scene in there where someone had opened up a brake line and all the Jews had gone out. They were, of course, trying to kill her. They were always trying to kill her. She was such a nice person. I don't know why that was. Killing, you know, we're obsessed with killing. so she was going down this hill and the intent of these villains was that she should have a wreck and die but she figured out that her brakes are out and so she just opened the door and put her nice little left foot with a very nice shoe on it on the road and stopped the car Now you know what would happen if anyone actually did that. They would have, that shoe would go off of that foot like that and they would have one shredded foot and the car would not stop. Power presupposes substance, structure, and subordination. power presupposes those substance structure and subordination the kind of power that would have been required to stop that car there was not the substance structure and subordination there that's why we have to be very careful and understand when we're asking for power we had better be asking for character. And one of my prayers has been that God would never give me more power than I could stand. And in my case, that's probably pretty small. In our scriptures, we have examples of this. Samson is the clearest example of power without character. Samson is the clearest case. This guy was a rascal. That's the kindest words we could use. Now, God called him because he needed someone to do a job. And if you look at the book of Judges generally, what you will see is failure of character under power. That's one of the things that the book of Judges is there to teach us about. Once you get that lesson, then when you go through the kings of Israel and Judea, you're going to find that every one of them failed because of character problems. Sometimes relatively benign, like in Hezekiah's case. But Hezekiah would have been better off to die when God called him home the first time rather than hang around and mess it up. it's very important to understand that you see Samson was called to a job and he systematically turned away from the issues of character that would have enabled him to have performed it and so he wound up as Milton wonderfully says eyeless in Gaza his eyes poked out, tied to a wheel, grinding for the Philistines. Thank God he did wake up, but actually that was a pretty bloody mess that he wound up in, and there was no intent that it would go that way, I'm sure. But still, he did return to to God, and we can be thankful for that. Saul is another illustration. Saul is a man who was from the smallest tribe and not a distinguished family, but he was tall and good-looking, and to appoint a king, God had Samuel anoint him, and Saul had genuine spiritual experiences. but no character. And so the story, when you read the story of Saul, and obviously I can't go through all that here, but just think about the story of Saul. You see other manifestations of this in people like Simon Magnus in the book of Acts who wanted power. and he saw Peter and John exercising the power of the kingdom and he offered them money if they would give that power to him. And of course you remember what they said back to him. These are illustrations. You have to have spiritual substance if you're going to bear the power of the kingdom. Luke 24. Terry in Jerusalem. Maybe we could put Luke 24, 49 up on the screen there to just look at, if that's convenient. Wait in Jerusalem. Why wait? Why wait? What's the deal about the upper room? Well, I'm sure if you've ever spent ten days in a room like that, it'll do something for your character. But it wasn't just the ten days. After Jesus, they had to wait at Jerusalem until they are endued with power from on high. See, they're clothed with power from on high. That's baptism with the Spirit. Wait. why wait why didn't Jesus just give it to them rather than dragging them around the country for two and a half or three years why didn't he just give it to them and the answer is they wouldn't have known what to do with it they hardly knew what to do with it when he started to give it to them but you remember how carefully he taught them and showed them and then he said now go do it And they found they could, and they just came back sailing in the air. Even the demons are subject to us through your name. What did Jesus say? Don't rejoice over that. All right? See, rejoice that you're tied in with me. That's what he was really saying. Just take that as the thing that makes you happy. Do you remember that? See, all these teachings about waiting and tarrying are teachings about growth of character, learning to trust, learning to rely upon God, learning to not take things into our own hands. Listen to this. Though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not love. I am become a gong show. That sounding brass was a gong. Or a little tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, cymbals. Now sit and listen to cymbals as long as you can. It won't be very long. Gongs and cymbals don't tell you anything. They have nothing to say. Paul is saying is, if I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not love, I have nothing to say. I just make a racket. Now you see, you have to think about now listen to how that progresses. Though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge. Whoa, we're not done. What's the next thing it says? Though I have all faith so that I could move mountains and have not love, I am nothing. See how important that is? Because only love can provide the substance, the structure, and the subordination to bear power. And it is the personality that is permeated with love that then can go on and say, love suffers long and is kind. Well, for many of us, we're off at that point. Love suffers long and is kind. I often ask people, if I could give them a pill that would remove their capacity to be unkind, would they take it? And there's a lot of hesitation. Because, you know, if you're running your kingdom, you're apt to say, well, you know, the occasion might arise where I would need to be unkind. And suppose I got in that position and I couldn't be unkind. What would I do? Do you get the picture? See? Love suffers long and is kind. Love does not envy. Does not exalt itself. Is not puffed up. Does not behave like a jerk. That's my translation of doth not behave itself unseemly. It doesn't behave like a jerk. Seeketh not its own. It's not easily provoked. Now, do you think a person like that would be safe with power? Are you thinking with me now? Do you see what that's about? A person like that would be safe with power. Again, you don't want to get legalistic about it because these are not little things that, well, now let's see, I must not envy. No, the not envying comes out of the deeper reality of love in the soul. Okay, I've got to quit, so let me just say this to you. God's intention for each of us is that we should grow. I'll say this again. that we should grow to the point where he can empower us to do what we want. I'm going to say it again. Put up with me now. Love suffers long and is kind. God's intent for each of us is that we should grow to the point where he can trust us with the power to do what we want. And I did not make a mistake with the last pronoun. Of course He wants us to do what He would want, but He wants us to want it. And to want it in the sense of it permeating our character and giving us the structure where if He gave us the power to shoot Jupiter into outer space, it would be perfectly safe in our hands. Hmm? Does this make any sense? See, this is why spiritual formation is so vital to this whole project of kingdom living. Well, thank you very much, and we'll see you later. applause
