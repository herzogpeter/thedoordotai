Father, into all of the ways that we, The sons of Adam have diminished and damaged and sometimes discarded the daughters of Eve. And into all the ways the daughters of Eve have diminished and damaged and in some ways discarded the sons of Adam, we ask for your healing to come, your deliverance to come, for a spirit of repentance to come into all of these things. And may the power of your spirit in those things be activated as we move into the word this morning that's about these things. I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, the assumption that I've been living with, along with Steve, over the last three weeks is we've been doing this kind of mini-series that we found ourselves in dealing with deliverance and spiritual warfare, talking about the Red Sea and the Jordan River, was that this three-week thing was a detour of sorts, an important one, to be sure, but a diversion nonetheless, separate and distinct from the work that we've been doing in the book of Colossians, particularly separate and distinct from the work that Steve and Jen had begun a few weeks previous in Colossians 3, verses 18 to 21, where the Apostle Paul in that text, had begun to talk about issues related to women and men, submission and love, marriage and family, parents and children, and to do it in a way, did Paul, that is often kind of thorny. The language he uses is even a little divisive at times if misunderstood, telling wives to submit and husbands to love, which apparently means, if you're not thinking very deeply about it, and some people kind of do interpret it this way, that husbands don't need to be subject. They just need to love. And wives don't need to love. They just need to be subject. And children, obey your parents. And parents, don't frustrate your kids. Colossians 3, 18 to 21. So when we started talking a few weeks ago about the Red Sea and the Jordan River, about deliverance and spiritual warfare, it seemed like a detour from all that, not connected at all to issues related to women and men, submission and love, marriage and family, parents, and children. But funny thing happened on the way to the Red Sea and the Jordan River. And if you were here, you kind of know, I think, what happened because among other things, what happened was that ministry happened at levels that you don't always see, even in our church. And I think ministry times are significant here all the time, but at a pretty significant level for three weeks in a row, indeed two weeks ago, quite a few of you came back on a Monday night for prayer and for ministry, for healing and deliverance. And it was this growing sense among our elders, our intercessors, our prayer team people, that something's going on right now that we need to pay attention to, like Moses and the burning bush. You can't make the bush start burning, but when it starts to burn, it's very important that you turn aside, that you pay attention, that you wonder what this means. So we started asking these questions. The elders did. I remember at meetings and getting emails from the intercessors, even asking them, what are you seeing and what are you hearing? What are we sensing as people are coming for prayer? Are there any patterns, recurring themes or issues that people seem to be coming for that might give us a clue as to what God is doing in this season right now so we can really partner with what he's doing? Well, while there were many things that we noticed, the pattern most obvious was this, that many, if not most of you, were coming for prayer and looking for deliverance in arenas of life that were inextricably linked to issues related to women and men, submission and love, marriage and family, parents and children. Indeed, issues that for some of you have been hanging around and haunting you for a very long time. indeed for generations, some of you, and now you wanted to be free. You were willing, in the language of last week's Jordan River Crossing, you were willing to step into the deep water of a risky obedience, believing that God would make a way and break generational patterns and set you free and call you into a good and spacious land, a new kind of living and a new kind of life. And all of that is why today, as we return today to the themes introduced to us in Colossians 3, verses 18 to 21, we do it with the awareness that we're still talking today about deliverance and spiritual warfare and the need that we have both individually and corporately to be free from some things, to step into some things, particularly things related to women and men, submission and love, Marriage and family, parents and children that might speak to healing and freedom and a stepping into wholeness and fullness, being fully alive, but to actually experience this wholeness and freedom. There's some rivers to cross, some Jordans to step into, some deep water to enter, some fear to face, some repentance to embrace. But as we do that, and as I kind of invite you into those kinds of things, facing our fear, being open to repentance, I want you to know also this. And I find this comforting because we're all in this story together, that as we return to the book of Colossians, you need to understand that the Colossians themselves, to whom Paul was writing these words about women and men, about submission and love, had to do all of that too. Indeed, and this is a very important thing to know relative to the context of Colossians, that the book of Colossians was written to a people who were living in a culture where the relationships, particularly between women and men, were horribly disordered and intensely painful for women and for men. But in that culture, particularly painful was it for women. And the story I want to tell you to illustrate all of that and kind of help us get into the instruction that Paul is giving in Colossians 3 and the parallel passage that Steve kind of introduced us to in Ephesians 5. It is not from the Apostle Paul. The story I want to tell you is actually involving Jesus himself, who in Matthew 19 runs right into this disorderedness between women and men because it wasn't hard to find this disorderedness. It was everywhere you looked in Jesus' day, in Paul's day as well. So what I want you to do today is open your Bibles actually to Matthew chapter 19 if you have them. If you don't, you can do your iPod. What are the things they can turn on to? Their phones, their blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So all the things that Steve tells you to do. Or you can just watch the screen, which is what I would do. And as you do, let me set the scene for you in terms of what is going on in Matthew 19. The Pharisees had just come to Jesus doing what they often did, because what they were often doing when they were interacting with Jesus was attempting to discredit him in some way, to publicly embarrass him in some way. So they came to him in Matthew 19, verse 3, testing him, it says. And the test was in the form of a question, a question that on the surface seemed innocuous enough if they were really wanting to know the answer. but they weren't asking a question because they wanted to know the answer. They were seeking to test him, to trick him, to embarrass and expose him in some way. And the question was this, Matthew 19, verse 3. Is it lawful for a man, they asked, to divorce his wife for any cause at all? Jesus' answer in verse 4 is effectively no, but he starts by saying this, and he says this with no small amount of sarcasm. Have you not read? Stop right there. What he's speaking of there relative to what they've read or not read is the scriptures. And the Pharisees to whom he's speaking read the scriptures all the time. They were experts in the law. So he's poking at them and ripping them, saying in effect this. Maybe, have you not read? Maybe you missed this one, but it's kind of hard to miss actually, because what I'm about to quote for you is right in the beginning, and Jesus is going to quote Genesis chapter 1, pretty early in the story, verse 27, when he says, Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them both male and female, and said that for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh? Consequently, they are no longer two, but one flesh. And what therefore God has joined together, let no man separate. they followed with another question. Then why, they asked, did Moses command us to give her a certificate and divorce her? They kind of thought they had Jesus here. If that's the way it is, then why did Moses command a certificate of divorce? Which again is a question that's not coming from a curious place. It's coming from a place designed to test him and to expose him by pitting him here against Moses. If Moses commanded and you disagree, then you're in trouble. If you disagree publicly with Moses, you're done as a rabbi. That's what's behind the question. It brings to this story, in addition to the tension that it reveals between women and men, submission and love, it brings tension and dramatic tension to the story because there's a whole lot at stake in this scene relative to how Jesus answers. Now, the answer that Jesus is about to give in the verses that follow has a story behind it, and it's a story that I want to tell you. But because I know this story, I hear this answer, particularly the tone of Jesus' answer, to be filled not with sarcasm, which is kind of what I saw when he said, have you not read? Of course they had read. He was being very sarcastic here, but in the answer he's about to give, The tone of his answer I hear, not filled with sarcasm or anger, not filled with defensiveness or even a need to win the argument with the Pharisees, but with what I would describe as a great sadness, as a deep grief. As he says, in effect, you're right, you guys. Moses did, in fact, instruct you to give a certificate of divorce to your wives, but he didn't command it, he permitted it. He says in verse 8, and the reason he permitted it is because your hearts were hard. And that's when I hear this great sadness in his voice because he knows how far they have fallen, because he knows how much they have lost. Even in their petty squabbling, they have no idea how much they've lost. He knows. And then he says finally this at the end of verse 8, But from the beginning, it has not been this way. And in those words, but more in what I kind of discern as his tone, you can almost feel his longing for home, his aching for Eden. So let me tell you the story. Kind of give you the history as to what's going on inside this interaction between Jesus and the Pharisees, what's really behind their question here. Because when they ask Jesus, is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause at all? The prevailing issue or the prevailing view of the day in Jesus' day and in Paul's day was that it was permissible, lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause was that you could divorce your wife for any cause at all. Indeed, that view was born of a rabbinic interpretation of Deuteronomy 24. Deuteronomy 24 talks about being able to put your wife aside for some indecency. And so the rabbis did what they always do when they come around the scriptures. They want to interpret what that means, how that needs to be lived out, this putting your wife aside for some indecency. And the rabbi Hillel was a very powerful rabbi in Jesus' day, defined indecency as anything that makes her appear unclean in your sights, which could, and eventually did, mean anything. From burning the bagels, to too much salt in the food, to spinning in the streets such that people could see your knees, to letting down your hair, or speaking to a man in public who wasn't your husband. If she's infertile or doesn't produce a son, she is unclean. She is indecent. Indeed, to be unclean in your sight could simply mean that you saw someone prettier than your wife, making your wife appear indecent in your eyes by comparison. So we've got some history here behind this question, and what the history reveals among other things is this, That in what could maybe be looking on one level, like this innocuous little debate between the Pharisees and Jesus, what we see here is that what Jesus is up against in this interaction with the Pharisees is not just a defiled and diminished view of marriage, where you could divorce your wife for any cause, but it reveals a defiled and diminished view of women. Indeed, it was the hatred of the feminine, the word that many of you are familiar with, many of you may not be relative to the hatred of the feminine is the word misogyny, such that treating, who Joel referred to in the song he sang, the daughters of Eve, such that treating the daughters of Eve in Jesus' day and Paul's with anger, contempt, and lust, that is, to use them as you would use something and then discard it when you're done, was just fine. Indeed, Moses commanded it, they seemed to think. So we're just doing what we're told when we use and discard the daughter's veve. So it's not a pretty picture. Indeed, in Jesus' day, as well as Paul's, women were at best subservient, at worst inferior. A common prayer of a Jewish man in Jesus in Paul's day was this. I thank you, God, that I'm not a Gentile. I thank you, God, I'm not an ignorant man, and I thank you, God, that I'm not a woman. In a Jewish home, the birth of a baby boy was met with joy. The birth of a baby girl was met often with disappointment, sometimes even with grief, which is still true in certain parts of the world, and we find it appalling as we should. Men in Jesus' day and Paul's, and this kind of creates some context for our understanding of what Paul and Jesus say in these various teachings on marriage and divorce, could have men in Jesus' day, Paul says as well, could have more than one wife and could easily divorce. Both were illegal for women, which puts a fascinating, though disturbing spin on divorce in Jesus' day and the question that the Pharisees are asking. Because when a man in Jesus' day would divorce his wife for whatever cause, it was tantrums tantamount in many cases to a death sentence for her. And indeed, and I don't have time to get into this real deeply, the real reason that Moses did permit certificates that you have to, I command you even, to give a certificate to your wife was actually to protect the wife from men who were discarding their wives for any cause at all. At least, says Moses, give her a certificate that would certify that she didn't just wander off, that she was pushed out. How horrible is this? That's why Moses commanded, permitted a certificate. It wasn't to give you license. It was to protect your wives from you, and everything was unraveling. Moses didn't know what else to do. Dallas Willard, in his book, Divine Conspiracy, describes what I'm trying to describe and explains it this way, that in the Jewish society of Jesus and Paul's day, and for most times and places in human history, which is actually quite sad when you think about it, the consequences of divorce were devastating for women. Except for some highly unlikely circumstances, her life was simply ruined. No harm would be done to the man, except for, from time to time, a small financial loss and perhaps a bitter relationship with the ex-wife's family. For the women, however, there were only three realistic possibilities in Jesus' day or Paul's as well. Number one, she might find a place in the home of some generous relative, but usually on grudging terms and probably live there as little more than a servant. The second option she would have would be to maybe find another man to marry her, which is often very unlikely. And even if he would marry her, she would come to him as damaged goods and everyone would view her, including her husband, that way. third possibility was this. She might finally make a place in the community as a prostitute because she wanted to, but because it was the only way to survive, which also puts a fascinating, though disturbing, spin on what we know was Jesus' association with prostitutes and publicans and sinners because, in all probability, the prostitutes that Jesus was known to associate with and care therefore, became that way, not because they lacked moral virtue, but in all probability because their husbands did. And they had no other place to go. They had no other thing to do. Again, you get these things in the slide. It just changes, not necessarily the essential meaning of many passages, but you start looking at them differently. You go, whoa, there was more going on there than I knew. Remember the woman at the well? In John chapter 4, the water is being drawn, and Jesus starts talking to her about rivers of living water. I have water that you know not of, and then you'll never thirst again. And then he says, and she's all excited about that, and he says, go home and tell your husband. And she says, I have no husband. And Jesus says, yeah, I know. You've had five, and the one you're with now isn't your husband. I've heard that passage all my life. I've made assumptions about her. Maybe you have, too, that she's obviously an example of someone who Jesus loved, but someone who was looking for love in all the wrong places, going from husband to husband to husband, discarding husband after husband, maybe because he wasn't handsome enough or rich enough, not politically connected enough, not satisfying enough, quite the user she must have been. But when you understand what's really going on in that culture and what women and men were up against even together, that isn't what's going on at all here. That isn't the possibility. Jesus, interestingly, doesn't confront her for having had five husbands or even tell her to leave the man she's with. He doesn't say that like he did to the woman taken in adultery when he said, I'll go and sin no more. He doesn't say that to her because in Jesus' day, that woman at the well wouldn't have divorced five men, discarded five men. She couldn't have. It was illegal. But those five men could have easily discarded her five times. It's just the way things were in Paul's day, in Jesus' day. And sometimes it's just the way things are. To one degree or another, maybe not exactly like I said it there. To one degree or another, it's the same. Though today, it's not just men discarding women. It's women discarding men. Because misogyny always gives birth to misogyny. Misogyny, the hatred of the feminine. misandry, the hatred of the masculine, hatred of the feminine gives birth to hatred of the masculine and round and round and round we go. And all of that is at least part of what's behind what I described earlier in this talk as his grief, his great sadness that I hear in his voice when he says in Matthew 19, verse 8, but from the beginning, it hasn't been this way. And I am here not to just win an argument with you Pharisees. In fact, I don't know if this is true, but it's kind of the way I read the text and enter into it. It's almost like, you know, I don't care anymore if you guys want to test me or trick me or embarrass me. I'm not trying to win an argument with you anymore. I'm here to call you back to the beginning and try to help you remember, verse 4 of Matthew 19, that from the beginning, he created them male and female. Do you remember this, you guys, and called us into this one flesh thing? And when he created them male and female, he says in Genesis 128, which is Genesis 1 is what he's quoting in Matthew 19. When he created them male and female, he blessed them, it says in Genesis 1, 28. And he said to them, notice he said it to them. It might sound like I'm splitting hairs here, but it's important because he doesn't just say this to Adam, and he's not just saying this to Eve. I want you together in the beginning. I want you together to rule and subdue and multiply the earth, all of which speaks to what we've talked about before here relative to this, a co-ruling and a co-reigning with God on the earth, where all that is masculine comes together with all that is feminine, and together we step into the fullness of who God has called us to be together and what God has called us to do together. And whenever or wherever you see that dynamic, and you do from time to time. You can kind of get a whiff of it. It's almost when you go by it, having seen it, you go, whoa, that was something different. Whenever or wherever you see or experience all that is masculine coming together with all that is feminine in rightly ordered ways, what you see is the image of God. Steve went into this in detail a couple of weeks ago when he talked about God not being male or female. It is the masculine and the feminine. They're blended together. There is the image of God. You see the image of God. You experience the power of God. And it's not just in marriage that we see this. Beyond even that, because whenever and wherever you see all that is masculine coming together in rightly ordered ways with all that is feminine, you see the image of God. You'll experience the power of God. Indeed, in one very practical and powerful way, I'm seeing this. And many of you, even if you don't know you're seeing it, you're seeing it in our church, is in our leadership right now. Particularly among our elders where rightly ordered masculinity is coming together with rightly ordered femininity. Men and women, not just working together, men and women submitted to God in rightly ordered relationship. And when you see that functioning, it reveals the image of God and it releases the power of God. Indeed, that dynamic I'm trying to describe was actually, in the beginning, God's great dream. In the beginning. But selfishness and sin, kind of coming back to the story now, spoiled the party. Kind of destroyed God's dream, if you will. In Genesis 3, we refer to it theologically as the fall. The good news of God's dream is revealed in Genesis 1. It doesn't take long. Genesis 3, we fell from that. And among the many tragic results of the fall, as recorded in Genesis 3, was the loss of this co-reigning, co-ruling, one-flesh dance dynamic, replaced instead by an almost constant vying for power. Who's gonna win? Who's gonna lose? Who's gonna be on top? Who's gonna have the power and control? In Genesis 3.16, it actually describes some of the results of this fall as a kind of list. It's a long list. Paradise is lost. Enmity between men and women. Pain in childbirth. But then it says, but your desire shall be for him, and he will rule over you. And what's funny about that phrase, but his desire shall be for him, you see that at the very end of the verse. Her desire shall be for him, and he shall rule over her. What's funny, not ha-ha, but odd about that verse, is that I've heard that verse used at weddings, as if it were God's design and desire. And he, her desire, I got a flash for you. That verse, her desire shall be for him, he will rule over her, is the result of the fall. That's an expression of the curse. I sometimes use this verse when I'm doing a wedding and I look at this young couple and her desire is for him and the desire is a very good thing. Just loves him like crazy. But the word desire there in Genesis is not that kind of desire. It's not a warm and gooey thing. In fact, the word in the Hebrew literally, and it's probably a different word they should use in the English, but literally means to tear down and to usurp. You kind of get the meaning of it really when in the very next chapter of Genesis, God comes to Cain who has just killed Abel and he's confronting Abel in Genesis 4 verse 7 saying this, Cain, sin is crazy. crouching at the door, and its desire is for you. Well, sin's desire for Cain, who had just killed Abel, wasn't to give Cain a kiss. Sin's desire was to usurp him, to destroy him, to bring him down. A result of this destruction of what God desired in the beginning was that her desire will be for him to usurp and to destroy and to bring him down, and he will rule over you. which is never God's desire or design or dream in the beginning because this, Genesis 3.16, is the curse. And in Matthew 19, fast forward it now to our text, as the Pharisees are coming to Jesus, all of what I just described to you is there. In plain view, for everyone to see, Because in Matthew 19, we get to see just how far we have fallen. All of which begs this question. And it's the question that Joel asked in his song. How do we get back? Can we ever come home to the beginning? Can we ever cross over this particular Jordan into a different kind of life, into fullness of life in this arena of women and men? Are you kidding? Marriage and family, can we ever be delivered? Again, borrowing the analogy from the Red Sea. Can we ever be delivered from this curse? And then step into more. Well, the answer to that, well, to answer that, I want us to return to our work in Colossians chapter 3 and Ephesians 5, which I told you just a moment ago was the parallel passage to Colossians 3 where the Apostle Paul in both of those places says, yes, you can come home. We can get back to the beginning because in both of those places, he's talking about women and men, submission and love, marriage and family, parents and children. Here's how it works, says Paul. More importantly, and this is very important, here's where you start to get back. Ephesians 5.18, the parallel to Colossians 3.17 says this, be filled with the Holy Spirit. Very important. I want you to start there. That's fascinating to me because what most people know about Ephesians 5 is what Paul says in Ephesians 5.22, where he tells wives to submit and husbands to love. But that's not where you start in trying to deal with women and men, marriage and family, submission and love. You start in Ephesians 5, 18, where he says this. You can read it off the screen. Be not drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the spirits. He's using the wine analogy there because when you're under the influence of wine, you do and say things you would, ordinarily do. So don't be under that influence. I'm inviting you to a life where you would be under the influence of the Spirit, causing you to do and say some things you wouldn't ordinarily do if you weren't under the influence of the Spirit. But the key here is I want you to start there. Don't worry about your marriage yet. Don't worry about who's to submit and who's to love. I want you to start with a preoccupation of being and learning what it means to be under the influence of the Spirit, because now, if that's actually possible, to be men and women under the influence of the Spirit, we have some hope that we might just be able to cross over into a different kind of life, into fullness of life in this arena of life between women and men to be delivered from this curse, to be filled with the Spirit first. I was at a wedding this summer. My nephew, Josh, and the girl he was about to marry named Sarah. The love of his life, 21 years old. He looked 12 to me. I know, Josh. I know, Sarah. It was a joyful time. Our whole family went. Those were always fun times. Just as the service, the wedding was about to begin, No one said this to me before they asked the pastor of the church. They came up to me and asked me, would you be willing to pray a blessing on them at the end of the wedding because you're kind of Pastor Dave and you're a pastor in the family, so wouldn't that be great? And I said, of course I would. So the ceremony went on, and I was just trying to think of what I would say, what kind of words could help that they would actually hear. If other things on their mind, believe it or not, at that point. And there they were. And it was just like this. I didn't come up on a stage. The pastor indicated I came up from where. And I stood right there and I looked up at them and there they were. Looking at me. And I can still see them in my mind. It's like I can still see Sarah and Josh and their faces so full of hope. Tears in their eyes. They had just said their vows. I promise you. And I promise you too. And like any good wedding, no one could get through it with a dry eye. because they meant every word. But as I was sitting down there waiting to be called up to pray, it flashed through my mind and I don't want to be cynical, but everybody does mean it when they make their vows. And so it was time to pray. I came up, I was looking at them and as I was looking at them, this again thought went through my mind when I wondered, what hope do they have? I looked at Sarah. Again, I can still see her face, just this hope all over, smiling from ear to ear. This awful thought came in my mind. What hope does she have, really, that Josh will be faithful and true, that Josh will be gentle and kind? How do you know? Well, he just promised. Good. Good. So my prayer became, actually, morphed in that very moment into a mini-talk, which I'm sure is a big surprise to you. And I remember saying to them in the prayer, in one way or another, it's like, I just acknowledge, you know, you just took your vows, and you meant every word, but you can't keep them. Not by yourself. So what do you do, Josh, with all your good intentions, And Sarah, with all your good intentions, what do you do? Here's where you start. Bend your knee to God. Start there. I didn't say it that big. I didn't say it that big. But it was almost in this, there was something spiritual happening. It was almost in the interaction. I could see it in Josh's face. I did, Uncle Dave. And in my spirit was, I know you have, Josh. But here's what I want to get you with. I want you to do it again and again and again and again and again. Because your number one job, Josh, your number one preoccupation, Sarah, is not to be or try to be the best husband or wife in the whole wide world. Indeed, Josh, I know you. I saw you grow up. it's not going to happen. I love this kid. Your number one job, and you can do this, is to spend the rest of your life learning what it means to be full of the Spirit, to be full of God's life. Submit, therefore, to God first. And there's your hope, Sarah. And there's your hope, Josh. Not that he submits to you or that she submits to you, but that he and you submit to God first. And whatever you do, it says in Colossians 3.17, which is the parallel to Colossians, Ephesians 5.18, whatever you do in word or deed, do it all, all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. In other words, do what you do as unto him first. I want you to start there. If you don't have that, if you're not desiring that, anything I say to you about women and men, marriage and life, won't matter. Bend your knee to God first. Align your life under his authority first. Be subject first to him. And then what flows from that, Paul says in Ephesians 5.21, is this. Because if you bend your knee to God, you're ready to do this next thing. you'll know what it feels like to subject yourself also to another human being. Ephesians 5.21, subject yourselves to one another. No more vying for power. I'm calling you back home. No more trying to see who's going to win, who's going to be on top, who's in control. Instead, be subject one to another, stooping to serve one another. And now we get into Colossians 3.18. in Ephesians 5.22, because then he says, wives, I'm talking to you. Submit to your husbands as unto the Lord. And husbands, I'm talking to you. He says in Ephesians 5.25 and Colossians 3.19, indeed, to you husbands, I'm going to say a little more. Why? Well, just remember the culture into which Paul is speaking these words and Jesus is speaking his words. What I want to say to you, husbands, is this. remember. First, remember your father, Adam. What I want you to remember about your father, Adam, is how he looked at his mother, your mother, Eve. In Genesis 2, verse 23. Because when God brought to Adam, the woman, Eve, Adam did not say, aha, aha, a maid to serve me, and wait on me and coddle me, and always remember she's subservient to me and easily discarded by me, which gives me all sorts of power in this relationship. No, I want you to remember that your father Adam, in Genesis 1, in the beginning, got it right when And he said to the woman who was brought to him, this is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh, and for this cause I will leave and I will cleave to you. And then Paul says in Colossians 3.19 and Ephesians 5.25, I want you to also remember the second Adam, Jesus. Take some cues from him who, when he was trying to help some young boys become men. Remember that? Sermon on the Mount. We spent a couple years there, a few years ago, sitting on the side of the mountain with these young guys, 16, 18 years old, who called the disciples. He didn't sit and talk about theology, he talked about life. Let's talk about your anger. Let's talk about your loss. And he said to these young boys who he was desiring would become men, things like this in Matthew 20, 26, that whoever wishes to be great among you, stop right there, these 18-year-old boys, every one of them wanted to be great. Well, here's how I'll become a servant. Whoever wishes to be first among you shall be the slave, for I have come, Matthew 20, 28, not to be served, but to serve. And if you've ever learned anything from me, says Jesus, learn That I came not to be served, but to serve and to give my life away. So husbands, love your wives. Ephesians 5.25, Colossians 3.19. As Christ loved the church, his bride, by giving himself away. And as we do that, even begin to move toward that, the waters of the Jordan River begin to part. As we begin to walk slowly maybe at first into a different kind of life into a different way of living. So let me close with the very words I closed with last week out of Joshua chapter 1 verse 6 with these words open door. Men and women, be strong and courageous. Only be strong and very courageous. Repeats it three times in verse 9. Have I not commanded you? Be strong and very courageous. Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go, and he is calling you and me and us to more, to life, to love, to freedom, to what I described last week as destiny. And so we pray, Holy Spirit, come. Would you stand with me as we close? First of all, the prayer team people will be here to receive anyone who needs prayer for anything at all. And elders as well who are available for that will be here. Let's just pray. Father, I don't know, but I do believe that your spirit is activated among us right now and stirring things up that we need deliverance from, that we need healing from, that we need repentance for. And so, Father, by the activation of your spirit, I pray that gifts would be given for healing and deliverance, for gifts of repentance to come and to flow so that we can continue to be stepping into a different kind of life that is fully alive, energized by your spirit as we follow you into sometimes deep water. All God's people said, Amen. God bless you as you leave. Thank you.
