I'd say that's good news. I'd say that's good news that when we can't hang on to him, particularly in context of mourning, he hangs on to us. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. The last three weeks, this actually being the fourth week, as most of you know, we've been talking about what that means. to mourn how it looks, how hard it is at times to do, because in truth, most of us have spent a considerable amount of time and energy learning how to deny and avoid any sense of pain or loss. We don't like to feel things like that, which is at least part of why I love the story of John 11, where Jesus coming to Lazarus' tomb four days after Lazarus had died is deeply moved in his spirit and troubled, he weeps. It's amazing, really, I think, given all of our attempts to avoid and deny fully feeling any sense of pain and loss with what I called two weeks ago, look on the bright side, band-aids. Here's Jesus in John 11, totally connected with God in union with the Father, full of hope in the resurrection, still allows himself to fully feel. He doesn't deny it or avoid it. He fully feels it, which is why the invitation for the last few weeks here at Open Door has been for us to do the same, to have the courage to fully feel our pain and our loss and to, like Jesus, weep. Because blessed are those who weep. Blessed are those who mourn. Agreed? Well, you were supposed to say yes. Because I have nothing else to say if you don't agree with that. But see, I think you do agree with that. But here's the deal. This is the fourth week talking about mourning. I mean, seriously, don't you think three weeks of boo-hoo is enough? Well, actually, I do think, I do think, I hate that. I do think three weeks is enough. In fact, I think it's more than enough, especially if that's all we do with our morning is to weep, is to sit there passively in a pool of tears, feeling things deeply. But see, I think there's more to mourning than simply weeping, Which is why today I want to conclude the work we've been doing around the second beatitude by talking about those times when our mourning, come with me here, dial into this, those times when our mourning, those seeing things over which we weep, actually gets translated into and becomes the basis for mission. When beyond just sitting in a pool of tears, feeling things deeply, as important as that is, you actually begin to do things, desire to change things, precisely because you allowed yourself to deeply feel some things, to mourn some things. But this time, your sorrow didn't shut you down into passivity. This time, your sorrow woke you up. So that now your mourning has been translated into and becomes the basis for your mission, sometimes your mission in life. Example, several years ago, a young mom who felt about her children like moms feel about their children, lost one of her children in a horrible car accident involving a drunk driver, and she mourned. And she grieved, and she wept till there were no more tears to weep. But then her mourning shifted and began to become mission. So today we have an organization called MAD, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers. That's what I'm talking about. It's that very dynamic. and beyond just sitting in a pool of tears, feeling things deeply, which is extremely important to do, you actually move beyond that to do things, desire to change things because your mourning has become your mission. Blessed are those who care that much, who mourn. It's interesting. Many scholars actually believe that the Beatitudes, which is what we're in right now, are actually based on Isaiah 61. That Isaiah 61 was Jesus' text, as it were. It was his frame of reference, and we've done a lot of work on that relative to Jesus being a rabbi and his scripture was not, he didn't quote Paul. His scripture was the Old Testament. And a lot of scholars believe Isaiah 61 was the basis. It was kind of the frame of reference, again, that Jesus came from. And Isaiah 61 is, among other things, a lament. Where the community of faith, God's people, is lamenting. They are mourning the desolation of the holy city and the present condition of God's people and God's program in the world. In other words, they were looking at God's people. God's people were looking at themselves. It would be as if today we, the church, looked at the church and just said, something's wrong and God's program in the world not happening. And so there was a lament in Isaiah 61 and a mourning. But that mourning did not result in passivity. They didn't resign themselves to that, and they didn't deny that things were better. They didn't pretend that things were better than they were. They said, no, really, God's program in the world, I don't see it. God's people in the world, I don't see them. We aren't becoming a different kind of people. We're not acting like the light of the world. But that mourning turned to mission when you hear this kind of verse, Isaiah 61, verse 4. Here's how we will respond. Let us rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated. Let us be the people who bring good news to the afflicted and bind the brokenhearted. Beloved, that is when mourning becomes mission. Likewise in the Beatitudes. When Jesus comes on the scene, he sees the people of God in the world at that time in exile. We talked about this at length in weeks past relative to Jesus and his rabbinic tradition. And the people of God at that time historically, they were in exile and in bondage, not just to Rome, but to a religion that had been co-opted by death-dealing legalisms, and they were in bondage to their own sin as well. So Jesus, the great rabbi, redeemer, calls them to mourn right out of the chute. This is his first message, his first words relative to experiencing life in the kingdom. First thing he says, blessed are the poor in spirit, and blessed are those who mourn. He calls them to mourn, but then to, out of their mourning, become a different kind of people, to whom and through whom the kingdom of God could come, a people who actually are the light of the world, able to partner with God in the restoration of all things, which, by the way, is the program of God. That's where the story's going. That's where it's going to end. And we have the opportunity as God's people to partner with God right now in the beginning, in the restoration of all things, as being a people who are rebuilding the ancient ruins. And all of that happens when your mourning turns to mission. Luke 19, 41. Another text that speaks of the same dynamic. Jesus is approaching the holy city, Jerusalem, and seeing Jerusalem, it says in Luke 19, 41, he wept, saying, if only, Jerusalem, you had known the things that make for peace, but they didn't because they were blind, so Jesus wept. He mourned, but, it's so important, He didn't just weep. He wept. He felt it deeply. He mourned, but he didn't just weep over Jerusalem. What's the next thing he did? He went to Jerusalem. Because his mourning had been translated into and become the basis for his mission. You do not know the things that make for peace. So he wept, and then he said, more with action than words, let me show you the things that make for peace. See, it's not returning evil with more evil. It's when you return evil with overwhelming good. I know you don't get it. I know you don't see it. You're blind to it. See, it's in the things that make for peace. It's not when you kill your enemy. It's when you give your life, even for your enemy. Well, we were yet sinners, Christ. this dynamic of mourning becoming mission is something that you maybe have never articulated quite that way but it's something I think many of you know because quite frankly I know this for a fact it's why some of you have become teachers you know they didn't connect the dots this way it's why some of you have become coaches it's why some of you have become counselors particularly marriage counselors because you grieved you mourned you know you ever think about we're really good at getting mad at things even evangelical Christians I mean, I think sometimes our face to the world is that we're really mad about all the evil in the world. What if we didn't get it? What if we just mourned first and then out of our mourning moved? Didn't circle the wagons and defend ourselves, mourned and moved. It's why some of you are counselors. It's why some of us are ministers. It's why some of you are health care providers. It's why some of you have a passion about being a nurse or a doctor. Maybe even a lawyer. It's why some of our people responded so positively to requests for tutors in the schools, in our community, and in our city as well. It's why some of you are involved in a prison ministry. I'll never forget the first time I went to Lionel Lakes and preached, and I found out there this group of people from Open Door were there, such that Lionel Lakes Prison was beginning to be called Open Door North, the prison. And I remember going to dinner. I think we had a bite to eat afterwards and talking to Charlie Bench and some of the people there, And they said, you know, when we open the metro section in the paper and we read all the places in that section where all the arrests of the last week were made and the guy's picture is there, while everybody else is, and he didn't say it quite this way, but while everybody else is getting old, man, I'm glad they got him. We pray for those people. We mourn over them because we're going to meet them in a day or so. We mourn over them. But there's one thing about mourning and going, ooh, their mourning turns to mission. It's why some of you men are mentoring young boys who don't have dads. This is kingdom stuff. It's why as a church we're involved in AIDS, the AIDS project in sub-Sahara Africa. And it's not because it's the latest trend. It's not why. It's because Steve Hansen and a group of people went to sub-Sahara Africa, and when they saw what they saw, they wept. But it didn't stay there. Their mourning became mission. Now, this whole thing of mission, being born of mourning. Actually, that phrase first occurred to me several weeks ago. It was just on the brink, but we were coming into this thing on blessed are those who mourn, and it came to me in an odd place for thoughts like this. It was a concert. It was a Stefan Van Vorst concert, actually, celebrating the release of his new CD, which is actually available in our bookstore. Thank you very much, and I am expecting a kickback from that. Something. I want something. When about halfway through the concert, though, Stephan sang a song of lament, of mourning, and it was a song that invited us in to do the same. And what it lamented, among other things, was how far we have fallen, and quite frankly, how little we care. But through the song, we started to care. And when we were done, as I was weeping tears off my face, I remember thinking, blessed are those who mourn this way. Blessed are those who care. In fact, the phrase I had was, blessed are those who give a rip. But then who, beyond feeling something, we do that well. We have good hearts. We, oh, yes. Beyond feeling something deeply, blessed are those who actually care enough to do something significant. desire to change something it's when mourning becomes mission and then in that concert as this phrase was going through my mind i thought about how much stephan actually stephan in particular cares about what what he cares about is born of what he's mourned and then i thought what a great way to meet stephan and steve um to have them share a little bit about how what their mission in life and their passions are come out of what has actually in some ways broken their heart. And if we could do that in some weird way, maybe it would help you get a glimpse of why we hold them in such high regard. Some of you may not know what I'm talking about. A couple weeks ago, I announced, in fact, Brad mentioned it quite casually, that Stephan Van Voorst and Steve Wiens were coming on our staff at Open Door. Stephan Van Voorst is our pastor of worship, along with Meredith and his little daughter, Miriam, and Steve Weins, coming on as a second voice here at Open Door, teaching pastor along with me, along with his wife, Mary, and Isaac, beyond their roles. Their roles, well, you know, they have skills that they bring to this. What was drawn, what drew us to them was their passion, their mission that's born of their mourning. And we began to wonder, would it be, is there a way we could do this? Well, we are going to do it. Church of the Open Door. Welcome Stephan Van Voorst and Steve Wings. Get up here with me. It was interesting, just before, this is true, just before we came up today, we were sitting talking and we're talking about friendship and how one day Jesus went to his disciples and said, I no longer call you servants, now I call you friends. And how there's a level of friendship that is based on, I like you, I like you too. And it's that wonderful, warm feeling that you get, but there's another kind of friendship that is born of people who together are looking at the same thing and they want the same thing. And we're on this journey together. And these guys are friends. Not just of me, but of Open Door. They are friends of ours. I'm a little bit nervous actually being hip enough to hang with you guys. Seriously, I mean, I've already been told the tassels are like a real, they're like a miss, aren't they? You brought it up. Now, those are Converse. Are those Converse? You should know what these are. They're old school, man. They're old school, and I wore high tops, though, and I think you need to do the high tops. You look like a dork. And the other thing, Steve, I don't want to embarrass you in front of everybody, but your jeans are ripped. Trying to be hip, Dave. You know. I paid really good money. You did. That's what I know. I know. That's so bizarre. We are friends. We are friends. It's part of what I think is going to work around this thing. Steve, just in terms of where we're at, what we're talking about here, why don't you share first? And don't, like I said last night, don't screw up. Oh, that's great. Well, when we started talking about this, I asked my wife and I asked my friends the question, what do you think it is that I grieve, that I mourn? What do you hear me talking about? And they told me some things, and I began to rewind the tapes back, really far back into when I was even a little kid. And I realized that from a really young age, I've always had a real place in my heart for underdogs, for people that are lower, that are seen lower. And this memory came to my mind of this fourth grade deal. I went to this little school, and there was this kid in my class in fourth grade. His name was Steven Gard. He was about six feet tall. And when everyone else is like four foot nine, that's conspicuous. And back in a time when black rimmed glasses were not cool, They were very dorky. He wore those. And he was the class dork. I mean, everyone made fun of him and didn't like him. And this was a Christian school that I went to. And so it was my birthday. And what I normally did is I had guys over for an overnight party at my birthday party. And we would eat pizza and stay up late. And in fourth grade, this thought came into my mind is that you should invite Stephen Gard to this party. And my next thought was, no way. Because if I do that, all my friends will think I'm friends with him. And it'll just be weird. I mean, if he comes, he's going to be weird at this party. It's going to ruin the whole thing. And the thought came back in my mind, no, you have to, you need to invite this kid to this party. And so I did. And it was a little weird. But he was invited in. Little weird things, little tiny weird things that make me feel embarrassed and stupid. But when I was a little guy, my mom will tell you, and I remember this, but I would pick up little roly-poly pill bugs, and I would put them in my pocket because I didn't want them to get stepped on. Right? Oh, I heard the, oh, down here. That's beautiful. And all of this came to a head in this scene that I saw when I was going to pick up some pizza for my wife and I and a movie. And went to this little strip mall where we live. It was a rainy day. And I picked up the pizza. I was heading over to get the movie. And I saw this father with his two daughters. And the two daughters had yellow raincoats on. One of them was a little older. She was standing a few feet away. And the dad was down on one knee, and he had his youngest daughter, her right arm in his left hand, and his right arm was hitting her right on the other arm over and over and over and over and over again. And the older daughter was, you could tell, not too far away, but staying there not knowing what to do. And I'm gripping my steering wheel, and I'm stopping, and I'm looking at this thing. and I cannot believe what is happening and you would feel the same way and so this thought do I do something do I get out of my car and get in between that or do I just keep driving because that might make it worse and what I did is I just kept driving and I reflected on that later a lot what happens when you see that and you keep driving. I think that something in the fabric of our society gets a little worse. And then I thought, what happens if you get out? I think something in the fabric of our society might actually get a little better. but it requires a courage that many of us don't feel like we have. How do you turn that kind of mourning for people that are on the bottom into something that you move into and do? Because I think what happens in any society is that all the anger and all the aggression and all the rage and all the disappointment gets cycled down from the top to the second to the third to the fourth to the fifth, all the way to the lowest person on the food chain, and they receive the biggest chunk of the violence. And that typically is kids and the poor. So what would it look like for us to move in to that? I don't think a program does it. I really don't think there's a policy we could legislate to make that better. I think it's when little groups of people decide that love actually wins. And when I say love wins, there's some of us that think, that's the most, that's the nice, you can't argue with love wins. I mean, that's nice. And it's over here and it's this thing that you can sit around and candles and kumbaya and love wins, but it doesn't really win because if it wins, it would have won. well I don't think it hasn't won because it's been tried it hasn't worked I don't think it's been tried very much because the kind of love wins that I'm talking about is the kind of love that steps out of the car and steps in between the aggressor and the oppressed and love wins means you have to absorb a blow. And who does that? I was driving into work up Highway 169, and I was listening to this little sermon, and before the sermon came on, there was this couple telling a story about how they have adopted a few kids, and they adopt these kids from all over the world. And it got down to like the fourth kid that they adopted, and it was this little two-year-old boy. And they said, oh, we adopt this little two-year-old. He's the greatest little guy. We love him. and he's HIV positive. And I seriously, as I was driving up, I thought, I started crying and I thought, who does that? Who does that? The people that do that believe love wins and there's a cost that comes when that kind of love is demonstrated. That is the least mushy, least idealistic, strongest, most powerful way that justice is done is that in your life, in your world, you move in between and you stand up for the oppressed. I think about that and there's a part of me that gets really overwhelmed at that. You know, I swing over to the side and I think there's too many oppressed people. Justice will never happen. The world is too big. And so I numb out and I anesthetize myself. And I try to, and we have a lot of ability to do that. And on the other side, I feel like I just get involved in all these different things. And I start writing checks and I start doing all these things. I think the answer is in your world to do the smallest, most available thing possible. And many times that's with your own kids. That you would refuse to pass down the aggression that came at you from your boss or from your spouse or whatever, and you give it right to your kid. I think love wins when you say, it stops with me and I will absorb it. I think about Jesus and the story he told about the guy that was lowered down. You know, Jesus is doing some teaching. All of a sudden, he feels sawdust in his eye, and there's a hole in the roof, and there's this guy that's being lowered down by his friends. his friends have been carrying this guy all the way from his house to this moment and jesus said you are saved because of the faith of your friends because someone decided to absorb the blow for this guy love actually won and that's actually why why i'm excited about coming here and over the years and years and years that i've known you i've known that you have had a soft spot in your heart for the underdog, for the poor in spirit. And so when I come here and when I stand here and when I have stood here before and proclaimed, I felt this traction and I felt it back. And so one of the things that we're wondering about and we're talking about and we're wondering who else, who else in here has a soft spot in their heart for oppressed people? But when I'm up here and when I'm out there and when I'm over here, that's what I'm going to be talking about. And that's what I'm going to be bringing because that's what I mourn about. And that's my mission. Amen. Thanks. Can you beat that? No. No. Was I supposed to try? No. Okay. Go back to that be yourself. Good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good. Yeah. Well, the last several times I've been here, I've talked about some things that are very close to my heart. And over the last couple years, there's been something in me that has wanted to move towards the Middle East, move towards people in the Middle East, Arabs, Christian, and Muslim. And because of that, my wife and I have gotten to know friends there, and now we have relationships there of Christians and Muslims who have been living there all their lives and sit in this area of the world that is suffering from such poverty and violence and a lot of things that you all see on the news. And these relationships have really affected how I think because when you sit with somebody and you begin to hear their stories, it changes your grid a little bit, you know. And I just got an email this week from a friend of mine named Ahmed. And he's 30 years old. He lives and works in Aqaba, Jordan. It's the southern tip on the Red Sea. And he's committed his life to serving the poorest of the poor in Jordan. He's one of the most devout Muslims I know. he was discipled in Islam by his father in the mosque his father is a very prominent Muslim throughout the Middle East when you say his last name people pay attention when Ahmed talks and I got an email from Ahmed this week and I didn't know this was going to happen but somebody had a friend of mine who had gone to the Middle East took a bunch of these CDs that I had just done and started handing them out to everybody and I was like I don't know how I feel about that because some of it's pretty overtly Christian hopefully all of it but uh there's a few things in particular I'm like I don't know how uh a guy like Ahmed hears that um but I trust my friendship with Ahmed and so I was kind of like well you know we'll see well I get an email from Ahmed the first sentence he says Stefan he said I have been listening to your CD he says I love it I love what you're saying he says I'm so thankful for our friendship to know that there is somebody who cares about some of the things that I care about and then he signs it your brother Ahmed he's affected my thinking and my heart has grown towards Arab Muslims and Arab Christians a lot. But I am concerned about the state of the world. I really am. And I want to learn more, and I have conversations with people, but there's a certain level of conversation that I'm kind of out of. I don't know the language. I don't know how to kind of roll with the people in the conversation, and that's the people, the leaders of things. Smart people, I call them. And in April, I got invited to go to a conference at Duke Law School. And the conference, the title of the conference, and this is going to sound intense, but the title of the conference was Confronting Terrorism Here and Abroad, A New Way Forward. And what Duke Law School did was they brought in people from the intelligence agencies, the defense department, advisors for Bush and Clinton and Bush Sr. and Reagan and Carter, all the presidents, people from the military, military leaders who had enormous amounts of responsibility. And they brought in teachers and lawyers and all these kinds of people. And they made, they had panels of people that would share on a given topic. And so I was there and there wasn't many people my age. Most people were older, which is kind of interesting to me. But we just came together to talk about terrorism, to talk about violence in our world and try to see like, okay, where are we at? What are we thinking about? And how do we move forward? And so I went and I sat there and I was with a few friends. And the first panel was on Islam and Arab culture. And they had a panel of people who were all American sharing what they know about Islam. And as they started to share, I started to think about Ahmed. And I started to think about my friends in the Middle East. And I thought, I don't know that Ahmed would agree. Because he doesn't talk about it that way. That's not how he sees it. And then somebody started talking about women in the Middle East and what it's like for a woman. And I thought of my friends in the Middle East who are women. I thought, man, I don't know that they would agree with that. And this disconnect started to happen to me between what these people were saying but what I had experienced with my friends in the Middle East. And I didn't know how to reconcile that. The next panel was on Mideast policy. And on the panel there was somebody who works for the president, a Democrat, and it was a diverse panel in terms of kind of America. And they started talking about Mideast policy, And they started saying, this is what's important and this is where we're going. And as I started to listen to the ideas of solutions and things like that to this problem that all of us have in this world, the Middle East included, this problem of terrorism, when I started listening to the solutions, I thought, oh no. I know how Ahmed would hear that. And it wouldn't work. I know how he would understand it and I know because what Ahmed would say that's not necessarily the problem there's another problem over here and what I began to realize is that I don't know that anybody on the panels had friends like Ahmed I just don't know if they knew and if they had friends in the Middle East. And something in me started to break in intense ways. An enormous concern for our world just kind of landed on me. The last night of the conference, I was talking to my wife in this lobby area of the law school, and she was at a baby shower for Steve and Mary. I had done friendship is like the most important thing to me and I had this stupid conference while my best friend is having a baby shower and it was just that in general was really hard for me but all my friends are together celebrating the birth, the coming of this little guy and I had just heard something for the last two days that deeply, deeply concerned me and all I could think about is what are we bringing these kids into? and I can remember talking to my wife on the phone and hardly being able to hold back to tears and she didn't know what I was hearing and what I was thinking but what I just heard for the last two days was just like oh my God we're in trouble because we have a massive disconnect and I don't know how we bring that together I came home that weekend and I led worship At Upper Room and I tried talking about this experience And as I started talking about it I just started weeping in front of everybody And I'm not a guy that cries very often And so it caught me really off guard And I didn't know what to do And I didn't know how to get it back It was like, Stephan, just settle down You know And I couldn't do it I got done singing I put my guitar down, I went up to my office, and I just wept harder than I can remember crying for years. I just don't remember anything like it. It was one of those things where because it was so not me, I was just like, okay, I have to sit in this and figure out what's going on here. And as I reflected on this experience, I started to realize something. That there's this thing in human nature where we always make an us and them. It can be as big as nations east and west. It can be small as husband and wife, brother and brother, parent, child, employee, boss. It doesn't matter. We have this thing where we always make a them. And what I realized with my friendship with Ahmed is that if you move towards them, you can begin to create solutions together because you understand the full story a little bit better. And what I started to grieve is this thing in us that says, why aren't followers of Jesus moving towards them, whoever them may be? Whether it's a boss or a spouse or a child, it doesn't matter. How do we move towards them? And what happens if we actually move towards the them, whoever they may be, and sit and listen? And listen to their story and try to understand a different perspective. And then not to assume that our perspective is totally right. There's this great story in the Gospels where Jesus is walking along the side of the road and there's a blind man on the side of the road named Bartimaeus. And Bartimaeus is yelling out to Jesus. He wants to talk to Jesus, and Jesus keeps walking, and the disciples are kind of like, be quiet, you know, don't bother him. You know, the disciples tend to do that. And he keeps yelling. Bartimaeus just keeps yelling. And Jesus finally stops, and he turns, and he looks at Bartimaeus, and he does something. He says something that I honestly think is one of the most profound statements in all of the scriptures. He says, Bartimaeus, what do you need from me? The reason I think that's profound is because I wouldn't have asked that question. I would have seen Bartimaeus and I would have been able to tell I think that he was blind and in my head what I would have made a decision on is Bartimaeus needs to see but Jesus didn't assume that he asked he asked what do you need that's one of the greatest things about Jesus I put my assumptions on people I put my assumptions on the them whoever them may be I think I know what they need and I think I know what needs to happen for things to be fixed but when we can begin to listen to them the line between us and them starts to get very very gray because before you know it we all start to become us and things change I'm excited to be here because I just get this feeling from you that you all are really serious about following this rabbi who had an incredible ability to start graying the lines between us and them and invited people into something that was so beautiful. I want to be part of that with you. I want to learn how to do that better, like Steve said, to absorb some things so that the lines begin to gray a little bit. and we can begin to move towards the them of the world, whoever they may be. That's my mission. Amen. Amen. What if? What if more and more we became an authentically missional people? And it wasn't because some pastor shouted rah, rah, rah for some new church program. But it was because we allowed our hearts to break. Because we allowed ourselves to mourn, to fully feel the kind of mourning that makes you move. Stephan? Stephan? Sing. Can you see the suffering around? Can you hear the cries of the beaten down? Losing homes and dignity Is justice only just a dream Do you have anything to say? Where are you now? Where have you gone? Come quickly, it's been too long Where are you now? Can you see the children of despair? Do you feel their anger everywhere? Fighting for a life today Is violence the only way Do you have anything to say Where are you now Where have you gone Come quickly It's been too long The world needs you now before hope is gone. Too many have suffered too long. Caught in a maze of fears and pain. I'm battered around by rage Deafening silence in my ears Are you the God who saves? Where are you now? Where have you gone? Come quickly, it's been too long. The world needs you now before hope is gone. Too many have suffered too long. They've suffered too long. Where are you now? Let's pray together. Lord, we come in honesty and I pray that you would help us sink into the things we grieve and mourn. I pray that we would be appropriate and dig deep into that. and then I pray that you would help us move to wherever you would have us move I pray that you would call us out and we would have the courage to step forward in your name, amen Amen.
