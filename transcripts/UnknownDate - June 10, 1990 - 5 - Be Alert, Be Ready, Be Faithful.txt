I'd like the rest of you to open your Bibles with me to Matthew chapter 24. We're going to be continuing our study in this study of the gospel, of this gospel, picking it up in the 42nd verse. Matthew chapter 24, verse 42. And again, as has become our custom, I want to acknowledge the presence of those who are in the overflow, just judging from the size of our first service and knowing that there were over 100 people in there then and looking at what it looks like now, I'm pretty confident that there's a good number of you there. And just trust that as you are in some way separate from us and in maybe a context that you don't feel real comfortable in, that somehow the Spirit of God will overrule all of that and you'll sense an ability to really receive from Him what He's got for you today. We are returning this morning to what is becoming for us a real familiar text, chapter 24 and chapter 25 of the book of Matthew. It is the Olivet Discourse. Most of you are aware of the fact, because of the teaching over the last couple of weeks, that this Olivet Discourse takes place in the final week in the life of Christ. It is revealing for us the events of the second coming of our Lord, and it was precipitated by a question posed by the disciples to Jesus in verse 3 of chapter 24. And that question had two parts. The first part of the question was this, Jesus, what will be the sign or the signs of your parousia, your full presence? What will be the sign or the signs of the end of the age? The second part of the question was this. When will these things or these signs be? When will it take place? In verses 4 to 31, Jesus to the disciples, to every generation following, and also us and the end of the age, said this. I want to reveal to you what the signs will be. First of all, from the general signs that will mark every age. Verse 4 to verse 14. To the specific sign in verse 15, which is specifically the abomination of desolation, and that particular sign will usher in the final three and a half years of man's history. To the ultimate sign, following all the apocalyptic events of verse 15 to 28, the ultimate sign of the coming, literal coming, of the sign of the Son of Man in the sky, coming in power and great glory. He revealed to them from verse 4 to 31 the signs of His coming. In verse 32, he began to deal with the second part of the question, and that was, when will these signs take place? And he began to answer it, as I said in the 32nd verse, through the parable of the fig tree, saying basically this. When you see these things happening, specifically these things, the abomination of desolation, that specific event in history that I believe is still yet to come, that will enter in, will usher in the final three and a half years of man's day. When you see those things, know that I am right at the door, and it is just about to happen. I also want you to know, according to verse 34, that the generation that sees these things, what things? Again, the abomination of desolation, the final events of the great tribulation, know this, that the generation that sees those events will also see the full presence. You will see the parousia, you will see the end of the age. But of that day and hour, when the parousia is going to come, my full presence, the end of the age is going to be there, no one knows. He says that four times in this particular passage. In verse 36, of that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven nor the Son, but the Father alone. Verse 42, he says the same thing. Verse 44, he reiterates the same issue. Verse 50, he says again the same thing. The general time, the general era is delineated for us in verse 15 to 28, when the abomination of desolation, three and a half years of apocalyptic events, you'll know that I'm right at the door, but the specific time you don't know. And in light of the fact that you do not know the specific time that these events are going to transpire, therefore, and that brings us right to our text, be on the alert, verse 42, because, again, you do not know which day your Lord is coming, and these events are going to transpire. But be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have been on the alert, and he would have not allowed his house to be broken into. For this reason, don't just be alert, be ready. Be ready, too. For the Son of Man is coming in an hour when you do not think that he will. Who then is the faithful and sensible slave whom his master put in charge of his household, to give them their food at the proper time. Blessed is that slave whom the master finds so doing, so doing what? Giving them their food at the proper time. Blessed is the slave whom his master finds doing that when he comes. Truly I say to you that he, that is Jesus, will put him, that is the slave, in charge of all of his, that is God's, possessions. But if that evil slave says in his heart, Ah, hey, no big deal, my master isn't coming for a long time. and shall begin to beat his fellow slaves and eat and drink with drunkards. The master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know and shall cut him to pieces. Happy word. And assign him to a place with the hypocrites. Weeping shall be there and the gnashing of teeth. In light of the fact that you do not know when your apocalypse will come, whether it be the ultimate apocalypse, meaning the end of the age, or your personal apocalypse, meaning your own end of life. Because of that, there's four things I want you to know. I want you to be. I want you to be alert. I want you to be ready. I want you to be faithful. And the fourth thing coming from another text that is a parallel in Luke, is I want you to be confident that in the end it will be worth it all. Let's pray as we begin. Jesus, I believe that as this text has become clearer and clearer to me, even in the preaching of it, that it is an important word. Not just to the church, but even in a broader context, this is an important word to the world. And in a powerful way, even as I've gone through this three times now, it's become more and more effective and applicable to the world we live in. And God, I pray in your name that you would take this truth, that you would burn it into our spirits, and that, Father, you would bring the message that is captured here and affect us with it and let it flow from us. But, Father, those who need to receive it, I pray that you would allow us to do that as well. Be our teacher by your Spirit in this place this morning. In Jesus' name, amen. The first word here is this, be alert, verse 42. We dealt with this in some detail two weeks ago, And literally, the call to be alert moves us back up into the text, back up to verse 36 and verse 37. You might recall that Jesus is dealing with the disciples and warning them and trying to describe to them why it is that men won't know the day or the hour. And it was kind of a bizarre thing. There's going to be these incredible events, these stellar events. The days are going to be shortened. And in light of all of these apocalyptic events on the earth that would clearly speak to the end of time coming, people are going to deny it. People are going to be apathetic toward it. They're going to be indifferent about it. They aren't going to receive it in the end days. And what Jesus did was try to compare it to the days of Noah to give the disciples a handle on how they could possibly miss the signs of the times in the end times. You see, in the days of Noah, it was then just the way it's going to be in the final day in spite of the message in Noah's day being clearly delineated through Noah for 120 years, they still missed it. And in spite of the unmistakable sign of judgment, which was the boat, a huge structure, bigger than the Queen Mary, in spite of that sign that was there for everybody to see that spoke of God's judgment to come, they denied it, they were apathetic toward it, and they were indifferent about it. Verse 38, it says, In spite of those things, life just went on. They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying and giving in marriage. Nothing wrong with any of those things at all. But what it meant was this. As they went through their life, The humdrum reality of life dulled their senses to the reality of the eternal. And they lived as if there would never be a day of accounting. There would never be a day of judgment. There would never be a time when their end came. And they were dulled. And they did not understand, verse 39, until the flood, remember the word? Apocalyptic. Their apocalypse. Until the flood, their apocalypse came. And then it was too late. and then they were washed away. So the first word to the world as it relates to the coming of the king, again, is be alert. The culmination of the age is sure. And when I speak again, I'm going to keep bringing this in. When I speak of the culmination, the culmination as we stick with the text is being spoken of as the end of the age, the parousia, the end of all things. But the thing that needs to be brought home to us and makes it applicable to every heart here is this. Whether we're speaking of the end of the age or my end of my age, the end of my age is sure. It is going to happen. Therefore, be alert. The life I live right now is not all there is to life. As much as I would like to lose myself in the humdrum realities of life so I don't have to think about that, every once in a while I've got to come up and wake up and be alert to the fact that this life is not all there is to life. be on the alert. As we move into the verses for this morning, starting in verse 43, however, we find out that it's not enough to just be alert, be aware that that is a reality. We need more than to be alert. We need to be ready. And again, I want you to catch the tension of this and the pulsing of this, that this is a word I believe to the world. It is a word from Jesus to the unredeemed of the world. in that it has an evangelistic, a powerful evangelistic focus and point. Let me kind of break it down in terms of its syntax and what it's saying as far as the parable in verse 43. Be sure of this. If the head of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have been on the alert. He would have prepared himself. In breaking down the syntax, discover first that this first phrase is an indicative, which simply means it is a statement of fact. Be sure of this. And the fact that it states is in direct contrast to a fact that is being stated in the 42nd verse. The fact in the 42nd verse is this. You do not know the day or the hour. But in contrast to that, you do know this for sure. And what you know is this. If the head of the house had known. Stop right there. The if there is even an important word. He had a sermon on if. Okay. The if is important. It appears in the Greek with a modifier, and the modifier makes that word if contrary to fact. Well, big deal. What that means is this, that if the head of the house had known that the thief was coming in the middle of the night, but he didn't, he didn't know the thief was coming, he didn't know he was coming in the middle of the night, and because he didn't, he was unprepared. But if he had, he would have prepared, he would have been alert, he would have done something to keep this thief out of his house. Just like any normal person, if you knew that in the middle of the night, a thief was coming into your house, you'd wake up. You'd look around. You'd be ready for the thief. The thief can do what he does. Why? Because you're not what? Ready. You're sleeping. Again, this word is a word to the world. It is a word to the unredeemed that is focused upon evangelism in terms of its intent. When it calls people to be ready here, I do not believe it's a call to believers to be ready for the king. We are to be ready for the king. I don't believe that verse is saying that. Believers, be ready. It's time to pack our bags. Get up on the roof and be ready for the coming of the king. No. No, it's a call of evangelism. It is a call to wake up and become alert and make yourself ready for the thief that is going to come. What's interesting about that, among other things, is the fact that as I was studying this, I saw this as an evangelistic and an invitation to come and come to life and wake up. But what it did to me is it made me think of and kind of reminisce just a couple chapters back when Jesus was making another appeal to salvation. What was interesting about it, and the one I was thinking of was Matthew 22, just two chapters previous to this. What was interesting about his appeal in chapter 24 was that while the appeal was fundamentally the same in terms of its hoped-for conclusion, that is, salvation, Its tempo, or its tone rather, its approach was absolutely different. In Matthew 22, verse 3, Jesus tells the parable of the master who says to his slave, go out into the area and call people to the feast. Give them an invitation and tell them this, that the dinner is prepared, the oxen have been butchered, the work is done, everything is ready, The grace is available. All they've got to do is come and eat. The banquet table, is there all the food they could possibly want? Is there all they've got to do is receive it? And the tone of that call to salvation is altogether what? It's positive. It's wonderful. It's good news. Come and get it. Food is ready. Grace has been delivered to you. The price has been paid. Hallelujah. Let's go. The problem. The problem is that word that is very positive and very graceful and not hellfire and brimstone at all got exactly the same response as the word of judgment in the day of Noah. It says this, that after these slaves went into the area and called people to the feast and said, we're going to come to celebrate the sun, the wedding feast of the king is wonderful, let's go. It says in verse 5 of chapter 22 in Matthew, they paid no attention. All of a sudden, I'm seeing the same apathy, the same indifference, the same ignoring mentality that is in verse 38 when they were eating and drinking, marrying and being given in marriage. It says in Matthew 22, they went their way, one to his firm, another to his business, going through life. Having their senses dulled by the realities and the humdrum realities of everyday life. to the reality that they'd been invited to a feast. Matthew 24, he's not inviting them to a feast. Matthew 24, he's warning them about a thief who's going to come and take every single thing they've got. We need to have something, and I'm talking to believers here for a minute, about evangelism, about your whole perception of the lost and what our message to people is. We need to understand that there is grace to everyone who by faith comes. There is grace. The table has been set. Everything you could possibly need for life here and forever is at the table that Jesus, by his blood shed for us, has spread for us. Everything is there. So come. But while there is grace, we need to also understand that there is judgment if you don't come to the table. There is judgment. the balance of those two things need somehow to be in the hopper of what we think it needs to somehow be in the hopper of how we think for me or for you for we to constantly be bringing a message of judgment, judgment, judgment without grace is not the gospel that's the hellfire and just scare everybody to death and they'll be coming not because they understand anything about God it'll just be this fear thing and they're hoping they're doing enough and the right thing but if all you do as well is bring nothing but grace and grace it's free it's nothing oh just come no big deal no judgment hey everybody's going to be an after all it's kind of universality of the whole thing without the message of judgment you got no grace at all you have no balance you see it is the judgment of god that makes people aware of the fact that they have no way at all to stand before god which produces brokenness it produces hunger for grace it produces mourning over sin and it produces the kind of heart that says i've got to have grace my only possible hope is Jesus. Then they're ready for grace. So just as looking at that verse, I think it's important to tie it in even with Matthew 22 and see that our message has got to have a double edge on it. The judgment of God, the grace of God, both at the same time, which produces life. Let's get back to the text. The picture of the thief is used to describe Jesus in his coming all through scripture. And when it is, it is speaking of Jesus coming in the posture of a judge. Jesus, and again, this is consistent with what we've done before. In his coming, Matthew 13, he's going to do two things. He's going to gather the truly redeemed, the weak, and he's going to also gather the phony, the phonies, the false ones, if you will, the tares, and he's going to gather the true ones and barn them. He's going to gather the false ones and burn them. He is coming as a judge. He is coming as a king and a sovereign Lord and a wonderful grace giver. But here he's being pictured as coming as a thief. What that metaphor of a thief communicates and speaks to is a number of things. Among them, I'll give you two. First of all, this metaphor of a thief speaks of Jesus coming and his coming as a thief will be unexpected. A thief comes unexpectedly. A thief comes suddenly. A thief comes in the middle of the night. A thief comes when you're not expecting it. A thief comes while you're sleeping. King James Version renders this this way. You do not know in what watch of the night your lord may come the word watch there is the one that caught my eye the jews divided the night into four watches of the night or four periods of the night the first watch of the night was six in the evening to nine o'clock the second watch was from nine to twelve the third was from twelve to three the fourth watch of the night was from three to six again and what he's saying here is this what i don't know is what watch of the night he's going to come i don't know when he's going to come. So there's this thing, if you're always watching every moment, I mean, I don't know. It could be a two, it could be a five, it could be a three, one, eleven, whatever. What I do know for sure is this, that he is coming. Apocalyptically, in the end of the age, he is coming. That is for sure. I don't know when. Personally, for you and for me, I know for sure he is coming. I don't know when. Again, I always think about this, make it as personal to me as I can't. I do not know when he is coming for me personally. It could be on my way home to Maple Grove this afternoon. He could come for me in a car wreck. It's over for me. And I don't know when. I'm not expecting that today. And what Jesus is saying here, among other things, is this. My gift right now, by saying this to the world, my gift to the world of the unredeemed is this. First of all, I want to invite you to a feast. And the feast is a feast of grace and life in Jesus and restoration and redemption and forgiveness and access to God through the blood of Jesus. And everything you could possibly need is there for you. But I got another gift for you too, and that is this, to not only invite you to the feast, but I need to warn you about the thief, and it's time to wake up to the realities of that. And while you go through the humdrum reality of your day, eating, drinking, being married, and given in marriage, you need to be ready for that event. This concept of a thief also speaks of something else. What does a thief do when a thief comes? A thief comes to steal. A thief comes to destroy. And it's really hard for me, by the way, to picture Jesus with that kind of metaphor. Isn't it for you? When I think of someone stealing and killing and destroying, I think of who? The enemy. I don't think of Jesus, but here he's being spoken of, And all through Scripture, those other passages I gave you, he's being spoken of as a thief. Did I give you those other passages? I don't know if I did or not. This is the third time for me. All through Scripture, he's spoken of as a thief. 1 Peter 3, 1 Thessalonians 5, Luke 12, Revelation 3, Revelation 16. And I have trouble seeing Jesus that way. So in what sense is he a thief? I think he is a thief this way. When it comes to the apocalypse, again, at the end of the age, or when it comes to mine, that personal end of the age for me and for you, he is going to come as a thief. And what that means is he's going to take everything you've got. What I mean by that is this. On that day, everything, everything that you are relying on, everything that you are hoping in, everything that you are leaning on, other than God to give you life, is going to be taken away. You follow that? Everything you're kind of going, yeah, I like, you know, and all the little things you surround yourself with, marrying and being given in marriage, all your food and all your drink and all that stuff that you're kind of propping yourself up with, in that day, he's coming as a thief and he's taking every single thing away other than Jesus, other than God, that you're leaning on for life. It's going to be gone and only those who are leaning on God, who are getting their life from Jesus, will be able to stand in that day. They are the only ones who have been made ready. in the vernacular we say it this way you can't take it with you in that day when you die you can't it's all gone now now that's kind of a cultural way or a physical way to look at all of our possessions and what that does in the world that statement says you can't take it with you so use it now. Have a ball now. I'll use the same phrase. You can't take it with you. And you know why you can't take it with you? Because there's a thief coming to steal every single thing you've got other than Jesus. And if you don't live in some level with a sense of reality tuned into that reality, it is the ultimate reality, you're asleep. It's time to wake up. To the unredeemed, he's coming as a thief unexpectedly suddenly in some sense destructively taking everything you've got i believe that this text if i could put a heading on it it would be this it is a wake-up call to the world it is a wake-up call to all those who are unredeemed to all those who have been put to sleep by the humdrum reality of everyday life it is time to recognize this reality and it is time to be ready. Verse 44, for this reason you be ready to. The million dollar question is this, how is somebody made ready? Well, if I were to just appeal to Matthew 22 and the invitation feast that was extended, the way to be made ready is simply by accepting the invitation feast. Come into the feast. Remember what happened? He went into the place and he went to the place where he had invited the people and they said, no, I don't want to go. I'm busy. I'm going to do what I want to do. I'm going to keep doing my life and I don't want to go and celebrate the sun. And the master that is God, the slaves having come back and said they didn't want to come to the feast, said this, that is fine. They were unworthy to come to the feast. That did not mean they were unworthy because their performance wasn't good enough. Truth is, they weren't worthy by their performance to get the invitation in the first place. What made them unworthy was what? that when the invitation to come and feast at the banquet table of God was delivered, they said, nah, that denial and apathy is what made them unworthy. After their denial and apathetic response to the invitation to come and receive the grace of the king, God, the master in that parable, said, Guys, slaves, hit the streets and bring this message of a feast prepared for men and women to everybody. Bring it to the drunkards. Bring it to the prostitutes. bring it to the hungry and broken and mourning, and tell them, I've got a feast for them. All they've got to do is know they need the food that I have, and if they come, they get it. Truth is, all through history, the only ones who ever have come to the feast that God has prepared by His grace through the blood of Christ is the broken, the hungry, the mourning, who've come to an end of themselves and recognize, I am thirsty and I am hungry for food and drink that only God can provide. Nobody else ever does come. Lots of religious people who are self-satisfied. Wealthy people who are self-satisfied never do come. Yeah, yeah, yeah, go have your feast. What this parable says is this. They are asleep. And a thief is coming, and when he dies, he's going to steal every single thing they've got. Be ready. How? By accepting the invitation. By entering into his grace by faith. By being washed in the blood of the Lamb. By being redeemed. That makes you ready. Third thing it says is not just be alert and be ready, but be faithful. Be faithful. Who then is the faithful and sensible slave? Stop right there. One of the things I want you to know about that's going to happen here in this passage is there's going to be a contrast made, and it's a powerful contrast. And the contrast is going to be between the faithful slave, which I think is a picture of a redeemed person, a genuinely redeemed person, and a wicked or an evil slave, which is, I think, a picture of and an emblem of, if you will, a metaphor for an unredeemed person, an unregenerate heart. And I want to set the parable up this way before I even get into the elements of it. I think that what Jesus is saying, part of what he's saying in verse 45 to 51 is this. When I come, the ones who have been awakened from their slumber, the ones who have been made ready by the blood of the Lamb, who have been washed in the blood, who have been made new creatures in Jesus Christ, are going to be very easy to spot. It's going to be very easy for me to discern who is truly part of my life and getting their life for me, who has truly been made ready, and those who are sleeping. The way I'll be able to tell is, some people will be sleeping and some people will be awake. But here, it's bigger than that. There will be some people who will be faithful and some people who will be wicked. They will be faithless. And I'll be able to spot how they live as being the indicator of whether they've been made ready or not. I want to note something. Even as I say that, again, before I get into the dissemination of this parable, that you do not become ready by being faithful. You follow that? You do not become ready to have the king come for you by cranking out a lot of faithful behavior. It's bigger than that, actually. what I think this is saying as you catch the whole flow of it is this the ones who are alert will be faithful the ones who have been made ready will be easy to spot there will be faithfulness as it's described here flowing from their lives how can you tell? the alert from the apathetic the sleeping from the ready the sheep from the goats you can tell by this parable the faithless slave the faithful slave it's easy to see with that in mind let's all understand the elements of the parable who then is the faithful and sensible slave whom his master put in charge of his household to give them their food at the proper time stop right there the master in this parable is god the slave or the servant is every man not just redeemed people or unredeemed. Every man and every woman that was ever created upon the earth. And every man was put in charge. You see those words? Put in charge. What that means is this. They have been given a stewardship. And what they have been given a stewardship of, or what they have been put in charge of, is his own household, right in the text. His household, or her household. Her household or his household is his life. Going back, it's borrowing from the metaphor of verse 43. Be sure of this. If the head of the house, now it's not speaking of a real house where this man is there with his family. That's the image that is created. But I am the head of my own house, my own what? Life. I am the head of my own life. Every man, every woman has been put in charge of his own house, his own life. Say it this way. Every man, every woman, person has been given by God the gift of life. Every man and woman has been given by God breath. They've been given by God intellect and capacities and resources and emotions and a will to decide. Above all the things that God has given to every man and every woman is a capacity to know God and understand at some level who he is. Romans 1 chapter 19 affirms that powerfully. Not only have they been given a capacity to know God, they have also been given an invitation to come to the feast, to enter into grace, and to have access to God through Christ. The reality is this, that part of what this parable in the 45th verse is delineating for us is that we have a stewardship. It is our life. We've been put in charge of our own household, and in that dynamic, and in the context of that reality, we are accountable for what we do with the stewardship given to us. The sad fact is this. Romans 1.21 says, Many people, even though they knew God, will not honor Him as God, but they became futile in their speculations, and their heart was darkened and professing to be wise, they became fools. And what was issuing out of their life when they became a fool was this. they exchanged the glory of an incorruptible God for an image in the form of a corruptible man. For an image in the form of a corruptible man. I don't know what kind of images are conjured up in your mind, but it isn't like a statue or some little idol in a pagan temple somewhere. The image in the form of a corruptible man simply means this, that when they exchanged that for the glory of God, they said, God isn't God, I am. I am the measure of all things. I am the center of the universe. It's all me. Faithful slave, the truly redeemed, made ready by the blood of Christ person is different than that. The faithful slave made ready by the Spirit of God is one who having been given the stewardship of life and having been given the stewardship of grace and having been given the reality of God alive in them, transforming them from the inside having been given the gift of redemption uses that gift and that stewardship if you will to what to give them their food at the proper time and blessed is that slave who the master finds doing that when he comes doing what taking what god has given to them and giving it away that's how i can spot who's genuinely ready who's genuinely redeemed that's how I spot it. You don't get redeemed by being faithful, but those who are redeemed issue in that kind of life. It's real powerful, and it's real clear. Literally, this is speaking of people who give away what God's given them. Those who've been made ready or easy to spot, they give away what God gave them. The picture I have of creation and what God intended man and woman to be was this, God here, you've seen this illustration before, but I am here, this is me, and living dependently on him in this relationship of honoring God as God and I am not God, you are God. In this position, I get everything I could possibly need. I get all my hunger satisfied. I get all my thirsts quenched. and in this position there is not only life but there is power and as God infuses his life to me through the redemptive work of Christ making this kind of relationship possible from this relationship flows the very life of God that he's giving to me it is an absolute contradiction for someone to have the life of God in them the life of God being pulsed into them and have it just sit in there damned up completely and never issuing in life never issuing in faithfulness maybe the reason there isn't any life being issued maybe the reason there isn't any reality being issued any faithfulness being issued is because there isn't any life there isn't any relationship you've never been made ready this this picture is made even more graphic when we look at the evil slave verse 48 but if that evil slave says in his heart give me a break the master isn't coming for a long time which reveals what about him it reveals that he's still back in verse 43 asleep while the thief is coming and he's sitting in his house nodding off he still hasn't heard verse 43 and he's still up in verse 38 with the people in the days of noah who though the signs were there and the message was there, they went, yeah, yeah, yeah. Eating, drinking, marrying, and being given in marriage. Not alert, because he's not alert, he's not ready. Verse 49. And because of that, he begins to beat his fellow slaves and eat and drink with drunkards. I think this is a powerful verse. There is no way with a proliferation of words that I can make this any bigger than it is, and so I'm just going to give you the concept and believe that the Spirit of God is going to make it as big for you as it is for me. I believe that what verse 49 is revealing here is a posture of life. It is a view of life and a way of life that marks out for us, and it will mark out for God in that final day, the heart of the unredeemed. It is a posture of life that will separate the real from the false, the sheep from the goats. It is a posture of life that will mark out those who are not ready and those who are still sleeping. And the posture is, the life view is this, that everything I have and everything I am is fundamentally and absolutely for me. Serve you? Ah, well, I might serve you. If my serving you serves me, I might serve you. Serve you? You don't get it. Everything in my life that I have and that I am is for me. So what I'm going to do is use you to feed me and to satisfy me, and I'm going to use you to quench my thirsts because everything is for me. In fact, if in my using you, you still don't feed me, and if in my using you, you still don't satisfy my thirst, I might even abuse you. And he went out and began to beat his fellow slaves. He didn't serve his fellow slaves. He beat, abused, and used his fellow slaves. The primary posture that marks out the heart of the unredeemed, and I don't care if they're going to church every Sunday, that is not how you tell if they're redeemed or not. I don't care if they read the Bible every day. That is not how you tell if they're redeemed or not. The fundamental life posture that will mark out those who have been given the life of God, been made ready by the blood of the Lamb, is that they will be a faithful slave, not an evil one. And an evil one is easy to spot. They are a consumer. They are a taker. They are a drainer. They are not a giver. They are not a servant. They are not a fueler. They eat and drink with drunkards. The picture I get is this. It's like their whole life posture is this. Everything here is for me, and it's a pulling in to me. All of my life is this. Don't wonder what you're looking at when you look at that. I don't care if they go to church every Sunday. When you're looking at this, you're not looking at somebody who's been made ready by the blood. the pasture of a truly redeemed made ready by the blood of the lamb person is this getting their life from god dependent on him not striving to produce these behaviors but getting their life from god from them flows the life that god is giving them and flows of the service that god has poured into them and the faithfulness and everything else frank tillipaw in his book the church unleashed identified a dynamic in that church in that book called a consumer mentality and what he called it in his book was a cultural reality saying basically this we need to understand that because we live in america there has been through the generations developed in america an overpowering and overwhelming consumer mentality that just consumes. And he went on to say that that consumer mentality has crept into the church and leavened it in ways that we don't even understand and don't even see anymore. He began to give examples of how even now we advertise our church and try to get people to come to our church by promising to satisfy all of their consumer needs. It becomes like McDonald's. We're McChurch. You know, and over 5 billion served. That's what we're here for. Just make sure you get your spiritual hamburgers every week, you know. And we'll even make it cheap. So it costs you nothing. I agree with Frank Tillepaw that a consumer mentality has crept into the church. And I agree with him that it's a cultural reality. But I would take it a step further than he did, past that consumer mentality being a cultural reality. According to this particular passage, it is indicated to me and to us that it's an anthropological reality, meaning it is a common to man around the globe reality that man in an unredeemed condition has no other choice than to do this, bring it and consume it, and everything is here for me to satisfy me. The only person who could possibly give anything is the one who is already satisfied and already full and already quenched in his thirst because they're getting their life from God, the only source of any of those things. Jesus is saying here among other things that when I come one of the ways I'll be able to sort out the sleeping from the ready the redeemed from the lost, the sheep from the goats and the faithful from the wicked will be their posture of life an evil slave it's consumption it's consumption and a redeemed born of the blood of the lamb slave getting his life from God is giving it away feeding his household those who are in his life verse 50 says this the master of that slave which slave? the unprepared, unready, sleeping wicked slave who's consuming his whole life the master of that slave will come on a day when he doesn't know the reason he won't know is why because he's sleeping he'll come when he doesn't expect him and at an hour where that he does not know verse 51 and he shall cut him in pieces oh you know i i really do get involved in and i and i really enjoy kind of breaking texts apart and getting into the syntax and it really does reveal things sometimes but sometimes the the most profound truth jumps off the page at you if you just ask yourself questions how does that feel you know i mean i i hear that and i kind of go it sounds like you're a little angry there cut them to pieces cut them to pieces i mean there isn't anything you know kind of judicial even about this you know he could have just said and when this angry slave comes and i separate the the true slaves from the uh from from the uh false slaves and all that kind of stuff i will place those who are evil over here and and there will be a no it won't be so good but you're going to be there and i'm sorry the good ones are over here I'm going to cut them to pieces. The picture I get is of a fisherman netting fish, pulls all the fish in, and what he's going for is, I don't know, trout. Now, if you fish with trout with a net, you're going to be in a lot of trouble. But I got trout in my pictures, so in my pictures I get to do what I want. So all these good fish are up, but in the middle of all this good, wonderful fish, there's this carp. And the fisherman takes the fish, and I don't even want to throw it back in the water because it's just going to reproduce and make more of these grubes. Cut it in half and throw it away. There's an anger in this. Why? Why? I tried to get in touch with that. What has God angry about here, this edge here? Cut him to pieces. I'm not sure, but here's what I think. I think part of what God's saying is this. In a world where people are physically hungry and in a world where people are spiritually starving, they don't hear the word you hear. They don't get the food you get physically or spiritually. And then in that world where I see some people, where some are starving, I see others eating and eating and eating, and it's never enough. And even when they're full and well over what they need, it's never good enough. All you do is consume and consume and consume. That makes me angry. And it is a mark that what I created man and woman to be has been absolutely lost. And that kind of person is the antithesis of what I created. Because what I created even in the garden and what I died for so that it could be bought back were men and women who would find the fullness of their humanity in relationship to God, getting their life from Him. And as the life of God was poured to them, the life of God was flowing from them. That is a human being that I created. And when I see this, it is absolutely opposite what I created. It is a defilement. You have embezzled my gifts. I think that's where the anger is coming from. And in a world where I see people who are thirsty and dry and parched, physically and spiritually, and all you do is drink and drink and drink and drink. You drink enough and it just makes you dull. You eat enough and it makes you fat. and it's the antithesis of what i created spiritually men and women to be in the light of my coming at the end of the age and the light of my coming for you at the end of your age at the end of your day what i'm calling you to is to be alert be ready not by your striving to be ready and even striving to be striving to be faithful but be ready by the blood of the lamb having come to the feast to Receive your life from him and be faithful. And by the way, it says of the faithful slave, verse 47, I love this, Truly I say to you that he will put him, the faithful slave, in charge of all his possessions, of all the king's possessions, meaning this, that the true believers will in eternity rule and reign as kings and priests with Christ forever. They're the ones who are going to rule, not the consumers. After those three words comes a word to us in Luke. It is the parallel passage of Matthew 24, and I am delighted to be able to bring it because after those three words comes another word, and that is this, be confident. Be confident. Confident of what? That being alert and being ready and being faithful will be worth it all. Chapter 12 of Luke, verse 36. Again, as I read the 36th verse, you'll pick up that we're talking about the same parable. And be like men who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast, so that they may immediately open the door to him when he comes and knocks. Blessed are those slaves whom the master shall find on the alert when he comes. Truly I say to you, now get this, that he, that is Jesus, not the slave, he, that is Jesus, will gird himself to serve. Jesus now, at the end of the age, at the end of my day, is going to have this posture with me in heaven. He's going to gird himself to serve. And he's going to have them, who's them, the faithful slaves who've been made ready by the blood of the Lamb and have used the life that God gave them to give away all their life. He's going to recline them at table, and he will come up to them and wait on them for all eternity. Be alert, be ready, be faithful, and be confident of what? That it will be worth it all, because he's going to serve me. You know what? The picture I have of this whole thing is this, That in this life that I live, energized by the Spirit, my life being drawn from Him, redeemed by the blood of the Lamb, that right now, that as long as God gives me breath and He gives me energy to do and live, whatever, the posture of life for me is to give away what God has given me. Now note, there are times in my life and in yours where I, because of the battle even, come up wounded and bleeding and exhausted and I have nothing to give. What that does is it doesn't make me guilty because I don't have anything to give right now. it does drive me right back to Jesus to get my life from him, to get healed from him, and then go back to do it. But the posture of life of the redeemed is to serve, and that's what I'm going to do as long as thou lendest me breath. But in that day, when the final parousia comes, or my final day comes, and I see him face to face, I'm going to be able to put it all down. And again, I get these goofy pictures, but... I'll tell you the actual picture. Did any of you watch the movie Glory? There was this one piece in the movie Glory where they were in a hospital in the Civil War, and there were all these broken bodies all over the place. And I don't know why, but that's the picture I have in my mind of that final day when I'm face to face, and all the warriors, all the faithful slaves who got their life from Jesus and gave the life that God gave them all their life are kind of dragging themselves in. And some of the warriors in that final day are weary, and some of them are wounded. and some of them are bleeding from battle and some of them haven't been beaten up quite that bad. They were faithful. But in that final day, we kind of all come in that tent together and we can kind of let the sword fall down at our side because we don't need to swing it anymore and we can put the shield of faith away because the fiery darts of the enemy have been quenched forever and ever and the armor of God that I've been wearing, I can put it aside and it's almost, I don't know how theologically correct this is, but the picture in my mind is, in that final day, it's like I'm too tired to even party. And I'm just kind of laying there, like this picture I have of the Civil War in the movie Glory. Sorry. But as I'm sitting there, when my eyes close, all of a sudden I sense a touch, and so will you, and I'll sense a lifting, and so will you, and all of a sudden I'll sense a soothing in my body, and a healing in my body, and a feeding of my spirit, and a quenching of my thirst, and I'll look up and it will be Jesus himself alone who has girded himself to serve me. That is unbelievable. And in that day, that final day, Revelation 7, verse 16 and 17, Revelation 16 and 17 is speaking of the saints who have been faithful during the incredible time of the tribulation. And it says, finally, when they are brought to the Lamb, It says this, they shall in that day hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the sun beat down on them, nor any heat, for the Lamb in the center of the throne shall be their shepherd, and he shall guide them to springs of living water and shall wipe away every tear from their eyes. And all through this, one of the things I've said is that this metaphor separates the true from the false, and the faithful slave is the one who serves. but you know I got to be real honest with you I'm mindful of the fact that believers redeemed people I sometimes we forget who we are and sometimes even though we're redeemed and we have been made ready we forget whose we are and even though we are ready in terms of salvation and we do genuinely love Jesus we do get leavened by the realities and the humdrum realities of life and every once in a while even the redeemed would do well to hear a word like this that we can come underneath this and take a look at it and say lord you need to come to my heart and realign it and i need to have my heart realigned to the compass of the kingdom and the compass of the king because sometimes jesus because of the world i live in and the realities that's kind of dull me too and lull me to sleep sometimes i don't know what's north and what's south and i don't know what's up and what's down and I don't want to know what's real and what's not and sometimes I don't know what matters and what doesn't and I need you to come to me today as one who has been made ready but I'll tell you God my posture hasn't been that of a faithful slave and it doesn't mean you're unredeemed if you're genuinely redeemed it does mean that maybe you've been lulled to sleep and it's time for you in that sense to wake up to you're going to spend eternity being served now is the time to give away what God's given you? Simple question. It's kind of direct. It needs to be stated. It's consistent with the text. Are you alert? Are you ready? Are you a faithful slave? Bring it to God and let him lay it at your heart at whatever level it needs to be laid. Let's pray. Stand with me as we close, would you? Jesus, a text like this can be applied at so many levels, to unredeemed people, to redeemed people, and I don't know how to sort it all out for the individuals here. That's where I'm thankful that we can call on your spirit right now and ask that you would take your word and not allow it to return void in any single heart here. For those who may be unredeemed and are like the man or woman who, in the context of their life, are just asleep, I pray that the message that a thief is coming to take all of their props other than Jesus would stir in them the reality that they need to come to the source of life today, that they need to come to the feast that has been spread for them, the grace of God by the blood of Jesus, allowing them to have access to God the Father through faith in Christ. Father, I am also mindful of redeemed people, genuinely redeemed, who, like me sometimes, forget who we are and whose we are, Being dulled and lulled to sleep ourselves by the realities of life. We fall asleep. Though we are faithful slaves, we start acting like consumers. God, generate in us a spirit that is born of you, that gives away for free what you have given us for free. Amen. Thank you.
