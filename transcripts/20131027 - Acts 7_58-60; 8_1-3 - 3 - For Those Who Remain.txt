And when they had driven Stephen out of the city, they began stoning him. And then they went on stoning him as he called upon the Lord and said, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. Then falling on his knees, he cried out with a loud voice, Lord, do not hold this sin against them. Having said this, he fell asleep. Saul was in hearty agreement with putting him to death. And on that day, a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. Some devout men buried Stephen and made loud lamentation over him. But Saul began ravaging the church, entering house after house, and dragging off men and women, he would put them in prison. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Let's pray as we go to the word. Lord, for spirit of revelation, I pray, that by your Spirit you would reveal to us the things we need to see and the things we need to know so we can live the way you've called us to in hope and faith. I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. I called it last week a dying grace for a dying moment, which is exactly what Stephen got, a dying grace in his dying moment on his darkest day, when at the moment of his death, his death that we kind of detailed last week, he was stoned to death. He gazed intently into heaven, says verse 55 of Acts chapter 7, and saw three things that are really good to see because it's really good to know when you're dying that the heavens are open and that they're open for you. And after he saw that, he saw also the glory of God. It was the unveiled glory, nothing hidden about it on this day. And then he saw Jesus standing at the right hand of God as if to say in his standing, Stephen, I will accompany you here on this, your darkest day. I will be with you through this day. I will empower you for this day. I will receive you home this day. So he stands up. That is Jesus in this vision John is getting at his death as if to say, this your darkest day, Stephen. Don't be afraid. You're not alone. You've nothing to fear because when you fall asleep, interesting way Luke said it, he's being stoned, but he falls asleep. When you fall asleep, you will wake up. And when you do, I will be there. I will meet you at the door. So Jesus stands up and Stephen, in the moment of his death, got to see all that. I called it a dying grace on his dying day, on his darkest day, which is a wonderful way to die, to in your dying be able to see the glory of God and Jesus standing. But that's not what everyone saw that day. Only Stephen saw that. Only Stephen saw the heavens and the glory because everyone else, dial into this, just kind of make the scene real in your mind, because everyone else that day saw, not the glory and the heavens, they saw the violence and the anger, they saw the stoning of Stephen, and that's all they could see that day. It raises the question of the day as we move now into the text that Peggy just read. What about them? What about those who remain, the living, who had to watch Stephen die the way he died? It was a gruesome way to die, and final, like all death is. But after he died, as bad as that was, it got worse. According to the text Peggy just right indeed, they didn't even have time to bury the body of Stephen, says verse 1 of chapter 8. Because on that very day that Stephen was stoned, it says, a great persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem as all of the anger, I think, that had been kind of held back that they'd been holding in check since Acts chapter 2, particularly this anger in the hearts of the council that earlier had wanted to slay and wanted to kill so desperately. Peter and John, all that held back stuff just blew. And people like Saul, and I'm hoping most of you know that reference to Saul, he is the guy who eventually becomes Paul, which makes this story incredible. It kind of ripple, let that ripple out. But Saul in this scene just kind of added fuel to this fire because he was in hearty agreement with stoning Stephen. His death was a good thing. He thought, let's do it again. Let's find some more people like him and do to them what we just did to Stephen. So they ran for their lives. It says at the end of verse 1, they just scattered all over throughout all of Judea and Samaritans who, except the apostles, who stayed back for a number of reasons. One was to bury the body of Stephen because somebody had to do that to show some respect and to cry out to God with great loud lamentation. That second verse says, for the friend who was dead, it was a horrible way to die. It was a disturbing thing to see because they didn't see what Stephen got to see brings me back to this question, so what about them? What about those who remain? What do they get to see? What do they need to know? Not on their dying day. I hope on my dying day I'll see all that stuff. I think you will. I want to know what I can see on my living day. On this day when Saul is ravaging the churches and me as well when I'm almost envious of Stephen. Not when he was being stoned. I'm almost envious now of Stephen because he's done and he's home and I'm not. Stephen got what we called a dying grace for his dying moment when the veil was pulled back and saw the heavens open, the glory of God and Jesus standing, and I'm glad he saw that. well what about a living grace i need a living grace for my living moments not just for that dark day um when i die but for this dark day when i live to somehow be able to see that the heavens are open for me today that the glory is real not just in my dying day but in this day and that maybe Jesus is standing as if he's helping me now. Not just then. I'd like to see that. Well, in order to see that, I'm going to bring you to another vision in the scriptures to introduce you to another apostle. And I'll let this in because this is fascinating. This apostle I want to introduce you to was there in Acts chapter 8 when Stephen was stoned, but he was one who, unlike Stephen, had to remain. Stephen saw the vision and got to go home, as it were, but this guy had to stay. His name was John, the apostle John, who later in his life would get a vision of his own, a revelation is what he called it. And in many respects, the revelation that John got about Jesus was very similar to Stephen's vision. A lot of the components were the same. In fact, it's one of the reasons I kind of thought of John, because as I was going through Stephen's vision, I thought, this is very familiar to and similar to John's vision in the Revelation. Indeed, at one point in Revelation 5, John is getting this vision into heaven, actually. And he's not dying. He's living. He's going to live for a while. He gets a vision into heaven, and he says, I see, among other things, I see a door, and it is, guess what, open, because the heavens are open. I see a throne, and guess what? It is occupied, and I see a lamb, and guess what? It is what? Standing. Same kind of thing, standing as if slain, as if slain. It's weird, because it looks like it's slain, but it's standing. Oh, it's because it's alive. It's been raised from the dead. But John's vision, unlike Stephen's vision, was not for the dying. It was not a vision for John on his dying day. It was a vision for John on his living day. Because there's some things you need to see and know, not just on your dying day, but on your living day. Because John's vision was for the living for those like you and like me who remain, who have to go through. Much like John himself, who had to go through, who he had to remain. Because John, I don't know if you remember this about John, but every one of the disciples, the original apostles, died a lot like Stephen. They weren't all stoned, but they all died a martyr's death. They were murdered. They were executed. John was the only one who didn't experience that. Instead, John ended up dying a very old man, but in exile. alone on this island called Patmos, and it was on this island called Patmos that God gave him a gift. That's like God gave Stephen a gift on his darkest day in this long journey waiting to go home. God gave to John a vision, a revelation, if you will. Again, it wasn't a revelation for dying. It was a revelation for living, not for that final day, but for this day, and it's a vision I want to try to help you see as well as you go through and I go through and we go through our living. It's called the Revelation. Actually became a book in the Bible, very weird book to be sure if you've ever tried to read it and people have done some very weird things with the book. But the word Revelation simply means to unveil, just to reveal something. And while you can get really lost in lots of weird things in the book of Revelation, the primary revelation or the point of the revelation that John was given was to unveil or to reveal primarily Jesus, specifically to a group of people. It's a very specific word of struggling churches in Asia Minor. There were seven churches in all that John was specifically receiving this vision for, so he could give it to them. And these people in Asia Minor were a struggling group of people who, because of Rome's relentless commitment to try and literally wipe them off the face of the earth had begun to wonder, much like maybe the church in Acts 8, when they were being scattered, began to wonder if it's worth it at all. Are God's promises true? What we're hoping in, is it real? And so this revelation was given to John so he could give it to these churches to encourage them. but know also this, God is giving this revelation to John about who Jesus is in his living moment for John as well, to help him press through because he was in a difficult place as well, being on the island of Patmos, having to remain. So the vision comes to him, I think, with this intent from God to reignite in him a fire that quite possibly had become a flickering flame to reignite and reenlist the energies of this gifted and faithful servant of God who I think possibly had come to believe that his usefulness in kingdom causes used to be, wasn't anymore, and who maybe had begun to wonder a little bit if it's worth it at all. Let me explain why I think that's at least a possibility. As we begin to dive into his revelation, begins in the 10th verse of Revelation 1. He says this, I, John, was on the island called Patmos. And Patmos, being there, explains why he might have been wondering if it's worth it all. It was, in fact, a barren place, a rocky island 40 miles off the coast of Asia Minor in the Aegean Sea. It was a penal colony. It means it was a prison island. And banishment to such a place was a common form of punishment in the Roman Empire. If your crime was political, you might have some freedom on this island. If it was a criminal issue, some kind of hard labor would be your experience. People debate which circumstance John was living under. the fact is this. It doesn't matter, actually, because at the end of the day, the case for him, the issue for him was this. He's a long way from home, from the people he loves, and even more, he's a long way from where it all began. That is his journey of faith. Think back with me now to where it all began for him. There he was, a pretty young man, Jesus. This Nazarene said, come follow me, and he did. He'd been with Jesus, described in one of the Gospels as the disciple that Jesus loved. He'd heard Jesus preach with authority, minister with grace, healed the sick. He'd even seen Jesus raised the dead. He was there, was this John at Pentecost that we were examining a few weeks ago in Acts chapter 2 and the clothing with power from on high that was the promise of the Father had arrived. He was there. He saw that experience. It was a recipient of it. And they were all, those young people, as this thing was exploding, so full of hope and confidence, two visions, honestly, of a changed world, the kingdom coming to earth, right here and right now. Hard to imagine John had preached in Jesus' name and seen results. He'd planted churches. He'd written a gospel that bore his name, the gospel of John and three epistles as well. But all of that, as you're sitting on Patmos, is a long time ago. Indeed, sitting on Patmos had to make the events of Pentecost feel like a lifetime ago. Was it even, I don't know, was that even real? So here he is, banished to a prison island in isolated exile, forced to suffer, not death like Stephen. Stephen, that was horrible. But that's not what he suffered. He suffered a different thing. He suffered this sense of uselessness, of irrelevance, of aloneness. He couldn't use his gifts of preaching and teaching, not on the island. I'm just kind of shackled here. My mouth won't go anywhere. Nobody's going to hear what I have to say. The joys and encouragements of fellowship and worship and learning and fellowship of people in a community of faith all gone, all cut off. The euphoria of Pentecost clearly faded. In fact, if I'm to tell the truth, as I look at the world from my vantage point, would say, John, I'm the island of Patmos, and admittedly, I don't see everything's going on, but to me, it looks like Rome is the ascendant power now in the church, at least to me, looks like a weak and ineffective force against unstoppable evil. I thought the kingdom had come I thought we would change the world It looked so possible It looked probable actually At Pentecost 3000 were saved in one day So in your mind's eyes You pull all this together Let the island of Patmos Stand as the place Of disappointment As a place where you are forced to face alone. Dreams unfulfilled, hopes dashed. It is a place of disillusionment and discouragement, maybe even anger at God, because while Stephen got a vision back in Acts chapter 8 of the glory of God and Jesus standing as he was dying, which was nice for him, we're still here being ravaged, as it were, not by Saul anymore, but by Rome, but by life now. But now as we continue to get the picture of what's unfolding here, I want you to dial into this, kind of go ahead a little bit in the story here because John, even at the end of this vision that he's about to get, would never leave this island. Hey, he's going to die in this place, in this place of not what I expected and not what I wanted. So it's not a story of rags to riches. I'm not going to tell you, he got set free. That's not the story here. The circumstances of John's life will never change, but something does change for John because he gets to see something. And in the seeing it, he comes to know something, something actually that he knew before but had forgotten like you do and I do, so you need to see it again because the island of Patmos, whatever else it was, was the place where Jesus was unveiled to him, revealed to him. And what he saw was much like what Stephen saw on his dying day, but it wasn't a vision designed to help John die. It was a vision designed to help John live because he says in Revelation 1, verse 10, this. I was in the Spirit on Lord's Day. Look at it on the screen. When I heard a voice behind me, a loud voice, like the sound of a trumpet saying, write down what you see, John, and send it to the churches. So I turned to see the voice, which is weird. He saw the voice, and the first thing I saw were seven golden lampstands, and in the middle of the lampstands was one like the Son of Man. His robe was reaching to his feet and his chest was girded with a golden sash and as good as John was with words. You just need to know here as I continue on that his words won't do justice to what he actually saw because he's trying to describe here that which is indescribable when he says in verse 14 that his head and his hair were like wool, white as snow, and his eyes were like fire as feet, burnished bronze, his voice like the sound of many waters, and his words like a sword that was piercing, his face shone like the sun, shining in its full strength. But you need to know when I actually saw him, I think John would say, I couldn't say anything. Indeed, I fell at his feet like a dead man because it was the strangest thing. This is my paraphrase of this next part here. It's actually the best thing because when I fell at his feet like a dead man, he laid his right hand on me. He tapped me on the shoulder and said, don't be afraid. John, it's me. Remember me? Well, let me remind you who I am because I am the first and the last. I am the alpha and omega. I am the living one, and yes, I was in fact dead. But you take a real good look right now, John, because I am alive forevermore. And to top it all off, I have in my hand the keys of death and Hades, death and hell, which is at least part of why Stephen, when he died, saw the heavens and they were open because Jesus opened them with the keys from death and hell, all of which means this, John, you're gonna be okay. So is my church. So are these seven churches that I'm giving you this vision to give to them, but so is my church eternal, the big C church. And I know, John, that you all got scattered that day that Stephen died back in Acts chapter 8, and I heard your loud laments that came to my ears, and I know that right now, it looks like Rome is winning this battle, but they will not win the war. In fact, the war is already over. I know you can't see that right now, but it is, because I have in my hand the keys of death and hell. And again, dial in as this is coming to him, this important note, that when this whole vision is over, and the unveiling of Christ to him is complete. Not one single thing will have changed in John's physical circumstance. He is still on the island of Patmos. Rome is still in control, and Stephen is still dead, but John has come alive because he saw something he needed to see, not for his dying day. He saw something he needed to see for his living day, and what he saw, among other things, was this, going back to Revelation 5, he saw a door, and it was open. He saw a throne, and it was occupied. He saw a lamb standing as if slain, but it was risen. And all of those things he saw, he had seen before. He had known before, but here's the deal about all that. He needed to see it again. He needed to see it again, and so do you. And so do I. George MacDonald, in his book entitled Unspoken Sermons, says this about visions. Visions, if they are truly visions and not wish fulfillment dreams, make things happen. By virtue of this vision, John the exiled becomes John the empowered. Rome has shut John away so his churches could neither see him nor hear him. but the Holy Spirit filled John's eyes with sights and sounds and his mind with speech that has given sight and speech to Christians ever since. The banishing decree of Rome was itself banished. Anybody can dream up a happy ending to a story, but it's a cruel joke, these happy endings, if you're actually being oppressed because that happy ending you made up isn't real. A vision, though, sees what is actually there, not what frustration or disappointment wish were there. In true visions, we get to see what's real. And this is what he saw. Away from his churches, not knowing how they were doing, he sees the penetrating attentive eyes of Christ, Tired and weak from his own confinement, he sees the rock-solid, burnished bronze, unshakable feet of his Lord, accustomed to speaking with authority to his prone-to-wanderers sheep. But now with no voice at all, he hears the voice of Christ, the Lord of the church, and it sounds like the rushing of many waters and living at the mercy of Rome's sword. He sees the word of God proceeding like a sword from the mouth of Christ and not returning void. But the really good news in all of this is that John wrote it all down so he could see it too. So let me tell you what he saw, among other things, this, verse 13. I saw this, first of all, one like the Son of Man, verse 13, standing in the middle of the lampstands. The lampstands, you probably know, are the seven churches for whom he got this revelation of Asia Minor. They are the seven churches, but they are also the church. They are us. They are us. And you need to know where the Son of Man was standing in the context of the seven lampstands. He was standing in the middle of them. He's right in the middle of it. All of our stuff, he's in the middle of this. all the glory of it, all the frailty of it, all the mess of it. He's in the middle of it, and it would be really good if we could see that, remember that, and remember also this verse 13, that he's clothed with a robe, reaching to his feet, and girded across his chest with a golden sash, which is the garb of both a king and a priest. As a king, it communicates something, and that is this, he has a right to rule. He's not asking you or me. As a priest, his priestly function is, among other things, to present his church to God and God to his church, his hair. John goes on, he's like wool, white as snow, which speaks to two things. The white hair speaks to age, but not just age. It speaks to wisdom. You have to have them both. Some people are old and they're stupid. this is a symbol of someone who is old he is the ancient of days but there's wisdom is what's being communicated in the symbol which means he knows he knows and his eyes are like fire which means he sees so he knows and he sees and i know says god to john through this all about your present circumstance. I know all about Patmos and Rome, and I know all about the death of Stephen, and I know your deeds. Revelation 2 verse 2, as he begins to speak to the churches, and he could speak it to us, open door. I know your deeds. I know what you're good at. I know what you're bad at. I know your perseverance and your toil, and that you dwell where Satan's throne is. It's a hard place to get people to listen to the truth of God's life and grace, but I also know the rest of the story, John. Here's why I know it, because I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I am the ancient of days. And what I know, John, love you, but what I know that you don't know and what I see that you can't see is that this thing you're in right now is not the end of the story. It's not the end of the big story, but it's not the end of your story either because Patmos, as discouraging and scary as it is, does not have the power to define your identity. It does not have the power to determine your destiny. His hair, white like wool, like snow, means he knows. His eyes, like a flame of fire, means he sees. Which brings me to one of my favorite stories of all time about my dad. Who knows and could see. I was playing football in high school. I told you this story before. I was a 185 pound tackle which is ridiculous yeah thank you on a team that stunk in two years of varsity football I think we won two games in two years on one memorable week we were about to play a school named Fenger High School that hadn't lost a game in two years when in the middle of the week an article appeared in the Chicago Sun-Times featuring a guy who played tackle for them which means I'm going to go against this guy he was about 6'5, 260 high school kid. Yeah, going to Michigan on a full ride, and yeah, shut up. But in those days, it was pretty common to play both ways. What that means is you play on offense and defense, and I did that, and it wasn't because I was good, it was because we stunk. And so this guy was going to be my guy all day, both ways, every play, and I remember lots of things about that day. It was really hot. The field was dusty. It was hard as a rock. We lost the game. It wasn't close. I held my ground, but I got pounded. There's another thing I remember about the day. It's weird that I remember it, and I feel this stuff come up in me. I'm 60 years old. I remember my dad was there. Part of the reason I remember him being there wasn't just that he was there. It was that nobody else was. Honestly, I mean, you know, the guy's girlfriends would come, and their moms and dad's, I sit there, but it was pretty much the only people who came and watched us play, so I could see him, and he always kind of did this thing, and in this particular day, he did what he did, because he would stand at the top of the bleachers, following the line of scrimmage. You just stand up there, and I could act like I didn't look at him, but I could see him up there, and he would just follow the line of scrimmage, up and down the field all day long, every play, and in the terms of the analogy, and how it applies to the vision John's getting, my dad didn't come down and take me out of this hard situation. He didn't rescue me. He didn't rescue John. God didn't rescue Stephen. But he was up in the stands watching this whole thing, watching a line of scrimmage. And I didn't have this kind of terminology then, but what I know now is it's almost like his eyes. My dad's eyes were like a flame of fire because he saw. And his hair was white like wool because he was old. I mean, dads are old. I mean, he's actually, when I go back, he wasn't that old. But when I was there, he was old. his eyes were on me which many saw his hair was white which means he knew and what he knew among other things was this he knew that we would lose the game before the game he knew he had a prophetic gift and he knew that I was getting pounded sometimes embarrassed and he knew that I would be discouraged and he knew I might even want to quit but he also knew some things I didn't know because he was the ancient of days. And he saw some things I couldn't see because I was 17. And I didn't have the big picture when I'm 17 of life because all I could see was, I'm getting pounded. All I could see was today. All I could see was Pat Moss. And what my dad knew that I didn't know and what he saw that I couldn't see was that this game I was playing that felt like the end to me, Indeed, that entire season, what he knew and saw was that game that season did not have the power to define my identity or determine my destiny, and it helped me to know, even though I didn't know it, it helped me to know he knew it. He was the Ancient of Day. See, I was getting pounded, says John, on the island of Patmos. My dreams were dashed, my hopes destroyed. I was beginning to wonder if it was worth it at all. But then I turned to see a voice. And having turned, I saw him right at the top of the bleachers, right in the middle of the lampstands. And his hair, like wool, was white as snow. He knew, and his eyes were like a flame of fire. He saw, and what he knew that I didn't know, and what he saw that I couldn't see was at this place of shattered dreams and bitter disappointment called Patmos did not have the power to define John's identity or determine his destiny because I know the rest of the story says the ancient of days, the Lord of the church, and the rest of the story is this. We win, John. So write what you see and tell it to the churches. Be faithful to the end. I'm so glad he was because now we get to see it. 2,000 years later, and we get to hear it, that his feet were like burnished bronze. It says in verse 15, feet burnished bronze, direct reference, you guys, to a dream that Daniel had of Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar, who in Daniel's dream was enormous. In Daniel's dream, Nebuchadnezzar was invincible, but his feet were of clay. So his foundations were shaky, Like Rome, like every other scary thing in this world that seems to have so much power, Nebuchadnezzar's feet were of clay, so he fell, so did Rome. But the foundation upon which the kingdom of God is built, and your future hopes rely, John is solid, unshakable. His feet were burnished bronze. His voice was like the sound of many waters. And while I couldn't tell you the words he said, it's almost like the words didn't matter. His words were piercing me like a sword, and his face was shining like the sun in the fullness of his strength. And then I see John stopping here again and saying, you know, I'm doing the best I can to come up with words to describe what is indescribable. But I want you to know, when I actually saw him, I didn't say anything. I just fell at his feet like a dead man. But then he tapped me on the shoulder and said, John, don't be afraid. It's me. Remember me? I am the Alpha, the Omega, the first and last. I am the living one. I was dead, but I'm alive forevermore. I have in my hands the keys of death and hell, which means you're going to be okay. And so is my church. Let me close with a question. What is your place of disappointment? Maybe live in there right now. It's not called Patmos. It's called something else. What is your place of disillusionment and discouragement that's convinced you, I'm done. I'm done. That's convinced you, I can't. I can't. Here's the word. This is the word of the Lord. Don't be afraid. It's me. remember me I am the Alpha and Omega I was there at the beginning I'll be there at the end I am the first and the last I am the ancient of days which means among other things this I know some things you don't know says God I see some things you don't see you can't see you can't see This will make you blind. You just can't see these things. And what I know that you don't know, and what I see that you can't see, is that this place you're in right now does not have the power to define your identity or determine your destiny. His hair, white like wool, like snow, because he knows. His eyes, flaming like fire, because he sees. indeed he sees you right here right now can you see him God help us see would you stand with me as we close at the beginning of the sermon I prayed for a spirit of revelation and maybe now you know why And so let me close with that same prayer. God, by your spirit, I'll pull back the veil. I pray you help us see what we can't see unless you help us see it. Because what we need to see is you. We want to remember you. We want to see you. And I pray that revelation, I pray that revealing, that unveiling of you would come to the people among us who are like John, who are in that place of discouragement and just because of the pain and confusion and whatever just can't see it. I pray, God, that spirit be released on people who aren't actually even interested in you, aren't pursuing, God, that you would show them right now, even now, who you are. One day you would do it to Saul, the guy who gave hearty approval of Stephen's death. You would open up the veil and go, do you know what you're doing? No, you don't. And bring life. And so we pray with revelation there would come life and even more and more life. and we pray these things in Jesus' name and all God's people said, amen. Amen.
