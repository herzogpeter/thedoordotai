Would you open your Bibles to the book of Luke, chapter 1, as we finish the word that I began in this passage a couple of weeks ago. As you turn, I'd like to just pray as we begin. Father, I thank you for the gifts that really do surround this season. And many of us do think of things under a tree. But we think most of all of your Son and how impacted this world has been because of that gift and how changed we have been because of that gift. I pray for an anointing by your Spirit as we break open your Word and look at another facet of that event this morning. I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, the event of Christmas is over. Packages are opened, I would suppose, in most of our families. My question would be this. What did Christmas cost you this year? All the fun of it's over, now you have to pay for it. Pay too much? Did Christmas this year cost more than you thought it would? Well, I think most of you would respond, it always does. Consider this. It always has. 2,000 years ago, the original Christmas prophecy promise came to us in Luke chapter 1 to a virgin named Mary. And the promise was this, fourfold. Number one, Mary, the Son of God is going to do something that you could never imagine. It's this. He is going to come alive inside of you. Luke chapter 1, verse 31. and behold, you will conceive in your womb. More than that, this life that is going to come to you is going to grow in you, Mary, for you will bear a son. The word bear there means to carry it, to fruit. And in the carrying of it, this life growing in you is going to stretch you, and it is going to change you and mark you, and sometimes it might even scar you. There will be times it will thrill you, but Mary, this life growing in you is going to change the way you walk. But it's not going to end there. The life that comes to you and grows in you is going to come from you. And when he does, verse 31, you will name his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sin. And the ultimate expression of this is this, that this life coming from you will then change your world around you. And the changing of the world around you from this life coming from you will not necessarily be Mary because you are great, but because He is great, verse 32, and He will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to Him the throne of His father David, and of His kingdom there shall be no end, for it will be forever and ever. We called that two weeks ago the Mary miracle. But what we discovered two weeks ago was that the real glory of this miracle is not in simply observing it from a distance happening in Mary, but that that very miracle can happen and has happened to many of us. I'm going to suppose most of us in this room already. That miracle has happened for the very same Son of God. Born in Mary has been, since He was born in Mary, born in me and born in us. We have been born, 1 Peter 1. We have been born spiritually of a righteous seed. It's Christ living in you, which is your hope of glory, Colossians 1. Not only has the same life that came to Mary and is growing in her, grew in her physically, growing in us spiritually, come to her, but it's growing in us as well. And it's coming from us as well, and it's changing our world around us as well. And it's not because we're so great, but the one who has been born in us, the life of God that has come to us and grown in us and come from us, He is great, and His kingdom will have no end. His work in our lives will have no end. And because of that truth of life coming and growing and coming from, Mary broke out in song. And we discovered two weeks ago that Mary's song became our song. Our soul exalts the Lord, and our spirit has rejoiced in God our Savior, for He has regarded our humble state. For the mighty one of God has done great things for us. For the same life he put in Mary he put in us. The same life that grew in her grew in us, came from us, and is changing the world around us. But Mary, to that promise of life coming, needed to respond. And she did respond in verse 38 when she said this. As I consider the possibility of this life coming to me, I say yes. Be it done unto me just as you have said, Holy Spirit, come, put your life in me, let it grow in me. I want it to come from me. And you know what? If you were here last week, I think you remember poignantly, we all did the same thing out loud. We said together, Lord, the life that you want to bring to us, we want it. Even already saved, we want you to plant new things of your spirit in us. Let it be unto us just as you have said. We receive the workings of your Spirit in our life. Today I want to add to that teaching a question that I told you two weeks ago I would ask of Mary. It's this, Mary, when you said, Be it unto me just as you said, did you know what you were saying yes to when you said yes? Mary, did you know what it would cost you? Did you know how it would change you? Did you know how this life coming to you, as wonderful as it feels when you say yes and you announce to everyone, it's come? How it would grow in you, did you know that? And how it might even hurt you from time to time. Other times, how it would thrill you beyond words, causing you to sing songs like, my soul exalts the Lord. How other times it would call you, Mary, did Christmas cost more than you thought it would. Actually, I have a bigger question than that. Mary, if you knew then what you know now about the cost of Christmas to you personally, what it did to your body, what it did to your life, would you still say yes? Be it unto me, just as you said. now before we answer that question too quickly even defensively oh of course you would of course you would i want you to with me ask this question of mary not now for if we ask the question of mary now which we obviously can't do but if in our in our thinking we were to ask mary now now on this side of eternity for her clearly the answer would be yes i think at other times in her life as well. But to get some dramatic tension in this, let's ask her this question in the context of her life. For beloved, just like you and just like me, she had to live this life of God alive in her out. She had to do it step by step. She had to do this day without being able to see the next day. She had to carry this thing in circumstances that sometimes didn't look like this might be the best thing that ever happened to her. Would you still say yes? Mary, did you know when you said yes over here in Luke 1 with this wonderful chorus of angels and your heart exalting that one day you would stand at the foot of a cross and watch this promised one die. Did you know that that would be part of the package when you said yes? Stand with Mary next to that cross in your mind's eye. There is no way to know what she was thinking or feeling at that time. I wonder, however, if things like this might have at least gone through her mind momentarily. As she looked at her son dying. But an angel told me he would be great. I heard the promise. I thought it was from God. He would be the ruler of many nations. He would have a kingdom that would have no end. Looks like it's ending now. this isn't at all the way I pictured what God was going to do in me and through me not at all did it look like this what about the prophecies what about the promises is any of this true any mother standing at the foot of their child's death would be in despair more than her son was dying her hope was dying here oh but Dave, Dave the resurrection is coming and surely she knew that it was coming well maybe she did let's say for argument's sake that she did know resurrection was coming Jesus certainly spoke of it but you stand at that cross you stand at those moments in your life when all of your hopes are being dashed When all of your dreams seem to be dying, when the very things that God said He would birth in you, and that it was God, now, today, on this day, look like they're over forever. All the theology in the world of great resurrection doesn't always meet you that day. Thoughts and promises of resurrection are hard to embrace when our hopes are dying and our dreams are dashed and the blood is pooling around our feet. Think about this. See, whenever I look at the cross, it's hard for me to be merry because whenever I look at the cross, I look at the cross from this place in history. And every time I look at the cross, I see the resurrection first. I see it through the grid of the resurrection. And because I see the resurrection first, I look at the cross and I find in the cross great hope. I sit often at Good Friday services and I'm deeply moved and I let myself consider what it was that Jesus went through for me. And you've done the same and you feel deeply. And you might even weep. But mostly what I feel out of that is grateful because I know the resurrection has already happened as I'm contemplating that event. It's one of the reasons that I'm able to really look at the cross because it's not the end of the story. But when you're in the middle of the story playing out, it feels like the end of the story. See, Mary had to do what you and I have to do. We have to live this thing out. Mary, did you know that when you said yes to the life of God coming in you and growing in you and coming from you, that there would be days that it felt like the lights go out? This would not be the end of the story, for all things do work together for good to those who love God. But there would be days when that felt like it wasn't true. Did you know there would be days like that? And Mary, if you did know there would be times like that, would you still say yes? If you knew Mary then, what you know now, about what this life that came to you has cost you personally, would you still say, let it be unto me just as you said? Let me ask that question of us. Would you say yes again? You know what I want you to do as I preach? I want you to go back in your life a little bit and think of some of the things that the stretching of the Spirit of God growing in you has cost you. And ask yourself, would I say yes again? Knowing what I know now, what I didn't know that Christmas morning when I was opening the package. Would I still say yes? My mind flashes back many years, and vividly I see an eight-year-old boy kneeling at the feet of his parents' bed, asking Jesus to come into his heart the best way he knew how. The little boy I have in my mind is me, little David. And part of what was motivating me that day was a genuine, at that point, love for Jesus. I heard something else about hell and they didn't want to go there. So I didn't know everything I was saying that day. But the seed of God's life got planted in me and that seed began to grow. And sometimes the seed that was growing in me didn't look like it was growing. If somebody was watching me, they might not have been able to tell. But other times it grew. In fact, that life of God in me couldn't be stopped. And if the life of God got planted in you, it can't be stopped. It couldn't be stopped. I couldn't stop it. so several years later the word would come to me david did you know that that life in you would grow in you did you know that day that it would stretch you that years and years down the road it would have times of delighting you and amazing you and thrilling you and other times it would scare you to death and other times it would call you and it would mark you and sometimes it would scar you did you know that day when you were eight that it would do that no i didn't know that would you still do it? Would you still say yes if you knew all that? I loved it when Dan sang just now with his dad, and my heart moved toward his dad, and I thought of his dad. I thought of his dad and his mom, and I think there is something good about it, and we need to get our arms around and notice men and women who've walked with God for years. There's something good about families of faith. So I'd want to talk to Dan's mom and dad and Sandy's mom and dead who've walked with God for years and other men and women in our church who've walked with God for years and not only have known maybe a little more of the thrill of God and how his promises are true and how there really is resurrection life available to us in this life, but they've also paid a little bit maybe more of the price, been stretched a little bigger, been called a little deeper, had to do it a little longer, just having to do it a little longer means something. And I'd like to say to them, would you still do it? No one now. When you knew then, would you still say yes? Be unto me. Just as you've said. My dad and mom are here this weekend. Many of you have family members. It's what Christmas is kind of characterized by. Families get together. For many of us, that's a painful thing. Middle of next month, my family is going to be going down to Chicago to honor my mom and dad for 40 plus years in ministry. and having grown up in that home I know that every day did not feel like resurrection reality and I would like to ask my father and my mother after their years of ministry if you knew then what you know now about what it costs would you still say yes? not just about getting saved I hope you hear it's bigger than that it is that but it's bigger than that see then 10 years later God called you to something else and called you a little deeper, and you said yes, and God brought you, and it hurt. But there was glory, and then He said something else, and He brought you deeper, and He showed you more. And with everything, there was resurrection life, and there was wonder to behold, but there was always a price to that, a stretching in that, and it hurt. Would you still say yes to God along the way? Beloved, there is something very powerful, precious, just sweet about couples having been married for years, looking at one another after years, saying, I'd do it all again in a heartbeat. The end of March this year, my wife and I will mark 20 years of marriage. After 20 years of marriage, neither Bonnie or myself are kids. We're not kids anymore. We're not old, but we're not kids anymore. And we are not naive about what marriage is about or what raising children are about. we have a little bit better idea what it costs. When I said I will be with you that first time I meant it I had no idea what that meant I even knew I didn't know what it meant. There is something powerful about 20 years later getting away with my wife and saying Bonnie I need to tell you something it's important for me to tell you after 20 years knowing a little bit more about what it really means to be a married man I want to say to you I do it all again in a heartbeat. I don't know if it means more. It's something different. It's sweet. It's precious. It has power. The word I'm bringing today is something that I hope can energize some of you to look into the face of your king, having walked with God some of you for a day. I talked to somebody this morning who got saved last night. Some of you for a year, some of you for 10, 20, 50 years. And look at him as if he is our groom, for that is what he is. And as I begin to talk about a little bit of what Mary paid for receiving the life, if any of it resonates with you, and you say, you know, I paid that price too. God stretched me that way too. Would you say yes again? Look in the eyes of our groom and translate it to praise. Jesus, I'd say yes again in a heartbeat. You know what? I'm going to assume. I'm just going to make an assumption. I think it's safe to make. Whether it is or not, I'm going to do it anyway. That you would say yes. As I'm speaking, just translate this to praise, okay? Mary, did you know that when you received this life, this day that burst in your heart a song, that some wouldn't understand the song, that some wouldn't reject, wouldn't accept the life, they would reject it, that some, in fact, would hate what God is doing in you. hate? It's a bit strong, isn't it? Who would hate a baby? Babies are so... Herod hated it. It's part of the Christmas story. We hear it over and over again. Herod hated it. The life of Jesus posed a threat to him. And he did everything in his power to kill this life that was being born and married. We know the story. What we know is this. Herod in all his power wasn't able to kill the life of God in Mary. But you know what Herod was able to do? A lot of damage. Without giving you the whole story. That's a true thing. Herod did a lot of damage. Could go many different ways with that particular paradigm. The only thing I want to touch on is this. Relative to Mary. Mary. Were you surprised by that response? You know, this thing came to you. You were delighted. You didn't care where it was born. It was just a wonderful thing. Did you kind of expect everybody to love it? Mary, were you prepared for the fact that somebody would hate it enough to want to kill it in you? Were you prepared for that, Mary? My answer to that question would be this. Mary was no more prepared for someone responding to the life of God in her with hatred, no more prepared than any of you were when the life of God got planted in you and you just kind of thought everybody would love it and you went home and found out they didn't love it. And you tried to share it with a wife or share it with a husband or share it with your kids or share it with the circle of friends or share it with your mom or dad. And more than just misunderstand it, some of you have shared the life of God in you and they tried to kill that life in you. And as you're sitting here, you're saying something to yourself. It's this. They weren't able to kill a life in me, but they did a lot of damage. You don't have to raise your hand, but I want to ask you a question. How many of you are like that here? How many of you have experienced that? Well, let me ask you this question. If you knew then what you know now about that being part of the price, would you still say yes? You know what I'm going to assume of you? I'm going to assume of you, yes. Yes. And now the yes is not as naive. I know a little bit more about what it costs to have the life of God in me, and I still say yes. It's really good to renew your vows. Mary and Joseph came to the inn, and they were turned away. You know that as well. Heard it a hundred times. Over the last week, you've heard it a hundred times. We've got no room for this. Picture in your mind's eye as Mary and Joseph are being turned away. I try to get inside her head. I wonder if she thought to herself almost in despair. But it's God in me. This is a God thing growing in me. Can't they tell that this is a good thing? And I'm being put in a barn. what kind of application could that have to us I have a pastor friend that I love very much he had been in the ministry for several years successful in that ministry by all accounts but already been saved and already in the ministry God began to call him deeper and to show him some more and call him into understandings of grace that he had never known, not just for salvation, but for all of his living. And he began to show him dimensions of kingdom life that he'd never understood about the gifts of the Spirit and the power of God, not just back in the New Testament and not just in heaven, but power of God today. And those things began to minister to him and set him free in ways he'd never known before. And the life that he said, Yes, be those things born in me, God, yes! He began to give them away, and some people He gave them away to, responded the way Elizabeth did in Luke chapter 1. When Mary came, entered the room, and it says the Spirit of God in the baby in her leaped in her womb. Some people have responded to the life of God in you with a leaping in their heart. Yes, we are related. And His ministry as it grew affected people and brought healing. But others responded in more ways than one. And more ways than subtle. No room for this message in this church. And he lost his church. And he never said these words when he walked away. But it could be said. Can't they tell? Can't they tell this is God in me? can't they tell that what's growing in me is something God has birthed and they're putting me in a barn they're putting me out I wonder how many of you have experienced that kind of thing I wonder how many of you knew when you signed on and said be it unto me just as you will bring this grace, bring this kingdom bring your salvation, bring your power bring your baptisms that some would misunderstand it. Well, you know now, look into the eyes of our bridegroom. Oh, Jesus. I'll do it again in a heartbeat. I'll do it again in a heartbeat. Translate it to worship. Mary, did you know that the baby born in you would one day be born to you? And the baby born to you would then grow up. Did you know that? What are you talking about? I'm going to change the metaphor now, and I kind of need to pull you along here. You're not supposed to mix your metaphors, so I'm going to just make sure they're separate. I want to change your thinking from the model of a pregnancy and all the life of God growing in us and coming from us to the life has been born, and now we're talking more of a relationship with this thing that's been born. I hear God kind of saying to Mary and to me too Mary did you know that I wouldn't stay a baby Mary did you know that I would grow and as I did our relationship would change that sounds a little scary actually what do you mean well let me tell you what I mean by turning you to Luke chapter 2 verse 41 it's 12 years later in verse 41 the story picks up with this his parents that is jesus parents mary and joseph used to go to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover and they were going again this year and when he became 12 they went up there according to the custom of the feast and as they were returning after spending the full number of days the boy jesus stayed behind in jerusalem and his parents were unaware of it so they're taking off and jesus is left behind and it's the original home alone, only he's in Jerusalem alone. So on the plane on the way home, they remember. They thought he was in the caravan with them, just with somebody else, you know, with some friends somewhere else, playing soccer. And it went a day's journey, and not till then did they look for him among their relatives and acquaintances. And when they did not find him, in a panic, you can be sure, returned to Jerusalem looking for him. And it came about after three days they found him in the temple. Now, be a parent. Don't be Mary and Joseph, the ones with the halos. Just be a parent. And you're looking for your kid. And on one hand, you're going, oh, God, oh, help him. And just the horrifying thoughts of something bad. And if you do find him unharmed, you'll kill him like that. And they find him sitting in the midst. He's oblivious. The kid's oblivious. sitting in the midst of teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. And when they saw him, they were astonished. And his mother said to him, Son, why have you treated us this way? This is not a good thing you're doing. Behold, your father and I have been anxiously looking for you. And he said to them, Why is it that you're looking for me? Do you not know that I had to be in my father's house, for I'm about my father's business? And they did not understand the statement which he had made to them. They did not understand. Shouldn't they have? I mean, surely they knew who he was. More than anyone else, they would have known who he was. Well, they did know who he was. They hadn't forgotten that. But, and this, beloved, hear this, is so much like our walk with God. They knew who He was, but the reality and the fullness of who He was was at this time in their life beginning to press itself more dramatically than before. Have you ever experienced that? You've known Jesus, and then sometime, someway, for some reason, you don't even know why, the Spirit of God, who He really is, begins to press on you in a way it hadn't been pressed before. And Jesus here begins to exert His will. He is no longer asking permission in their relationship. He's just 12 years old, but he's not asking permission. It's changing. He's not doing their plan anymore. It's kind of how it works, seemingly. He's not just a baby anymore. This baby is a king. Did you know, Mary, when you said yes to this life born in you and were delighted at the prospects? that this baby would grow and sometimes what he would do and sometimes what he would call you to would feel very unreasonable. Did you know that when you signed up? Did you know that some of what he would call you to would make you angry? Christmas more than any other season creates images in our mind of Jesus as a baby. And it ought to. And that's a powerful image. Wonderful. But we need to understand something, beloved. It is this, that when we enter into this life of God in us business, we have got a tiger by the tail. This is God in you. And we thought it would be tame. We thought it would be cuddly the whole time. I hearken back to Phyllis Mathis when she spoke a couple of weeks ago at our communion service, and she made reference to the Chronicles of Narnia and Aslan as being the metaphor of Christ, the great lion. And one of the characters asked, because he was a lion, it sounded scary. Is he safe? And the response was, no, he isn't safe, but he is good. But you've got to tire this God in you stuff. It will grow, and it will call. 20 years later, in Luke chapter 8, verse 19, another little twist here, verse 19, His mother and brothers came to Jesus, and they were unable to get to him because of the crowd. And it was reported to him, Your mother and your brothers are standing outside wishing to see you. But he answered and said to them, Who is my mother and who are my brothers? My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it. And all the people were listening to him in rapt attention, understanding maybe what he meant spiritually, but there was a lady outside who at best was wondering what he meant. Jesus, I thought it was just you and me. You're making your mother other people, your brothers other people. I thought we could just cuddle. I will forever be your son. There will be forever this picture of a baby, but that baby is a king. Mary, this baby is a king. Mary, this baby is your king You know, Simeon in Luke chapter 2 Came to Well, it was when Mary and Joseph came to the temple with Jesus And Simeon was there And Simeon said to Mary Blessed are you And this child here will be the cause for the rise and the fall of many And then he looked at Mary and said something that I know had to trouble her He said this And this child will pierce your own soul as well, Mary Because this child will not just be a baby this child is going to be a king. It's going to be your king. And it's going to call you. See, part of what Christmas costs and part of what Christmas entails is a progressive revelation of who Jesus really is, what Jesus really provides, what it is He gives. We are learning more and more about that all the time. We talk about knowing more of the riches of His grace, a progressive revelation, understanding of that, but also a progressive revelation of what it is that God calls for through His Son Jesus and what it is He wants. You see, beloved, once we embrace the baby, He's going to grow up and He is going to exert Himself upon us. And at each stage of our growth or His growth in us, there will come different and deeper ways of relating to Him and learning from Him and learning how to respond to who He really is. There will be times when the most powerful message from our Father to us will be this. You need to learn to sit on my lap. You need to get the cuddly aspect of this, the baby piece. You never got that. All you've ever seen God as is the judge who's got a lightning bolt in his hand and wants to crush you like a bug. And in this stage of your life, I'm landing on many of you who are in this stage. You need to learn that Jesus is a safe place to go, that God is a place that you have access to. Come unto me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, I will give you rest. But that same God who says, Come unto me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, I'll give you rest, said, Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel, teaching everyone you meet to observe all that I commanded you. Come, get rest. Go, do my work. There are stages in our life as Jesus grows in us, or we grow, I don't know which it is, stages in our life where the most important thing we can do is learn to sit on his lap and call him Papa. There are other times in our life where the most important thing is not to sit on his lap. the most important thing for us to learn at that stage is to learn to do what He said. Good question at this point. Is there ever a time, David, when it's not important to know that we can sit on His lap? Is there like a time when we outgrow the need to sit on God's lap? Never. You will never. I will never outgrow the need to know that I come to God. Abba, Father. Never outgrow that. but there are times in my life and in yours where that is not the most important thing for he is saying to me at another stage in my life David you always can be on my lap what you need to learn now as I grow and call you is to obey me in this yes in this yes in this and yes yes in this will you say now let it be unto me yes I'll give you that and yes I'll give you that and yes you can have this room and yes you can have this space is it ever not important to obey do you ever outgrow your need to obey no but there will be seasons in your life where his exerting his character on you will say, the most important thing you need to know right now is not the obey part, it's the sit on my lap part. Our ways, it changes and it grows and it doesn't stop. And there is something exhilarating and frightening about the fact that our relationship with God continually changes because he calls us deeper. and he calls us further. I'm reminded of Matthew chapter 8. Verse 1. Jesus is standing on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. He's been doing ministry for some time. It's time to leave the shore. The crowd of people are there and he is saying to his disciples, if you want to follow me, you're going to have to get into the boat. You're going to have to leave the shore and follow me. And he gave an order to depart to the other side. And a certain scribe, verse 19, came to him and said, Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go. And Jesus said, That's great. Get in the boat. But let me just tell you this. The truth is, foxes have holes and birds have nests, and the Son of Man does not have a place to lay his head. And if you still want to follow, follow. Get in the boat. But it might be like that, and this guy disappeared, as I've said many times, in the white space between verse 20 and 21. Another disciple came to him and says, I will follow you too wherever you go. But let me just go and bury my father first, which meant let me wait for my father to die so I can gather my inheritance. And when I am financially secure, then I'll follow you with everything I have. And Jesus said, let the dead bear the dead. You follow me now and trust me now for all your needs. And he disappeared as well. But some disciples did get in the boat and they followed and they were faithful. And they got in the boat and as soon as they got out into the middle of the lake, there came a great storm. And they thought, oh, my Lord, we thought if we obeyed, it would be cool. It would be calm. You would take care of us and everything would be peaceful. And I would say to them in the middle of the lake, if you knew then what you know now, would you have gotten in the boat? Would you have said yes? Would you have said, yeah, keep deepening me, keep calling me? God had a lesson from them in that. Later on in that same gospel, those same disciples were on the same lake. And Jesus came to them, and you know the story well, For Peter called to Jesus and said, Lord, bid me come. And Jesus said in effect to Peter, okay, this time get out of the boat. I put those things together. I kind of see Jesus at one time saying to the disciples, if you're going to follow me, get in the boat. They all get in the boat, obey him. Then later on, these same disciples are in the boat doing what God said. And now he goes, okay, everybody, out of the boat. And the question in my mind comes to me as I reflect on the ways in which God has done that with me, calling me and changing somehow the rules or something, I get frustrated and I say to God, God, what do you want in the boat, out of the boat? What do you want? And I hear him say to me what he's saying to Mary and to us as well. Here's what I want. Everything, absolutely everything. Mary, did you know that the baby was a king to whom you would bow. Mary, did you know? He would be a king who would in a variety of ways say to you, Mary, we're going to go further. We're going to go deeper. Mary, I want you to ever sit on my lap. Oh, yes. Forever sit on my lap. Forever, Abba Father. But Mary, I want you to ever do my bidding, do my work. I will ever be, Mary, the precious little baby boy. But Mary, I will ever be the king who says, follow me, obey me, serve me. When I put these things together, the word that came to my mind was surrender. And what occurred to me about that word surrender, as I get a number of pictures in my mind of people surrendering, is there is a kind of surrender that you can beat out of people. You just beat people. You can beat people into submission. And they cry, uncle, I give up because the pain was so great. There is another kind of surrender that is not given to one who conquered you by brute force, but is a surrender given to one who conquered you by love. It is the kind of surrender that the Bible speaks of in the metaphor comparing the church, the bride of Christ, to the groom being Jesus. And in this kind of surrender of a bride to a groom and a groom to a bride, the word I would put on the surrender then is sweet surrender. It's sweet surrender. That says, yes, I know a little bit about the cost of your life being planted in me. I know a little bit about the cost of your life growing in me and coming from me. I know a little bit about your calling of me and calling of you to deeper things. And you could beat me into submission, but my heart just says yes. Be it unto me, just as you have said. I receive it. I receive the life. I receive the deeper places. What Christmas costs you? what has the life of God planted in you cost you? I know that I wish I could read, you know, like a comic strip, you know. I wish I could read what it's cost you. I think we would weep if we could see the price that many of us have paid for the deeper places God has called us, for just getting saved in the first place, For the lifestyles that changed and the agony. Oh, you snapped a finger and got saved and there was no... No, the agony that it took to move out of a lifestyle into one that is consistent with the life of God in you. Translate it to worship. Just translate it to worship. Jesus, we know a little bit more about the cost of our own Christmas. and we are here to, and I want to speak for you. Can I speak for you? I'm going to talk to the Lord. I'm going to talk to the Lord. We're here to tell you, Jesus, that we would do it again in a heartbeat. How many of you say yes to that? We would do it again in a heartbeat. Let's pray. Jesus, Dan, would you come? Jesus, I just thank you for your truth. I thank you for the truths we find in your precious word. I thank you for Mary. I thank you for her willingness to do what we've had to learn to do, and that is to receive your life and let it grow. I thank you, Lord, that she didn't stop the life in her, but she allowed it to go. I thank you, God, for the comfort we get when we find out that what saints of old have suffered for their life, for their faith, are things that we have suffered, and we kind of find out that this is kind of par for the course, and it gives us courage. but I thank you, Father, too, for resurrection. I thank you for the thing that makes it worth it all, and that's your life, your life in us, and the life you reveal and the glory that goes from glory to glory and from deeper things to deeper things. And I just pray these things on us, that you give us courage to keep saying yes. Give us a spirit of courage to keep saying yes. I just pray even now for Dan as he sings, that as he's singing that we would be able even to take his words in his heart and translate it to worship. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
