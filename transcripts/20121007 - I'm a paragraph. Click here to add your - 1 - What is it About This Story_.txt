I'm lighting a candle, and it's not for the ambiance. It's because ever since the second chapter of the book of Acts, a flame, has been a symbol of the Holy Spirit, the presence of the Holy Spirit. And today, we are doing something that we haven't done for three years. We're starting a new book. Been in Colossians, yeah. Been in Colossians for three years, beginning Acts today. The Holy Spirit being a pretty primary player in this whole story. My son, Caleb, texted me this week with a text that said something like this. He said, Dad, if it took four years or three years for you and Steve to get through four chapters in Colossians, are you going to live to the end of Acts? You never know. And so we begin a new journey, a new book. After three years in the book of Colossians, we begin today in Acts. Open your Bibles. If you have them to the book of Acts, its full title is the Acts of the Apostles. If we gave the real title, it would be too long because it's the Acts of the Apostles who are empowered by the Holy Spirit. Chapter 1, verse 1, I want you to open to that where the Apostle Luke, who is also known as a physician, begins his letter with these words. Acts 1 verse 1. In my former letter or book, Theophilus, I wrote all about the things that Jesus began to do and teach. Stop right there, which is why this book is going to take a long time. Now, the former book of which he speaks, I want to kind of set the table here today, is the Gospel of Luke, that Luke also wrote, obviously, but he wrote the book of Acts as well, which, like the book of Acts, was written to and for the benefit of this guy that Luke mentions in the first verse of the book of Acts, this guy named Theophilus, who in all probability was a friend or an acquaintance of some kind with Luke's, considered by most scholars to be a man of some stature in Rome, quite possibly being a Roman official of some sort and as such a representative member of the intelligent and educated upper class in Rome. Luke himself being an educated man, being a physician as he was, thus having, quite possibly, we don't know about this for sure, but quite possibly because of Luke's status as a physician and educated man, would have had some credibility with this guy named Theophilus who would not have been easily impressed and quite selective, I would guess, as to who he might believe on any given matter. So Luke is kind of here in Acts and also in his gospel, the first account, the first book or letter that he wrote to this guy. He's kind of giving it a shot, like letters written to a skeptic who nonetheless might be a friend. Luke begins in his first account with words designed to appeal to such a man as Theophilus. And the first account is Luke, and I want to read from Luke because it kind of helps set some context for understanding as we move into Acts. Luke's gospel, first chapter, first verse says this, and as much as many have undertaken to complete an account of the things accomplished among us, just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word and have handed them down to us, it seemed fitting for me as well, having investigated everything carefully from the beginning to write it out for you in consecutive order, most excellent Theophilus. I did all this this way, being careful from the beginning to write out everything in consecutive order so that you might know the exact truth about the things that you have been taught. And 24 chapters later, the Gospel of Luke, which again was Luke's first letter to this person, man named Theophilus, was complete. But all of that, says Luke, in his second letter to this friend of his, this most excellent Theophilus, was just the beginning. Acts 1, verse 1. It was just the beginning of everything that Jesus began to do and teach. Pick it up now in verse 2. Until the day when he, that is Jesus, was taken up after he had been by the Holy Spirit given orders to the apostles whom he had chosen. To these he also presented himself alive after his suffering, his death, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of 40 days and speaking of things concerning the kingdom of God. And gathering them together, he commanded them to not leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, which he said, you heard from me. And so when they had come together, they were asking him, saying, And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the epochs, which the Father has fixed by his own authority. Don't worry about that. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you. And you shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and in the uttermost parts of the earth. And while I'm not going to cover all of that information today, those words usher us into this story that is embodied in the book of the Acts. I'd like to pray as we enter into this. Father, we are about to enter on what I think is a journey into a book, but it's into a story. It's a story into which we've been invited, and I pray that your spirit would be in it and on it and just all around it, breathing life into it. In Jesus' name, amen. It was actually in the middle of the 18th century as a matter of historic record that in both France and Great Britain, there was tremendous social disorder and inequity in the land, resulting in much suffering among many people. It was the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and while some really good things were coming out of that, there were some things not so wonderful coming out of that. And among the things that were not good was this widening gap between the rich and the poor. The poor in these days were growing poorer and larger in number by the day. The rich were growing richer and smaller in number by the day, with most of the wealth in those days in the hands of very few, which is a common theme historically. happens over and over again, creating in both France and Great Britain a powder keg of tension that actually in France exploded in what we've come to know historically as the French Revolution, where thousands of people were slaughtered. It was, like most revolutions, a bloody revolution, but in Britain. And what happens in Britain is why I'm telling you this story, because it actually connects kind of historically with the book of Acts, believe it or not. Something very different was unfolding. Not a bloody revolution, but what historians have come to refer to, at the same time the French Revolution was exploding, in Britain there was this thing they called the Great Awakening. A Great Awakening that actually lasted a couple of decades and had its roots in a powerful spiritual awakening led by men and women whose names are still familiar to us, at least to some of us, men like John Wesley and his brother Charles who founded the Methodist movement. Indeed, in the early days of this movement, an estimated one-sixth to one-fifth of the entire population of Great Britain had come to faith in Christ. They were being swept into the churches, and with that awakening came everything you would expect, imagine, maybe even desire to see from any kind of spiritual movement or what we would refer to as a revival. It was emotional. It was wonderful. It was confusing. And sometimes it was hysterical, making some observers predictably skeptical and suspicious of what looked to them like excess and hysteria until what eventually happened in this awakening was something more than just people flopping on the floor like a fish and giving God credit for all of that wonderful stuff. There began to be a healing in the land of some of these social ills as the rich, under the influence of this awakening of life in them, and came into a new kind of power and kind of a new way of thinking, not only about their stuff, but a new way of thinking about the poor. And many of them in those days became what they never would have expected of themselves, champions of the poor and the embodiment of generosity in the poor. As a result of this awakening, we're also receiving a new kind of power and truth that provided for them, among other things, a sense of dignity. And even a kind of self-discipline that some of them hadn't had before, so much so that in the wake of this awakening, there really was this healing of the land. Many of these social ills began to be addressed in ways that no one expected or anticipated. Indeed, historically, many of you know that the converts of this awakening were instrumental in the abolishing of the slave trade in the British Empire. There was in Parliament in 1807, the Slave Trade Act. It didn't entirely abolish it, but that set into motion the abolishment of it. And just historically, it's kind of fascinating. That was like 60-some years before it happened in America. And in America, it happened in the wake of a horrible war. This was happening in Britain in the wake of a spiritual awakening. In addition to that, relations between labor and capital improved. There was reform of the child labor laws and huge increases in literacy because God had moved somehow because people had been awakened. And it kind of makes you wonder. When I hear stories like that as a matter of historic record, it kind of makes you wonder what would an awakening even look like today? How do we know it if it came? What would its impact be? How would it manifest? And where would it manifest? Would it start in the churches? I hope this doesn't sound cynical, but would it even be in the churches? Well, the answer to those questions, at least in parts, I believe, is found in places fascinatingly to me, like the book of Acts. Because the book of Acts, among other things, is giving to us a historic account of what is undoubtedly the greatest awakening in the history of the world, an awakening that historically was so massive that it completely and utterly remade one of the greatest civilizations of all time, the Roman Empire. Indeed, it is an indisputable fact that 2,000 years ago, there was this tiny group of peasants and slaves who believed for some reason that Jesus Christ was not just a great rabbi. Though he was a great rabbi, and we spent quite a bit of time a few years ago talking about the wonder of his teaching. But there was a group of people who kind of dialed into the fact, oh yeah, oh yeah, he is, without a doubt, a great rabbi. Maybe better than we have ever seen. But something more was going on there because they saw him as more than a great prophet as well. Lots of prophets around. And if you follow some of those prophets, they will help you. But there was something else here. Because this little group of pretty insignificant people began to believe that he was the preexistent son of God come to earth, that he died on the cross, that he rose from the dead. And that little group, when it began, had absolutely no political power, no economic power, no educational or cultural clout. And yet within two centuries of this kind of insignificant, at least the people themselves so insignificant, within two centuries, it had swept up millions of people into an entirely different kind of life, becoming in fact one of the leading forces in the Roman society that was disintegrating at the time until even Rome itself finally said in effect, okay, we give up. This must be true. Indeed, it was in 313 AD that the Roman Emperor Constantine declared Christianity to be the official religion of the Holy Roman Empire. I like that. And the official religion of the National Football League as well. There you go. Now, historically, it's kind of ironic because when the Christian religion was legalized in Rome and then declared by Constantine to be official religion. Sounds like a good day for the faith. In fact, it is a bad day and set kind of in motion the need for an entirely new awakening, but that's another story we're not going to get into right now. I want to talk about Acts because what we have in the book of Acts, among other things, is this. Among the only, well it is not among, it is the only historic document written by an eyewitness of these early days of this awakening. Indeed, of all the historic critics, and there are many historic critics who snipe about how much we can believe about the Bible, virtually none of these critics doubts or even questions that the one who wrote this account, he might be lying, but the one who wrote this account was in fact an eyewitness. His name was Dr. Luke. But he wasn't an historian by practice or trade. He was a friend, writing to someone who at some level he cared about. Oh, Theophilus, it's just you and me talking right now. I just want you to know that something in my life here has changed everything. For me, for us, I think, for you, Theophilus, actually, I think something has changed everything for the world. Thus raising this question, and it is the question of the day around which we will do our work and prepare our hearts for the table, and it's a question that remains. In other words, it's been raised before and it never goes away. The question is this, what? What is the something that has changed everything? What explains the things I just described about the Roman Empire, about Great Britain and the awakenings there? What is it about this story? What is it about this book, this ancient book written 2,000 years ago? Why do we bother with it? Why are we here? I mean, seriously. Because here we are. Think about this. You maybe don't think about this. Reasonably intelligent people. I'm assuming, kind of giving you the benefit of the doubt here today. Living as we do in the 21st century, advanced in ways that people who wrote this book could not fathom. If we tried to describe the things medically, scientifically, technologically, electronically, if you tried to describe to them these things, their eyes would glaze over. They would not be able to relate. So why did you find your way from wherever it was you came today to find your way to this building in this Maple Grove place and walk into this room where we are about to gather around this book again? And to explore it, to dig into it, and to wonder at its meaning. Why do we care? Why are we here? Scholars for centuries have argued for and against its authenticity, its reliability, its relevance to us. Critics tell us there is nothing here of significance for modern people, for primitives maybe, for ignorant people, possibly some comfort here for them. But we're too smart for that. We're too advanced for that. But here it is. It still remains. And here you are and here we are about to dig down deep, about to plunge ourselves into this ancient and what some would consider antiquated book. Why? Well, some clues might actually be found in the story itself that we are about to tell in the book of Acts as week after week and month after month and who knows, year after whatever, begins to unfold, and as it does, we are just going to be hearing a little bit more about this story and why, because maybe the answer to why it remains is maybe it's more than the story itself, because maybe it's more than words on a page, because maybe, I don't know, maybe the power that Luke said Jesus said would come. In Acts 1, verse 8, at the beginning of Luke's account to Theophilus relative to what happened, Acts 1, verse 8, but you shall receive power. This is the promise of the Father. When the Holy Spirit comes upon you, maybe the power Jesus said would come came. And maybe, well, sometimes this power seems to wane, even to disappear and fade into the distant past like something that maybe, I don't know, used to be, but isn't anymore. Maybe, even when it's hard sometimes to see, it remains. And can be found, in fact, not out there or over there or even up there, but in here. here. Christ in you, alive, the risen one in you by the real presence of the Holy Spirit in you, because when the Holy Spirit comes on you, you shall receive power. Greek word there is dunamis, means power, energy, life. You shall receive life, the life risen, life of Christ in you. and it struck me early this week as I was getting into this text how ironic it is that the theme of Colossians that we just spent three years exploring, that that theme of Christ in you began in Acts 1. Oh, Theophilus. Most excellent Theophilus. I just want you to know. I'm not trying to make this bigger than it is. I want you to know what I have seen with my eyes and heard with my ears because something, Theophilus, has changed everything. And it's this, that we saw him alive. Because after his suffering, Acts 1 verse 3, he presented himself alive with many convincing proofs. Not even going to go into all of them, just trust me on this. was amazing to see appearing to us over a period of 40 days and speaking to us of things concerning the kingdom of God. The word revival is a fascinating one historically being associated most often with religious experiences of particularly emotional and sensational kind which is why they're often viewed skeptically and suspiciously predictably but a revival actually applies to lots of things. And whenever you see a revival of anything, it always has two parts. Because whether it's an architectural revival, like the Greek architectural revival, where something is kind of returned to, or a play is revived on Broadway, two things always happen. First is this. Someone revisits the original genius. Someone rediscovers, oh, we forgot the original essence of something. And then number two, it has reintroduced this original essence or genius to a different people at a different place in a different time, but it isn't new. It just feels new to the people who may be experiencing it for the first time, and it isn't being discovered. It's being rediscovered because somebody went back to revisit the original genius, to rediscover the original essence. And so it is today, beloved, we begin a journey back in order to maybe rediscover some essential things that might help us move not backward, but forward as a people into what we kind of call around here our sacred future. Because this book into which we are plunging ourselves again today is not just the Word. It is the living Word. And it isn't just the story of something that happened long ago. It's the story of something that began long ago. Because in my first book, O Theophilus, I wrote about the things Jesus began to do and teach. But that was only the beginning. The best, Theophilus, was yet to come. Because this story, this story that began in Acts 1 is unfolding still today, right before our eyes. And we, and by we, I'm actually speaking for the elders of our church, for all the teachers of our church, for the body of our church that's kind of behind this study and acts. We want to help you see it because we don't want anyone to miss it because we're being invited not to just hear this story. Let me tell you a story. We're here to invite you into this story because the invitation is to join this story, to participate in this story, like getting on a train that left the station a long time ago, before we were born, before we could even think of such things. And this train has been moving and picking up steam, and this train has been expanding since Acts chapter 1, verse 1, and the good news is this. It's not too late to get on board. It's not too late to join this choir. It's not too late to sing this song and add your voice to the voice of peasants and slaves who, when the Holy Spirit came on them, the life of Christ began to inhabit them, and they received power, the nature of which we are going to be examining for weeks and months. and blah, blah, blah. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. We close with this reflection and then we'll go to the table. I love how this story begins in Acts 1. The words that I just read to you, like an epic movie is how I see the whole book of Acts kind of lay out in my mind. An epic movie that is going to bring us places of grandeur. Some of you know enough of the story, you could maybe even think of some of the things that are going to happen, places of great danger, actually, in the book of Acts, and great delight. Like the Lord of the Rings. I thought of this movie this week, and it felt like a comparison. I'm sure many of you remember that movie, an epic movie that brought us to places. That movie did of great danger and delight, but it began, Lord of the Rings, in the quietest way, a pond. Remember this? Just clear as glass, still as could be. The calm of a woman's voice as that movie began speaking softly, and then it moved on. So too the book of Acts is epic, and will bring us places of great danger and delight. Early on in the story is the stoning of Stephen, the beheading of James, 3,000 saved, and one day the expansion of the church in the face of all sorts of resistance, in the beginning, but it didn't matter because the word of God grew mightily and prevailed. Epic story that began in the quietest way with a first century physician named Luke sitting at a table as I imagine him, a quill pen in his hand, a candle providing some light in what I imagine to be a dark and damp room writing a letter. no fanfare he didn't rent a room oh theophilus most excellent theophilus i so want to tell you a story but it's a story theophilus i didn't hear from someone else because i saw it with my eyes and i heard it with my ears much like the apostle john who in his first epistle first john 1 1 makes it clear from the beginning that the things of which he speaks are things that we have heard with our ears. We have seen with our eyes and our hands have handled concerning the word of life. And this life was manifested, in other words, made visible, revealed. And we have seen and bear witness. And now I'm telling you, proclaim it now to you, oh, Theophilus. But here's the best part of the story, Theophilus. Because even though I am an eyewitness of these things, and I think you trust me, Theophilus. The best part of the story is that you don't have to take my word for it, because the best part of the story is Acts 1 verse 8, because when the Holy Spirit comes on you, Theophilus, just spread it beyond Theophilus. See, I don't care where you live, be it Jerusalem or Rome or Colossae, Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Belfast, Northern Ireland, or this goofy little suburb we live in called Maple Grove. Isn't that a cute little name? I don't care where you live, and I don't care when you live, be it when Jesus was actually here so you could physically see with your eyes, or 2,000 years later when the Holy Spirit comes on you, Acts 1, verse 8, you will receive power, dunamis, energy, life. And the life is the actual life of Christ, the risen Christ, alive in you. And when that comes upon you, takes residence in you, you will be my witnesses. I grew up in church hearing about how we needed to be witnesses, and it kind of meant knocking on people's doors with tracks. That's not what this means. You will be, when the Spirit comes on you, what that means is you will be eyewitnesses of the Spirit. Because when the Spirit comes on you with life and power, you will see what Luke saw. You will hear what Luke heard. It's like an eyewitness to an accident. What happened? Well, you can tell him because you saw. An eyewitness is someone who has tasted this spirit life, and now you have something to say. And so we pray, as we often do here at Open Door, Holy Spirit, come. even as we begin this journey into this epic story with all its dangers and delights help us by your spirit to rediscover and revisit the essential things life giving things world changing things and I can't think of a better place to start this journey at this table for a number of reasons one is in a symbol as we're beginning this journey this is the bread we need. It's like getting a meal so we can go. This is the bread we need, and this is the drink we need, because this is where it all began. And this is why it's true, and this is what it costs for us to enter into and experience this spirit life, and that is why we're grateful, and that is why we sing, and that is why we serve, and that is why we bow down low. In a few moments, we're going to come to the table, and if you're visiting, I just want you to be comfortable with what we do, because we move around a lot, and there's a lot of freedom to do that, and I just love how our people are free to do that, and some will come and bow at this cross, and it means a number of things, but even symbolically, to take your body and bend your knee. Something that happens in the spirit that says, this is my posture before my God. I am here grateful to serve. And there will be people up here for you to come to for prayer. Because when spirit begins to move, things begin to get stirred up that need the touch of God. And so we will pray, but all of it will be mediated by this table, this food. I am the bread, said Jesus. I am the drink that you need. And so we come to partake of him as a community of faith.
