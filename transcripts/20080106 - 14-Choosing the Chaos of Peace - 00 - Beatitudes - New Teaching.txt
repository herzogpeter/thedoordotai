And Tom Johnson is here with us today and he's going to lead us through. So that's going to be fun. that is going to be fun before we share the meal we got some work to do and it's going to require something of us so I want to pray as we head into the word pray with me Jesus for for eyes to see you and for ears to hear you and most of all for feet that are willing to follow you into the places that you call us. For that, we need courage. Amen? Well, two weeks ago, Dave was unpacking in this series that has gone on for a year now, in the way of the rabbi, he's unpacking what it means to be a peacemaker. And he said something that has been messing with me for about two weeks now. And that's sort of a love-hate thing I have with Dave on that kind of stuff. Because he says these things that just make you kind of a little mad and a little curious. And it makes you do something with it. So this is what he said. And then I want to say a few things about it. He said this. Most of the time, the process of bringing peace isn't peaceful at all. By definition, a peacemaker is someone who has the courage and the willingness to intentionally and actively move toward and into situations where there is no peace. And the reason why it's been messing with me is because I've realized that most of the time I do exactly the opposite. And so do you. We intentionally move away from and out of situations where there is no peace in order to find peace, if we're honest. See, if you're like me, you move away actively from the unruly mob of insanity that you call your children. And you intentionally move toward the bathroom and a locked door. We actively move away from our stressful job and intentionally move toward a drink to wind down. We actively move away from the person with whom we're in a conflict and we intentionally move toward an entire pan of brownies. That hit a little too close to home, right? Now we do this because we have no real peace. We don't have actual peace inside of us to deal with those situations. So we move toward this form of external peace, a thing that we just call peace, but it isn't peace. But there's a problem. The world is in desperate and dire need of actual peace. And for peace to come, some of us are going to have to answer the call of the rabbi to become peacemakers. And this call is not this loud rally cry that we get all excited about. It's a sober call to action. It's almost a whisper. Will you be a peacemaker for the world? As followers of this rabbi, if we're called to willingly move into areas in our lives and in the world where there is no peace, then here's what I believe is true. We're going to need to access a source of peace that can exist even in the face of great conflict. That's what we're going to need. Because what I know about you, if you're a peacemaker, is this. You are exhausted. If you actually move into areas where there is no peace, willingly and courageously, you are exhausted. And most of the times your insides are constantly churning. At times you're scared to death about what the outcome will be. Most of the time you wonder if you're crazy or not for taking the time to move into these areas where there seems to be no hope. Jesus said something to his disciples toward the end of his life that must have sounded crazy to them. He said this in John 14, 27. My peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled. And don't be afraid. When Jesus said, peace I leave with you, you've got to remember the context of his own life out of which he was speaking those words. Jesus was the one person that actually did have the weight of the world on his shoulders. So him talking about peace seems a little strange. It seems odd. Because he was in constant danger of being assassinated. He was maligned, misunderstood, and rejected by members of the religion that he called his own. People hounded him day and night for his time, for healing, to heal members of their family. And it left him probably exhausted and depleted. The poor guy was so exhausted one night, we read in one of the Gospels. that he was on a boat with his disciples. And there was a storm raging so fiercely that the disciples who spent their lives on boats were afraid that they were going to die. Jesus was asleep. Dude was tired. But he also knew about a peace that could exist in the face of great turmoil. when he says, my peace I give you. This particular phrase carries a meaning. It's almost, it's an idiom that means this, to give one's life. My peace I give you means this, my life I willingly lay down for you for a purpose. It means to die for, to lay down one's life, to give one's life, and to grant someone the opportunity to do something with it. see Jesus our rabbi who we've been studying and we've been asking ourselves if we have the courage to follow is saying I'm inviting you into my way of peace not the world's way which seeks to find peace in this external fake sort of way but my way of peace which intentionally moves towards and into situations where there is no peace and I'm showing you that peace is only lifted up when someone is willing to lay something down. Peace is only lifted up when someone is willing to lay something down. And when it comes right down to it, in my life, my ability to willingly move into situations where there is no peace comes down to this fundamental question. What am I willing to lay down in order to lift up peace? now in the countries of Rwanda and Burundi in East Africa more than 2 million people have died over the last 50 years as a result of genocide and corruption and violence much of this was because members of the Hutu tribe decided that the only way that peace was going to come in their lives was if they eradicated all members of the Tutsi tribe these murders occurred not with guns or bombs but with machetes and garden tools. It was gruesome. And over 800,000 of these deaths occurred over a span of 100 days in 1994. I mean, that's the kind of violence that if you think about it, you can't think about it. You talk about a situation where there is no peace, this would be on the top of the list. But the good news is this, there's a growing number of peacemakers in these two countries, members of the Hutu tribe and members of the Tutsi tribe who are laying down their weapons and lifting up peace. And certain members of these two tribes have begun to intentionally meet together. And when they greet one another, they shake each other's hands. And they lean over and give each other a kiss on the cheek. And when they do that, they whisper a word into each other's ear. It's a whisper. It's a silent, sober plea. And the word is this. Amahoro, Amahoro. It means peace. Can you imagine if you were a member of a Tutsi, of the Tutsi tribe, and you remember freshly in your mind what happened? Can you imagine reaching out and shaking the hand of a Hutu and kissing that person on the cheek and whispering the word peace in their ear, expressing your hope for a better future, what do you think that you would have to lay down in order to lift up that kind of peace? Jesus says this, peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you, and I don't give as the world gives. Don't let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid. The reason why he said don't let your hearts be troubled and don't be afraid is because it's hard, right? To move into these areas where there is no peace. You're gonna feel your insides start to churn like the storm on the sea and you're gonna feel your hearts start to be troubled but Jesus says, my peace I give to you. My way of peace I invite you into. With these words, Jesus takes our hand and shakes it and Jesus reaches over and kisses our cheek and into our ear he whispers this sober call to peace. He says, will you be a peacemaker in the world and in your life? I have a friend who's watching one of her best friends go through this divorce. And it's hard and messy and there's a lot of emotion involved as there always is with this kind of thing. but my friend is entering the chaos with this woman and one day when my friend was at this woman's house with her family this woman who's going through divorce leans over and whispers this into her ear she says you know even in all the chaos when I'm with your family I feel like I have a family again blessed are you when you move into areas willingly and courageously where there is no peace to bring peace because when you do that, you are close to the heart of the rabbi. Amen? See, Jesus understood the word peace. He understood a kind of peace that could exist even in the face of tremendous turmoil. And he's inviting us to know that same peace. And if we accept his invitation, then our work will be to identify what in our lives need to be laid down so that we can have the courage to move into the areas of our lives where there is no peace. The word for peace that Jesus uses, one of the nuances of this word, means to sit down in one's heart. to sit down in one's heart versus frantically moving around, trying to control things, to sit down in one's heart. It also means to be quiet in one's inner self. So as you ask yourself where you might need to intentionally move into in the areas in your life and in the world where there is no peace, you're gonna need to sit down in your heart and quiet your inner self and ask yourself some questions so that you can move into these areas with a resource of peace that'll bring you through the conflict. So I want to ask you a question. What do you need to lay down? What do you need to lay down in your life so that you can lift up peace in the areas in your life and in the world where peace needs to come? Do you need to lay down your need to control the outcome? when you think about a situation in your life maybe where there is conflict and you're rehearsing the conversation in your mind over and over and over again and you're realizing you need the situation to go this certain way and you need that person to say a certain thing in a certain way in order for you to feel like peace has come do you need to lay down your need to control the outcome? A lot of us do. do you need to lay down your definition of external peace so that you can finally say something when normally you would keep silent when you're sitting around a table and that thing comes up again do you need to lay down your need to keep everything calm so that you can finally say the truth do you need to lay down your need to win as you think about bringing peace do you need to lay down your cause some of us get so passionate and so fired up about our cause and we get so angry about it that our cause makes us hate the people that we're fighting against and peace does not come do you need to lay down your fear as you enter this journey with me I can't really offer you a road map here's how to go into peace here's a left turn that you can take that will make you avoid all kinds of conflict and sorrow I can't offer you a road map but I can offer you some gifts to take with you. If you're courageous enough to hear this sober call, this whisper to be a peacemaker, I can offer you some gifts. These gifts are for those of you who are scared to death and sick to your stomach with worry about heading into these areas where there is no peace. These gifts are for those of you who would rather be silent than risk entering the chaos and saying the word that needs to be spoken. These gifts are for those of you who even in the face of all of those things are following our rabbi, Jesus, right into the places where there is no peace in your life and in the world. These gifts are for your journey. I offer three. Firstly, I offer a gift of faith. John, who knew a little bit about entering into places where there is no peace, says this in 1 John 4.4. He says, you, dear children, are from God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God. You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. The one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. See, when you have willingly chosen to enter into situations where there is no peace, here's what I know is true. You will experience opposition from people and from the forces of evil that sow discord as their main modus operandi. You will experience that kind of opposition and it will be fierce. So when you do that, you need to know that greater is the one that is in you than the one who is opposing you. Amen? Amen. Greater, greater, greater is the one who is in you. The word greater literally means older, which carries the meaning that the one who is in you existed before the evil that opposes you. The one that is in you will exist after the evil that opposes you is done away with. So enter into the situations of your life where there is no peace with faith. Secondly, I offer a gift of hope. Paul writes this in Romans 15, 13. Paul knew something about heading into situations where there was no peace. and in his style of just run-on sentences and over-exuberance, he says this, may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit because when you willingly choose to enter into the places in your life and in the world where there is no peace in order to bring peace, you might experience despair. you might feel like there is absolutely no hope that anything will come of what I'm doing. Into that despair, receive the good news that the God of hope can fill your empty despair. So when you enter into these conversations and situations, you can know that into your emptiness, when you admit that you are empty, God will fill you up with what you need when you need it you can know that as you follow the way of the rabbi into areas where there is no peace the God of all hope fills you with joy and peace and hope the good news is that can only come in the form of a gift you can't earn that you just have to receive that lastly I offer a gift of love John again in 1 John 316 writes this. This is how we know what love is. This is how love is boiled down. This is the definition of love. Jesus Christ laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for one another. See when you willingly choose to enter into the situations in your life and in the world where there is no peace, you might be tempted to be motivated by things other than love. Because things like anger and revenge give you a lot of momentary energy to head into the situation. But motivations of anger and revenge and things like that are not the way of the rabbi and they don't bring peace. See, when you are gripped and seized by the same love that brought Jesus to the cross, when you bring that into your areas in your life and in the world where there is no peace, you will be a peacemaker. You will be. Because the only true motivation for making peace has to be love. And the broken body and shed blood of Jesus show us how to be peacemakers by laying down our lives, our agendas, and our motives in the name of the one who first loved us. So as we move to the table, We can receive this gift of love now. We can receive a gift of faith now and of hope now. We can remember the first peacemaker whose broken body and shed blood was a Eucharist for us, a great blessing for which we can express our tremendous thanks. And then as we move from the table into our situations, in our lives and in the world where there is no peace, we can do so because we know the love and the hope and the faith of the God that overcomes is with us. Amen. Amen. Tom. It's so good to be back with you and no better place than around this table. I'm privileged to be able to share just a few thoughts in keeping with what Steve has invited us into. First of all, this is the Lord's table. It doesn't belong to any denomination or any group or sect. It belongs to the Lord. And he invites those of you who have a relationship with him that makes these elements meaningful to come and participate. And it means at least two things. One, it means a time of thanksgiving, thanking God for what he has done to make it possible for this to happen, for breaking the power of sin and death and showing us by his example and telling us with his words that death is not final. That those agonizing places he invites you and I into that feel like death, they just feel like death. They're not final. This isn't the end all. So as he asks us to courageously go into places where there is no peace, it may feel like death, but we have his promise that death is not final. And this table celebrates that. It's a time for us to give thanksgiving for that. It's also a time for us to participate with him in this, to pause for a moment to examine our lives and see how we are lined up with the purposes of God, with our rabbi, our teacher, our master, the one that we call our Lord. It's a good time as we come around the table to participate by beginning to reflect, how is my life lining up with his purposes? and then to resolve by his power that is at work within us that we are going to be those peacemakers he's called us to be. The kind of people that he was when he walked on the earth and invites us to participate with him in the ongoing work of building his kingdom. That's what this table is about, at least in part. And I'm excited to be able to share in this. And as the stewards, those who will be waiting on us for this, come forward. I think it's amazing how our God takes things in the physical world and he uses them to teach us about the reality of the spiritual world. So we have before us crackers and wine or juice. Each cracker is made up of individual grains of wheat that had to go into that transforming experience, that death experience, to be reborn into a whole new existence. And if they didn't submit to that, they couldn't participate in becoming the body, the bread that we're going to celebrate as a symbol of his body. The same way individual grapes, if they held on to their own identity, their own ego, their own pride, their own purposes, would never be allowed to submit to the crushing process, the breaking process that allows them to be born into a whole new existence. which allow us to celebrate the life that is in the blood of Jesus Christ. So these physical symbols are pictures of what he's inviting us into as we sit down in the heart of God, sit down in our own heart, and experience peace and then become peacemakers. Well, Paul instructs us that he received a revelation that on the night that Jesus betrayed, he took the bread and he broke it and he gave thanks and he said, this is my body which is given for you. And in the same way, after supper, he took the cup and he took the cup and he said, this is the new covenant in my blood. And when you do these things, when you eat the bread, when you drink the cup, you declare that the death of Jesus Christ is the way to life until he comes. It's a reminder for us today and it's a reminder of the hope we have in the future. Would you join with me in prayer as we offer up our thanksgiving and ask his blessing upon this time. Lord, thank you for what you have done in setting the example for us. We pray that as we take a moment to just pause and reflect upon our own hearts, our own lives, that you would speak, that you would draw, draw us to yourself, Help our lives to line up with your purpose and plan in the world. We pray that you would bless this experience with an empowering of your spirit that would accomplish these purposes to your glory. We pray this in Jesus' name. Thank you.
