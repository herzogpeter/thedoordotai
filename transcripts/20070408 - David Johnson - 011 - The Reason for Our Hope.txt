kingdom of God and the mission of our Rabbi Jesus, bringing the kingdom and then inviting us to be part of that very mission and message. But today we think about the fact that it's the resurrection of our Rabbi Jesus that sealed the deal. So we are so grateful. We are so grateful. I pray now that as we move into the ministry of the Word, the same power of your spirit and freedom we had in the context of worship would be true in the context of this word, and I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. The last couple of weeks, in the context of the series of sermons that we have been calling the way of the rabbi, we've been talking about the importance of understanding the message and the mission of Jesus in light of the fact that Jesus was himself a Torah-observant Jew, that his entire frame of reference was the Old Testament, that the Old Testament was his Bible, that Jesus grew up as a young boy in Nazareth, hearing the stories not of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, but of Moses and the prophets of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, and that those are the stories that served as the background that provided the context for his message and mission concerning the kingdom of God, and it's why for the last couple of weeks we have gone deep into the story of the Old Testament, examining themes that find their culmination and their explanation in this rabbi we have been coming to know as Jesus, and it's why I want to do it again today, to go into the Old Testament again. But this week I want to focus on a different theme. We've been doing a couple flyovers, three in a row of the Old Testament, kind of looking for a different theme in each flyover. This time, a theme that I think is fitting for Easter. The theme is this, hope. I want to talk about hope and the kingdom of God and how it is central, absolutely central, to understanding the message and the mission of our Rabbi Jesus. and it's rooted in an Old Testament story, a story that I'm going to break into three parts. We'll call it Three Acts, and we'll kind of see it as a drama. The whole Old Testament into the New Testament, Acts, or Act number one, we'll call God's original hope. What it was that God originally intended, desired, and designed for his creation. Act two, how that hope was lost. And then Act three, we'll see how Jesus and his followers saw the coming of his kingdom. to be among other things. The restoration of that hope and the restoration of that hope was his message and it was and is his mission to which he has called his people to be part of. Acts 1, Genesis 1, verse 1 says this in the beginning. God created the heavens and the earth and the earth was formless and void and darkness was over the surface of the deep and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the water. The word moving is often translated hovering or brooding. And to the ancient rabbis, the picture that was formed in the mind was actually that of a bird, particularly a dove, brooding over its young. Picture it protecting, nurturing, waiting for the birth of this life to come. One rabbi put it this way. The throne of divine glory was standing in space, hovering over the face of the waters, even as a dove hovers over its nest, protecting, nurturing, nourishing, waiting with great expectation. See, the picture you have to get of God in creation, while it's about to be born, is this, that God had great plans. God had great plans for his creation, conceived in love, and great anticipation was it. Genesis 1, 27, we come now to the birth, if you will, of his creation. Indeed, the crown of his creation, verse 27. And God created man in his own image. In the image of God, imago Dei. In the image of God, he created him, male and female. He created them, and God blessed them and said to them, have some fun, be fruitful. I expand this thing. It's going to start with you, but this is an ever-expanding universe that we are going to enjoy together. Multiply, fill the earth, subdue it, rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth. And then God said, behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed, and as you plant the seed it will grow and produce more. An ever-expanding universe that we'll do together, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed will do the same, and it will be food for you. And every beast of the earth and every bird of the sky and everything that moves on the earth which has life, I have given every green plant for food, and it was so. God saw all that he made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning. The sixth day, chapter 2, verse 2, then says that God looked on all that he had done and said, It is finished. Fascinating words have a haunting ring to them. We heard them Friday with Jesus on the cross. is finished. They are connected in some interesting ways. And then he rested on the seventh day. And once again, the ancient rabbis noted something that while God had declared it finished, there were some things he obviously and deliberately hadn't finished. But the lack of completion didn't mean there was something wrong. It was, as I've already mentioned, this sense of something beginning, like a baby is born, but that baby is going to grow. And there are two, a man and a women, and they will multiply, and there's another one, and then another one, and this ever-expanding universe. Because the whole point was this, in Act 1, where hope was very high, the whole point was this, that God desired to complete the task of creation, bringing it to its full potential in a collaborative partnership with the crown of his creation, the object of his love, the human race, men and women, in whom he had placed his very breath. Indeed, this concept of God collaborating with his human creation to expand the universe and bring it to its completion and see it grow and prosper and flourish. The ancients had a phrase for that. The phrase was this, to fix the world. To literally, you guys, in partnership with God, this was his dream, help the world reach its full potential, to fill the world, protect it, and then with God and man, to just enjoy watching it grow. So God places man and woman in the garden and says to them, take care of it. Attend it, work it. as we partner together in the care of this creation, thoroughly enjoying the process of watching this creation grow and reach its full potential under the rule and the reign of God. By the way, all of that is kingdom language. We get the idea sometimes, especially in our study of Jesus declaring the kingdom is within your reach as if Jesus was beginning the kingdom. This is kingdom language in Genesis. So in the context of Act 1, I hope you have the picture. Things are very hopeful. Act 2. The fall where hope is lost. Genesis 2.16, Genesis 3.4 then gives this picture of the serpent. That is, Satan saying to the woman, God's lying. You shall surely not die. The fruit isn't poison, it's sweet. See, God knows, verse 5 says Satan to the man and the woman, that in the days you eat of this fruit he's told you to not eat of, your eyes will be open. In other words, you're blind now, said Satan. God wants to keep you that way. His desire is to keep you in the dark, which means, and this is one of the fundamental lies of the evil one to humanity, it's this, he can't be trusted. God can't be trusted. He isn't good. He doesn't have what's best for you in view. So if you disobey him, a very good thing will happen. Your eyes will be open. And so they did eat the fruit. And when they did, their eyes were open. And so in some sense, Satan was absolutely right. But what they saw was sin and death. And what they felt was naked and ashamed and guilty. And for the very first time, they felt something they had never felt before. Despair. So what they did was hide. First from God, Adam, where are you? And then they learned to hide from each other, placing fig leaves on each other, to hide from each other. They even learned to hide from themselves. And we've been doing that ever since, hiding from God and from each other. Never before, as this story unfolds, had a despairing thought ever entered their minds. But now, they would never be free from it. They would spend their lives trying to find things, indeed, to relieve it. But regardless of what they did, They would never be able to fix it. So that now Tikkun Alam, fix the world, bringing all of this to its full potential is precisely what they cannot do. So the Lord God in chapter 3, verse 23 of Genesis sent them out of the garden. Now, to the ancients, this banishment from the garden was the theological picture of what we talked about in length last week. That was the theme we kind of did in our flyer of the whole Old Testament. The theme was this one word, exile. Exile, where the fundamental reality is this. We're not home anymore. We're not protected anymore. God is not hovering anymore. Ephesians chapter 2, strangers and aliens, says Paul, is who we are without hope and without God in the world. N.T. Wright, as I quoted him last week, says that to understand this idea of exile is maybe the single most necessary idea to understand, if you hope to understand, the message and the mission of Christ as it was perceived by the original here. So let me explain it like this. The picture is this. After the fall, the human race goes into exile. That is, separated from God, are they? But God begins again to call them home. After Noah, he begins that call home with a guy named Abraham. Remember him? who he promises will be the father of a great nation, that great nation would be Israel, and Israel would be a light unto the nations, through whom God would, what, fix the world, tikkun olam. But something, as we talked about last week in length, continually went wrong, time after time after time, because over and over, the people of Israel would turn their hearts from God. We saw it last week, particularly in Solomon, because of his 700 wives, because of his lust, actually, his heart was turned away from God to other gods, so his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God like his father David was, so the Egyptians came. And it wasn't just solemn, and this happened to the people of God over and over, and then the Assyrians and Babylonians and the Persians and then the Greeks as they over and over go into exile. So it said, in Jesus' day, as we kind of now fast forward the tape to Jesus' time, this issue of exile is the theological spiritual and emotional issue of the day because if you are a first century jew the thinking is simply this we are supposed to be the people of god through whom god will bring tikkun alam through whom god will fix the world but look around there is no descendant of david on the throne rome is on the throne fix the world we need someone to fix us, to deliver us, and just about anyone will do, quite frankly, if they end our exile. Now, to all of that add this, that the teachings of the prophets all through the Old Testament consistently made one thing clear, that exile always came about because of sin. Remember, they would turn their hearts away from God's. And exile, according to the prophets, would end when the hearts of the people would what? Return to God. And God would forgive their sin. Lamentations 4.22 says, The forgiveness of your sin, O daughter of Zion, will be accomplished, and he will keep you in exile no more. That was their hope. So when sin has been forgiven, then will come the return from exile, strangers and aliens no more, and then will begin tikkun olam, this partnership with God and his people to fix the world, to bring the kingdom of God, to bear upon the affairs of men, Act 3, Mark 1, where hope begins to be rekindled with these words. And it came about, verse 9, Mark 1, verse 9, and it came about in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan and immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens opening and the spirit like a dove descending upon him. Now, when it speaks of the heavens opening there, it is not speaking of some weird cloud formation where clouds begin to part and blue sky starts appearing, like you might see in a movie with weird organ music playing behind. It's like kind of an attempt to go, this is how it really happened. That isn't how it really happened. This is kingdom language. You need to dial into this so you can hear what literally is happening. This is symbolic language, and what it's saying is something wonderful. For what it's saying is this, that something is happening here upon which you really can begin to pin your hopes. For the sphere of the heavens is opening up, is being brought near, for the rule and the reign of God is now within your reach. And then it says in that verse I just read that the Spirit descended on him like a what? Like a dove. I love the connections of the story. Genesis 1, remember that? Verse 2, at creation, God hovered like a dove over his yet-to-be-born creation, protecting it and nurturing it, waiting for it to be born. And now in Mark, the story is coming back. The story is coming back. God's going to get it back, for God is hovering again like a of. Again, he's moving on the waters, this time the waters of baptism again, but this time it's not at the inception of creation. Now it's at the inception of recreation, so that in verse 14, Jesus began to proclaim the gospel of God, the good news. I have good news of God, and the good news is this, that The kingdom of heaven is within your reach, for God has now begun. Tikkun alam, the fixing of the world by the mending of the human heart through the forgiveness of sin. The exile is over, and you can come home again to God. You can come back to. You can return to the fullness of your identity as a person and as a people of God, and you can return with a sense of confidence to the mission God has given you to partner with him in the fixing of the world, a mission that he put on his creation in Genesis chapter 1. And as Jesus began to teach them about the kingdom of God, as he healed the sick and fed the hungry and defied Herod and cleansed the temple, a very powerful but frightening thing began to happen in the hearts of a few, particularly to the people who were paying attention to what he was saying and what he was doing. the thing that happened to them was this. They began to get their hopes up, which is a very dangerous thing because to get your hopes up means that your heart could be broken. Fast forward now to the final scene, Luke 24. Jesus has just been crucified. There are rumors of his resurrection, but no way to verify that. Who would believe such an outrageous thing? Two disciples on the road to Emmaus were discussing the awful events in Jerusalem concerning the Christ and how they had gotten their hopes up at one time. When Jesus and his resurrected body actually began to walk with them and speak with them, though they were prevented, it says in verse 16, from actually recognizing him. So in this place where they're grieving and Jesus is risen, but they don't recognize him, Jesus asks them a question, what are you talking about, verse 17, and they just stood there silently looking sad, the verse says. Just nothing to say. When one of them named Cleopas, and just to add to the picture here, most scholars believe that Cleopas and the other person with him was his wife. So you have man and woman, Adam, Eve, together. They are there. And the one Cleopas, after Jesus asks, what are you... Did you hear about these events? Cleopas says this, are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who's unaware of the things that happened here in these days? And he that is, Jesus said to them, what things? And they said to him, the things about Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty indeed in word and in the sight of God and all the people, and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to the sentence of death and crucified him, but we were hoping that he was going to be the one who redeemed Israel. We were hoping that he would be the one who would bring us out of our exile so we wouldn't be separate anymore. Then Jesus began to try to explain to them in verses 25 through 27 how a suffering and death, which they thought was the end of their hope, was in fact designed by God to be the ultimate reason for their hope, for God had planned something so wonderful that one day people would actually refer to the day of his suffering and death as a very good day. They'd call it Good Friday. But they still didn't get it because they still didn't see. So God gave them a gift. And we see how it unfolds in verse 30. And it came about that when Jesus, he, that is Jesus, had reclined at the table with them, He took the bread and blessed it and breaking it, he began giving it to them. And their eyes were what? Open. And that was the gift. And they recognized him. And then their eyes were open. And that's the gift they got. Their eyes were open. And they were never the same again. I'll connect this part of the story to the first part of the story. Remember Genesis 1? When Adam and Eve sinned, it says their eyes were open. But what they saw was sin and death, and what they felt when they saw sin and death was guilt and shame, and what they did was hide from God and from each other. But now in Luke 27, 24, some eyes are being opened again. In Genesis 1, it was Adam and Eve, a man and a woman. I think on purpose in Luke 24, it is Cleopas and his wife, symbolic of humanity that God created for himself. Some eyes are open in Luke 24, but this time what they see is the defeat of sin and death because they see Jesus alive, risen from the dead, having broken the power of sin and death. And what they feel is hope for the forgiveness of sin and freedom from guilt and shame and despair. And what they know is that they don't have to hide anymore. And what they realize is that the tikkun olam, the fixing of the world, has finally begun and that they get to be a part of it, that they get to be a part of it by putting their confidence in and learning to follow the way of this rabbi named Jesus by believing in his message and taking on his mission. So what they do is go back to Jerusalem in verse 33. And what they say when they get there is this, verse 34, the Lord really has risen, which means, beloved, among other things, this. It's time to get your hopes up. Amen. Beloved, the good news of the gospel of the kingdom is this, that the exile is over, that the tikkun olam has begun, that God is fixing the world by the healing of hearts of ordinary people like you and like me, by forgiving our sin and removing our shame by opening our eyes and restoring our hope. But even more than that, by re-enlisting us in the mission of partnering with him in the bringing of his glorious creation into the fullness of its glorious potential, Tecun Alam. And that is why, beloved, we worship. That is why we serve. That is why we follow our Rabbi Jesus. And that is why we sing. Amen.
