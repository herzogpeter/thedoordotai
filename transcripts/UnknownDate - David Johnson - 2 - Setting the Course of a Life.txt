Open your Bibles with me to the book of James. The third chapter study brings us back again this week to a section covering the second through the twelfth verse. James chapter 3 verses 2 through 12. We are dealing these weeks in a series of sermons born of this particular section in James that I have entitled, The Taming of the Tongue. The series began in verse 2 with this acknowledgement from the writer James. For we all stumble, or we all sin in many ways. And in considering the many ways in which we all sin, among the most common, according to James, among the most central and maybe even it could be said the most serious, are sins of the tongue. Indeed, verse 2 goes on to say, If anyone is able to tame the tongue, or if anyone is able to avoid sins of the tongue, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well. In other words, the tongue, if tamed, has control over everything else. Everything else will follow. Therefore, I think James is making that the priority issue, the most serious thing. He'd be a perfect man, but nobody's perfect. Verse 8 tells us why, for no one can tame the tongue. The fact is this, it is in all of us a restless evil, full of deadly poison, full of hurtful potential. I couldn't have been much more than seven years old. The reason I'm kind of landing on that age is the memory I have of this particular incident. It happened at a school that my family left when I was nine, so it was right around seven years old. And the incident that I have a memory of is one that is not unique to me. As I tell you this, all of you have a story like this, I am quite sure. Seven years old, I'm coming in from the playground after recess. On this particular recess, I'm coming in differently than I normally do. This time, my head is down, my chin is quivering, and I wanted to hide. The teacher noticed, what's wrong, David? Are you okay? Oh, my chin had been quivering already, and I was wanting to hide, and now she noted. I didn't want her to see me. I was hoping like crazy she'd see me. But now it feels like everybody sees me. And even when I was seven years old, I knew the rules. The rules were these, little boys don't cry, little boys don't cry, don't cry, don't cry too late. Marissa called me a name she's just exploding Marissa is such a powerful person oh no she called you a name what'd she call you I can't repeat it if you say it out loud I gotta hear it again Marissa You know, here's the deal. You get called a lot of names when you're seven years old. The playground's kind of a rough place to be. But not all names have the same effect. Not everybody who gave a taunt made my chin quiver and my knees weak. The ones, not just when I was seven, but throughout the life, that have the power to make the chin quiver and the knees weak are the ones that are coming from somebody, first of all, who for whatever reason I was hoping they would like me, who for whatever reason I felt the need in me for them to approve of me, and evidently at this particular time Marissa was somebody that that mattered about. As time goes on, the Marissas of our life become a little bit more significant, and time doesn't even have to go on because even at seven years old There are a lot of people bigger than Marissa whose yes are things that we deeply, dearly desire. Daddy has a lot more power than Marissa, so does Mommy. And maybe there was that coach at that particular time in your life when you were extremely vulnerable and very much wanted somebody to affirm something of your masculinity or femininity or a teacher to do the same or just your identity, just to notice you. And somehow the word they even said wasn't that big, but it went way in sight because the dynamic that has the power to make the chin quiver and the knees weak has to do with who it is that's saying it. A lot of people could call you, again, a lot of names, maybe worse than what this person called you, and you just kind of blow it off. It doesn't make a difference. But when they said it, somehow went inside. It's not just the person who they are. It's what they say. For what they said out loud on the playground of life and the playgrounds change as we get older. But what they said out loud, the reason it hurt, was because they said something that you kind of knew was true anyway, but you were hoping no one would notice. Go back and be seven. I mean one of the cruel things that kids kind of do and we're trying to kind of build ourselves up when we do it but we notice physical flaws just like that and you were hoping nobody noticed that your nose was big but it was and they noticed it and this time you were hoping but they did and now it's out loud and everybody knows and you were hoping they wouldn't notice that your hair was funny or your legs are skinny or you feel fat or you're slow or you think you're stupid, you think you're stupid But you wonder, and then somebody said it out loud, and now it's obviously true now. And when you played games, you played them with all your heart, and you ran as fast as you could, but you always felt like you were clumsy, and you always felt like you were slow, but you hoped nobody noticed, and then somebody said it out loud. And the person who said it was the fastiest, quickest, best, and why did they have to be the ones who noticed how slow and fat and clumsy, and oh my, and it goes inside, and it makes your twin quiver, It makes your knees weak. The advice we got in those days, those days being those seven-year-old days, and the we being all of us, it's kind of like, I don't know, I'm just assuming this was the advice we got when somebody said a hurtful thing, was not entirely helpful. Now, David, next time someone calls you a name, just say this. Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt me. seven years old that is that is so empowering i'm ready for the playground now you know i mean i don't want to build this whole thing around this goofy phrase but the truth is i honestly i don't remember ever actually using that phrase to defend myself I remember using that phrase when what was said came from somebody I didn't really care that much about when somebody said something that really didn't get inside I'd use that phrase but never to defend myself I'd use that phrase to attack back and taunt them back sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me especially the words you say you idiot but when the words came from somebody that I was hoping would like me and they said something that I kind of thought was true anyway, hope nobody noticed, and now it's in the spotlight. Never did I feel like that phrase would protect the wound that had already happened. For here is the truth. While sticks and stones can break my bones, words could pierce my heart. And words can wound the soul. You see, if I break my bone with a stone, I go to a doctor. And in the skill, and with the skill that he or she might have, they will set that bone, and it will hurt like crazy, but they will set it, and they will cast it, and they will medicate it, and they will heal it, and six weeks later, I'm going to be better, and I might miss a few games, but I'll be back, and everybody knows I'll be back, and even while I'm laid up, I know, I'll be back. but who do you go to who do you talk to where's the doctor if what got wounded was your soul if what got broken was your heart and if there were such a thing as a doctor of the soul and you could go and have a little visit and they would have an x-ray machine how would you in the preliminary examination explain to the doctor where it hurts. I mean, if I broke my leg, that'd be easy. They'd be able to see. They'd see me limp. They'd see why I'm limping. They'd see the swelling. And then how would you explain to the doctor, the soul, not only where it hurts, but why it hurts? Because there isn't any evidence. Because the arrows of a word pierce the heart. It's almost as if they do their damage and then the arrow itself vaporizes. So there isn't any external, well, you can't show, well, this is it right here. And how do you explain not only why it hurts, but how do you explain why it still hurts? How do you explain why sometimes after 25 years, how come after 35, 45, how come it still hurts after all that time? How come you still, even though in your family, in your work, there is a competence about you, how come you still feel stupid? And you still feel invisible and inadequate. I wish I would have just broke my leg. I wish they would have just thrown a stone. All that to bring me right back to the text. all that to invite you this morning to come with me again this week and marvel at the power of the tongue to do among other things three things that I shared with you last time number one marvel with me at the power of the tongue to set the course of a life be reminded of the text it starts in verse 3 here's the course of the life if we put bits in horse's mouth so that they may obey us we direct their entire body as well with the tiny little bit. It sets the course of their life. Behold the ships also. Another example. Though they are great, are driven by strong winds, are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot desires. So also is the tongue. Marvel with me again this morning at the power of the tongue to direct the course of life. Number two, marvel at the power of the tongue to damage people. Verse six, the tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity. the tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body. It sets on fire or it sets the course of our lives and it is set on fire by hell. With it, verse 9, we bless God. With it, we curse men from the same mouth. It's amazing. Come blessing and cursing comes life and death. Marvel with me again today at the power of the tongue to damage people but also to bless people. Third, marvel with me again this week at the power of the tongue to reveal the heart. In other words, marvel with me at the power of the tongue to reveal what's damaged in my heart because every time I speak a bitter word, what it really does is it reveals in my bitter word a bitterness in me, an unhealed thing in me. And the tongue has an incredible capacity as I come out with venom to reveal the venom that still resides in me. Now, last time we dealt with this, I indicated that this week we would deal with that third thing. Trying to discover those things that drive the venom that comes from our mouth. To my apologies, it's not actually more of an explanation. I'm pushing that back one more week. the deep look at all of that, because I found myself this week marveling again from an entirely different angle than I did last time at the power of the tongue to set the course of a life. But while we're going to spend more time on point one and two again this week from an entirely different angle, I firmly believe that as we better understand how the power of the tongue has in fact set the course of our lives, the power of maybe other people's speech to us to set the course of our life. In doing that, we will, I believe, come to better understand what does drive our tongue and will set us up very well to receive the word that is about to come where we talk about the bitterness in us that drives our own tongue. With all of that said, let's get down to this outline. The power of the tongue to set in motion the course of a life. The two analogies here I just read in verses 3 and 4 clearly are simply the bit in a horse's mouth in a rudder on a ship. The point of those two illustrations is this, that something very small has power to influence the direction of something very large, like a horse or a ship or a life. Indeed, something in verse 4 caught my attention, that even though these ships are driven by strong winds, the direction of the ship, the destination of the ship, is not determined ultimately by the strong winds, but rather by the small rudder. Now that caught my attention because if I was just looking at a ship and didn't know much about him, I would think that what really had the great influence on the ship's direction would be the strong wind. If you're a sailor, you know that you can set the sail a different way and you can move the rudder a certain way, but sometimes you can actually go into the wind. It is amazing how the rudder, not the wind, has the ultimate say about your direction. So also the tongue, says verse 5. You see, I would think looking at a life that adversities in life and pain in life and just life, which is hard, would be the ultimate thing that would determine whether somebody's life is going to go to life or death. Healthy things or hurtful things. And the word of God here is saying it's like a rudder. I'll tell you what has more influence in the direction of our lives into life and death are the words. that are spoken. And you know what? There are life-affirming words that have empowered people to live their lives literally into the wind and succeed. And there are death-dealing words that regardless of the calmness of the life externally render people very, very wounded, sometimes with no direction whatsoever. Marvel at the power of the tongue to set the course of life. into positive things and into negative things. The main tenor of this whole section is the power of the tongue to kind of do negative things. What I want to introduce here, it's really important that in this whole series we spend at least one week on the potential for the tongue to do positive as well. Proverbs 18.21 pulls it together this way. Life and death are in the power of the tongue. James 3.10 pulls it together this way. From the same tongue can come blessing or cursing. From the same tongue can come life or death. Beloved, we have in our mouths the power to speak to people life and death. Blessing and cursing. And these words in our mouths that we speak to our children, to our spouses, to our friends, to our colleagues at work. These words in our mouths have the power to set the course of life. Now, just this little qualifier. A word from your mouth does not have the power to determine your life. The thing I want you to get here is they do, however, have the power to move you, to move you, to set the course, to move you in a direction. I really like you. Moves you that way. I really care about you. I really believe in you. And it sets you in a direction. Positive words of affirmation can be aborted. Negative words that speak death can be aborted by the life of God, by the truth of God. They don't have the ultimate state. But I'll tell you what, words of death and life set the course. They can push you in a direction. Think about the influence of words this way. A real practical level. You know, some of the career paths that you have chosen and you're sitting in right now and maybe you're frustrated with your career, maybe you're delighted, you can't even believe you got this job you have, were set in motion for some of you by a word. It's interesting. I was talking to a woman who came up to me between services. I would say she was in her early 50s. And she said, you know, I'm going to tell you about an English teacher I had in 12th grade. Here's this woman, mid-50s, remembers an English teacher she had in 12th grade. And when she started talking about her, she started to cry. And when she said, when she started to cry, I said, marvel at the power of a word. I just said, marvel at the power of a word. I didn't know if she was going to say a negative thing about this woman in 12th grade or a positive thing. Turns out that this teacher in 12th grade said these words to her, I believe in you. You're good at that. You're good at writing. And she said, I am a writer today. Marvel at the power of a word. Some of you are in careers because a positive word was spoken to you. Some of you are in certain careers because a negative word was spoken to you. And the negative words over and over was this. You'll never do it. You are so stupid. Don't even bother. Don't even bother. So you didn't even bother to try to apply for college, to do the kinds of things you need to do in order to set a course for a career that you might have. And you may be very capable. You may be very bright. You may have incredible potential, but there were words spoken over you and into you. It doesn't make you bad or defective, but you believed them. You were 10 years old. And so you didn't even try, and the bar that you were willing to jump over was always set by you really low. Now you're 35, and you're thinking, I could have jumped way higher. I could have jumped way higher. Some of you have an adventurous spirit, a risk-taking spirit. You know what? Some of the dynamic of your risk-taking spirit was set in motion for you by a word that someone spoke to you. Maybe it was a father. Hope it was a mother. Maybe for you it wasn't a father or a mother, and that's a sad thing. But you know what? There was an English teacher in 12th grade somewhere along the line possibly, or a coach, or a friend, or a spouse. Maybe there wasn't anybody until that spouse came along who was free enough from himself or herself to speak this into your life. You know what? I believe in you. And I think you can. And maybe you've heard messages that you can't. But they are lies. And they began to speak into you words of life. And they began to set the course of your life. And an ability to take risks and move into things you weren't sure you could do began to rise up in you. And they started with a word. some of you have an insatiable drive for success and that insatiable drive for success for some of you was set in motion by a word but I want you to consider the possibility that some of our insatiable drives for success were not set in motion by positive words of life but negative words of death what are you talking about? I think you probably know exactly what I'm talking about you are such a loser. You will never amount to anything. Maybe those words exactly were not heard. Maybe they were exactly what you heard. But then somewhere along the line, you found out that you, you know what? Big surprise. It was a huge surprise. You found out there was something you weren't good at. And you started doing it and doing it and doing it and doing it and doing it. And your drive for success, you're 35 years old now. Your drive for success is not being born out of Some helpful, this is what I was made for. I was made for this. This is great to be functioning consistent with who God made. Now your drive for success is born out of a deep need to prove again today that they are wrong. I can't do this. And it's fueled by anger. And the arrow that pierced your heart that said you were a loser and said you'd never amount has vaporized. You don't even know. Some of you don't even know where that word came from anymore. vaporized. The fact is this, you may be successful. You may be wildly successful. More money than you ever thought you'd have. A nicer house. But in your spirit, you're not settled. You're successful, but you're not satisfied. It's never enough. It's never enough. It's never enough. And the people around you who were drawn to you, especially because of some of this drive. At the beginning, they were drawn to you because of it. This guy's a goer. This woman's a mover, a shaker. Like being around that energy. But now you've got a family, and they've been around that for a while, and you're hearing from people who love you pretty much. They love you a lot, and they're speaking into your life some things like this. You better stop. Would you please notice us? But you can't stop. You want to stop. You can't stop. Why? Because you're driven. And all that was set in motion by word. The power of the tongue to bless sets the course of our lives into life. The power of the tongue to curse sets the course of our life into death. I want to look a little bit at the tongue's power to bless and curse. Let's look first of all at its power to bless. Open in your Bibles with me to Hebrews 11. Just kind of keep your thumb in James and turn over to Hebrews 11. Just a couple pages to the left. Hebrews 11 it's really an odd place to go when you think about it if we're talking about the power the tongue has to curse and to bless because it is as you know if you look at it real quick you go oh yeah this is the gallery of faith this is that chapter where from verse to verse examples of men and women are recorded who acted in obedient heroic faith and because of obedient heroic faith they were put in here among the people in here are two men Isaac and Jacob now the reason they caught my attention was not that they're here because Isaac and Jacob are pretty strong biblical names oh yeah I know about them I don't know their whole story but I would expect those two names to be in the gallery of faith it's not that they're here it's why they're here that caught my attention relative to what I'm talking about see everybody who's in here is in here because of kind of what they did by faith Noah for example is in chapter 11. For by faith he built an ark. In faithful obedience, a land where there had not been rain, only drought, the deluge was spoken to him as coming, and in faith, and in the face of tremendous ridicule, he obeyed God and built the ark. That's a big deal. That was a big effort. And so obviously he's in there for that. Sarah was a woman who by faith, beyond menopause, beyond the possibility of having a child. She was old. Her womb was barren. By faith, she received the miraculous child, Isaac. So I know why she's there. That's a big deal. Moses is, of course Moses is here, if anybody's going to be in here. Moses would be. He was there because by obedient faith, he led God's people out of bondage. Now read in verses 20 and 21, Isaac. and Jacob. By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau his brother even regarding things to come. Basically even regarding things to come as a father. I don't know exactly what he said but what he communicated to his children was this. You have a hope and you have a future. I believe in you. I am invoking the name of God on you and in the name of God you got a hope and you got a future. He blessed his children. Then Isaac, who was blessed by his father, passed that blessing on. Next verse. By faith, Jacob, who had been blessed by Isaac as he was dying, blessed each one of the sons of Joseph. And worshiped leaning on the top of his staff. All I want you to note about those two verses is this, that with all the great works of obedient faith in chapter 11, These two men are mentioned for no other reason than they blessed their children. That is huge to me. God in Hebrews 11 puts the power of a verbal blessing, puts the power of a word to set the course of a young man or young woman's life on the par with the building of the ark, with the birth of a miracle child, with the delivery of God's people from bondage. That is to say, the words of life, we speak to one another, our children, our co-workers, the words of life we speak to one another is a big deal to God. And while most of us can get in touch pretty quickly with those wounded places where words of death were spoken to us, this would be a good time to even ask the Spirit of God to give you a memory of the men and women in your life who did not speak death to you but life. The reason sometimes it's harder to remember the words of life is because I don't have to recover from the words of life spoken to me. I have to recover from the words of death. But the words of life, we love them, we appreciate them, and they set the course of our life, but they're not what's in my face. But it would be an important discipline, even a gift that we'd ask God for right now, for you to remember just briefly the face of that 12th grade teacher, your father, your mother, maybe that coach, that friend, that colleague, that spouse, who in one way or another said, I believe in you, I think you can. But I want you to notice something else, even as you do that briefly, and maybe it's already gone, That this blessing I'm talking about, especially for those of us who know Christ, we can enter into this in ways that nobody else can, quite frankly, and you'll understand that in a minute. This blessing that we would confer upon our children and our friends and our spouses and each other as beloved believers in Christ, this blessing is something deeper than have a nice day. Now, saying bless you, bless you, bless you is something that in a Christian context, a church like ours, we would be fairly comfortable saying to one another casually. somebody leaves bless you bless you and some of you wouldn't be comfortable but if any context you'd be comfortable maybe here but after a while it becomes not much more than saying have a nice day and it's nice at that level I just want you to know there's more to it Exodus chapter 6 verse 23 God is explaining to the people of Israel the importance of blessing the children specifically and it's so important to bless the children says God that he gives them a blessing to speak over them and into them And then at the end of that, at the end of the blessing that he gives, and you can read in Exodus 6, God in Exodus 6 verse 23 explains to the people who are going to confer this blessing the ultimate aim of the blessing. What I want you to do in all of this is invoke my name on them. I love that. I want you to know that when you are blessing, what you are in fact doing is speaking my name on them. The name of God on you, Jacob. I put as your father the name of God on your life. I love that. But to that now add this truth. That in Exodus 19.6, 1 Peter 2.9, Revelation 1.6 and Revelation 5.10, the word of God says that we who are in the family of God shall be a kingdom of priests unto our God. 1 Peter 2.9 says we are a chosen race, a holy nation, a royal priesthood. And as priests, all of us, this is not Pastor Dave has this. This is a believer. Every believer in this room is a royal priest. And as a royal priest, you have royal priestly functions. And among those functions is the priestly authority to bless. I can't do this for you. I don't think I have words to paint the picture well enough. But for men and women in this room who name the name of Jesus, who have the life of God in them, to indeed, right now, in their minds and in their spirit, man and woman, say, Holy Spirit of God, I receive the mantle of a priest and I receive with that mantle authority to bless. That is to speak the name of God on people. Name of God on you. The life of God on you. I put on you the name of God. I want to talk with that in mind. I want to talk to Sunday school teachers in our midst. I want to talk to nursery workers and youth leaders. I want to talk to the choir directors among us. I want to talk to coaches. I want to talk to teachers and parents. I want to talk to aunts and uncles. I want to talk to big brothers. I want to talk to big sisters. I want to talk to big kids who have little kids who look up to them. I want to tell you something. If you're in Christ, you are a part of a royal priesthood. And you have the mantle of a priest. And you may have a lot to grow in. And there's maybe a lot of things you don't know and you're going to need to learn. And as we get older, we will. But I want to tell you, I don't care how old you are. You have authority from God to bless. You have authority. And to have authority means that when you do it, it works. It matters. You have authority to put the name of God on people. So I authorize you by the word of the Lord as kingdom people to bless and put the name of God on people. I mean, think about doing this. These kids walk by. Name of God on you. Name of God. I mean, they're moving so fast. It's like you need the radar from a fighter pilot gun. Name of God on you. Choir leaders. You know what? It's really important that you teach the kids to sing. I don't care if you're a choir leader here at church, maybe you're at school. It's really important that they get the notes and they learn the song and they learn the melodies and the different parts. You know what's way more, if you're a choir leader, but you're also a child of the king, and you're in a public school, or if you're working with our kids, you are a royal priest. You know what that means? That way, way beyond. The importance of teaching them how to sing a song is the importance of blessing them to all year long in ways that may be even creative, and you can't even think of right now to put the name of God on him. I put the name of God. Bless you. I put the name of God on you. and maybe what you need to do is pick the hardest kid, the one you have the hardest time liking, and I put the name of God on you. Well, that's just a waste of time. You have the authority of a priest to intercede the life of God in people's lives. Would you please believe it? I want to talk to teachers. You know what, teachers? It's really important that you teach them the material, that they learn how to add and divide and work with fractions, that they learn how to deal with participles if it's English and verbs and nouns and know the difference and know how to write sentences and they know the history of the world it's really important I'm not kidding it really is important and if you're a teacher in the church it really is important that they understand the story of the Red Sea and how Jesus died on the cross and when it happened and that he rose and all of the things that come around that that they know the story that they know the material it really is important could I tell you something that's even more important that you bless them that you understand that you are a priest in their midst and you have authority to put the name of God on them and to understand that there may be other people doing that but there may be nobody else doing that makes it even more important that you be in that place with those kids doing something more than teaching them math. I put the name of God on you. Well, they would kick me out of school if I said, don't say it out loud then. I don't care if you say it out loud or not. You're a priest, just do it. coaches tell you what coaches it's really important that you teach your kids how to dribble the ball and how to shoot it it's really important that you show them where to stand and how to move but you know what's more important than the X's and the O's and the play that they gotta get right and they gotta get it right you know it's way more important than that that those little boys and those little girls get blessed by you and I'm telling you if you're a coach if you're out there with kids if you're out there with older kids if you're out there, you are a priest. You are in such an incredibly delightful, wonderful place because you can put the name of God on them. A guy named Joe came up to me between services right in the hall and he said, thanks for this word today. He said, you know, I'm a hockey coach. And he said, we got these kids and this hockey is just a maniac sport. And these kids, it's a good team. We got this one kid, he's just so angry. He's really a good hockey player. And he just doesn't have anything. We keep trying to pull him in and pull him in. and every time we discipline him, it's like, I don't care. He doesn't care, and I know he cares. And he said, I even ask other coaches, what should we do to this kid? And the word is always, discipline him, bench him. We just bench him, and we do him, we bench him. And every time we bench him, he doesn't, yeah, I don't care. And he's becoming more and more apathetic. He said, I just got off the phone with the guy I coached with, and I said, we're going to take this kid, and we're going to bless him. We're going to put the name of God on him. and when you do stand back and marvel at the power of a word to set the course of a life you walk through the halls I mean I get excited about this getting ignited in our hearts as you walk out the halls as you walk out here today bless people as you go I mean don't be goofy about it bless you bless you bless you but it was good I gotta tell you between services it was kind of cool because there was a lot of bless you stuff going on, but it was real. It wasn't have a nice day. It was name of God on you, name of God on you too. As kids, you know, you're going to go out there, there's going to be a bunch of kids running around knocking you over. Everyone that goes, but think about it. In your spirit, you won't be able to catch up with them. Name of God on you. Kid almost knocked, they're going to knock you over. When you go in the infancy, they will knock you over. As soon as they do, grab them, name of God on you as you fall. Parents, bless your children. bless your children do it every day do it every day in ways that are easy try to catch them doing something good there he did there he did wait for a little while longer now oh there she goes notice it notice it and bless them but it's more than noticing they did a good thing maybe right in the middle of them doing a bad thing right in the middle of a discipline. Maybe right in the middle of a discipline when you're having to say hard words. Because by the way, love does not always just go, you're doing great. When you're not doing great, right in the middle of a discipline say, and at the end of this, you may not be ready to receive this, but I put the name of God on you, boy. And you may run and you may hide, but the name of God's on you. Could I tell you, parents, look for ways to bless your kids. Could I tell you something? Do it formally. Bless your kids formally. You know, I got this from the men's ministry. who caught this in a retreat, and they do it quite often now, where they have recognized the need for blessing specifically at certain times in their lives. And in these retreats, often they talk about the fact that the blessing didn't ever come to them. And so they've had some retreats. Our men's ministry has had some retreats where what they do is they put the blessing on each other, where it wasn't from maybe a dad or a mom, and they put the blessing on each other, and they do it formally. And they speak words of life to one another, the kind of thing that maybe they would have liked to have heard from their father. And they invoke the name of God on that blessing. I don't think we know a lot about this. It's a new thing. But for me, to almost ceremonially, especially at critical times when my daughters are moving into their womanhood. Like when we came around my daughters when they went off to school and we came around our daughters, my wife and I, and we blessed our daughters. To do it formally. A couple years ago, I'm going to do it with my youngest in a couple months when I just go away with them. But a couple of months ago, or years ago, actually, I took Caleb away, and we went to a motel, and I was speaking someplace, and I just brought him with. And I had this big agenda. I wanted to just be with him, and I wanted to speak some things to him, his father stuff. And, you know, a number of the things were like, oh. That was his response. That was my response before I went, oh. But then I was mature when I talked to him. But his name is Caleb, and my wife and I talked about this. And I told him about his name. I told him about his name. I told him about his name in the Bible and how the spies went out and they didn't come back, believe in God. They were overwhelmed. But there were two people, Joshua and Caleb, who believed God and they came back with a different report. Instead of Caleb, he was a man of a different spirit. And he said, Caleb, and I said, Caleb, I'm speaking this over you. You're a person of a different spirit. And I'm going to pray that over you. He doesn't know what that means and I don't know completely myself what that means. And is that the final word for that boy? I don't know. I'll tell you what. It does have the power to do it. has the power to set the course of a life. It has the power to move them one more inch this way, this way toward life. Look for ways to bless your children, to speak life-affirming things to your children, and then marvel at the power of a word to set the course of a life. Amazing stories told by Brian Harbour in his book, Rising Above the Crowd, about a little boy named Ben Hooper. Don't often do this, but I just want to read this. Enter into this with me. Ben Hooper was born many years ago in the footholds Foothill. There's a story told many years ago. Ben Hooper was born many years ago in the foothills of East Tennessee. Little boys and girls like Ben who were born to unwed mothers were ostracized and treated terribly. By the time Ben was three years old, the other children would scarcely play with him. Parents were saying idiotic things to him like, what's a boy, or about him, what's a boy like that playing with our children? As if Ben had something to do with his own birth. Saturday was the toughest day of all for Ben. His mom would take him down to the little general store to buy their supplies for the week. Invariably, the other parents in the store would make caustic remarks just loudly enough for both mom and child to hear. Comments like, did they ever figure out who his real daddy is? Those are hard things for a 7-year-old boy, a 12-year-old boy to hear. In those days, there was no kindergarten. So at the age of 6, little Ben entered the first grade. He was given his own desk, as were all the children. At recess, however, he stayed at the little desk and studied because none of the other children would play with him. At noon, little Ben could be found eating his sack lunch by himself. The happy chatter of children who shunned him was barely audible from where he sat. It was a big event when anything changed in the foothills of East Tennessee. And when little Ben was 12 years old, a new preacher came to pastor the little church in Ben's town. Almost immediately, little Ben started hearing exciting things about him, about how loving and non-judgmental he was, how he accepted people just as they were, and when he was with them, he made them feel like they were the most important people in the world. Reportedly, the preacher had charisma. When he walked into a group of any size anywhere, the entire complexion of the place changed. Their smiles broadened, their laughter increased, and their spirits rose. One Sunday, though he had never been to church a day in his life, little Ben Hooper decided he was going to go and hear this guy preach. He got there late, and he left early because he did not want to be seen by anyone. But he liked what he heard. For the first time in that young boy's life, he caught just a glimmer of hope. Ben was back in church the next Sunday and the next and the next he always got there late and he always left early but his hope was building every Sunday on about the 6th or 7th Sunday the message was so moving and exciting that Ben became absolutely enthralled with it it was almost as if there was a sign behind the preacher's head that read for you little Ben Hooper of unknown parentage there is hope Ben got so wrapped up in the message he forgot about the time he didn't notice that a number of people had come in after he had taken his seat suddenly the services were over Ben very quickly stood up to leave as he had in all the Sundays past but the aisles were clogged with people and he couldn't run out as he was working his way through the crowd he felt a hand on his shoulder he turned around he looked up right into the eyes of the new preacher who asked him a question that had been on the mind of every person for the last 12 years who knew this boy whose boy are you? asked the preacher instantly the church grew deathly silence slowly a smile started to spread across the face of this young preacher until it broke into a huge grin and he exclaimed oh I know whose boy you are why the family resemblance is unmistakable you Oh, you, boy, are a child of the king. And with that, the young preacher swatted him across the rear end and said, That is quite a heritage, young man. Don't ever forget it. And he never did. A preacher and his family, through the children in their own home, befriended that little boy. One day, little Ben Hooper met the Christ, of whom that preacher spoke. And years later in his life, Ben Hooper became the twice-elected governor of the state of Tennessee. And all of that moves me to marvel at the power of a word to set the course of a life. But all words do not bless and speak life. Some words curse and speak death. And so it is, as we continue in James, we will have to also marvel at the power of the tongue to damage people. But nobody I know wants to do that. All of us, I believe, want to speak blessing, not cursing. Talked a little bit earlier about how I blessed my son with that word. You know what I left out and I need to... Because that same mouth of mine that blesses my children, and I think I do, that same mouth has spoken death to him at different times. This same mouth that wants to speak blessing and sometimes does, also sometimes erupting out of stuff that I need to do some work on and wonder about, speaks death to people, and sometimes to the people I love the most. So where is all that bitter water coming from? As I said when I began, we're going to push that to next time, but I'll give you a hint. It's coming from an unhealed place. It's coming from a bitter place. The bitter water comes from a bitter place. It doesn't mean your whole heart is dead. You could have a redeemed heart, and in your redeemed heart have a bitter place. It's coming from a wounded place. It's coming from a place that maybe with another word has been cursed. And while in this series I am quite sure that as we get in touch with the ways we have spoken death to people, there will be involved a need in all of us to repent. What occurred to me this week is that for some of us to get to repentance, we're going to have to first experience some healing. Because we've said, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, a million times, but the place in the well, the place in the fountain from which our venomous speech comes, that place has never been healed. first it's going to require some healing and some grace and some kindness and the affirmation of our Abba hear the word that some of you grew up under you'll never amount to anything you are such a loser those words of death if believed can set the course of life no hope, no future hear now as I close words of life words of truth from our Father not my father or our father this may sound weird to you but our father daddy wants to talk to us before we leave this morning I want to speak these words over you almost ceremonially I want you to stand as I speak this over you I would invite you to close your eyes as I speak these words over you get in any posture I think it's important to be as comfortable as you can to close your eyes and even if there's woundedness in here to open your heart as wide as you can as we move beyond your spouse or your friend or your parents or whoever it was who spoke some other things to you and get face to face with your father hear ye the word of the Lord from your Abba Father dear son, dear daughter when your earthly father called you a loser, when your mother or your friend or whoever that person was that you wanted to like you declared over you, you'll never amount to anything. I, your heavenly father, am here to tell you this, that they were lying. Jeremiah 29, 11. Here's why I know they're lying, says your father, for I know the plans I have for you, and the plans those other people said were for you, never amount to anything, you're a loser, were lies. For my plans for you are plans for welfare, not calamity, to give you a future and a hope. Marvel would you, says your father, Marvel would you at the power of a word to set the course of a life. Maybe today is a day to set a new course with a new word. Here is the new word, Jeremiah 29, verse 11, From our Father, I know the plans I have for you, plans of welfare, not calamity, to give you a future and a hope. Thank you.
