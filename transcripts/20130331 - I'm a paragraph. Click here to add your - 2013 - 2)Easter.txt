This is great, isn't it? This is great. What a day. Yeah. Let's pray as we go to the word. For the kind of life and energy and power that can only be generated by your spirit, I pray. And I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. And now, says the Apostle Paul in that classic Easter resurrection text, 1 Corinthians chapter 15, verse 1. I make known to you, brethren, the gospel, which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, by which also you have been saved. For I delivered unto you that which was of first importance, that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures, But that wasn't the end of the story because after he died, he was buried. But that wasn't the end of the story because after he died and was buried, he was raised again on the third day according to the Scriptures. And according to the Scriptures, the third day is a very good day. Because the third day is God's day. Because the third day is the day that God shows up, which is why this Easter weekend, what I'm going to talk about is hope. What it is we're hoping for, because this third day brings all sorts of hope. So we're going to talk about that and what it is we're hoping in, because we human beings are hopers. We just are. Hope is why you got married. Hope is why you had kids. Hope is why you stuck with it when the bloom was off the rose because you hope. Hope is why farmers plant seed. It's why people play the stock market. It's why people go on blind dates. Hope. And the joke I pretty much pull out every year, hope is why 40,000 people will once again this year make the yearly pilgrimage to Wrigley Field on opening day. I know it's hopeless. I know that. because they hope. There's actually two kinds of hope I want you to dial into, however, tonight that I want to talk about. The first is this, when you're hoping for something. Because when you're hoping for something, what you're hoping for is a particular circumstance to turn out a certain way, to turn out a way you're hoping for. There's nothing wrong with that at all. I mean, we do it all the time. Hope I get that job. Hope we get that house. Hope I get the girl. hope she says yes. But sometimes we hope for things that we know are a long way off. And the truth is that in the waiting for this thing that's a long way off, we can actually begin to lose hope that what we're waiting for will ever come. Proverbs 13, 12 says this, that hope deferred makes the heart grow sick. Because the truth is this, a human spirit can survive just about anything. But if you lose hope, wow, that'll take your breath away. That'll affect your body. That will make you sick. Because we human beings are hopers. Which raises again this question, what are we hoping for, what are we hoping in, and I mean today, I mean really right now today, where you're sitting in this auditorium this Easter weekend, because some of you are hoping for some pretty serious things, where the stakes are really high and the outcome of what you're hoping for really matters. Hope she comes back. Hope we don't lose him. Hope it's not cancer. But one day, it will be cancer. And if not cancer, it will be something else. Indeed, one day, everything we ever hoped for put our hope in. will eventually disappear, disappoint, wear out, give out, break down, fall apart. And when that happens, and it will, this is a real upper talk, I know. Desire is stirred. Desire is stirred for a different kind of hope, for a deeper kind of hope, rooted not in something, and it's not wrong to hope in something, but when the things all go away, there comes this desire for a hope that's rooted not in something, but in someone, someone in whom we might be able to place our hope, and we're here today to talk about that someone because the testimony of Scripture from beginning to end is pointing to this one whose name is Jesus. But it's not because this Jesus always gives us everything we've ever hoped for. But because he is the one in whom we can place our hope when everything we've been hoping for does what things we've been hoping for do. Disappear. Disappoint. Wear out, give out, break down, fall apart. all of which brings me back to why we're here today in this room, this Easter weekend, to this Easter Day story, and to the words of Paul again, who in 1 Corinthians 15, 1 again, says this. So now I want to make known to you, brethren, the gospel, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, by which also you have been saved, For I delivered unto you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, but that's not the end of the story because after he died he was buried, but that's not the end of the story because after he died and was buried, he was raised from the dead on the third day according to the Scriptures. And according to the Scriptures, the third day is a very good day. Because it's God's day. It has been for a very long time. And every day this time this third day thing happens, it brings with it all sorts of hope. And this third day theme thing is a theme that runs through all the scriptures. We've talked about this actually before. And wherever it would show up, there's kind of this rhythm. And it shows up in a variety of ways. and it always speaks to hope whenever it's there, particularly in the context of circumstances where people had actually lost their hope. Indeed, the pattern to these stories was always the same. In the Old Testament and the New Testament, we're in the beginning of these third-day stories. The beginning of the story is some tragedy happens. All hope is lost. Our dreams are dashed, so it's a dark day, but the dark day is that first day. So the first day is a very dark day. it's the oh no day and the rhythm of these third day stories all through scriptures is that after the dark day it's followed by a waiting day. That's called the second day where you're kind of in the dark. In some ways the second day is worse than the first because some things settle in. But in the second day you're not really sure what's going on. You're really in the dark followed by these third day stories. Dark day, waiting day, third day stories, deliverance day. And it's always called, in these third-day stories, the third day. The third day is always a very good day. Now, the people of God grew up on these stories. And we've kind of got to connect some dots to kind of see these third-day themes all through Scripture. I think we connected to the third day he was raised from the dead. But this third-day theme is all over the place. Often it was their story. They were kind of telling their story. Sometimes the stories were quite obscure. One that I'll tell you very quickly is this. It's recorded in 1 Samuel 5. It's 40 years after. It's after the 40 years of wandering in the wilderness, carrying the Ark of the Covenant. The people of God get to the promised land finally, but they're struggling. They don't have a king, so it's before David and Solomon. They're fighting the Philistines, who are the arch enemies of God and God's people, and they're not doing very well, so they're hoping for some thing. They're hoping for victory, but they don't get it. They lose in a horrible battle. Indeed, it was a devastating loss in 1 Samuel 5, such that they not only lost 3,000 men, or several thousand men, including the sons of Eli the prophet, Hophni and Phinehas. Cool names. But they also lost the Ark of the Covenant, which, as many of you know, was the symbol of God's presence and power and provision among the people. So the Philistines captured that as well. So they lost everything they were hoping for. But that's actually when things get interesting, because the Philistines carried the Ark of the Covenant to a place called Ashdod, where they had this god called Dagon, and they brought the Ark of the Covenant into the temple of Dagon. And as part of their celebration for kind of beating the Israelites and rubbing their nose in it, they brought the Ark of the Covenant into this temple and placed it right in front of their god, a statue of their god, Dagon, as if to kind of go, na-na-na-na-na, and they were kind of celebrating. And then they went and had a big party. All day long. At the end of the day, they got tired, and then they went to sleep, moving into now the second day. So in the next morning, the second day of the next morning, in 1 Samuel 5, verse 3, it says this, that when the Astrodites arose early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord. Which is really weird, because it looks like Dagon is bowing down to the God of Israel. Now, like there'd been a fight in the middle of the night when no one saw in the dark. God somehow won. It's just so weird. So they saw all this and propped up Dagon once again. Their little statue of him dusted him off and went about their celebration again of their victory into the second day. Until they got tired again of partying all day and went to bed. But when they rose early the next morning, verse 4, fourth day, third day. Behold, Dagon had fallen on his face again before the ark of the Lord, but this time his head and his hands were cut off, laid neatly across the threshold. Only the trunk of Dagon was left. Now, there's a lot of things we could talk about in that story, but what I want us to see, and the reason I'm telling you that, is that it's a third day story. First day is a very dark day. The ark of Israel is defeated. The God of Israel is defeated. The glory of God is gone. The Ark of the Covenant is stolen. All hope is lost. Indeed, there's really a poignant story within this story that illustrates this. When the news got back to Eli the prophet that they had lost, that his sons had died, that the Ark was gone, he drops dead. Just like that. But his daughter-in-law, that is Eli the prophet's daughter-in-law, who is pregnant with his son's child, goes into labor and has a son. who in her grief she names Ichabod. And Ichabod means the glory is gone. So what she's saying when she names her child Ichabod is this, we have no hope. This whole thing has been a pipe dream. Abraham was wrong. Moses was wrong. There is no God. There is no glory. There is no hope. Life doesn't mean anything. You're born, you die, that's it. and my son might as well know that from day one, Ichabod. Glory, gone. Hope, too. That's the first day. And some of you know all about that day. And some of you are experiencing that day today. Because that's the day that the heavens grow silent when hope is lost and the glory is gone and the second day in some ways is worse than the first because the enormity of what we've lost sinks in. It really is over, but things are happening that you can't see, like Dagon bowing down to the ark in the middle of the night, but the third day is God's day. And the whole story takes a 180 degree turn when it gets revealed that what Satan meant for evil God meant for good, the time of captivity is over. God is coming home to his people and his people are coming home to him because the third day is God's day and God's day is a very good day. And it's just this theme all through scripture. Genesis 40, let me give you some examples. Joseph says to the cub bearer, they're both in prison. Remember this story? In three days, Joseph says, Pharaoh will lift up your head and you will be released. So for three days, he waited and on the third day, it happened. In Exodus 3.18, Moses says to Pharaoh, let us out into the wilderness three days. Why three days? Well, in Exodus 19, verse 3, we find out why. Because on the third day, the Lord will come down. So consecrate to people, Moses said, and make them ready for the third day. And on the morning of the third day, it says in verse 16, it came to pass that the Lord came down. Because it was the third day, and the third day is God's day, and God's day is a very good day. You've heard the story of a woman, a girl actually, named Esther, who felt like she was in way over her head because she was, having been placed by God into a position where she could, in fact, bring deliverance to God's people, to her people, if she could only find the courage and the opportunity to speak a risky word of truth to a very powerful king. So she fasted and prayed. Guess how long? Wild guess. Three days. And on the third day, she went into the presence of this king and spoke a word that if not received would cost her life. But God showed up on the third day and made a way for her and the people of God were delivered on the third day in that story of Esther. Because the third day is God's day. And God's day is a very good day. And then there's Jonah. Well, you know this one. In the belly of the whale, how long? Hello. Class. Three days. And we don't know how many times in the belly of that whale Jonah thought he was going to die. Having given up hope because the first two days in these third day stories are always dark days. but on the third day, God showed up and made a way because the third day is God's day, and God's day is a very good day, bringing with it lots of hope. And all of that is at least part of why. Paul says what he says, but the way he says it. Paul says what he says the way he says it when he says, back to our text, 1 Corinthians 15, verse 3, this, that I delivered unto you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, but that wasn't the end of the story because after he died, he was buried. But that wasn't the end of the story because after he died and was buried, he was raised from the dead on the third day according to the scriptures. And according to the scriptures, third day, very good day because the third day is God's day. Amen. Amen. Now bring all that right up to the Easter event, Good Friday and Easter, Because from everything that anyone could see, those first two days were very dark days. First day, Jesus is hanging on a cross, and that's a dark day. Any of his disciples looking at that cross, the women who were with him looking at that cross, our dreams right there dashed. Our hopes right there, gone. Second day, worse in some ways than the first, on the second day it all starts to sink in. This really is over. Nothing miraculous happened on the cross. He didn't call the angels and set them free. He really is dead. This really is final. But then comes the third day. And I think by now you know where I'm going with this because the third day is a very good day because the third day is the kind of day and it's the kind of day all through scripture. It's not just here in the resurrection story. The third day, all through scripture, is the kind of day the prisoners get set free and people get restored and mountains shake and waters part and young harem girls like Esther face down kings and stubborn old prophets like Jonah get dropped off at seaside ports by very large fish. It's the kind of day that stones get rolled away and a rabbi named Jesus is raised from the dead. Indeed, it is such a big day, this stone got rolled away day, that every day since that day to this day, the followers of this Jesus, the risen one, these followers who used to only observe the Sabbath to honor God, soon began also to observe. The apostle John refers to in the revelation as the Lord's Day. One of the first references to what we call the Lord's Day, Revelation 1 verse 10, John says, and I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day. The Lord's Day is God's day. It's the third day. What that means among other things is this, is that we are third day people. It's who we are. It's why we're here. It's why we hope because this Easter thing is the Lord's Day. Now, when I was a kid growing up in church, my only understanding, perception of what we call the Lord's Day didn't go much beyond the fact that the Lord's Day was Sunday. And so what that meant was Sunday, so Dave, you need to behave. That was hard. And you need to go to church because it's the Lord's Day. And you need to wear your Sunday clothes because it's the Lord's day, because it's the Lord's day, and because it's his day, you don't want to spoil his day. He's very petty, actually. Here's the truth. I never really experienced that Sunday thing as a horrible day, but I can tell you the truth. It was never my kind of day, the way we did it, because it was more the kind of day where you did things because you're supposed to do them, because you do things because they're good for you. It's kind of like eating your vegetables. You eat your vegetables because they're good for you. That's why I went to Sunday school. At least that's how I figured it out. You go to Sunday school and you go to church because that's good for you. Okay. Still not my kind of day. And while some people still might experience Sunday that way, it's really sad because they're missing the point. So let me explain it like this. In a way that, I don't know, I can understand. And I need to use a sports analogy. Sorry about that. Because when it comes to sports or athletics, every once in a while, whether you're watching something on TV or some event, or you're participating in some athletic event, every once in a while, you just light it up. You just go off. I think you know what I'm talking about. All of a sudden, there's this round of golf. Where did that come from? Can I do it again? A few years ago, there was a guy named Sean Green who played for the L.A. Dodgers. He did something on this particular day in baseball that nobody had ever done before. And it was this. He hit four home runs, and a double and a single. A lot of guys have hit four home runs. We did four home runs, double, and a single. And this guy was a good ball player. It wasn't great. It kind of came out of the blue. And it was a big event, 19 bases. In that one day, he kind of hit a major league record. But when asked by reporters after the game, how did you do that? His response was classic, I thought. Because with a bit of a grin, he simply said this, I don't really know. I guess it was just, you know, my day. I don't know if you're getting the picture, but I'm going to try to help you get the picture. Because the Lord's Day isn't just a day we tip our hat to God and go to church. Now, the Lord's Day is the day, this might not sound spiritual enough, the Lord's Day is the day that he hits it out of the park. The Lord's day is the day he parts the water, he makes a way, he raises the dead, he heals a heart. Indeed, the Lord's day is the day. Where if some reporter actually came up to the Lord, this is bizarre, I know, I'm sorry, and put a microphone in his face and said, So Lord, how did you do that heal the heart thing? How did you redeem that person? Transform that marriage. Rekindle that hope. Forgive that sin. Redeem that life. Part those waters. How did you walk out of that grave? Ascend to the Father. And then pour out your spirit on all flesh. I don't know. But I think he might say with a little bit of a grin, Well, I don't really know. I just guess it was my day. And yes, yes, Friday was dark. As he hung on that cross, but that's the first day, you guys. And the first day is always a dark day. And Saturday was worse because it all looks so final. He really is dead. All hope really is gone second day. But the third day is God's day. And God's day, according to the scriptures, is a very good day, bringing with it lots of hope. So get your hopes up. Amen. Amen.
