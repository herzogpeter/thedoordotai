What I find Jesus doing with, and I think this is an important word for us, especially if you start going to the University of Minnesota, where I got my mind all screwed up on this issue for a while. If you start going there, or you start reading books from a little more liberal persuasion, it's important to hear this. Jesus, who is our guide in this, my main reason for believing in the Bible is because Jesus did, and I have a lot of reasons for believing in him. Jesus didn't theorize about how the Bible was inspired. He didn't speculate about theories of inspiration. He didn't get into squabbles about geographical accuracy or what have you. His basic orientation was trust it. Trust the Bible. I don't know about your theories, but trust it. He never questioned it. He just went to it. He didn't get involved in a lot of squabbly details and stuff. And I think we'd be a little bit more effective. The church as a whole would be more effective in its mission if it would quit squabbling about things that really don't need to be squabbled about. And we just say we trust it. It doesn't make a better difference to me whether you believe there's four pillars under the earth or not. Let's go out and save souls. I mean, that's what the bottom line is. And that was Jesus' attitude. It's just one of trust. When we read the scripture then, the main thrust of this teaching on inspiration is the belief that here I can find God's word to me. I don't need to be second-guessing God. I don't need to be questioning God. I can find God's word for me here. And that doesn't mean that you're going to find science or some kind of other information there, but you are going to find what God has to say to you, what God wants from you, etc. Let me say one other word about this. I didn't put it down here, but I'd recommend you making a little note of this. It has to do with the purpose of Scripture. I've already said that the purpose of Scripture isn't to teach us some scientific theory about pillars under the earth. It's not to teach us exactly to the tenth how many people david had in his army or any such thing as this the central purpose for scripture is to lead us to christ the old testament points to christ and the new testament points back to christ and the central theme throughout scripture whether it's explicit or implicit is jesus christ ultimately in a nutshell the whole the whole bible is this incredible foundation that points up to the person of jesus christ and if you read the bible and it doesn't lead to jesus christ whatever theory of inspiration you hold isn't going to make a lot of difference anyways you see its purpose is to lead us to christ and then to develop the christian life from that point when we read the bible i think it's very important that we keep in mind that that point that christ is is the ultimate author and the ultimate subject matter of all of scripture we should interpret the whole of the bible in the in view of the person of jesus christ jesus said in fact jesus called the word of god the expression of God, the image of God, the form of God. He's called all those things because he's the place where God ultimately reveals himself. Whatever else we think we know about God, we have to compare it with Jesus Christ. And it's very good to do this. Sometimes as you read in the Bible, you'll find some questionable things about God. This is on my mind, I guess, because I just dealt with it today. You'll find some things, you know, he slaughters all these Canaanites. He wipes the whole earth with a flood. He zaps the guy because he touched the ark. He stones a guy because he picks up sticks on the Sabbath. And you go, what gives here? And if you base your view of God on that and then try to reinterpret who Jesus was, you're going to have a weird view of God. Start with where God finally and clearly and decisively revealed himself and interpret everything else in that light. I don't know a lot about God, but I do know this. He's in the person of Jesus Christ. i do know his character i look at jesus christ i know his love i look at jesus christ i know his stance towards me because i look at jesus christ all i need to know about god i find in jesus christ and the rest of scripture points to that and there are some weird things out here but i'm not going to reject what i know about jesus christ for those things i'm going to reinterpret those things on the basis of what i know about jesus christ okay it's important i had a guy call me up just today and we talked for quite some time. This guy is seriously stressed out and he comes from a real dysfunctional home and he's convinced that God hates him. He's convinced that he's used up the blood of the atonement. He's convinced that, that's his phrase, used up the blood of the atonement and he has all these Old Testament examples to prove this. He's worn out the patience of God and God now has rejected him and he's got all that stuff going on. And on top of that, he's trying to figure out what the particular symbols in the book of Daniel mean. And my advice to him was this. Look it. Why don't you just turn to the person of Jesus Christ for a while and rest there and get healthy? Because as long as you're unhealthy, you're going to be reading the Bible in sort of an unhealthy way. And so you pick up these things which, from a Christian perspective, are kind of peripheral. I don't know why God slaughtered the Canaanites, but I'm sure he had a good reason. And it was a loving reason, because I know that God's loving from the person of Jesus Christ. So I'll put that one on the back burner for right now, and I'll trust in Christ. And try to get this guy away from all these peripheral things and center him in on Jesus Christ. Let Jesus love you. Let him embrace you. Let him hold you. Get healthy. And then try to figure out the symbols in the book of Daniel if you have time. But first, find out what's the core and what's the peripheral. Find out what the thing is really about. Because if it doesn't lead you to the person of Jesus Christ with all of his grace and all of his compassion, then it hasn't done its job in the first place. Okay. You got questions about that? Shoot me. Hit me with your best shot. Any questions with it? Really, you guys, I really like questions. Okay, then let's deal with another thing here. Oh, good. Okay, let's move on then. No. Yeah. thanks a lot you really had to open pandora i really appreciate that trying to get me in trouble okay there's no way to deal with that topic briefly and you knew it too you were trying to call me i'm teasing you um what's your name jody that's right joia in the book uh it's actually an incredibly good astute brilliant question um it falls right smack in the center of this evangelical right evangelical left thing the liberal view doesn't worry about that at all you know the bible's full of myths so what's the deal but uh if small it falls right smack in the middle of of that whole debate and the issue and it's a legitimate issue for discussion it's uh you know do you how much scientific import how much detail about the scientific theory of of how we came to be can be wrung out of genesis 1 and 2 what is the purpose of the author in there is he trying to teach any kind of a science thing it all hangs on on how you want to interpret genesis 1 and 2 and that goes right smack in this whole other thing all other thing about what do you do with the pillars under the earth or what have you. From my perspective, and this may seem like a couple, but it's really what I genuinely believe. I shipwrecked on that issue too when I first went to the University of Minnesota. And what my gut feeling is now is this. What's at stake here, my fundamental conviction, but feel free to disagree, but this is just where I land on this, is that the only thing that's at stake in that is the interpretation of two chapters of the Bible, Genesis 1 and Genesis 2. uh we're debating about how you know how exactly we should interpret that i don't see that anything else hangs on that so long as the person is is uh is um believing that the central purpose of scripture is inerrant and infallible and it's not just you know uh made up out of some thin air but it's teaching us something what we disagree about is what it teaches but we don't disagree that it teaches inerrant and there's a lot of passages that are like that i mean there's a lot of issues where we disagree about things like that. I think it's an interesting topic, and I'd like to discuss it, but I don't like to bring it into, as it sometimes is, brought it into the center of fellowship and brought it into anything that would disrupt Christian fellowship and worship together. There was a guy, just a little example here, where I used to be a counselor for the Jimmy Swigert crusade. Well, I did a couple of times. And he was preaching this sermon that was one of his great sermons. It was called, Is Hell a Reality? And in this sermon, he was sending everybody to hell. It was really incredible. Only he could do it this good. But he was sending all the Catholics to hell. And he was sending, the sword was wielding really wild. And one of the things he sent to hell is everyone who believes in the theory of evolution. Well, after that, he gave an altar call. And a lot of people came forward. So my job was to go up there and look for people who maybe looked like they wanted to accept the Lord and then lead them to salvation. there's this guy there a very distinguished uh man um and he was sobbing just sobbing and sobbing and so i said you know the lord's really working with you isn't he would you like to accept him as your savior and uh and he said yeah i would and i go then let's pray he goes i can't it's like what do you mean you said you wanted to accept the lord as savior uh you know all you need to do is ask him in your heart he says well i can't i i really you know i really would like to but i just can't i said why it turns out he was a a phd student at temple university in biology and he was convinced that there was some sort of evolution some sort of progression that went on to creating creating human beings but he didn't know anything about christianity except that the preacher said that you can't believe that and still be saved and so he was in this on the one hand god was pulling his heart to him on the other hand he had this thing in his mind that was pulling him back so he wanted to believe it but he didn't think he could believe it and in my response you know one thing i could have done was to try to argue against him a phd in biology and i could I read a book on that once and tried to debate him on it. But what I did is I said, look, why don't you shelve that issue right now? That's an interesting thing. You can come back to it, study it. There's a lot of people, there's a lot of arguments for it, a lot of arguments against it. I, frankly, am not learned enough to decide conclusively either way. I can give you my opinion, but right now, your relationship with the Lord is what's important. So you can shelve that and still be a Christian. And that was just great news to him. and it was like wonderful news that, you know, this was an okay thing to have questions about. So I guess I'd like to leave it an okay thing to have questions about. All right, someone else said something? Oh, okay. Okay, very good. Let me deal with this issue. The church, one of the parts of the basic Christian beliefs is that the Bible is absolutely inspired, it's infallible, but the church has always wrestled with, oh, man, with the issue of how do you apply it? First of all, how do you read it? And the issue basically is this. What is culturally relative and what is not? Now, this is an issue that, I'm throwing a lot of commercials here, but take it for what it's worth. We have a whole six-week course on how to read the Bible for all it's worth. And it's taught next semester, or next quarter, whatever they call these things. And semester, I don't know. And so we deal with this in great depth. So tonight I'm just going to really give an overview, just so you kind of know what the issue is. It's basically this. There are some things in the Bible that, as we just said, are culturally relative, the way they speak about the world. You have to expect that. God's inspiring a book that's supposed to be relevant to centuries of people. It's very hard to do that. We credit authors as being great when they can write a book that's relevant for an entire generation. Here God's inspiring a book that's going to be relevant for centuries of people in a wide variety of cultural circumstances. It's very difficult to do. And when you inspire, communicate your thoughts, God Almighty communicating thoughts to these little tiny people and this little speck of dust in a little particular historical framework and they have very limited understanding, that has to condition the way he says it. You can't just bulldoze over a person's culture and way of thinking to inspire the message you want to be inspired. So the Bible is inspired through the culture that it was written, which means that as we read it, there are going to be some elements in the Bible which are only relevant to that culture. Let me give you an example. There's a lot of stuff in the New Testament about women's clothing and how women should appear. There's also a couple things about how men should appear, but they seem to be more preoccupied with how women should appear because that was much more of an issue in the first century um and the reason i want to flag that is because so many women might read that and you get kind of freaked out i was in a church that specialized on being freaked out about this kind of stuff um the first church i was saved in it was just they they loved to hit on these things and since no one else was believing them they wanted to believe it because what really got them off was believing something that no one else believed and making it a matter of salvation uh that's what cultures usually do find a little thing that no else believes you believe it and you make salvation dependent on it and you feel very very special and the church i was in with something like a cult so the bible says women shouldn't braid their hair does say that shouldn't so they don't braid their hair uh the bible says that a woman should have long hair so they they they never even cut their hair the women tripping over their hair all the time they never would cut it the first corinthians 11 says women should have long hair well a man should have short hair paul says it doesn't even nature itself teach you that a man should have short hair um they uh the bible says don't adorn yourselves with uh jewelry or immodest jewelry so these women never wore jewelry uh there's one verse in deuteronomy that says a man and woman shouldn't wear each other's clothes no cross-dressing so they that meant women don't wear pants and all these rules like this um a ton of stuff like this interestingly enough the bible also says women should wear veils in church but they never wore veils in this church and i couldn't figure out quite why they didn't do that the bottom line though is this there's a lot of stuff like that a lot of particular stuff another issue that the church is wrestling with is should women be in the ministry because there's some verses which seem to suggest that Paul was open to that Romans 16 for example where he clearly has some women who are leaders in the church but then you have other places where Paul says don't let a woman talk in church and talk in church a woman should not have authority over man okay the question we're asking is this is that part of the culture or is that part of the eternal message okay is that binding on us today or is it not and then then then then here you have this problem well okay if you say that you don't have to that you can braid your hair because it's part of the first century culture why don't you ordain homosexuals because that's That's also part of the culture. Here's a couple, real quickly, a couple of principles to help you decide those kind of issues. The first one would be this. Here's four principles. What's core and what's peripheral? Again, always keep an eye for what, and this isn't always easy to decide either, but what's core and what's peripheral? What's central to the motif of the Bible, to the order of creation, and the way God created the world? to the fall, to salvation, to the person of Jesus Christ, to the foundation of the church. There's a core theme that we need to talk more about, but we can't. But a core theme, and the question is, is this particular passage you're reading, is that central to what the Bible's about, or is it kind of peripheral, part of the, you know, on the outside here? There's just something a little different about saying, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld the glory of the only begotten of the Father. There's a difference between that and Paul saying, greet each other with a holy kiss. You see what I'm saying? You kind of kind of intuit the difference. But I don't think salvation hangs upon greeting each other with a holy kiss. That's not part of our culture. We don't go around kissing each other. Strangers, you just go, kiss. Once in a while we do, but not too much. If we do, we get slapped. So try to get an eye for what's central and what's peripheral. Try to get an eye for what's inherently moral and what is not. What's inherent? I'll write bigger next week, okay? Because I realize you can't see this very well. Well, that really helped, didn't it? What happened? What happened? Oh. There. I still don't know what I did. Okay, look. There are places where Paul winds up the machine gun and starts listing things that are sin. They're what are called Paul's sin list. And he lists them as being immoralities. things which if this characterizes a person's whole life is evidence of their not being regenerate a little footnote to that would be this when paul gives those lists uh you know all homosexuals adulterers fornicators blasphemers drunkards will not inherit the kingdom of heaven he's not talking about you know one time slip up or people who struggle with it or whatever he's characterizing a lifestyle people who you know are into this have no conviction about it romans one basically these people who are just really into this ungodliness and have no conviction about it, that's probably a good indication that they're not regenerate. If you're regenerate, you at least struggle with it. It doesn't mean you've always overcome it, but you struggle with it. Okay, there are places where Paul lists these sins, and then there are other places where, again, Paul, these are things that are inherently immoral. Fornication, adultery, homosexuality, these are things which are immoral in and of themselves. There are other things, however, that only become moral in a particular culture, in a particular circumstance. It's offensive not to greet your neighbor with a kiss in a certain culture. It's not that offensive in our culture. That becomes a moral issue in a particular setting. It's not immoral in another setting. Or drinking wine. You can find places in the Bible which prohibit drinking wine. You can find places in the Bible which recommend drinking wine. What is it? Clearly depends on the cultural situation. Paul says that explicitly in Romans 14. Some people are okay with eating meat. Some people are OK with drinking wine. Other people have problems with both. Well, depending on the situation you're in, you either abstain or don't abstain. There's a higher principle here. Don't offend your brother. But these are culturally relative things. There are some cultures you go into. And if you go like this to your neighbor, you're going to get beat up. Because showing your heel to a person is considered a great insult. It's like flipping the bird in our culture. But you go to an Arab country and flip a bird, and they're kind of like, you know. So it's a culturally relative kind of thing. Ask that question. Is it inherently moral or is it not? Another question. Is it uniform and consistent or is it not? Okay, so what I mean by that is this. Is this taught throughout the whole of Scripture? Is there a consistent message here, at least in the New Testament? Or is this something which you find a divergency of opinions about in the Bible? If it's uniform, that's a good indication that this is something which transcends all cultures. If it's not uniform, that's a good indication that this is something which doesn't transcend cultures. So you don't have a uniform teaching in the Bible about women wearing braids, or about men wearing short hair, or about women wearing long hair, or about women wearing jewelry. You find some places where the jewelry and that kind of stuff is a blessing of God. You have some places in the Bible where men wearing long hair is a symbol of your dedication to God. there's just no uniformity of opinion there you you have places like I said in Proverbs where it says don't even look on wine when it's red you have other places which said go ahead and a Timothy have a little wine for your stomach's sake there's no uniformity there because whether wine was okay or not depended upon the historical circumstance in which was written was culturally relative or eating meat offered to idols in Acts 15 it prohibits that. Don't eat meat offered to idols. And in 1 Corinthians 10, Paul says, go ahead and eat meat offered to idols. Well, it depends on where you are. If you're around a bunch of people who are really uptight about eating meat offered to idols, don't do it. But if you're with some more open-minded people, feel free. It all depends. Women's role in the church. This is a little tougher one, but you find, I just guarded myself, but you find Paul, you find women leaders in the Old Testament, you find Paul in Romans 16 recommending Phoebe and this other woman as leaders in the church, you find Lydia being a leader in the church, and in Romans 11 you find Paul saying women should prophesy in the church, okay, so theirs is a real kind of a role there, speaking of prophetic role, whatever, but then you have other things where Paul says keep silent and women shouldn't teach, we can't go into it now, but if you did go into it, you'd find that there are historical things going on in some circumstances, like at Ephesus, where it just wasn't conducive to have a woman teaching. There's a lot of weird things going on in Ephesus with women in religion. So for a woman to be a pastor in Ephesus would have really looked bad. So Paul says, don't do it. Other times, Paul says, you know, it's okay. Or at least he intimidates that. It's not that clear cut. But that might be an example of a cultural relative issue. But do you find anywhere in the Bible where homosexuality is recommended? Or anywhere in the Bible where drunkenness is recommended? or that kind of thing. No, the Bible's totally, though it has a different opinion about wine, it's totally uniform on drunkenness. If you drink wine, don't ever get drunk. The Bible's constantly against that. Homosexuality, it never is qualified in the least from beginning to end, it's uniform. So these are ways to try to discern what's culturally relative and what is not. Okay, then finally, what is the principle and what is the application? What is the principle in the passage, and what is its application? What I'm getting at is this. For example, you take 1 Corinthians 11. You find Paul telling women that when they prophesy, they should wear a veil on their head. And they should keep order, and they should have long hair. And men should have short hair. And then he kind of deals with some strange things about the angels or whatnot. But what a good thing to ask, and this is sometimes, you sometimes need a commentary with this. is this what is paul getting at what is the principle that paul's teaching here and what is the application of the principle to sum it up in a nutshell my view of that is that paul is teaching up the principle behind all this is keeping order in the church what was happening is that these corinthian women were getting real liberal because of paul's teaching that in christ is neither male nor female and so they were throwing off all social customs they were even taking off their veils in church god forbid they were they were they were bringing upon the church the the ill repute of the society around it and this was just ruining the gospel paul says keep order in the church and for you that means wear veils when you're going to pray or prophesy at least in fact it's so it this is how ungodly it is paul says this it's so ungodly when a woman doesn't wear a veil in church she might as well go around bald and the people who are going the The women who were growing bald in those days were the Corinthian prostitutes. So Paul is saying, you guys are acting like a bunch of sluts when you come to church and take off your veils. And in that culture, that's what it meant. Well, okay, the application in the first century has to do with veils. The principle has to do with decency in church. That doesn't mean in our culture we have to be wearing veils, but it does mean we have to obey the principle of keeping decency in church. i really think it probably is is not conducive to the gospel for a for a woman to wear a g-string bikini to church but that's about how that's the equivalent kind of thing don't wear things that are going to distract people from from worship and there might be equivalent dress codes for men okay but that's the principle that's the application i know it's very quick i understand but but uh you know one hour class what are you gonna do what questions do you have let's process that In fact, let's stop there. I want to talk about how the Bible came to be, the canonization, the difference between the Catholic and the Protestant Bible, why do they have 15 more books than we have. I wanted to talk about that, but we only have four minutes, and so I don't want to. The history of the Bible in four minutes. But I was just going to give an overview of how the whole thing came to be. But let's hold that off until next week. See, we're already behind. I can't believe it. Give me some questions, some feedback. What's going through your mind? issues or problems or dilemmas or struggles or or anything you have four minutes here I want to get your money's worth paid big money to get in this class any questions are there any issues that you would hope we get to on this subject matter that that we didn't get to you feel like you have a foundation on the Bible yeah Greg, if a person doesn't speak by the literal, and they're always speaking to you, do you think that most of the time that's been very old and it's been very hard to be alive as far as you thought of this one fellow that you dealt with in the campaign? He was honestly searching for you. Do you think that that was more the minority of that situation? situation you know there are i mean there are the people like that it's i don't think it's an issue of taking it literally or not it's a question of taking it authoritatively or not um i don't think you take the bible totally literally uh because you read that that joshua made the sun stand still and you automatically assume well of course he in the first century or in in this uh what was it about the 18th century B.C. When was it? I forget when he lived. But you automatically assume, well, that's part of his culture, so it looks like it stood still, and he wasn't teaching a scientific theory. Or the pillars, or the hard dome. No one takes that literally. Or the Lord coming down, it says he has feathers, and he blows smoke out of his nostrils. You automatically interpret that figuratively. Or when it says that the Lord comes here or there, where it implies that he's spatially limited. You take that probably figuratively. It's not that the Lord's finite and he has to go places, but it's a way of speaking. So it's not an issue of how literal do you take it or not. I think it's an issue of how authoritative is it. Whatever the passage speaks, whether it's literal or not, it's authoritative over my life. Now there are those who are going to try to maybe make it mythological or something in order to avoid its authority. I don't know about their motives on that. But if you're not going to take it authoritarianly, how can you take it authoritarianly? Oh, sure. When a person just rejects the authority because they don't like it. Where they will look at a passage that clearly teaches something with regard to, say, human life. Let's say homosexuality. And they say, well, that was just part of the culture. What may be going on there, I do know some people who I think really believe that on the basis of their exegesis, but what may be going on there is that they have homosexual struggles in their life, and they don't want to face up to it, so it's easier to reinterpret the passage than it is to rearrange your life. And so I think that some of that's going on. It's easier to do that. But I guess what I'm hesitant about is making an issue, say for example Genesis 1 and 2, equivalent to that. sincere Christians really disagree about this. And I don't want to call people who disagree about homosexuality insincere, but certainly for the majority of Bible-believing Christians, that is so clear that there's simply nothing to recommend it biblically. There's also this. Some might say that, hey, look it. When you read that women wear veils in the church and you don't have to wear veils, then why trust anything the Bible says? Well, that kind of thinking, that doesn't evidence to me spirit-filled thinking at all. That evidence is a person who's trying to run from an issue. Because clearly, issues are different. I just gave four principles to decide the difference between those issues. Or someone who says, well, look, the Bible has a phrase that four pillars hold up the earth. Well, hey, I can't trust it for scientific stuff, so forget it. I don't believe Jesus rose from the dead. Well, you're making a big leap there, and I think there's more going on there than meets the eye. There's ulterior motives. And I know in my life, when I've come to question those kind of central things, on the basis of these little peripheral things, it's usually been an ulterior motive. I want to feel free from thinking that there's a God I've got to answer to. And the easiest way for me to do it is to use the fact that there's a phrase about four pillars to dismiss the whole thing. And so there's something else going on there. At the same time, though, I don't want to sit in the judgment seat and accuse someone who disagrees with me of doing that, Though that may be what they're doing. Okay, next week we'll finish up this whole thing, and then we're going to talk about the attributes of God, and I'm going to make the doctrine of the Trinity perfectly clear. Ha! Okay. See you next week.
