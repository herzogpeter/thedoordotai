Open your Bibles with me. to the book of Colossians, the first chapter of the 15th verse, as we continue our study of this great epistle, coming today to what most biblical scholars regard as being among the most powerful expressions of the transcendent supremacy of Christ in all of Scripture, if not the most transcendent expression of the supremacy of Christ in all of the Scriptures, referred to by some, as Paul's cosmic Christ. It's a scene by most scholars, this section we're moving into, as a hymn of sorts without music. It's a kind of emotionally charged poetry where the Apostle Paul, in the words actually of the Apostle Peter in 1 Peter 2.9, is attempting to proclaim the excellencies of him that is of Jesus who called us out of darkness into his marvelous light. And it's a hymn, a song, if you will, that in some ways actually begins in Colossians 1, verse 12. Just back a few verses, which we were dealing with last week as a kind of preamble, beginning in verse 12, a kind of prelude, if you will, to the hymn itself that begins in verse 15. But in verse 12, it's where Paul speaks of joyously giving thanks to the Father. Remember that? Who has, among other things, qualified us, it says in verse 12, to share in the inheritance of the saints in light. An inheritance that the Apostle Peter, again, back in 1 Peter 1, 4, says is imperishable. Your inheritance that God has qualified you for is incorruptible, undefiled, and fades not away, reserved in heaven for you. So our inheritance that God the Father has qualified us to enter into is eternal. It is secure, and it is ours. But he didn't just qualify us, says Paul, because he also, verse 13, delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved son, that is, Jesus being God the Father's beloved son in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins, and he, verse 15, speaking of Jesus, is the image of the invisible God. And with those words, he is the image of the invisible God. The hymn, the song has begun. This song that had been kind of held captive, if you will, in the heart of Paul is now being released and begins to flow. And while I'll spare you any attempt on my part to sing this song, which would be very disturbing. But actually, this is a song. It's kind of a metaphor of a song. There is no melody to this song. What I want to do is read this song to preach it, to proclaim it for even the sermon that I preach today in some way be a song for he. Verse 15 is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created, both in the heavens and on the earth. Visible things and invisible things, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities. All things have been created by him and have been created for him. And he is before all things. And in him all things hold together. He also is the head of the body, the church. And he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he himself might come to have first place in everything. For it was the Father's good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in him and through him to reconcile all things to himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross. Through him, I say, whether things on earth or things in heaven, and although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds, yet he has now reconciled you and me in his fleshly body through his death in order to present you and me before him, holy and blameless and beyond reproach. And by this time, I think the angels are singing. And I wonder if when Paul originally wrote these words, I don't know, but as they were stirring in his mind and in his heart and began flowing from his hand to his pen to the paper, I wonder if he was weeping for joy as he wrote these words joyously, giving thanks to the Father for the Son of the Father's love, Jesus. We're going to talk about Jesus today. We're going to talk about the name today because it's Jesus from beginning to end. It's kind of a running joke in my family. Kids every once in a while will ask me, Dad, what are you talking about this week? And because I don't want to get into the details of whatever it is I'm talking about, because it's usually kind of involved with a number of things. Oh, the Bible. God. Jesus. Jesus. Well, today it's Jesus. from beginning to end. When you get up this morning and you opened up the newspaper or maybe you took a look at your cell phone and you saw the date line that was there, what you saw was a date, December 13, 2009. Now, we don't think about that very often, the year 2009, but here's the question. 2009 years from what? Well, it's 2009 years from the birth of this little baby named Jesus. Again, we don't think about it this way very often, but you can't open a newspaper. You can't look at a cell phone. You can't check a dateline without indirectly being reminded of this name. Every year, this time of year, Time magazine identifies the person they believe to be the person of the year. That one individual who had the biggest impact, who touched the most lives, who affected the world most deeply, either for good, sometimes even they identify the person of the year who had the most impact for bad. Last year it was Barack Obama. The year before that it was Vladimir Putin. One year it was Hitler. So it's either good or bad. But nine years ago, in the year 2000, kind of a significant year, we're kind of rolling over a century here, they decided to name the individual that they thought to be the person of the century. You remember that? 2000, the person of the century. How many of you remember who that was? Anybody? You need to shout out our name? The person of the century was Elvis Presley. No, I'm kidding. What? What? I love that. Come to the next service. It's good. Just to do that. No, it's Albert Einstein, actually. But here's the deal. It's kind of hard to remember the person of the year. It's really tough to remember the name of the person of the century, but here's the irony. If you had to choose the name of one single person who has had the biggest impact on the history of the world since the beginning of recorded time, that one life that has touched every continent and every tribe and every nation and every language, there is just one name. Just one. And that name is Jesus. Because it's Jesus. From beginning to end. but here's the deal about this name. He, in terms of his incarnation, was born 20 centuries ago to an impoverished couple in an obscure village in an unimportant corner of the world. Maybe a few hundred people actually met him. Maybe a few thousand people actually heard him. He never traveled outside his region. He never wrote a book. He never held an office. He never led an army. He never governed a nation. He didn't even have a home of his own. the Romans didn't consider him significant enough to even record his execution so far as we know. And yet over the next 2,000 years since his incarnation, that one name would inspire the founding of more universities, among them universities like Oxford and Cambridge and Harvard and Yale, the creation of more hospitals, the launching of more charities, the writing of more books, the expression of more great art than any other name. fact is the power of that one name would move more people to sacrifice their finances, their possessions, their safety, their careers, sometimes even their lives than any other name in history. Even the instrument upon which he met his death across, a horrific mode of execution that in Jesus' day symbolized suffering and death and stirred nothing but fear, has since become the most recognizable symbol in all the world, stirring not suffering, pain, and fear, but hope. And if we could have gone back there and woken somebody up back there in Bethlehem 2009 years ago and told them, hey, you guys, there's a little baby going to be born in your village tonight, who in 2,000 years will be the cause of people gathering around the world to remember his name and sing his praise and hear his story and want desperately to follow his way? Who would have believed it? And it raises the obvious question, at least to me, why? Why do we keep coming back? What is it about this name? What is it about this man that continues to inspire and move and haunt and captivate and entrance an entire planet full of people? Well, lots of answers, I suppose, could come from many directions and many sources. But here's one answer to that question. It's Paul's answer in Colossians 1, 15 to 22. Here's why. Because he is the image of the invisible God. He is the firstborn of all creation, for by him all things were created, both in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities. All things have been created by him, created for him, and he is before all things, and in him all things hold together. But he didn't just create the world, which it says here he did. Paul goes on to say in this hymn, this anthem, this song that he recreated the world, having reconciled all things to himself. Verse 20, having made peace through the blood of his cross, through him I say all things. Whether things in heaven or things on the earth, including you, verse 21, because although we were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds, yet he has now reconciled us in his body through his death in order to present you and me before him, holy and blameless, beyond reproach, and maybe, I don't know, just maybe. That is why we keep on coming back. We keep on coming back to remember the name, to sing his praise, to hear his story, to desperately desire to follow his way. But that's just one guy's opinion of who Jesus is, the Apostle Paul. Though he's not alone in this opinion, in this answer to the question, why do we keep coming back to this name? Why is it so central even in history? The Bible is a very big book. I mean, my Bible actually is physically big, and that's because I'm a holy man. Need a big Bible. And it tells a very long story, does the Bible, from beginning to end. But the fact is this, the Bible, from beginning to end, with all of its confusing and sometimes disturbing and messy, actually. If you've ever read it, you know that some of the stories in the Bible are very confusing and messy images and stories. From beginning to end, the Bible is the story of Jesus because it's Jesus from beginning to end. One writer that I was reading this week laid it out like this, saying that the Old Testament, at the end of the day, with all of the weird things that might be in there, when everything is said and done, is really just the preparation for Jesus. All of it is pointing to Jesus. From Moses and the prophets, lots of things are going on with Moses and the prophets through the Psalms and through the Proverbs. The truth is this. After you strip it all, all of it, Moses and the prophets, the Psalms and the Proverbs, all of them are pointing to and preparing us for Jesus. The Gospels is the presentation of Jesus. He's here from beginning to end. The Gospels really is all about that. The book of Acts is the proclamation of Jesus, crucified and risen, ascended, now coming by his spirit to invade his people. The epistles is the personification of Jesus, that is, Christ alive, risen from the dead, returning by his spirit to live in and through his people in the world, personified. So it's Jesus from beginning to end. Acts 8.35, kind of a cool story here that kind of illustrates this Jesus from beginning to end, especially as it relates to scripture. Philip, the apostle, meets on the road to Gaza, the Ethiopian eunuch. Remember that story? This guy, this Ethiopian, is a court official and the queen of Ethiopia. He's kind of a big deal. He's in charge of the entire treasury of Ethiopia. He's in Jerusalem to worship God. And Philip gets this word from the spirit of God. See that guy, go talk to that guy who's in the chariot. So Philip goes over to this chariot thinking this is weird. And as he approaches the chariot, he hears this guy reading aloud from the prophet Isaiah. So Philip goes, I know how to break this conversation open. And he says to the guy, realizing that he's reading the prophet Isaiah, do you understand what you're reading, says Philip to this Ethiopian. And the Ethiopian says to Philip, how can I understand it unless someone guides me in this and explains these things to me? Would you guide me? So Philip in Acts 8, 35 opens his mouth and beginning from this scripture that he was in, and the scripture he was reading was Isaiah 53, like a sheep led to slaughter like a lamb before its shears. From that scripture in the Old Testament, it says that Philip preached Jesus to him from Isaiah. He preached Jesus because it's Jesus. From beginning to end, Luke 24, 27, a similar kind of story with this Old Testament Jesus from beginning to end theme. I love this story. It's the one you've heard us talk about this before. The two disciples are on the road to Emmaus. The events of Jerusalem have already happened. Jesus has been crucified. There's a rumor of his resurrection, but they're kind of confused and afraid to actually believe it, but they're talking about all this stuff. When the resurrected Christ appears to them, though they don't recognize him until he's done talking to them. So he walks up to them, that is Jesus to these disciples, who are confused and afraid, and he says, what are you talking about? And Cleopas, it says in Luke 24, answered saying, we're talking about the horrible events in Jerusalem. Haven't you heard? I mean, everybody else has been talking about this. Are you the only one? They say to Jesus, who doesn't know about this stuff? Everybody's doing this, how Jesus, the Nazarene, a prophet, mighty in word and deed, And in the sight of God and even in the sight of all people was sentenced to death and crucified. And though we've heard he's risen, we're not sure what to think. And so Jesus, it says in Luke 24, 27, first says to them, don't you listen to the prophets? Don't you listen to the prophets? So beginning with Moses, Jesus says, and then with all the prophets, Jesus began explaining to them the things concerning himself that were revealed in all of the scriptures, starting with Moses and the prophets. He went through Jesus. I don't know how he did that. Pretty quick through the whole Old Testament scriptures because it's Jesus from beginning to end. And he is not just a brilliant rabbi, though he is and was a brilliant rabbi, a reality that we as a church examined for almost three years with great joy. He is the image of the invisible God. That's who he is. Hebrews 1.3 calls him the exact representation of his nature. Jesus himself says, if you have seen me, you have seen the Father, because he, back to Paul, Colossians 1, is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, which sounds very poetic, but I have no idea what it means. just know this, it is not a reference to chronology or time as if to say he was born or existed before creation though he did exist before creation. It's a phrase, this firstborn thing, very specific phrase that comes from the Greek word prototikos which literally speaks to rank, to preeminence, to preexistence. N.T. Wright says it this way, that as the firstborn he is not part of creation, He is the Lord of creation, the one who stands preeminently before creation and over creation. For by him, all things were created. Back to Colossians 1.16. And by all things, I mean all things. Whether in heaven or on earth, visible or invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things have been created by him and for him. And he is before all things, verse 17. and in him all things hold together. Again, poetic language, kind of moving, not sure what he's talking about specifically. He's talking about creation here. And he's talking about how Christ, in his pre-incarnate form with the Father, literally created the world. He also sustains the world, because in him all things hold together. Hebrews 1, 3 says that this way, that Jesus upholds all things by the word of his power. He upholds all things by the word of his power. Now, I know that's poetic language, but I kind of try to look at that literally, the word of his power, and I start to think, really? Jesus is holding it all together by the word of his power. And then my cynical side kicks in, and I go, well, what's the word he's using? to hold it all together. I mean, is God perpetually and eternally saying, stay together? I mean, it's in the wind, you can't hear it, but he's actually talking. Stay together, everybody, everything all together. Don't move, moon, stay right there. No, no, no. This is poetic language. We missed the point entirely if we see it any other way. This is a song that Paul is singing. So no, God is not using literal words to hold it together, and he's not holding the earth on its axis with his fingers. but he's in it and he is upholding it and holding it all together it is him it's a fascinating thing I stumbled across this week almost by accident actually involving a number of authors, nuclear physicists who talk about this thing called Coulomb's Law you might want to google it It's C-O-U-L-O-M-B-S, Cullum's Law, and another phrase called nuclear glue. So I did Google it, and I got all this stuff, and it has to do with the fact that the building blocks of all matter in the universe, of all substance, is made up of three fundamental particles. And you learn this stuff in grade school. Protons, neutrons, and electrons, which all together form the nucleus of the atom. Now the protons carry an electrical charge, which means absolutely nothing to me. It doesn't move me at all. But apparently it creates a problem for nuclear physicists, and it's really not a problem that it creates. It's a puzzle. It creates a bit of a puzzle. And it's because of this thing called Cullum's Law, which says that like charges of electricity, like the kind you find in protons, repel each other, and it's kind of this invaluable law, which again means nothing to me, but apparently is quite fascinating to scientists. Because if you've got a bunch of little protons shooting out electrical charges, why aren't they blasted out? That's their question when they look at this thing that is the building block of all matter in the universe. Because Cullum's Law says that protons should not be able to exist side by side in the nucleus of an atom, though they do, because the charges should repel each other. Carl Darrell, a nuclear physicist with Bell Labs in New York City, says this, and I quote, We've obviously figured out how to negate this force. holds it all together and let them do what we expect them to do and that is to shatter. They have atom smashers. There was an article about that even in the paper this week. But we still, he goes on to say, but we still don't understand nor can we clearly identify what we've now come to refer to as nuclear glue. Fact is these nuclei at one level have no right to exist at all because they should have been blown up instantly yet there they are and they are everything. He says the building blocks of all matter in the universe. And then he concludes by saying this, and this is what I love. He says this. Some inflexible inhibition is relentlessly holding it all together. Some call it nuclear glue. Others refer to it as the Colossus, which makes me wonder if it's not Colossus. Maybe it's Colossians. Chapter one, verse 16. for by him all things were created. All things in heaven and in earth, all things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions, rulers or authorities, all things have been created by him and for him and in him all things hold together because he is the inflexible inhibition. Because it's Jesus from beginning to end, the writer of the book of Hebrews says it this way, in Hebrews 1, verses 1 through 3, that God, after he spoke long ago to the prophets, to the fathers and the prophets, in many portions and in many ways, in these last days, has spoken to us in his son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the world. Because it's Jesus from beginning to end. And he, that is Jesus, is the radiance of God's glory, the exact representation of his nature, who upholds all things by the word of his power. The apostle John in his gospel said it this way, John 1, 1, that in the beginning was the word. And the word was with God and the word was God. He was in the beginning with God and all things came into being by him. And apart from him, nothing came into being that has come into being. And while no man has seen God at any time, it says in verse 18, the only begotten of God who is in the bosom of the Father, he has explained God the Father to us because the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory. Glory is of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth because it's Jesus from beginning to end. Indeed, in the final book of the Bible, the apostle John in what's called the Revelation calls Jesus the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. He is the first and the last. He is the root of David and the offspring of David. How do you do that? The root and the offspring. Here's why. Because he's the first and the last. He is the living one. He is the worthy one because it's Jesus from beginning to end. Listen to me. It started in Genesis. Because in Genesis, Jesus is the ram at Abraham's altar. And then it moves to Exodus. Because in Exodus, he's the Passover lamb. Jesus is the Passover lamb. In Leviticus, he's the high priest. In Numbers, it's Jesus who is the cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night. In Deuteronomy, he's the city of our refuge. In Ruth, he's our kinsman redeemer. In 1 and 2 Samuel, he is our trusted prophet. And in Kings and Chronicles, he is our reigning king. In Ezra, he's our faithful scribe. In Nehemiah, he is the rebuilder of everything that is broken. because it's Jesus from beginning to end. In Job, he is our redeemer who ever liveth. In Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, he's our wisdom. In the Song of Solomon, he's the beautiful bridegroom. In Isaiah, he's the suffering servant. In Jeremiah and Lamentations, it is Jesus who is the weeping prophet. And in Daniel, it is Jesus who is the fourth man in the midst of the fiery furnace. In Amos, he's our burden bearer. In Obadiah, he's our savior. And in Micah, he's the messenger with beautiful feet because it's Jesus, you guys, from beginning to and in Habakkuk, of all places. He is the watchman that is ever praying for revival. In Haggai, he is the restorer of our lost heritage. In Zechariah, he is our foundation. And in Malachi, he is the son of righteousness with healing in his wings. And in Matthew, thou art to Christ, the son of the living gods. And in Mark, he's the miracle worker. In Luke, he's the son of man. In John, he is the door by which everyone must enter. In Acts, he is the shining light that appears to Saul on the road to Damascus. Because it's Jesus from beginning to end in Romans. He's our justifier. In 1 Corinthians, he's our resurrection. In 2 Corinthians, he's our sin bearer. In Galatians, he is amazing grace. In Ephesians, he is the unsearchable riches of God. In Philippians, he's a slave, obedient unto death. And in Colossians, he is the fullness of the Godhead in a body. In 1 and 2 Thessalonians, he is our soon-incoming king. In 1 and 2 Timothy, he is the mediator between God and man. In Titus, he is our blessed hope. In Philemon, he is a friend that sticks closer than a brother. In Hebrews, he's the blood of the everlasting covenant. In James, it is the Lord who heals the sick. In 1 and 2 Peter, he is the chief shepherd. In 1 and 2 John, it is Jesus who is the tenderness of love. In Jude, he is the Lord coming with 10,000 saints. And in Revelation, lift up your eyes, church, for your redemption draweth nigh. He is King of kings and Lord of lords. Let's stand and sing. Oh come let us adore Him Oh come let us adore Him Oh come let us adore Him Christ the Lord Amen Amen Amen Amen Amen Oh come Oh come let us adore Oh come let us adore Oh come let us adore Christ the Lord we sing amen amen amen amen amen amen Amen Amen Amen Amen So beloved, do not lose hope. Do not lose heart. For joy has come. Joy is coming in. to the one who was and is to come. All glory and honor. Go in peace. guitar solo Thank you. Thank you.
