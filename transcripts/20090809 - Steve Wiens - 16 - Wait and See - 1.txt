Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Let's pray, then we'll dive into the message. Jesus I am really convinced that if we could see you if we really could see you who you are and what you're like we would drop everything and follow you the problem is we just usually can't see you so open our eyes and help us to see amen amen well when you're wondering whether someone something that you want to happen if you're wondering when it will happen or if it will happen, sometimes the answer, unfortunately, that you get is this. Wait and see. And it's never the answer you want. Dad, when can I expect that you'll raise my allowance? Well, wait and see. Son, when can I expect that you'll clean up your room? Wait and see. Mr. Governor, any idea of when the construction on Highway 94 will be completed? Wait and see. And Mr. Favre, are you really sure you're retired? Wait and see. Well, we're terrible at waiting and seeing. We live with a kind of drive-through mentality, I think, concerning the things that we want to happen. We want what we want, when we want it, and exactly how we want it. And we hate to wait. So, and this is kind of a funny thing to think about, but imagine that Jesus worked a drive-thru. He would get fired for sure. Yeah, I'll have a number 12 with a Diet Coke and extra large fries. Great. Why don't you just pull up to the second window and bring all your possessions. And then I'm going to ask you to pull over and wait because someone behind you might need your meal more than you do. What? What? What I want, when I want it, and how I want it is incompatible with the life of following Jesus. Now the main question for Jews at the time of Jesus was when and how the kingdom of God was going to come. They were very concerned and interested about this question. And Jesus' answers to this question didn't fit the expectations of many of the people in his day. In fact, his answers, which were usually shrouded in the confusing fog of parables, tended to frustrate people. So turn in your Bibles to Mark 4, verse 26, to hear one of them as we continue in this series on the parables. We read this, Jesus also said, This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. All by itself, the soil produces grain. First the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. And as soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it because the harvest has come. Wait and see, Jesus is saying in this parable. The kingdom is coming. In fact, it's already here if you had eyes to see it sprouting up and growing around you. The children of Israel, the believers in the time of Jesus, were really good at waiting. They'd been waiting actually for thousands of years for Messiah to come and proclaim that the kingdom of God had finally come, which in their minds would be marked by three things. The overthrow of Roman rule over Israel, and then a new king of Israel sitting on the throne where David once sat, And then God's judgment for all their enemies. So when Jesus came and proclaimed that the kingdom of God had actually come through him, in fact, it was already around them and available to them, they were understandably confused because nothing that they were expecting to see, that they had been waiting to see, was happening. They just weren't seeing what they wanted to see. even John the Baptist this is really interesting was wondering the same thing in Matthew 11 verse 2 we read his troubling question sitting in prison wondering if he had if he had wasted his life when John heard in prison what the Messiah that is Jesus was doing he sent his disciples to ask Jesus are you the one who was to come or should we expect another. All of which raises this question for me. What if the work that you're hoping that God will do, and maybe even expecting that God will do, is not the work that God is doing in you and around you? Or at least it's not happening the way you thought it would. What if the answer you got to your question was wait and see? How okay would you be with that answer? And what would grow in you if wait and see was planted in you? In your long search for a new job, perhaps? What if the answer was wait and see? In your prayers for your prodigal child, perhaps? What if the answer was wait and see? and in your marriage when your spouse isn't changing as fast as you'd like him to or her to in your wrestling with God what if the answer you got was wait and see well we live in a drive-through culture with a drive-through mentality and so we are terrible at waiting and seeing so let's talk about it now in this parable the farmer sows some seed then he basically goes on vacation he sleeps in sometimes and he wakes up early sometimes which basically means that he blows it sometimes and sometimes he gets it right but the seed that was planted turns into grain anyway even though he doesn't know how it happens which is sort of an interesting thing to a farmer because a farmer knows exactly how the grain grows. Seeds planted, it gets watered, and when the time is right, the only way that you wouldn't know how it happened is if you didn't get it right. So in this soil, the seed grows seemingly all by itself. The farmer scatters the seed, and then the farmer waits. So it raises a few questions for me when it comes to waiting and seeing. and question number one is this when it comes to God working around me and in me what can I expect that God will do and what's my part question number two do I recognize the kingdom of God when it sprouts up around me or even in me or do I miss it because I'm looking for something else and the third question is what kind of character is required in a person to trust in the process of waiting and seeing when a seed has been planted and we're only going to get to the first two questions today we'll get to the next the third question next week so first question when it comes to God working around me and in me what can I expect that God will do and what is my part now I think the truest thing that can be said about how God works around you and in you is this God is tirelessly working to save you God is tirelessly working to save you when you're lost and when you're without hope and all of your trying has resulted in failing when you sleep in one too many days and there's nothing left. It turns out that that is exactly where God's best work is done. Amen? David writes about this in 2 Samuel 22. Sorry, in verse 18. He writes, He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes who were too strong for me. They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the Lord was my support, and he brought me out into a spacious place. He rescued me because he delighted in me. He rescued me because he delighted in me. God is tirelessly working to save you from your anxiety and your worry, from your addictions, which are too strong for you, from your greed and selfishness, from your rage and bitterness, which are poisoning your relationships. On the day of your disaster, when your world is dark and closed in all around you and there is no other way out, the truest thing about God is this, that God is tirelessly working to save you. That is the truest thing about who God is. God is working to bring you out into a spacious place. And this is the nature of the kingdom of God that Jesus brought. Now the word salvation literally means to be roomy. I love that. To have room or to be brought out into a spacious place from a dark, cramped, closed-in and oppressed place to a spacious place where you can see and breathe. That's what it means to be saved or to be delivered. Not just from hell when you die, though that is included, but from everything that traps you in darkness here on earth. Jesus said it this way in Luke 4, verse 18 and 19. Quoting Isaiah, the prophet, Jesus says, The Spirit of the Lord is on me. He has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free and to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. Jesus is saying this, Where there is poverty, I am working to bring salve that will ease your suffering. Where there is oppression, I am working to bring justice. Where there is blindness, I am working to open your eyes so that you can see. I, Jesus says, am working tirelessly to set the world right again. That is what I am doing. That is what the kingdom of God is about. And that is the truest thing about me. says Jesus of Nazareth. So, where is your poverty? What is oppressing you? And where are you blind? Well, what you can trust God to do is to tirelessly work to save you in those areas. That is what God is doing and that is what God will do. that is the harvest that's coming up around you. That's the kingdom of God. But what's your part in that? Well, part of it, I think, is to agree that in fact you need saving. That in fact there are things that have kept you and are keeping you in a dark, cramped, oppressed space. And that you need to look up and be delivered from it. I think another thing that is your part to do is to trust in the work that God wants to do in you and then to wait and see that the life that God wants to do in you will grow when you trust God with it. Now, 5.30 to 7.30 p.m. at my house pretty much every day represents the day of disaster in our house where Mary and I have to marshal every resource on heaven and on earth in order to make dinner and clean up dinner and get the kids fed and get them cleaned up and get them ready for bed and get them to bed and wipe banana off the walls and all this kind of stuff. Well, one particular night this last week, my Twitter update was this, patience equals thin. Because on that night, I'd just gotten Isaac to bed, and I went downstairs, and there were some groceries sitting out on the counter that needed to be put away. So I started with the easy stuff, in the hopes that when Mary was done putting the twins to bed, she would come down and get to the hard stuff. And by hard stuff, I mean the big bag of shredded cheese that you get at Costco, which someone has to open up and divvy out into smaller Ziploc bags and put in the freezer so that it doesn't go to waste. Now, I don't know why, but I hate that job. So, and I know this sounds like a small thing, but when you're totally depleted of every resource you think you have, and you're staring at this bag of cheese, it's like it taunts you. you know i will defeat you it was the day of my disaster in this moment all was dark and closing in around me and the invitation in that moment was this steve grab the ziploc bags because if you don't do it mary will have to do it those are the options and so because God is working tirelessly to save me from my selfishness the way out of that cramped dark oppressed place is to trust that by grabbing those ziplock bags and opening up and saying there are resources available to me now that I'm at the end of my rope that only God can provide even in a small, stupid, silly thing like emptying a 40-gallon bag of cheese. It's a way of being saved from selfishness. And it sounds small, but I am convinced that battles are won and lost in the small things. That if you can't do the small things, you'll never do the big things. But I can be choosed. or I can choose to be saved or not. So I'm not going to tell you what I did because that's how I'm being saved. Now God is also working, I think, to save me from my blindness. It's been on my mind for actually quite some time to get involved in issues of justice by just forming some relationships with people on the margins. So I finally called up a friend who has a lot of friends who are on the margins and we got together and I just said, this is what I'd like to do. And so he threw out some suggestions. And as soon as he threw out these suggestions, I began to regret this meeting. Because all my fears came up. Fears like, what in the world am I going to talk to these folks about? Because I'm not talking about like doing some huge service project. I'm talking about building a relationship with some people. Building a friendship with some people that I can learn from them. And so all these fears like, they're totally different from me? What will we talk about? Won't I look completely out of place and stupid? And do I even have time for this? Well, into my fear, the invitation was this. Do you want to see? Do you want to be brought out of your dark, cramped, oppressed place out into a spacious place where you will actually learn more about yourself and the world and me, specifically because you're now in a relationship with someone who is very different from you. And I'm not going to tell you what I chose to do because that's how I'm being saved. God is working tirelessly to save you. Not just from hell when you died, though he has done that and is working on that. But from the things in your life which are poisoning you and keeping you oppressed and in a dark place, God is tirelessly working to save you from that. And your part is to agree that you need saving. And to partner with God as God throws out these little invitations like seed into soil. You can either accept it or reject it. But if you accept it, you'll have to wait and see what grows in you and around in you. And if you reject it, you'll have to wait and see what grows in you and around you. Second question. Do I recognize the kingdom of God when it sprouts up around me or do I miss it because I'm looking for something else? Now God is tirelessly working to save you but here's the deal. God is also tirelessly working to save everybody else on the planet. And sometimes God invites you to be a part of saving somebody else. sometimes that's the invitation that you get now this is difficult to do when you've when you're living with the drive-through mentality what i want when i want it and how i want it is not compatible with the life of following jesus because jesus frequently will give you an invitation where you have to stretch beyond what you think you can in order to help somebody else but I'm looking only for what I want to see and how I want to see it and what I expect to see. I tend to miss a lot but Jesus didn't miss much and a story about what he saw in two blind men demonstrates this. I want to read it to you in Matthew 20 starting in verse 29. It's an amazing story. As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho a large crowd followed him. These are people that are saying I want what Jesus has. And two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard, because they couldn't see, that Jesus was going by, they shouted, Lord, Son of David, Lord, Son of David, the King that is coming, have mercy on me. Now the crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet. But they shouted all the louder, Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us. Now, question, who, despite being rebuked by the crowds, who shouts all the louder, Lord, have mercy on us? What kind of person prays that prayer? A desperate person. A person who is so trapped in oppression and darkness that they know that there is no way out if someone doesn't come and save them. Now the crowds who are following Jesus and obviously looking for something for themselves from Jesus looked right past these two invisible blind men who were sitting by the side of the road, but not before rebuking them. Now the word to rebuke literally means to evaluate and then to award blame. You guys are like this because of your lack of faith or because of something you did. So be quiet. Your opportunity has passed, is what they're saying. It's our time to get what we need from Jesus, what we need, when we need it, and how we need it. but then we read two of the most beautiful words in the scriptures Jesus stopped now why did Jesus stop because Jesus doesn't live with the drive-through mentality of what he wants when he wants it and how he wants it Jesus was always looking for the kingdom of God sprouting up around him and when he saw it, he went right after it. When he saw the harvest was ripe, he brought out the sickle and cut it down. Instead of rebuking these two blind men, Jesus asked them a brilliant question found in Matthew 20 verse 32, and the question is this, what do you want me to do for you? He places himself at their service. It's amazing that the king of the universe would do this. Now, a question that could come up in your minds is, what if that had been the response of the crowd, who instead rebuked these two men? What if they had stopped and said, sirs, how might we be of service to you? What do you need from us? Well, if they had done that, they might have had to give up what they wanted Jesus to do for them. But that wasn't their response. They rebuked these two men because they were living with a drive-through mentality, which is dangerous to do around Jesus. In fact, it's incompatible to living a life of following Jesus when what you want, how you want it, and when you want it is the highest priority for you. So in essence, Jesus instructs the crowd to pull over and wait. So Jesus looked these two men in their blind eyes and heard their response, which is found in Matthew 20, verse 33 and 34. Lord, they answered, we want our sight. And Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him. You know what else I know about desperate people? Is they don't spiritualize their desires. it's right out there. Lord, we want our sight. We are desperate. Well, can you imagine being blind your whole life and then suddenly you're able to see and the first thing you see are the eyes of Jesus locked on yours. Can you imagine how that might transform you? Well, it says immediately they received their sight and followed Jesus, so they joined this crowd, presumably. So I wonder what happened to this group of Jesus followers from that point on, because now it included these two guys, which I'm going to imagine were fired up. Right? What happened, do you think, the next time they passed by two invisible, unclean beggars or lepers or blind people? Stop everybody! Because we're going after the harvest right now and right here. I think they had eyes to see the kingdom of God around them because Jesus opened them. Question. What causes you to stop in this crazy, busy, drive-through mentality world? What causes you to stop? Well, we have a friend, his name is Kurt Rhodes. Stephan has talked about him. He works in the Middle East with an organization called Questscope. They help street kids get mentored and mainstream back into society. And some of the kids they work with are in juvenile detention centers. And in one of these dissension centers, our friend Kurt found out that the guards were raping these young boys every night. So when Kurt found out about this, he brought this question to the Quest Coast staff, about 30 people. Should we blow the whistle on this? Let's take a vote. And the vote was 50-50. And the people that were saying, no, let's not do it, said, Kurt, if we blow the whistle on this, there's a very large chance that our whole organization will be shut down. And so we won't be able to help any more kids. So let's just make this decision soberly. Kurt was facing his life's work evaporating just like that. But Kurt knew this in his heart and down to his toes that Jesus is working tirelessly to save little boys who are being raped in prison. So he could not keep his mouth shut. And he blew the whistle. Went to the person that was highest up. And he demanded that every single guard and every single person in that whole penitentiary be fired. Except for the cook who told him in the first place about what was happening. And because of the integrity of this person who had been working in the Middle East for 25 years, our friend Kurt. These people were fired, and these kids were saved. Because Kurt, yeah, yeah. Now, this happened because Kurt stopped. He stopped. And he noticed what the harvest was producing around him, and he said, it is time to pull out the sickle. It's ripe. what causes you to stop? What causes you to notice when the harvest is ripe and it's time to pull out the sickle? One of my friends that works here at Open Door, for her it's orphans. She's leading a trip to Romania in a few weeks and she's extremely passionate about orphans. I heard her talk about it on Tuesday or Wednesday this weekend. I mean, it's like fire is lit under this young woman. She's passionate about seeing orphans who would otherwise lay unattended in cribs for years. Can you imagine that? A little kid lying in their crib 20 hours a day. Unattended. So, she's leading a group of people to Romania to serve these families and these kids. And she's working, you know, behind the scenes to see if adoption can be opened up again in this country. because she's seeing that the kingdom of God is sprouting up all around her and it is time to harvest it. For Jeff Casale in a branch of our men's ministry called Hearts in Action right here at Open Door, what they're seeing sprout up around them is helping single moms with house and car repairs they wouldn't otherwise afford. Their mission is to serve single moms, widows, and the distressed in our church and outside of our church. So every third Saturday of the month, they gather for breakfast together at OPH, right on Bass Lake Road at 7 a.m., and then they head out to work together. They head out to the harvest because it is ripe. And it's what the kingdom of God is that they see. What causes you to stop? For some of you, it's kids. They're the least powerful in our society and many times the most vulnerable, even right here in Maple Grove. So what if our church became known in our community as a great place for kids to be known and valued and loved? Well, next week you're gonna get a chance to sign up and be involved in serving the kids of our church and in our community. And so if kids are what makes you stop, if kids are what you see as the kingdom of God that's ready to harvest, you're gonna wanna show up next week. With a sickle in hand. Well, here's the deal with stopping. It's really messy. And it's going to require something of you. It is not romantic. One of my friends has stopped for someone else that's in great need. And she emailed me about it. About how hard it was. She wrote this. Absorbing the violence from the world we live in requires real hard work. stamina. It's not romantic at all. It is hard. Now it's hard because part of what you need to do when you stop is to trust that God might be growing something that you may not be seeing yet. It takes real character to wait and see when it's very hard and when you can't see what's growing around you. The farmer in this parable sows seed and it eventually grows. And when it's ripe, he notices that it's ripe. And he harvests it. It's as if the only two questions that this farmer is concerned about are these. What's growing and when is it ready to harvest? And so the question that we have to dive into next week is this. What kind of person do I need to become and what kind of soil do I need in me in order to have the wisdom to see what's actually growing around me, to stop at the bag of cheese and the kid that needs to be loved? So that I move past the drive-through mentality of what I want, how I want it, and when I want it. And then I'll have the patience to wait until it's ready to harvest. What kind of person do I have to become so that those things are true about me? And what kind of church do we need to become in order to have the wisdom to see what's actually growing in us and around us? Not just what we want, when we want it, and how we want it. and then to have the patience to wait until it's ready to harvest. A question that we're wondering about lately is this. What kind of season are we in as a church? And what's growing? And what's ready to harvest? But I'm getting ahead of myself because that is next week. So let's pray together. so Jesus where we are oppressed free us and where we are blind open our eyes so that we can see and where there is poverty in us bring the healing salve that eases our suffering and let us see you. Because if we did, I think we'd drop everything and follow you. Amen? Amen. Bless you as you go. Thank you.
