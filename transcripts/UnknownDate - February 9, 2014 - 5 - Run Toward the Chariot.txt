Later, God's angel spoke to Philip. At noon today, I want you to walk over to that desolate road that goes from Jerusalem down to Gaza. He got up and went. He met an Ethiopian eunuch coming down the road. The eunuch had been on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and was returning to Ethiopia, where he was ministering in charge of all the finances of Kandaka, queen of the Ethiopians. He was riding in a chariot and reading the prophet Isaiah. The spirit told Philip, Climb into the chariot. Running up alongside, Philip heard the eunuch reading Isaiah and asked, Do you understand what you're reading? He answered, How can I without some help? And invited Philip into the chariot with him. The passage he was reading was this. As a sheep led to slaughter, and quiet as a lamb being sheared, he was silent, saying nothing. He was mocked and put down, never got a fair trial. But who now can count his kin since he's been taken from the earth? The eunuch said, tell me, who is the prophet talking about, himself or some other? Philip grabbed his chance. Using this passage as his text, he preached Jesus to him. As they continued down the road, they came to a stream of water. The eunuch said, here's water, why can't I be baptized? He ordered the chariot to stop. They both went down to the water, and Philip baptized him on the spot. When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of God suddenly took Philip off, and that was the last the eunuch saw of him. But he didn't mind. He had what he'd come for and went on down the road as happy as he could be. Philip showed up in Azotus and continued north, preaching the message in all the villages along that route until he arrived at Caesarea. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. You guys, here we are, gathered as God's people. Imperfect, the cheese sliding off our cracker, as Brennan Manning would say. But here we are to sing God's word, to hear God's word, to receive God's word, and to meet God where we are at. Amen? Isn't that good? Man, it's just sweet that we can do that. So would you pray with me as we dive into the word? And again, the reminder is, as we pray, this is not a time for me to pray for you. Well, it is, but it's mainly a time for you to open up your heart to God and to say, okay, Lord, here I am once again, as messed up or not as I really am, but here I am, Lord. And if you have something you want to tell me, I'm open to hearing it. And if you have a place of my heart that you want to touch, Lord, I'm open to receiving it. So that's the invitation for you. So let's pray together. God, we open up our hands we open up our hearts and our ears we open up our minds and we say to you we need you to speak to us and maybe even we need you to meet with us and maybe even we need you to come inside of us and be with us in our loneliness in our pain in our confusion we need you. We need your presence. And we want to say that we're listening to you, God. We're listening for you. We need you. And we are your people. Amen? All right. Well, here we are in the middle of the book of the Acts, which, again, if you're new around here, we've just been plowing our way through the Acts. And it's a story of followers of Jesus after he has died and risen again, after Jesus has sent his Holy Spirit to be with his followers and build the church. So this is the very beginning of the church when the church explodes with supernatural activity. People are being healed. People's needs are being met. People are sharing with one another. I mean, it's just this amazing activity of God saying, when God's people are really being God's people, there's no one in need. And this is happening. And then we hit wind and waves and we hit persecution. And Stephen is stoned. And Saul is about to come on the scene. And the people are scattered. The followers of Jesus are scattered. And one of those people to be scattered is Philip. This brave young follower who decides to preach Jesus in Samaria. This place that really hasn't heard a whole lot about the message of Jesus. But we read, as we saw last week, that people were healed of every kind of disease. Paralytics were able to walk. People with demons got demons cast out of them. And the result was great joy. When Jesus shows up into someone's life and into his city, the result is not condemnation. The result is not 50,000 debates lined up one after the other. It's joy. Amen? It's joy. It's needs being met. It's people being healed. It's people being redeemed. And that's what was happening. So last week we looked at two different kinds of leaders. Philip, empowered by the Spirit. and the result is he leads people to the table where they can eat that which is good. And Simon, this guy that was a little bit more about his own personal fame and his own personal power, he thought he could buy his way into what he thought of was the magic spectacle that was the work of God. And then we saw last week that Peter came down from Jerusalem and confronted Simon, but then invited him into repenting and turning. And I wondered last week out loud, what if Simon did? You know, it's like because if there is not room for Simon in the kingdom, there's not room for me. So what if Simon turned? And we ask the question, what kind of leader follows the Spirit to where the Spirit leads him to go? And so this story that you just heard from Christine is an example of Philip doing exactly that. And so the picture is Philip's right in the middle of all this excitement in Samaria. And I would imagine it's like the staff meetings that he and his, you know, other disciples are having are exciting because crazy things are happening. And they're just like, we can't even keep up with it. And then Philip gets the word from God saying, Philip, I want you to leave the excitement and go south on this deserted road toward nowhere. To which Philip probably replied, awesome. But Philip went, we read. I mean, crazy guy. He just went. He did it. And my guess is the reason why he did that is because he had spent the last several years with Jesus when Jesus was still alive. And I think Jesus took him on those kinds of trips all the time. Hey, we're going. Where are we going? I don't know, but we're going. Yeah, but a bunch of people have needs over there. Yeah, but they have needs over there too, so we're out of here. And they got into a boat and they hung out and ate hummus and laughed and talked and skipped rocks. And then they got to the next place. so Philip was really used to this kind of thing but I think this must have felt weird because he was alone out on a deserted road in the middle of nowhere heading for nowhere have you ever been there God invites you on a desolate road and you're like hello hello hello Yes. I love you, you four-year-old or whatever you are. Oh, that was good. What if God's voice is more like a four-year-old? You know, it's like, hello, hello. We're on this adventure together. Hello. Oh, great. Well, so Philip hears the voice of God, and then he goes. So question, has that ever happened to you? You know, where you sense God's voice inviting you to go do something, and then you actually do it. I remember a couple of years ago, I was working on a talk in my office, And right in the middle of nowhere, this thought comes to me, and I believe it was from God, and it was very specific. It was, your friend and co-worker Terry needs some encouragement. And that was Tuesday that that message got for me, and I knew our staff meeting that I meet with him and Dave and Vicki was on Wednesday. So I emailed Dave and Vicki, and I said, hey, I think I just, I think God just wants us to encourage Terry. so can you come to staff meeting tomorrow ready to encourage Terry? And they're cool. I mean, they're miles down the road on this journey that I am, so they're like, oh, totally cool. You know, we'll do it. So we show up the next day, and Terry comes in, and Terry's really generally very upbeat. He's fun. He's real steady, easily the steadiest of the guys anyway. Vicki may be, you know, as steady as him, but Dave and I, it's like, it's a good thing we have Terry and Vicki. But, so Terry comes in, he's just, I mean, his face is just hanging low, and he tells us this story about what happened to him the night before, and it was really hard and really tough. And so we're listening to him, and we're just really dialed into him. But at the same time, Vicki and Dave and I are looking at each other, going like, can you believe this? I mean, we didn't encourage, you guys did the encouragement thing, right? Anyway, so after Terry got done talking, you know, he said, Terry, thanks for telling us, but you need to hear that I think God put you on our hearts yesterday, and so we've come ready to encourage you. And then we did that, and it was so sweet. And when that kind of thing happens, what does it do to your faith? It builds it up, doesn't it? Makes you believe maybe there's a God in heaven that actually cares about me and my day. in my life. And maybe God puts people in my life to care for me. And that's how the body of Christ works, right? The Spirit whispers to one person, hey, this person needs some help. And then this person shows up with what they have and then it's sweet. And it works and it's beautiful. So Philip's on this desolate road heading nowhere. And all of a sudden he hears and he's heading south and there's a chariot. And when we say chariot, it's sort of, I mean, don't think Ben-Hur, you know, in the little U-shaped chariot with the one standing. It's a long journey. So he's sitting down, the Ethiopian eunuch is sitting down in some sort of a carriage driven by a driver and some horses. And so Philip is, you know, he smells dust before he sees it. And he hears the clattering of the wheels. And this chariot passes him by on the way south. And so, you know, the dust is all covering his nostrils and his throat is dry. And then the chariot's kind of disappearing off in the distance when Philip hears another voice from God. And it's this. hey, I want you to go run toward that chariot. So Philip's like, dude, I didn't even bring my running shoes. It's going to be a little awkward. I've got sandals. They have two horses. But Philip starts running. I mean, just get this picture, you know? Water. He's running, and then he comes up to the eunuch, and he noticed that the eunuch is reading Isaiah. He's reading a scroll of the scriptures. And, I mean, it's really clear in the story. This is what's happening. Philip is actually running alongside of the chariot saying, hey buddy, you understand what you're reading? You know, please let me in. I can't keep up this pace. And the Ethiopian eunuch goes, well, how can I unless someone helps me? Get on in, right? And so he gets in and then he hears the story that the Ethiopian eunuch had traveled all the way from his home to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage. Now, what you may not know, but what he would have known and what Philip would have known is that this Ethiopian was doubly outcast from the temple system. Because he had been castrated and because he was not Jewish, he would not have been allowed in the temple. So why he made this huge long trip all the way to Jerusalem is the big question that's dangling in front of us. why would he have done that well I think in part because he was obviously so spiritually starving to eat something that was good that maybe he said maybe there will be someone there that will introduce me to the God that I need to meet so we don't know what happens in the temple but we can assume that he is definitely not let in but he somehow purchases a scroll of Isaiah. Now, Isaiah means salvation, which is interesting. And he's, you know, there's no Lifeway bookstore that sells, you know, but I mean, he has to purchase this handwritten, hand-scribed out scroll, which would have been very expensive. We know that he's the treasurer to the queen, so he's got some wealth to him, and he's reading Isaiah. So perhaps he read this verse here in Isaiah 56, 8 on this pilgrimage where he's hungry for God and not meeting God, not able to meet with God because the very people who are doorkeepers at the house of God aren't letting him in. So he reads this in the scroll of Isaiah, Isaiah 56, 8. The Lord and King will gather those who were taken away from their homes in Israel. Okay, I got that. I know the children of Israel were dispersed. And then the Lord announces, I will gather those Israelites to myself. And then this next sentence, the Ethiopian eunuch reads, And I, God says, will gather others to join them. What? Yeah, I will gather others to join them. So the eunuch must be going, okay, what others? And then maybe he read this in Isaiah 56, 3-5. This has got even laser focus. It's one of those moments where you know God is maybe speaking to you through the scriptures. Suppose an outsider, he reads, wants to follow the Lord. All right, that's me. Suppose an outsider wants to follow the Lord. The guys at the temple said that was impossible, but here in the scriptures, apparently, maybe there's a little crack for me to wedge my foot into. Suppose an outsider wants to follow the Lord. Then he shouldn't say the Lord won't accept me as one of his people. Really? And a eunuch, oh my goodness, now I am in the scriptures. and a eunuch shouldn't say I'm like a dry tree that doesn't bear any fruit. In fact, the Lord says, suppose, I mean just suppose, across the annals of time, there might be at least one eunuch who keeps my Sabbath days. They choose to do what pleases me and they are faithful in keeping my covenant. Then I will set up a monument in the area of my temple to which the eunuch might have said, Bro, I was there and I didn't see a monument. Well, keep reading. Their names, the eunuchs' names, will be written on this monument. And that will be better for them than having sons and daughters. The names of the eunuchs will be remembered forever. They will never be forgotten. And at that moment, if he read that scripture, can you imagine what was going on in the heart of this forgotten one? this eunuch who had been outcast, doubly so, for things that he didn't even choose. He was a eunuch not by his own choice. He was a eunuch because he was part of a class of people who were given over to be workers in the queen's court, and he was a eunuch because anyone who worked closely with the queen, it was very important that everybody know that there would be no possibility of polluting her bloodline, so that there would be no possibility of her babies being other than the royal bloodline. So they had to be eunuchs. So things happen to him in the course of his life that he doesn't choose, and then he is made an outsider, but then he reads in Isaiah that the names, his name, will be remembered by God forever, that his name will never be forgotten. Now be an outsider for a second. be a marginalized person for a second that everyone in the religious systems has told you, you're out, you're never gonna get in, and all of a sudden, you're reading the scriptures, and they're saying, your name will never be forgotten. But he's alone, and he's reading this by himself. And you know what you do when you read the scriptures by yourself sometimes? It's like, I don't know. I mean, maybe I'm making this up. this clearly. And then here's Philip. Hey, do you understand what you're reading? And it's like, the eunuch must have said, maybe God is real. Because I'm on a desolate road, and I haven't seen anyone for miles. And here's this young guy wearing running shoes, and he's about to jump into my chariot. And so Philip comes up into the chariot, and this is the passage. We know the passage that he was reading at that moment, because It's right there in the scriptures. It was from Isaiah 53, verses 7 and 8. And hear this. You guys hear this with the ears of a eunuch and remembering his life and what happened to him. Hear this description of Jesus. He was beaten. He was tortured, but he didn't say a word. Like a lamb taken to be slaughtered and like a sheep being sheared, Now hear that As a eunuch He took it all in silence Justice miscarried And he was let off And did anyone really know what was happening? He died without a thought for his own welfare Beaten bloody for the sins of many people And the eunuch's question is Is they a prophet talking about himself Or someone else? That's what he asked Philip One of the disciples of Jesus And Philip got to say Oh my goodness let me tell you about my friend and Savior, Jesus of Nazareth, who loved outsiders of every stripe, tax collectors, sinners, prostitutes. They were all friends of his. We had dinner together. It was awesome all the time. He loved, loved people who were outside of the faith. And I've got a feeling that he loves you. and he died for you. He died on a cross for you, but death couldn't hold him. He rose again. We saw him again. Now his spirit has filled us up with power and resurrection and it means that you can be included in this family. So this is a very good day for you. And so they're rolling along in this chariot and then all of a sudden and there's the Ethiopian eunuch sees a little river. And I love this guy. I mean, he is like, he is such an activator. He's going to do it right now. He's not waiting for tomorrow. He's not waiting for next week. He's like, hey, there's a river, and I've heard what you guys do after you believe is you get baptized. What would stop me from getting baptized? And they would have both known that, well, the fact that you're a eunuch would stop you from getting baptized, and the fact that you're not Jewish would stop you from getting baptized. thank you very much. But he orders the chariot to stop. Because Philip's like, I'm calling an audible right now. And they get out, and Philip baptizes him on the spot, down into the waters of death, up into the waters of resurrection, and they embrace, and they're brothers in Christ. And then Philip is Star Trek style spirited away. And I don't know how that works, man. It's like, I don't got a real great, woo! I mean, wow, that's weird. But I just am going to believe that that's what happened. And Philip lands up in Azotus. And Philip is like, dude, thank you for not making me run all the way back to Azotus. That would have been tough. So, you know, there are some perks, you know, from following. And so the eunuch is there by himself, and it says he doesn't ever see Philip again, but he doesn't care because he's gotten what his pilgrimage was a search, and he finally got it. God met him. Jesus met him. An outsider. And all of a sudden, he's inside. And once you are inside the love of God, there is no outside of inside. Amen? There is no path that you can run. There is no distance you can travel. There is no nothing you can do that will get you outside of the love of God because God pursues you. Just like he does Philip and just like he does this eunuch. It's a question to consider. what would it mean for you to follow God on deserted roads? What would it mean for you to be open on a Tuesday morning as you're going through your taxes to get a message from God that says, hey, you know your coworker? They're kind of discouraged. Maybe you should send them a quick email. Or, hey, you know that, I mean, some of our friends, the Bogles, they traveled all around the world. They traveled all the way to the other side of the world because they believed God asked them to do it. And, you know, that's like the thing that we say, okay, Lord, anything but don't send me to Africa. And that's where they are, you know. It's like this hilarious deserted road thing. But if God asks you, what would it look like to open wide your hands and open wide your heart and open wide your spirit and open wide your mind and go, okay, Lord, maybe I'll go. Maybe I'll do it. What is the deserted road for you? And it's probably, you know, it's probably smaller than you think. It's probably not necessarily Africa. It might be Africa, so I don't want to take that out of your mind. But it's most likely concerning the people that are in your sphere of influence. you can listen to them, you can encourage them, you can share Jesus with them in a winsome and beautiful way. Which means, you know, the gospel means good news, right? So when someone really hears Jesus out of your mouth, it's going to be good news. It's good news. It's not a debate. It's not a doctrine exercise. It's good news. It's Jesus is here for you. Jesus is what you need. And it's working through questions and working through, but it's God is for you. I mean, that's the good news. God is for you. I don't know anyone on planet Earth that that is not good news for. God is for you. Most people believe God is against them. So what does it mean for you to follow God on deserted roads? I think, you know, a good start would be to download Elizabeth Honeycutt's song that we just sang, Have Your Way. Just go on iTunes, Elizabeth Honeycutt, Have Your Way. It's maybe 99 cents or $1.29 or whatever it is, and start singing that. Open hands and open hearts, open up our minds to you, God. Let that be the prayer of your week. We are longing, we're searching, guide us in the way of truth. We're listening. What if that was our posture as a church this week? God, we don't know where you're going to send us, but we are listening. next question what does it mean to believe that god pursues you just like he pursued philip and just like he pursued the ethiopian eunuch what is it what would it mean for you to believe it not just in your head but in your heart that there's a god who is so radically and recklessly and amazingly and crazily in love with you that he pursues you all the way down the road that you've gone that's maybe twisted and maybe messed up and maybe far away from God and maybe you've done things that even today where you're thinking, I don't even know why I'm at church. My last two years have been absolutely crazy. There's no way God is for me. And in this moment, at this moment in time, I'm here to tell you that the good news of the gospel, of the risen Jesus is God is for you and God does pursue you no matter what and no matter where, that's a done deal. For God so loved the world that he gave. God gave it all for you and for me. That's God's fundamental stance towards you. I will give my most precious thing of my world to get you, to pursue you, to run after you. And God says, you know, I have some people that are called my followers and I'll send them for you. I mean, isn't that amazing to think that God whispers your name into someone else's ear because you need encouragement? I mean, isn't that incredible that God pursues you like that? To me, it's breathtaking. So what does it mean to believe that God pursues you? And then lastly, what would it mean for you to run toward the chariot? What does that look like in your life? Again, Philip, he's just walking down the road, chariot passes by, gets the little thought in his mind from God, hey, go after the chariot and get inside. So then, you know, the vague thing, hey, go on this deserted road and head south, becomes very specific. Go on the road and head south. Okay, I will. But I might give up if it gets boring. A chariot passes by. hey, go get in the chariot. What does it mean for you to run toward the chariot in your own actual life? And what scares you about that? Because that's scary for me. But what is it for you? Is it with your spouse? Is it with your coworkers? Is it with someone you know, but it has been a long time? What is it for you to follow that which God is calling you to do. And, you know, I think many times we think, well, you know, really the Hebrew word for run really means wait. And you know it means run. There's a psalm that says, I run in the path of your commands because you have set my heart free. I think so often we think about running in the path of God's commands as like a jail cell, You know, well, that would be awesome. To do what God wants me to do? What a prison. But the psalmist and Philip, they're like, I run in the path of God's commands because he set my heart free. When my heart is free, this is what my heart does. This is what we're wired to do. And the God of all grace will give you what you need to do what God's calling you to do. I mean, that's what's crazy. So what is it for you? Maybe you know, maybe you don't know. But if you know right now, my encouragement to you would be to whisper this answer to God right now. God, here I am. My answer is yes. Maybe you got to figure out some things. Maybe you got to ask some questions. but if you know what it means for you to run toward the chariot right now, just whisper to God in your spirit, yes, I will do it. I'll need help. I need lots of help. Help! Thank you. But God, here I am. I will do it. Here I am. I will do it. and the God that is God will give you everything you need Amen so let's stand together pray together deep breath in blow it out So let's pray together. God, we put out our hands to you, and we say you are God, and we want to hear you, and we want to listen for where you're calling us, and we want to do what it is that you want us to do. We run in the path of your commands because you have set our hearts free, Set our hearts free, God. Those of us who are bound up and burdened and in prison, set our hearts free so that we can run after you, so that we can run after your paths, which are laid out for us, which are filled with joy. Give us a heart for those people who are marginalized and outside so that they might be invited in, God, because we believe you love the world and you've made your bride beautiful so that people who do not know you may come to know you. We are salt and we are light and we are fiercely dependent on you, God, to give us what we need to be those things. Amen? Amen. Amen.
