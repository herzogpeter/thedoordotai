but i got this idea of sexual violation and and without you know getting any details i would begin to direct our prayer in that way and that's when it just cut loose uh that's when we're going to really get things done and it turned out to this person and no one had known that not even her husband who was there at the time knew that she had been on a date rape in fact she didn't even remember that until after this happened. She had just suppressed the whole thing so effectively that it had been blacked out of memory. And the result was that we now could address what was there. Ask the Lord for as many specifics as He's willing to give, as you're open to. And the final thing is this, always be in and under the Lord's authority. Never think. You'll freak out. You'll positively freak out if you think for a second that this is your battle, and that you're the one who has to kind of do the fighting. And when we think like that, what we end up doing is screaming real loud as though, like, you know, how loud we are is going to make a difference. And we try to say things real authoritatively. And it's really not necessary, though sometimes you just get into it and that's what you do. But we're under the Lord's authority. We're sort of like the barrel of a rifle. That's all we are. God's the ammunition. God's the one who pulls the trigger. God's the gunpowder. God's explosive. God's the one who directs the bullet, but we're just supposed to be barrels. So we pray in his authority. He wants to use us in this thing, but it's not our fight. Relax a little bit then. It's not your responsibility to vanquish the enemy on your own power. It's your responsibility to be a useful instrument. He's the one who does the whole thing. That's why I always pray in the Lord's name and on the Lord's authority. I'm even hesitant about, because Jude was hesitant about, Addressing Satan himself. And rebuking Satan himself. I rebuke you. Jude says that Michael the Archangel didn't do that to Satan. But Michael the Archangel said, the Lord rebuke you. And that was kind of made a difference. So I would make a new law, a new rule, a new regulation. You're going to be demon-possessed if you don't listen to this. But the point is, be praying in the Lord's authority, not on your own. When you're with a person. When, or when there's some kind of physical confrontation. All right? A person called me up two weeks ago. I shouldn't just limit it with a person, because you can have a physical confrontation without a person. A person called me up about two weeks ago and said that her telephone cord was dancing. You get a lot of it. That's not like Ghostbusters. This stuff is just too bizarre. I never believed I'd be operating in this stuff. And I don't operate in it much, so don't call me if your telephone cord dances, because I'm not a, you know, who you're going to call a person. But this person I know pretty well, and the telephone cord was dancing, you know. She said there's no wind or anything. I go over to her, and it's just dancing around, and it's kind of freaking her out, which is understandable. I said, wait until the telephone starts dancing, and then they didn't call me back. That may be a physical confrontation, or maybe it's something else that's very weird. I said, is it real tangled? Mine does that when it gets real tangled up. She goes, no! So I... There's also, this kind of freaked her out when she called on her answering machine. There's another voice on it besides hers. She calls to get her messages, and someone else was on it. That was a real growly kind of a thing. So maybe there's something going on there. Okay, what do you do in those situations? When you're on your own, and you're by the phone, who are you going to call? Okay, I... You know, here's the thing, though. Like, this stuff is so bizarre. I mean, all this stuff is so bizarre. But, you know, it's bizarre because I am a product of this culture which says it's supposed to be bizarre. Get out of there. It says it's supposed to be bizarre. And it really is. I can't believe the stuff that I myself have seen with this. It's just so strange. If anyone else told me it, I wouldn't believe them. And I always feel like when I tell anyone else it, they don't believe me, which is why I hardly ever talk about it. The other thing, though, is this. about going back to this other point about praying the Lord's authority. The Lord mocks Satan. Colossians 2.15 tells us that, that on the cross the Lord made a mockery of Satan. And it can sometimes reinforce your confidence if we need to take the enemy seriously, but not too seriously, because he's defeated. It's over, it's done with. And I think when we stand in Christ, there's no room for fear here. There's no need for fear. There's certainly no need for paranoia. This is a done deal. We're just wrapping up the show. The war has been won. There's some battles to fight, and those are important battles to fight, though we don't fight them. It's important to see him as a mocked enemy. That's why sometimes I don't mind laughing about this stuff. I don't want to at all take away the seriousness of it. I'm also kind of laughing at some of the caricatures of it, like Ghostbusters kind of stuff. It needs to be taken seriously, but not so seriously that it occupies your mind more than the Lord, or even occupies your mind one-tenth that the Lord does, or occupies your mind one-one-hundredth that the Lord does. I don't care if your phone is dancing. The Lord is the one who's going to take care of this, and you can become so preoccupied with the enemy that you lose that focus. okay i didn't cover the first point did i i went and not for point number two okay test the waters when you're in a thing like this test the waters observe and listen i don't know what this is all subjective i wish i had objective criteria to give you but but uh follow the promptings of the spirit i keep saying that over and over again what do you see what do you hear um what do you feel on the inside don't assume that you're dealing with a any kind of a demonic force with your phone or with another person. Always go for, if you can explain it naturally, make that your main focus. Maybe the person is having an epileptic seizure and they're not possessed. You look for natural explanations. You don't rule out other stuff, but test the waters. Begin to pray in a spiritually confrontational way. With this young lady I just gave you. I didn't know if there was a spiritual stronghold there. I began to sense it, and so I began to pray against it. And it seemed like the more I prayed against it, I began to see physical manifestations. Sweat, shaking, twitching. Something's going on there. That's a good indication that you are now in what is often called a power encounter. Talk to the person. if you're dealing with a person here. I'm just, the reason I'm giving you this is that part of spiritual discipleship is being in tune to the possibility of spiritual warfare when you're praying with another person. And maybe we pray for a lot of people, but we don't ever entertain the possibility of spiritual warfare on their behalf. Many times there is spiritual warfare to be done on their behalf. Paul tells us that one of the main goals of spiritual warfare, 2 Corinthians 4.4, is to tear down strongholds in people's mind. There's a spiritual encounter there. rational argumentation isn't enough so when you pray for a person i'm just trying to give guidelines as to as to maybe how to go about this real practical guidelines talk to them observe listen begin to pray at a spiritual level if you know i sometimes pray this way lord if there is any kind of demonic interference here i want to come against that in jesus name now be watching what happens when you do that if there's any if there's a significant stronghold that you're coming against, it may begin to act out at that point. Lord, if the enemy has got any territory in this person's life that needs to be brought into captivity to you, I pray your spirit would do that and we come against the enemy who would try to deceive her and you begin to pray in that way and see what kind of response you get. You may be doing spiritual warfare and there's simply no physical response. So, you know, go according to your inner intuition. Sometimes, however, there's a physical response that that begins to evoke. Talk to the person. Ask them, what's going on? When I pray that way, do you feel anything different? I mean, this isn't like hyper-spooky stuff that we've got to roll our eyes back and tune out and go into ethereal land over. Talk to the person. Be down to earth. When I come against the enemy, what goes on there? Talk to me. What's happening with you? This is just a down to earth sort of thing. It's not a thee, thou, thither, wither thing. It's just a down to earth practical thing. You've got a problem, we're going to try to address that problem. One of the problems may be spiritual. What goes on when I pray that way? Get feedback from them. Use that as an indication. If you're in a spiritual encounter, if it's possible, pray until there's some resolution. And that can look a lot of different ways. Pray until there's a resolution in your spirit that the thing is done. Pray until there's a resolution in the other person. Is there a peace there? Again, there's no one thing to look for here. I dealt with the most intense case I've ever had in my life was at a retreat that I did where I had two people that were really demonized. And for six hours, we prayed for them. Four times I thought we got the thing out. I thought, oh, finally, oh, let's go home, get some coffee and go to bed. Bam, it happens again. And I think what happened was we got one out, but there was other there. I'm not sure how that happened. But pray until there's some resolution, if possible. Sometimes there's other things that happen and you just got to say, we got to pack this up and let's do it again tomorrow and just pray for protection on the person until that time. But try to pray until there's some kind of resolution. Peace in you and peace in them. Finally, encourage some follow-up counseling. Encourage some follow-up counseling. Some people think that when you have a spiritual encounter and you win, and you always do win, by the way, though it may not look like that initially, But when you have a spiritual encounter, that solves the problem or that heals the person. And now they're going to be healthy individuals and walk down the street and have a little skip in their step. And that's not the way it happens. Coming against demonic forces in a person's life or even in your own life doesn't heal you. It makes healing possible. But that doesn't itself heal you. Every case I've ever known about in every case, or almost every case that I've heard about, where there is a significant stronghold in a person's life, where they're really demonized in an intense way, say, for example, to the point where when you come against it, they actually lose their consciousness. When there's a stronghold like that, it usually is connected with some deep wound. The enemy goes for your Achilles heel. He wants to find the wounds in your life and salt them, and that's the power he has over you. Demons are like flies on a wound. In fact, this is a real picture I got when I was dealing with these two people at this camp. There was this deep wound like a bedsore and it was all pussy and full of fungus and just oozing with junk. There's all these bugs on it. The job of the bugs, do you love my illustrations? The job of the bugs was to keep it really infected and maybe even make it bigger. When you come against that, you get the bugs off. So now healing can take place, but healing still needs to take place. Now, almost always when there's a significant encounter of this sort, some kind of follow-up counseling is appropriate. Maybe professional counseling, maybe not. In this case that I had at this camp, these two people got into counseling, and a number of the other people who watched it had to go into counseling because it was that freaky. Two people had to be committed to psych wards for a period of time because they just had nothing that would prepare them for what they saw. It was pretty intense. Okay, let's spend five minutes hashing through questions on intercession or on spiritual warfare. Do you feel like you got a grip on that or have I confused things more than they were before? Questions, comments, experiences. And that's exactly what Paul tells us. That's exactly what Paul, the point was that the main place where she feels demonized, another little footnote here. The Greek word is demonizomai. It's a word that's almost always used with regard to any kind of, what we sometimes call demon possession. The word literally simply means, if you want to take it as the most literal meaning, it means being rendered passive in relationship to a demon. To be influenced by a demon in such a way that you are not powerful in and of yourself to resist. To be passive with regard to a demon. There are an infinite variety of degrees of that. I mean, I think when you walk into a store and office and you get hit with some great temptation to go over to the pornography rack, you just got demonized to a little degree. There's a tempter there who's got a little hook in you and saying, come on. But that doesn't mean that you're possessed. Sometimes we make this radical distinction between being possessed and oppressed. But the Bible doesn't make that distinction. The Bible simply says demonized. There are various degrees of it. And we can't know from the outside how severe it is. I think it's a pretty radical form of demonization that a person has when, when you come against it, they lose their consciousness. And the thing maybe even speaks through them. Oh, I had a note there that I didn't get at. When I said, talk to the person, don't argue with the demons. Did you catch that on the overhead? I didn't comment on that. That's a bad thing to get into. If the thing starts talking to you, which I don't think will happen very often, so don't get freaked out, but I got freaked out and don't get into a fight with it they'll win and it's a waste of time and it just sidetracks you and they lie all they do is lie why converse with something which is pure lie you get no information that's worthy of anything now some would argue with that but that's been my experience where was I? oh about the demonization thing so this radical distinction between being oppressed and possessed is there's nothing really biblical to support that. This is why Christians can be, and we obviously are, every one of us, at different points in our life, to some degree, demonized. It just means that there's a demon acting on you. Sometimes it can be pretty strong if there's real deep hooks there, and that doesn't mean you're not a Christian. In fact, it may be that those hooks are so great that when someone comes against them, you lose it for a little bit. That doesn't mean that you're not a Christian. We've had in our mind, I think partly because of Hollywood, this criteria that if you roll on the floor or you lose consciousness or the thing talks for you, then that means you're possessed. But if it's anything less than that, then that means you're oppressed. And you can be a Christian if you're oppressed, but you can't be a Christian if you're possessed, which means that if you really had strong strongholds, you all of a sudden, that means you weren't saved. That kind of backfires on you. It backfires on people who have gone through that. So I just want to say that as kind of a clarification point. Coming back full circle to the point that raised all this was what Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4.4, that the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but are spiritual to the tearing down of strongholds, bringing every thought, casting down every imagination that would set itself up against God, every image that we're literally, you know, in the imagination is your mind's image-making capacity. The enemy uses that against the knowledge of God, against who you are, and then Paul says, the result of that is to bring every thought captive under Jesus Christ. He speaks as though that were, in fact, in that passage, he speaks as though that were our only spiritual warfare. No, that's not the only spiritual warfare. That is the central one. What goes on in your mind? Sometimes maybe we need to do spiritual warfare on our mind. I come against that thought. Where is that thought coming from? It ain't from you, God. And so, bam, come against that. Stand in who you are in Christ. Good. Someone else? Yeah. See, what I'm getting at is when you don't know how you should pray. When you're seeking the Lord and you're trying to discern, okay, what's going on here? You're asking the Lord, show me here. Now, what are you looking for? I'm looking for some kind of internal direction or whatever. Now, if I get a word that says spit on her or something like that, I know that that's not consistent with the word, and so I'm not going to go with that. On the other hand, I know that right now I am sold out to, I'm focused about hearing from God. That's my intentionality, and that counts for some kind of protection. I don't think God's going to lead me astray on that. But there's also the influence of the enemy, and you've got to be aware of that. So the light of Christ, the criteria of the word is always the standard. Okay, but you see that there's an intuitional element here. That's why I say don't just go on intuition. Look, observe. What happens when you do this? You can be wrong. That's true about getting a word of knowledge and a word of wisdom and all the spiritual gifts. You know, in 1 Corinthians 12, Paul lists prophecies, interpretation of tongues, all of that. That stuff can be so damaging if everything you think that goes on in your mind is God. Because then, you know, and you've maybe been in services, and I have been in a lot of services, where people stand up and what they say you know it's not of the Lord and it can be real damaging. Where those gifts work best is in the same context. This is my own theology here, but in the context that the Corinthian church was at. When you have a group, the Corinthian church, as far as we can discern, was probably between 30 and 40 people. And in a group of 30 and 40 people, those gifts work real well. It's an interpersonal kind of thing. But always know that there's a possibility, with very, very rare exceptions, the possibility that you could be wrong. And so you've got to be careful. You've got to be tactful. You've got to coach what you say. You've got to be discerning in how you use it. You've got to make sure that you're not abusing, that you don't use it in an abusive way. So also here, we're fallible. We can go wrong. And that's why you just use as many criteria as possible. Be as tactful as possible. Qualify what you say. I get really scared when someone just says, I got a word from God and it says this. I really like it when someone says, I think I got a word from God. and I think I'm supposed to, you know, okay, that means that we can negotiate this thing here. But otherwise, you're also in the position of God, and I'm in trouble, you know. I just, I went to a Benny Henn crusade one time where I saw him accuse a woman of adultery in the middle of this crowd of 5,000 people, and I knew the woman. I didn't really know the woman. I knew the superintendent of my district who was good friends with the woman, and it just wasn't true. But if that was your word of knowledge, wherever you got it from wasn't God. Okay, anyways. Yeah? I think a word of knowledge, and for those of you who don't know, this is all in 1 Corinthians 12, where Paul talks about gifts that God gives the church. That kind of gift, especially that one, is really good in a prayer ministry where you need to know how you should pray. God never discloses secrets for the sake of disclosing secrets. He's not a national inquirer. You know, inquiring the minds of what to know. Hey, did you know about this? He does it to direct prayer, to help us in spiritual warfare. And, yeah. Okay. I've heard enough testimonies like that where, you know, I don't understand any of that, to be really honest with you. In fact, I don't understand any of this. All right? I really don't. And that, for a lot of years, just kept me out of it nice and safe. It was only because I got yanked into this stuff that I'm, you know, even doing it. And so stuff like that, honestly, I walked out of the first Tom White seminar we had. I thought, this is so flaky. I did. And then a year and a half later, when I was going through it, I was desperately trying to find my notes. What did he say to do now? And so when you've been through it, it kind of changes things. Be open to it. That's why I don't understand how that can be. What do you mean, a necklace? But it happens enough. okay yeah that's important uh uh when you listen to dave and you listen to me i think in pictures dave thinks in pictures and we hear this about getting a picture getting a picture and some people think oh i don't get a picture that's because you know some people are perceptually driven other people are more auditorial driven and some people are what they call kinesthetically driven intuitively driven uh we have different you know like like we can see the same things and what I'll remember is what I saw, and what you'll remember is what you heard, and what another person will remember is what they felt. And that's how we store information. It doesn't matter how we store information. And so God uses that. And so you just got to kind of find out what's primary for you, and don't try to get what isn't primary for you. Maybe it's the word. And that's why some people are much more intuitionally driven. I had some people come over to my house when my house was going through this stuff, and this was the wildest thing I've ever done, because I really thought this was the ultimate and flakiness before. I had these people come over to exercise my house because all sorts of crazy stuff was happening in it. And they would do that. One would say, I'm seeing something over here. Let's go pray here. Another person would kind of get a feeling, an intuition, like, I think we should go pray in this room. And I could see, though, one person saying, well, what do you see? Well, I don't see anything, but I feel like we should go here. You've got to, you know, God communicates differently with different people. And incidentally, the night after we did that, we didn't have a thing happen to our house ever since then. We had them come in, walked around the house doing all this very, very, very strange stuff, and the result was that all the dreams we were having and nightmares and all the stuff we were seeing stopped. So I don't care how flaky people say it is, it works, and if it works, I'm going with it. Yeah. And that's another thing I don't understand and that I've always confronted is whenever I did this stuff, I've had five or six times, six actually, and seven, but one of the times I didn't recognize and just dropped the ball. But whenever I've done it, it's like I say in Jesus' name, come out, and I thought it was supposed to just go boom. It's like it never happens that way, and that bugs me. I don't know why. Wait, I say in Jesus' name, and the Bible is supposed to come out, and I don't understand why it has to be the struggle, and you're going for hours. I don't understand why that is, but that's okay. but I think I should just be able to say, out, and they should come out. They don't listen to rules, I guess. Okay, one, two, and then we're going to have to move on. One, two, three, final three. That's really a good thing. Both with regard to the intercessory prayer and with regard to the warfare. This can never become, it must never become a power trip. Certainly never a cool thing. At one point I thought it would be kind of cool to get involved in this. It's not. It's really not at all. It's a person thing. It's no different than helping a person who has a disease or might get hit by a car. One of the things that can happen in intercessory prayer, either in spiritual warfare or just intercessory prayer, that is a blessing, is for God to give to you the gift of empathy, where you begin to empathize with the one that you're praying for. In fact, that frequently happens. You are in some ways participating in the work of Christ on the cross, not in the sense that you're atoned for anyone, but in the sense that he gives you a piece of his heart. He feels for the world. He took the whole sin of the world, the whole pain of the world upon him. When we intercede, either in spiritual warfare or just in ordinary intercession, maybe ask God, be open to God, giving you a piece of empathy, a piece of his heart where you begin to feel the pain of the person you're praying for. Man, that changes your perspective. This is why sometimes you pray for your enemies. We get a totally different view of them because God will give you a little piece of their pain. Maybe explain, shed a little light on why they're acting the way they are. Okay, you had, I think, the last one. I already told you I didn't know anything about this. No, okay, that's really good. I mean, that's a really good question. I wouldn't stop praying for them if they don't want to be helped because pray that God will change their will, change their desires, show them something they didn't see before. but they probably won't let you pray with them I wouldn't lay hands on them if they don't want to yeah if you know I'm not sure how to answer that and in a lot of cases when you're praying with somebody they want to be prayed for and yet there's another side of them that doesn't or the side of them that wants to be free but another side of them that doesn't want to be free that's pretty normal aren't we like that a lot you know we hate our sin and we love it that's why it's still around we're double-minded and unstable in a lot of ways so i'd say just go ahead and pray i don't know a formula for how much willing they have to be to be freed and how much you know one thing i don't understand is how kids can ever get in this situation uh you know kids don't choose it there's no more you know but it seems to happen but then again maybe it shouldn't be strike me as that weird because saddam hussein and other and hitler they have they have the power to kill little kids demons are simply super instances of the free will of human beings so if the universe is such that little kids aren't safe from other human beings, well, I think they're safe from demons. You see? I always thought there was a theological law that said that couldn't possibly happen. But the universe seems to be more cruel than I would think it would otherwise be. But it's fallen. Okay, you have the last word. This is... Okay. We got ten minutes because... Someone's going to say five minutes worth of announcements. Is that about right? Five minutes worth of announcements? We can cut it down to three, I think. Okay, reading the Bible devotionally. I'm going to say a brief word about this. We're going to cruise here because I want to get to the money bit. This is where it gets most fun and most convicting. Reading the Bible devotionally, a little word, just a little word. Why is it so dry? Many times it's so dry. You're not drawn to the Bible. It just doesn't have any life for you. You read it out of duty. You get tired of it. You know, there's a time not to read the Bible, too. Okay, I think I'm supposed to say this. You know, Christians throughout the ages, most Christians haven't had Bibles. It's a very new thing to have a Bible. I don't want to underemphasize the importance of a Bible. But you can survive in Christianity without it. Everyone's saying, what was you saying? You can't survive without the Word. But illiterate people go to heaven, and the majority of people throughout church history have been illiterate. In fact, the idea of owning your own Bible is very rare. I say all that to say this. It can be that the Word can become dangerous for you. If you've been through a very harsh environment where it was used as a billy club, you flinch when you look at it. And there's actually a time where you need to ask the Lord to give you space to rest, even from the Bible. Doesn't that sound weird? But I've been through that. And where you'll only break the mentality that you've always had going to the Word and quits. I used to look at the Bible as a battlefield. The only reason I went to the Bible was to prove my doctrines. It never spoke to me in any kind of healing way. I just had my proof text, and I wanted to make sure I could refute everyone else's arguments. It took me so long to quit reading the Bible that way. And I had to take a break from it. It had to become, one person I think summarized it really well, The Bible had to become user-friendly. And it actually can be damaging to you when you read it, and it's not user-friendly. I'm not at all trying to justify not reading the Bible. I'm just saying that even to go to that, you need a certain degree of health, and you need loving leadership. We talked about praying the Scripture back to God. Oh, one of the reasons why it's so dry can be because we've been beat up with it. Another reason is because we can tend to read it like we read everything else. We read the newspaper fast. I do. I read a lot of books fast. I go to the Bible, and it's, oh, how nice. And it doesn't, it's like, but if the Bible is really a one-of-a-kind book, there ought to be a place where we give it a one-of-a-kind reading. Okay? It's unique, and the way we approach it needs to be unique. Not that. It's good to read the Bible, and get the point, and get the history, and get the information, record it in your mind, and go on. That's great. Study it for doctrine. Read it like any other book. Learn its history. Tear it apart. Do that kind of stuff. Intellectual study. Great. But that's not going to feed your soul and transform your life. There needs to be a time where you read it in a very unique way, in a very special way. One of those ways is what we did at the beginning of this class. Praying the scripture. Turn the scripture into a dialogue where you dialogue with God about it. Pray it back to God. I think you'd be amazed at the way it can come alive in your life. Another way that I find most beneficial. This is my favorite thing to do with the Bible. It comes from St. Ignatius of Loyola, who was one of my favorite theologians, founder of the Jesuits. He says, enter the Bible. Enter a passage using all five senses. You've got to worm your way into the Word and get it on the inside. So it becomes sort of like a virtual reality. You follow me here? You know what virtual reality is? You can put on these things where it's three-dimensional. You actually feel like you're in a different world. if you don't know what I'm talking about you're not going to know what I'm talking about and you can you're in this very bizarre world it's like the video game of 20 years from now it's a three dimensional thing and you're in a different world it's like doing Mario Brothers but there's Mario Brothers you've got to run from and then there's Mario Brothers and it's like you are in the Mario Brothers game it's like stepping into the TV set Videodrome or something okay well in this you've got to enter into the inside of the text I wanted to do this as an exercise tonight, we don't have time so I'm just going to give it to you and I want you to try it on your own take a passage of scripture this works really well with parables or with the story of Jesus but you can use it in just about anything all the story, the narrative aspects of scripture become one of the characters become one of the characters and pray as to which character you should become. Usually it's going to become one of the central characters. But you enter into their perspective on things. Try to imagine what it would be like. This takes a lot of time when reading the Bible, but man, you get a lot of fruit from it. Let me just use one illustration here, okay? Luke chapter 15. Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathered around to hear him. Picture all these sinners and tax collectors gathered around to hear Jesus. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, This man welcomes sinners and eats with them. Terrible. Birds of a feather flock together. That's not what I was told. Then Jesus told them this parable. Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Okay, in your mind, picture a scene with a shepherd and a hundred sheep, and you lost one of them. Okay, so picture the shepherd. Use all five senses, as St. Ignatius says. He says this in the 16th century. What do you see? What do you hear? What do you smell? What do you sense around you? What do you feel? Okay, construct the whole thing. Enter into the text. Ask the Holy Spirit to help you. Suppose one of you, okay, does he not leave the 99 in the open country? and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? You're the sheep. Where are you lost? How have you got there? A lot of times I find that I enter the passage, but I also bring to the passage a lot of my own garbage. So I'm a sheep that got stuck by doing what I did, even though a sheep could never do that. You know what I mean? Okay, but I'm a sheep and I've screwed up and I'm hanging on the precipice of a cliff and it's cold and there's wolves out there roaming all around. You know, get your scene here. You're scared. and there's this shepherd out looking for you and maybe he's been roaming for a couple days but he cares so much about you that he left those other those other sheep what do you feel about that you hear him calling you thought you were done for now you hear his voice and when he finds it he joyfully puts it on his shoulder can you see jesus doing that carrying you on his shoulder what do you feel like when you're doing that it's riding along on his shoulder he's hugging you you're safe now he cared so much about you and he goes home and then he calls all of his friends and all of his neighbors together and he says rejoice with me i found my last sheep my lost sheep can you picture jesus and all the angels having this incredible party over you i mean you know you didn't think you're that important you didn't think that he'd go chasing after you in the middle of the night through the cold and the rain and fighting off the wolves to get to you let alone die to get to you but he did and now he's just rejoicing and having a party with all of his friends up in heaven because you came back it makes a world of difference you can know all the information that I just gave in your head, and it won't touch you a bit. But you enter on the inside of the story, make it a virtual reality, have the Holy Spirit make it a virtual reality, and now all of a sudden it's about you, and it makes a difference. You're the sheep, and you see and experience and feel things in a particular way, and that's when it begins to transform your life. The point of all the parables, in fact, the point of all of Jesus' vivid language is to give us a picture to give us, well, that's if you're perceptually orientated, but to give us a way of thinking about it that's concrete, that's perceptual, that's definite, that's tangible. So that we've got something to cling on to that can make a difference in our life. Because theories and abstractions just don't cut the mustard when it comes to transformation. Theories and abstractions just don't cut the mustard when it comes to transformation. It's not like Ross Perot. Nah! Okay, uh, okay, solitude and silence do it. just do it, Nike theology hey basically all I want to say is get alone and shut up no, that's good to do okay, finally in five minutes let's talk about money stewardship not that this pertains to any of us but you know the danger of wealth we don't need to review this, do you? the love of money is the root of all evil man, the Bible has some harsh things to say about rich being rich the love of 1 Timothy 6, 6-10 really gives a stern warning about being rich, how you're going to fall in love with it, how the love of money is the root of all evil and all ungodliness and all this other kind of stuff. Matthew 19, 23-24. Let's try to water this down if we can. It's easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get to heaven. I've heard one explanation that there's a big gate called the eye of the needle, and that's what Jesus is referring to. I've never seen any proof of that, but I think it was probably made up by a rich man. Luke! Campbell can't get through that easy. Oh, is that what it was? Okay, so it wasn't... I think it was hyperbole, Jewish hyperbole. Rich people can go to heaven. But man... That's Matthew 19. Luke 12, 13-21, about the rich fool who said in his heart, I will store up for myself more and more and more and more and have a nice retirement to go coasting through life, and he's just going to have all this great stuff. Basically, he was a good capitalist. Look what the Bible says about him. Who doesn't store up more and more and more so he's going to have a nice retirement? Sounds like the guy was pretty level-headed. He got zapped. Our greed-driven culture... we live in a culture that makes greed a virtue. I think capitalism is the best system going. It's the lesser of all the evils, but it's got its own evil. I don't like communism. Because, I mean, if the world was all Christian, communism would be great. But with sinners, it just doesn't work. It doesn't. But beware of capitalism. luther thought capitalism was of the devil he said so martin luther thought capitalism was the most ungodly thing and he said the reason why it's so ungodly is because it will take the worst vice and make it the best virtue namely greed and he was right our society our culture our whole economy survives on greed you got to always want more you got to be hungry for more perpetual hunger is what our society creates you never have enough that's what every commercial is about You know, you get bombarded every day with 8,000, I saw this last night on TV, 8,000 advertisements a day to buy something. You need something. What a perpetual message. Man, if we could just memorize scripture 8,000 times a day, I think I would be transformed. The tape again ran out before we were able to finish. And so I'd like to finish what we were getting at in this last session in our discipleship course. our culture is driven by greed when bombarded 8,000 times a day with a message that tells us that we need more we got to get more we have to acquire more how do we break this deception how do we come against that message that we're getting 8,000 times a day let me just close with with a few considerations the first is this realize that you own nothing we own nothing we come into this world with nothing and we leave with nothing. And all that we have in between, in the in-between time, in the period of our life, is given to us to be stewards of. It's given to us on loan. And the question, it's given to us as a gift and also given to us so we might do something with it. We own nothing. Now that goes against the fundamental presupposition of our culture, but it's a truth. We are not the lords of our own material possessions. We are stewards of them. A second thing is to think communally. Begin to think. James tells us this in 2, 14 through 17, about how we must be concerned with others when they have needs, when they have things that are unmet in their life. If we just say, God bless you, and let them go the way, our faith is dead. In Acts chapter 4, we see a good illustration of this, how the early church thought communally. In verses 32 through 37, the church came together, they had all things in common. They each sold some of their property so that they could give it to the church as a whole, and that way they shared their possessions. We don't need to become communists, but we do need to become communally conscious. Learn to see those around you who are in want, who don't have what you have. Part of the deception of our culture is that we think individualistically. We think just about ourselves or maybe our own family. and we sort of perseverate and focus in on that. But when you become aware of those who are around you, those who have less than you, those who are in need, we begin to confront this deception that we need to always be hungry and need to always be acquiring more. You begin to live your life not in the mode of what can I get, what can I get, but in the mode of what can I give, how can I serve, how can I help. Finally, you can extend that globally. In fact, we need to extend that globally. Look at the world around you. You know, Americans constitute 7% of the world's population, but we consume almost 50% of its resources. We are in the top 5 percentile in terms of wealth of those on the earth. When you see yourself according to the standard of America, maybe you feel like you're being shortchanged something. But when you see yourself by the standard of the world where most people are at, maybe your feelings of being shortchanged will diminish somewhat. If we change the standard by which we measure our wealth, our feelings about our wealth begin to change. Begin to think globally. In this world, 17,000 kids a day starve to death. One third of the world is going hungry, even as I'm talking to you. Another third of the world is living right on the border of hunger. The majority of the world lives for survival, not for comfort or convenience. The question is, can we become sensitive to that? Can we get enough out of the deception of our culture to begin to see that for what it is and maybe begin to do something about that? A good question to ask yourself is this. In a world where there are 17,000 starving kids, kids who starve to death each day, we need to ask ourselves the question, what is the upper level that is justified for a disciple of Christ to live? What is the upper level? You know, if your neighbor's kid was starving to death and you had all this food, I'm sure you'd feel kind of guilty about eating it in front of them. The only difference between that situation and the situation we're actually in is that our neighbor happens to be 10,000 miles away. The question is, what is the upper level of wealth that is justified, that we can live at in this world? It's not a question about how much can we earn. Earn as much as you want. In fact, the church needs billionaires. I mean, let God bless you with billions of dollars. Because with that comes power. You can do a lot of things in the world with finances, and that's a blessing of God. The question is, what do you do with it? Make a million dollars, but live off of $75,000 or $50,000, and the rest reinvest in the kingdom. There's no one standard you can come up with, you know, that no Christian has a right to earn more than $50,000 or $75,000 or $100,000 a year. There's no rule on this. Every individual has to be motivated by their own heart. But what needs to happen is for us to ask the question. Our culture deceives us into never asking that question because it always gets us to want more, hunger for more. So you've got billionaires who are working on the third billion and fourth billion, and they'll work 16 hours a day to get that because they think that somehow the fullness of life is found in more of that. But if we've been set free by receiving what we need in our inner life from Jesus Christ, we know that money doesn't fill that and possessions don't fill that. And so that can change, and it must change, the way we think about our possessions. What can we do with the kingdom of God? What can we do for the kingdom of God with the blessings that God's given to us? What is the highest justified standard that we live off of? Whether it's $30,000 or $50,000 or $100,000 a year, let the Lord work with you on that. And the question is, what can you do with the rest? I want to close in prayer. Lord, I pray that you would help us, those listening to this tape, to be open to your dealings in their life with regard to their finances, as well as with the other disciplines that we've talked about here, Lord. Money is such an idol in our culture, and we're so insaturated with that. We're so influenced by that, Lord. I pray, Lord, you begin to confront the idols of our life, and even the idol of money, thinking that the purpose of life is to live in as much convenience, in as much comfort, with as many possessions as possible. Lord, that's a lie of the enemy, and we call it such. And we ask that you'd help us to be free from that, Lord, that we might receive the blessings that you've given to us, the wealth that you've given to us, and use it for your kingdom, Lord. Use it for your namesake. Use it to show the love of Christ and how we help the world and how we help the homeless and how we help those who are marginalized in our society and those who are starving in other societies, Lord. Be with us, Lord, we pray in your name. Amen.
