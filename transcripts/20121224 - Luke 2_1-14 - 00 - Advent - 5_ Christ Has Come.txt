Good afternoon, everybody. My name is Bob McKenna. I'm the care pastor here at Open Door. And tonight's reading is from Luke chapter 2. Now in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth. This was the first census taken while Quirinius was the governor of Syria. And everyone was on their own way to register for the census, each to his own city. Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem. because he was from the house and the family of David, in order to register along with Mary, who was engaged to him and was with child. While they were there, the days were completed for her to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn son, and she wrapped him in clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn. And in the same region, there were some shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terribly frightened. But the angel said to them, Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy, which will be for all the people. For today, in the city of David, there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. This will be a sign for you. You will find the baby wrapped in clothes and lying in a manger. And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts, praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest and on the earth, peace among men with whom he is pleased. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be unto God. Well, Merry Christmas, everyone. So good to see you. when my family gathers together for a meal especially, one of our traditions is to ask a table question. So, and oftentimes I do the table question, and so that's my little way of staying in control of the event. But the question goes out, and then each person has to answer the question. And so I have a table question for you tonight to think about. And the question is this, Have you ever been a part of a really magnificent caper? Have you ever been invited to do something that everyone else thought was completely impossible in a way that certainly was impossible? Have you ever been invited to be a part of a caper? There's a guy named Bob Goff. He wrote a book called Love Does. I read this book this year. one of the most inspiring books that I've read in a very long time. I think his amazing picture is going to come up on the screens. This is just a little picture of what I'm going to look like in about 10 years. So it's great. You can just get a little picture of this kind of guy. But he writes all these stories. His life is dedicated to pulling off amazing capers of love. And his most favorite, my most favorite story in this book is a story called Ryan in Love. And he writes that he was sitting on his porch with his wife, and the porch overlooks this little path that people walk on from time to time, which overlooks a large body of water. And so one time he was sitting with his wife, and this guy came meandering down the path, not unusual, until he just kind of stopped right at their fence and was looking up at them, sort of awkwardly staring at them. And pretty soon he waved at them and motioned them down to the fence. and so Bob went down there and he said, hi, I'm Ryan and I'm in love. And I was wondering if I could propose to my girlfriend right here in your backyard. And now remember, Bob loves capers, so Bob said, absolutely, we're doing this thing. The answer is yes. You just show up whenever you want to and you can propose to your girlfriend right here in our backyard. So he goes skipping away, hardly missing, you know, hardly hitting the ground. But then he came back the next day, and he motioned Bob over again. He said, Bob, Bob, I have another idea. What if we had dinner on your porch before I popped the question? And Bob's like, awesome, done. We're doing it. Yes, the caper was getting better and better. So sent him off. They worked out a date which was going to work. The next day, Ryan shows up again. He's like, Bob, motions over. This time, Bob's like camping at the fence, doesn't even sit on the porch anymore, looking for Ryan. Ryan goes, Bob, I'm just wondering if my friends, some of my friends can come over and serve us the dinner. And Bob said, that would be fantastic. How many friends are you talking about? How many friends do you need to serve the two of you dinner? Ryan said, about 20. 20. Awesome. Done. Next day, Ryan comes back, motions Bob over. I don't know why they didn't exchange cell phones at this point, but he goes, Bob, I just, I mean, we're going to have dinner on your porch. My friends are going to serve us. I'm just wondering if you could set up some speakers on this porch and we could, you know, I would really love to dance with my fiance after I pop the question. Yes. The answer is yes. Ryan, is there anything else that you need? No kidding. Ryan goes, looks at the water, looks back at Bob. Do you have a boat? Bob's like, as a matter of fact, I do. So of course he could borrow this stranger who he's never met before in his life. He could borrow his boat after he has a wonderful dinner with his girlfriend that he's about to be engaged to. And so the night comes, and the girl is flabbergasted. The dinner is gorgeous. The friends, all 20 of them, decked out in tuxedos, serve a great meal. The dancing is amazing. They go and get on the boat. Bob fires it up, and they go out to this prearranged point at which Ryan turns his girlfriend out to the shoreline and he's gotten about 50 of his friends to spell out in candles, will you marry me? Well, of course, the answer was yes. But then Bob one-upped him because remember, Bob loves capers. Bob called the Coast Guard to sort of slink over and the moment that she said yes, every gun or cannon that was on this boat was lit off and just in this amazing, tremendous coup de grace because Ryan was in love. Have you ever been a part of a caper like that? Now, this is Christmas Eve, and we bundled up our kids, and we light the Christ candle, and we listened to some beautiful scriptures, but the reality is we are celebrating the most amazing caper ever conducted in the course of human history. It was an impossible event, and it was pulled off beautifully. Think about it. It was like God was grinning and winking the entire time. I'm going to involve a 14-year-old virgin who's going to get invited by an angel to carry my son. I'm going to conduct a chorus of angels up in the sky to put on a concert for a group of shepherds. I'm going to have the actual son of God actually born in an actual barn. And people are going to tell that joke for the rest of human history. At a time when every Jewish baby boy was being murdered because of a power-hungry king, I'm going to have my son be born right into that chaos. And I'm going to invite everybody who wants to be in on this caper, a 14-year-old virgin, some lonely shepherds, three wise men, in. And we're going to watch this thing unfold moment by moment by moment. It is the world's greatest caper ever hatched. And it's what we celebrate tonight. But I think the more honest people among us, or maybe the more cynical, both of which I would fall into that camp, might say it's sweet to sing about a baby who came 2,000 years ago to bring light to an otherwise dark and oppressive world. But really, it's been 2,000 years, and I don't think life has gotten a whole lot better. You know, so it's kind of nostalgic and sort of sweet, and we pack out the church for Christmas Eve, but it's sort of a nostalgic story. It's sort of the good old days when Jesus came, and for one night we can sing and pretend that life is okay. Well, here's when the caper gets really, really extraordinarily better. Meister Eckhart wrote this in the 13th century. We are all meant to be mothers of God, For God is always needing to be born. We are all meant to be mothers of God because God is always needing to be born in our blind and violent and oppressive and dark world. And the punchline of the caper is that you and I are invited into the caper of the light coming into the world. You think about the moment when Joseph and Mary were rolling into Bethlehem and there was no room anywhere. Mary was ticked off at Joseph for not making reservations anywhere. There's no room in the inn, right? And this beautiful moment that happens in a barn could have happened in someone's inn. Well, the question that comes, I think, to you and to me from Jesus is this. I am the light of the world. I'm just looking for a place to be born. Because the light of the world is born in every single moment of every single generation since. Every single person that's sitting in this room has the opportunity to say yes to Jesus being born in him or her again. In this horribly dark world, the invitation comes to you. Is there room in you? to house Jesus so that Jesus can be the light of the world once again in this moment in time with school shootings and fiscal cliffs and foreclosures and cancer. Will Jesus come again through you? The question is, is there room? Is there room in you? Do you want to be a part of this beautiful, extravagant, ridiculous caper of God? Do you? We just house the light of the world. We just hold the light of the world and let it shine. Amen? So tonight, let's open up our hearts to the King of Kings. Let's make room for him to come in. And then let's watch that light shine really, really brightly. Amen? Amen. Amen.
