I ask you to open your Bibles to Galatians chapter 2, our continuing study, verse 1. Every time I preach, I feel like I kind of grab you a little bit before I start and ask you to pray for me, and ask you to join me and even join me in the preaching of the sermon, that we would be declaring together what the Word of God is saying. And many times I come and I say I'm really feeling distracted, I'm feeling burdened, and I'm feeling under attack. And pray for me that God would give strength, and you do, and he does. And today I'm feeling a little different. I'm feeling extremely full, and I've got a lot of things to say, and my heart is just bursting with enthusiasm about what God has for us this morning. And I need you to pray for me to slow down and let the Spirit really do his work. without me getting in the way because I'm so excited. And that's a real issue, and I would have you join me as we get into this. Let's just read the text, first of all. Chapter 2, verse 1. Then after an interval of 14 years, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas. This is Paul talking, taking Titus along with also. And it was because of the revelation that I went up to Jerusalem, and I submitted to them, the apostles, the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles. But I did so in private to those who were of reputation, for fear that I might be running or had been running in vain, wasting my time. But not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. But it was because of the false brethren who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty, which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage. But we did not yield in subjection to them for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you. But from those who were of high reputation, what they were makes no difference to me. God shows no partiality. Well, those who were of reputation contributed nothing to me. But on the contrary, seeing that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised, for he who effectually worked for Peter in his apostleship to the circumcised effectually works for me, worked for me also to the Gentiles. And recognizing the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship that we might go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. Let's pray as we begin. Dear Father, I call upon you at this time to ask that what we would hear would not be words of man, of a man, but that we would hear from your powerful, precious Holy Spirit. that you would first of all quicken our minds to grapple with the information and there is a lot and we need to intellectually fight this morning but I pray Jesus far more importantly that your spirit with power would move and communicate things that human tongue cannot communicate that you would pierce and divide Amen Character assassination is a deadly weapon if you would like to destroy someone's credibility, if you would like to destroy someone's influence, his very ministry. Every one of us know about that. You see it in the news every once in a while where someone, very often a public figure, is attacked or defamed in some way. And the charge that is being leveled at him can be absolutely false. But you know what? In your mind and very often the public's thinking, it doesn't matter if the charge is true or false. The fact that that negative thought has been planted in your mind stamps him guilty forever, and it takes a lot of work to get through that. I want to tell you something. The Apostle Paul was under such character assassination all of his life and all of his ministry. His effectiveness, because of the things that the Judaizers were saying about his person, was very definitely being hindered. We realize that the Judaizers who had come into this church, these Galatian churches had had an impact, had found inroads, and people were believing the things that were being said. Paul was hounded all his life by people resisting him and raising up people who didn't like him. Now, there's a way in which I could look at the Apostle Paul and finding him always in controversy, kind of say, Paul, what do you expect? It's just something you ought to assume is going to happen just by the very nature of your personality. We know enough about the Apostle Paul to realize that he was a controversial guy. He was a confronter. He didn't beat around the bush when issues came that were important. And he was not always diplomatic. Last week, I found it tremendously humorous in Acts chapter 9, when Paul had finally come to these apostles in the city of Jerusalem, meeting them for the first time, that the Word of God said that he went around all of Jerusalem speaking boldly the truth of the Lord Jesus Christ and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews. And people wanted to kill him. He was raising such a ruckus. And it says in that ninth verse, I'm not sure it's the ninth verse, it's in Acts chapter 9. It says in that verse in Acts chapter 9, second column, halfway down, it says this. And finally, when he left, and the apostles got him out of town, the churches in Galatia and Samaria and all of these different areas finally had peace. What do you expect? A guy like that who takes a stand and says, this is where we're going, this is what we believe is going to become a target. But there was one group of people who took special aim at Paul. They were the Judaizers. Judaizers, you remember from our studies in the past few weeks, are not people who are kind of from the outside, they don't have big fangs and they don't spit venom. They were people who were in the pews. They were people who looked very, very spiritual, and they considered themselves to literally be defenders of the faith, and they were taking issue with Paul's gospel of grace. It was their opinion that Paul was getting mushy, that when he was talking about the liberty of the believer, he was setting people free to sin. And they came in with all this kind of stuff that says, yes, you're saved by grace through faith, plus... And then they began to add works. And Paul would go from town to town, and he would plant seeds of God's grace. And these Judaizers, it seemed, wherever he went, would follow in right behind him and just pull up from the roots the ministry that he had done. And their most effective tactic in destroying his ministry, or at least trying to destroy his ministry, was not in attacking the message itself, first of all. The first thing they did in trying to uproot this gospel of grace as it had fallen on people's ears and given them liberty in Jesus, the first thing they tried to do was attack his person. You'll notice that in yourself when you get into arguments or you get into differences of opinion with people. If you feel that your argument isn't holding very much water and you really feel like you're going to lose because the argument that's opposite you probably makes a lot more sense, what you're going to feel yourself doing is crossing over a line and all of a sudden you're not talking about issues anymore, you're not talking about opinions anymore, all of a sudden you're talking about personalities, and character and you're judging people's motives. And if I can make the guy look bad, we'll ignore his message. No better way to do it. We can spread venom about the Apostle Paul. He will lose his credibility. The accusations that they were leveling against him, you remember them. One, that he is not an apostle. He's a fake. He is not an original. He's a hypocrite. He got his message from the apostles. He didn't get it from God like the other apostles did. The guy's on a big ego trip. He really thinks he's hot stuff. And he's all on his own completely. He has no authority from the church in Jerusalem. He's just a guy doing his own thing. And so it is that before we even get into the meat of the exhortation that the Apostle Paul has of this church in Galatia, we see him defending his credibility. For two chapters, Paul attempts to establish the absolute authority that he has been given by God to speak for God. Now, some of us, in maybe prior reading of the Apostle Paul, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, we see him constantly doing this, defending his apostleship, defending his apostleship. And some of us, myself included, not having gone into the text and seeing what was going on around there historically, kind of get a little upset with Paul. You kind of think, man, that guy's paranoid. He's always saying, I am an apostle. I'm an apostle. he's on a big ego trip he's just speaking from wounded pride and he sounds a little bit infantile from time to time the thing is this that we discovered last time we met and dealt with these texts was that much more is at stake when he defends his apostleship than simply his silly hurt feelings the gospel is at stake the apostle Paul would be saying this if you defame me and if you revile and ridicule me you will ignore me the problem with that ignoring me is simply this. Not that it's going to hurt my feelings, which it would. It would. He would have hurt feelings. But that isn't the real issue. The issue of this is this. God has given me a message to preach. If you ignore me, you're going to miss the message. What's at stake? The gospel is at stake. Thus it is that he defends his apostleship. Liberty in Jesus Christ is at stake. And as Paul writes the book of Galatians, Paul is fuming mad. There is a lot of tension in this book. Do you know that some things are worth fighting for? Do you know that? Some things are worth fighting for. In fact, I'm going to go a step further. Do you realize that what some spiritually dead churches desperately need more than anything else is a good, knock-down, drag-out fight? What? What kind of nonsense is he preaching? Good Christians don't fight. Good Christians go with the flow. Good Christians don't upset the apple cart. I mean, really, what in the world could be worth fighting about? I'll tell you this. I know a lot of things not worth fighting about. And one of the real defilements in the church today is what we do is we find ourselves fighting about a lot of things that aren't worth fighting about at all. What we need to understand is that there are some things worth fighting for. Some things that aren't worth fighting for are things like this. How we do things. How we do things. You know, there might be a lot of disagreement about how we do things. And I think there needs to be a lot of room for disagreement. But separation? Not a chance. Not a chance. Division? Because of that? No. The color of the walls? It's negotiable. It's negotiable. You've got to have a certain confine. It's negotiable. The structure of the board? It's negotiable. The songs we sing? It's negotiable. A lot of room to disagree. Divide? No way. There are things that aren't worth fighting for. There are things that aren't worth dividing over. There are some dimensions of theology, though there is an awful lot of theology that I will fight for. There are some dimensions of theology that I have seen believers divide over and not have fellowship with one another. And I think it's wrong. And I may be going out on a limb for some people here, but this is where I'm at with this. I've heard people divide and decide not to have fellowship with one another and just spread all sorts of malicious kinds of things with a brother over their interpretation of Genesis 1, 1 through 3. God created the world. Absolutely. I'll fight over that. 24 hours. One guy says, yes, it was 24 hours, just like today, just like our 24-hour period. Somebody else says, it doesn't necessarily mean it was a 24-hour period of time. These guys divide. They fight. It's not worth it. I don't think. Disagree? Fine. Disagree like crazy. Have an argument. Don't you dare divide over something like that. One of the things that was always going on when I was a younger person was the prophetic scheme that people argued about and divided over. Is it pre-tribulation? Is it post-tribulation? Is it pre-millennial? Is it post-millennial? Amillennial? I think it's pan-millennial. You've heard that one. In the end, it's all going to pan out. I don't know. But I know, and you do too. You do too. Maybe we've grown because I don't have a lot of this controversy anymore. But I know people who have divided with a brother in Christ because one of them believed pre, the other one believed post. I don't think that's worth it. Argue? Fine. Do it. Just go at it like crazy. It's wonderful. Both of you will grow. Maybe both of you will learn the right one, too. One of you might. Anyway, I'm not even going to tell you where I'm at with that. Another one we used to fight about all the time. What Bible version do you use? Have you ever been involved in that one? Oh, man. King James Version. If it was good enough for Paul, it was good enough for me, you know? Some of you think that. Okay. It's not worth fighting them out. Let's argue. but we don't divide over stuff like that. No way. And I want to tell you something. You know one of the rules of thumb in terms of determining what's worth fighting for and dividing over and what isn't? One of the rules of thumb that I would like to share with you is this. There's an awful lot of things that we would divide over. And I am not willing to fight over them, and I'll tell you why. Because an awful lot of the issues, many of them that I just mentioned, are going to put a brother in Christ over here and put another brother in Christ over here. If it divides the brethren, real believers, I don't think it's worth fighting about. Argue. Go ahead. But divide, no. We've gone into something that we shouldn't be getting into. If it's dividing true believers. Now, please hang on to this because I'm going to try to make a point from that. The point is this. We need to be aware that while there are some issues over which I am not going to fight. Now, it's possible that, you know, Apostle Paul says, so far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. It may be that someone doesn't like my particular bent on another one is tongues. There are many different perspectives on the gift of tongues in its place. And there are many different ones in our church. And some of you might not agree with mine. I hope we never divide. There are some things that aren't worth fighting for. But we need to understand and be aware that there are some issues over which we have to fight. Some issues over which as people of God who care about things that are real and biblical, that we must be willing to enter into and confront, that we know even as we do it will cause a division, and it's a division that is absolutely necessary to be made. Sometimes you need to fight. Division. Division. That's bad. That's always bad. Wait a minute. Listen. Listen, we will do everything we can to avoid divisions that separate a brother from a brother. But get this, on the other hand, we, I believe, must do everything we can to bring the kind of division into the church, the kind of division into the church that will separate that which is real from that which is false. Bring down the sword right now. Separate that which is phony from that which is real. Separate the sheep from the goats. that is not something that we should avoid that is something we should pursue and do actively all the time my dad used to tell me all the time especially when I first got into the ministry and then when we talk he gives me this little piece of wisdom all the time and I'm going to pass it down to my son and he'll pass it down to his and daughters and all the way down the line it was this be careful David where you draw your battle lines because there's an awful lot of things that aren't worth fighting for and the other reason you need to be careful about where you draw your battle lines is this because there are some things you have to fight for. And if you keep drawing them over silly little things that don't make a difference, you're going to lose your ability to fight the real war. Paul had drawn a battle line, folks. Right here. Paul had drawn a battle line. He said, this is worth fighting for. The issue, the issue was simply this, legalism versus liberty. Legalism under the law, liberty under grace. Do you ever wonder why this is such a volatile issue? Why it is that the Apostle Paul attacks legalism with the fervor that he does? After all, don't you ever get the idea that people who are legalistic, people who are really wrapped up in legalism, sometimes even in our own minds we have this feeling that men alive, they're a little bit hung up, they're a little bit, you know, they're a little bit, they miss the point a little bit. But heavens, you know, sometimes they look like they're really spiritual people. And Paul comes down so hard on the Galatians, he comes down far harder on the Galatians than he ever does the Corinthians. He tells these people are severed from Christ if they keep going this way. Adding works. Performing. Why is it, beloved, that legalism is such a danger to the gospel? I'll tell you what I think. I believe that the reason legalism is such an antithetical precept to the gospel of grace is this. that legalism gives people a false security. Legalism gives people a false security. What do you mean by that? What I mean by that is this, that instead of my security being solely in God's grace and placing my faith and sense of trust and sense of rest in his full, completed work, if I am legalistic, what I will do will be placing my sense of confidence and security not in his grace, but rather in all the little things I'm doing. And, beloved, they may be good things. and the false sense of security comes simply this way that through a law structure a person is able to wrap himself in a cloak of external piety he is able to wrap himself in a cloak of external piety as long as I keep the rules say the words carry my Bible as long as I've grown up in the church and when I'm old I stay in the church even though the life of God is not in me and the internal graces are never evident never evident I actually believe that because I've cloaked myself in this robe of external piety that I have been regenerate the fact is I'm on my way straight to hell legalism is anathema perfect example Pharisees perfect example Pharisees who looked more spiritual than a Pharisee. Again, we've got these mental pictures in our minds that Pharisees were easy to spot. Everybody knew a Pharisee was wrong. Everybody didn't know that the Pharisee was wrong. Pharisees looked like the most spiritual of the spiritual. They looked like they had it all together. They were real concerned about the Sabbath day. Oh my, you just take care of these things. You don't do that. When Jesus performed a miracle on the Sabbath, they nailed him to the wall. And Jesus nailed him right back and said, you guys care about tithing your dill and your mint and your cumin. You do all those little things and you've forgotten the way of your manners of the wall like love and mercy and justice. You know what they didn't have? They didn't have the inner graces. They had wrapped themselves in a cloak of legalism, thus deluding themselves into thinking they had life when they didn't. They were on their way right to hell. Some of the most religious among us are the most lost. That's a scary concept. The ultimate delusion, the ultimate delusion is believing that because I grew up in the church and have stayed in the church and prayed the sinner's prayer and have been able to maintain a good show that I am regenerate. And some aren't. Paul says that's worth fighting about. That's worth fighting about. That's worth confronting and I'm going to do it. I will do battle with those expounding an external faith all my life. Let's get to the war. It's waged on three fronts in the book of Galatians. These Judaizers had first of all attacked his authority. This is how the whole book breaks down. They had attacked his authority. They had attacked secondly after they destroyed his credibility. they attacked his gospel of grace. After they attacked his gospel of grace, they attacked his lifestyle of liberty. Paul counters that onslaught with his own onslaught. Chapters 1 and chapter 2, if you want an outline for the whole book, this is it. Chapters 1 and chapter 2, Paul defends his apostleship, says, I have a right to speak. I've been given this message from God. Chapter 3 and chapter 4, he defends his gospel of grace. In chapter 5 and chapter 6, he defends the lifestyle of liberty. Those things are all to come. We're still in the midst of his defense, of his apostleship. The first accusation that the Judaizers brought against the Apostle Paul, you remember, was simply this. Paul got saved. We don't deny that. But he didn't get his message from God. What he did was he went up to Jerusalem, listened to the Apostles' teaching, then got all the doctrine from them, then went off his merry way to Cilicia and all these different places and started preaching a gospel, but it was his own. It wasn't. And when he met these Galatians, he just changed it to fit his own, and it got perverted. And these Judaizers again, remember, considered themselves as the ones who were coming in to save the day. Paul had come and got his doctrine, went away, changed the doctrine. Now the Judaizers are going up to clean up after Paul, straightening him out. Paul counters powerfully. We did this last week. Verse 11, for I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. For I neither received it from man nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ. Then he went on to defend it. I'm not going to go into that whole thing. That's a big review. But he defended it and proved it by saying, you can look at my pre-conversion life, you can look at my conversion, and you can look at my post-conversion life. And as we said two weeks ago in this text, there is nothing in any one of those dimensions of my life that could possibly lead anyone to believe that I got my message from a man, from any man. I didn't even meet the apostles until three years after I was saved. And that whole three years I was preaching the gospel and preaching the gospel. I got this from no man. now after that powerful what I would call if you wanted to have a title for verse 11 to 24 it would be Paul's declaration of independence Paul's declaration of independence now after chapter 1 verse 24 we go to chapter 2 verse 1 and there's a transition here and you need to catch it if you're going to understand at all where we're going there's a transition the transition goes like this the whole point of chapter 1 verse 24 verse 10 to 24 was that Paul wanted to demonstrate his independence from anybody else. He wasn't taught by man. But you know what? That argument opens him up for some criticism from some other people. And you know what the criticism is? After he's declared his independence from any man, the criticism would come from the Judaizers simply this way. Yeah, Paul, and that's just your problem. You're too independent. Which, by the way, just goes to show you, if somebody wants to get you, if somebody's negative on you, it doesn't matter what you say, it doesn't matter what you do, they're going to find a way to get you. Hmm. That's why Paul was never a people pleaser. He never tried to go to this person and this person and find out what they wanted and do it. He just kept preaching his message. Okay. Okay, that's just your problem, Paul. You're too independent. It goes like this, so you get the flow. First accusation, you learned your doctrine from the apostles. Paul answered. It said, no, I didn't. I'm totally independent. God gave me the message. The second accusation would simply be this. That's just your problem, Paul. You're doing your own thing. Your independence is anarchy. your independence is anarchy your gospel is sectarian your teaching is different from Peter's and the apostles so it is that in chapter 2 verses 1 through 10 he says yes indeed I'm independent but I'm not alone so what did he do he went to Jerusalem after 14 years he met the leaders he shared with them their gospel they gave him the right hand of fellowship and said to Paul Paul go to it this section beloved right here is hot stuff this is very very volatile stuff and We're going to hit it right now. The section breaks down real simply three ways. First of all, we see his defense of the apostles' affirmation of him. First of all, we see it in his coming, verses 1 and 2, in his confrontation, verses 3 and 4, and then in his commendation. Let's hit it real quickly. Verses 1 and 2, his coming. Verse 1 just sets the scene. Then after an interval of 14 years, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas taking Titus also along with me. This just sets the scene. Some good history to know. It's real clear from our study last week or two weeks ago that his contact with the apostles was absolutely nil. He had very little contact with them. The first time in Jerusalem that he ever met any of the apostles was three years after his conversion, remember? And even when he went that time, he only met one of the apostles. That was Peter. And then he also met James, but James wasn't an apostle. And then he only spent 15 days there. 14 years later, he goes back up to Jerusalem, and meets with the apostles again. What's he doing during those 14 years? What's he doing during those 14 years? Verses 21 through 23 tells us in chapter 1. Then I went up to the regions of Syria and Cilicia, and I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ, but only this. This is what happened during those 14 years. Everybody who hadn't met me kept hearing, he who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith, which once he used to try to destroy. And they were glorifying God because of me. The word had spread. Also during that first 14 years, he had made two missionary journeys, one with Barnabas, another with Silas. And now finally, after 14 years, he's back in Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas and Titus. By the way, just for the record, again, if you're taking notes and you just want to know the history here, I believe that this trip that is being spoken of here in chapter 2, verse 1, is the trip that's recorded in Acts chapter 15. A couple weeks ago we dealt with it, so I don't want to go into it real deeply. It's the Jerusalem Council. In verse 2 of chapter 15 in Acts, the Word of God says that there was no small dissension going on. And what that dissension was all about was about the legalism that was being spread by these Judaizers. No small dissension. And so it was that the Holy Spirit revealed to Paul and Barnabas that we need to go to Jerusalem and straighten this thing out. And so they did. Notice something in chapter 2, verse 2. We're moving on to verse 2 now. That first one just set the scene. And why did I go up to Jerusalem? It was because of a revelation that I went up. I want you to notice something. One of the things I feel real strong about is if we're really going to get the thrust of this text, we've got to get into the heart and the guts of the Apostle Paul. He throws another barb here. He is really angry. I know I shouldn't use that word. But here's a barb here. It's incredible how he zings them right here, these Judaizers. It was because of a revelation that I went up. How is that a zinger? How is he shooting at them with that when he says, I went up because of revelation? Simply this, because the accusation against Paul was simply this. I know why Paul's going up to Jerusalem. The guy's desperate. He finally blew it. He knows he's way off on a limb all by himself. Nobody agrees with him. And he's going off to Jerusalem to try to get all sorts of support. You know, these guys just aren't with him. And he knows it. And he's going to try and get his message straightened up. The other reason is this. We know why Paul's going up to Jerusalem. They're disciplining him. They even know that his message is followed up and they're calling them on the carpet. You know what he says? I want you to know before the question even comes up. I went to Jerusalem for one reason and one reason only. Nobody called me. Nothing like that happened. God gave me a revelation. God's the one who tells me what to do. That's where I went. A little zinger. Lots of tension here, folks. God told me to do it. So it is that Paul goes to Jerusalem and he goes there with two things. He goes with a message and an illustration. It's always good to have an illustration when you give a message. What was the message? The message was simply this. Apostles, I want you to get together here. I want you to hear the message that I'm giving. It is grace, grace, grace, grace. Energized by faith, faith, faith, faith. No words. He shared it with them. And he brought an illustration. The illustration was Titus. Titus is a Gentile. Titus is a Gentile. He is an uncircumcised Gentile. These Judaizers are saying that if you're going to be saved, you've got to be circumcised. Does he have to be circumcised or not? The answer is no. Therefore, the message is valid. The question is this then. Why is it so important for him to do that? Why is it so important for him to go to these apostles when all this tension is going on and share with them the message and get their support? The answer to that is real interesting. Somebody might think, you know, he should have had to go. You know, God's going to straighten all that out. And, you know, everybody should know and it shouldn't be any problem. But he goes anyway, and there's a real reason. He tells us right here. The reason I came here and gave you my message to find out if you agree with me or not is this. If we are not together on this, apostles, there are some real leadership principles here that I want to tap. If we are not together on this, if we are not preaching the same message, then I'm running in vain. I am wasting my time. The message to the apostles was simply this. Let's say our message is the same. And by the way, you'd have to know their message would be the same. There's just no doubt at all that their message would be the same. The problem was this. If, however, our message, we agree in principle, but apostles in Jerusalem, you're soft on legalism. You're not willing to take a stand on legalism and stand firmly against these Judaizers publicly. What you're going to do when you don't take a firm stand is you're going to undermine everything I'm trying to do with the Gentiles. So I need to know that you are not only agreeing with me, Paul says, in principle, but that you are willing to take a stand publicly against them. sounds a little far-fetched guess what he had that problem with peter he had that problem with peter and again here's some real powerful leadership principles going on here when peter was with paul you know what he said he said oh yeah it's grace it's grace it's all grace it's nothing but grace it's freedom in christ absolutely no doubt about it but you know what happened to peter when he was with the judaizers he changed his message he just kind of vacillated. Peter's problem in the early part of his ministry was that he was a bit of a mush. He was a bit of a mush. He agreed with everybody. Guess what? You can't agree with everybody. And if you're going to be put in a position of leadership, you're going to have to take a stand. And Peter and Paul looked Peter square in the eye and says, Peter, in principle, I know you agree with me, but you need to tell me right now, who are you with? Anyway, where do you stand? You've got to know your own mind, and then you've got to have the courage to stand up for what you believe. You stand condemned. Verse 11. We're going to get into that next week. You stand condemned. So, his coming brings a lot of tension. This is a tense moment, and his coming has set... Not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. That is a tremendous victory for the Apostle Paul against the Judaizers. Why is that? This is the end of Side 1. Do not fast-forward the tape. Please turn the cassette over now to continue listening on Side 2. because the Judaizers were coming to the churches in Galatia and saying this we're from the Jerusalem church we speak as authoritative from the Jerusalem church and they say that you guys need to get circumcised. What did Paul do? He just pulled the trump card. He says, I'm going to show you guys and I'm going to just push this right down your throat. I'm going to bring a Gentile to the Jerusalem church. Ask them. See what they do. Hey, guess what, folks? I brought a Gentile, uncircumcised Gentile, from the churches in Galatia to Jerusalem, showed him to the apostles, said, hey, what do you want to do? You want to circumcise this guy? They said, no way. Incredible victory he had just won. It really was a gospel of grace. But you need to know this, that that victory didn't come easy. verse 4 tells you why the victory didn't come easy. But it was because of the false brethren, that's why it wasn't easy, who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty, which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us and you into bondage. This is potent right here, and I want you, if you've been sleeping, to catch up. Wake up. Ready? Wake up, everybody. Here we go. Potent stuff. Need to hear it. I see you sleeping. No, I don't. The Greek really helps us here. And there are three phrases that I'm going to take apart and leave with you for you to get. The first part of this phrase that I want you to get is this. False brethren. Who are they? You write that down. False brethren. We're going to take that apart. Who had sneaked in. Sneaked in is the next part I want to give you. That's very important. To spy out our liberty is the third thing I want to get you. First thing is false Christians. The reason our victory was hard to win to bring this gospel of grace was because of false brethren. Very interesting term. and it ought to let our little antennas in terms of spiritual warfare go up a little bit. Who is the enemy? He calls them false brethren. Literally that word means sham Christians. The Phillips translation calls them pseudo-Christians. They are people who look like they're Christians but they're not. They have a cloak of decency. They have a cloak of decency. They have a cloak of spiritual piety but they have no inner life. They look real, but they are not. That is a very scary concept. False brethren. These people are not someone who came from the outside, some sort of hellish kind of cult that is luring away our young people, you know. Oh boy, we know who they are. No, the problem is you don't know who false Christians are. They just wear a cloak of decency and you just don't know what's going on really in their heart. But they aren't real. false brethren. Paul, by the way, I want you to know, doesn't call these legalistic people misguided, poorly taught. He calls them false, sham Christians. They're phony inside and out. The question that we have to face is this. Is it possible that we have false brethren in our midst? Here, Church of the Open Door, 1983, this very date. What is the date? It doesn't matter. Eight. Mother's Day. This Mother's Day made it relevant. Make your sermons relevant. Talk about Mother's Day. There's your Mother's Day sermon right there. Are there false brethren? Yes. Are there false brethren in our midst? The answer to that is this. Absolutely. Does that surprise you? Does that surprise you? It shouldn't surprise you. You know what ought to surprise us? What ought to surprise us is if there weren't false brethren in our midst. That's what ought to surprise us. The Apostle Paul says over and over again when he left the church in Ephesus, he says this, this one thing I know when I leave, grievous wolves will come in from among you, not from the outside, not from the outside, from among you who look just like sheep, but they're not. They wear a cloak of decency. They talk real spiritual, but there's no inner life. They're false, sham Christians. Do you think Paul stirred things up in churches when he went? Whew. Timothy had a terrible problem with this in fact he wrote to Timothy in 2 Timothy chapter 4 verses 3 and 5 he says listen Timothy the day will come when people will not stand for sound doctrine and deep teaching but will want to accumulate for themselves people who tell them cute little stories and you don't do that you stand firm in the word and you know the reason Timothy got tripped up because he wasn't ready for that he didn't realize that the enemy was going to come from the inside. And Paul had to tell them, you better be ready for that. You ought to be surprised if there aren't sham Christians. Our task, beloved, is to preach a gospel that is so clear that it comes down like a sword, dividing between what is real and what is false, revealing the sham from that which is external religion. And you know why that's so important? There's two reasons that's important. One reason that's important that we divide between what's real and false. The first reason that's important is for the sake of the body of Christ. because that which is false but it looks real is going to tear and devour and destroy the church. You'll see it happening all the time when attitudes come. You'll just see it. You'll just see it. And the other reason that we need to come down as hard as we can with clarity and power of the gospel that demands an internal life. The other reason that's so important is because the people who are sham Christians are going straight to hell. that person needs to be saved and whatever we can do to break through the delusion that they have that they are with their external piety whatever we have to do to do that we have to do it we have to do it we have to be real careful there are ways in which we have no power to do that one of the one of the you know the word of god even told us you know there's wheat and tears you know that that's just going to be a fact that's the way it's going to be what i don't want you to do is go into the field and start tearing everybody up because what you're going to do is if you go start doing that you're going to start tearing real stuff up with phony stuff you let me take care of that the scary thing about that passage is you know when god takes care of it at the judgment that's when and he takes the phony stuff and he burns it up the way i can confront this right now is appeal to you and say look into your heart are you wearing a cloak of decency or is it real have you met the savior are you regenerate are you reborn and i don't mean some sort of intellectual reborn but it is the life of god and you alive that's the first thing i want you to see false brethren powerful stuff who snuck in unawares who snuck in unawares another powerful stuff why is it because in the greek that little that little term snuck in unawares is in a passive and doesn't that just bless your heart it's in a passive oh that just that just knocked me out isn't that incredible no it doesn't do anything for you does it i want to tell you what that means when i see that that they who had snuck in unawares is in the passive and the only way you can get that is by getting into the language a little bit what that says is this it communicates this very strongly that the action of coming in and sneaking in unawares was an action that happened to them it was not necessarily an action that they had in their minds and said aha i've got a plan to destroy the real church didn't have that at all they were passive. The action was done outside them to them. They snuck in unawares. You know who was unaware of it? They were. They thought they were defending the faith. You know, this speaks to believers and to unbelievers. They were pawns. That's what they were. They were pawns of Satan. They were pawns of the enemy to move into the real church and destroy the real church. They were pawns. and they weren't necessarily even aware that they were doing it. They got used by the enemy. They just got used. Somebody was pulling their strings. Every assault they made on the Apostle Paul that they thought was just defending the faith was just, ah, Satan's going, great, keep it up, buddy. Keep it up. You're tearing the church apart. I love it. And they thought they were so spiritual. They were pawns. You know what? We're real familiar with this concept of being used. As Christians, we talk about that all the time. I want to be used to the Lord, right? I want to be used to the Lord. And many of us have had that sense of having been used to the Lord. And we say things like this. I didn't have anything to do with it. I just shared my faith. I felt the filling of the Spirit and I've been obedient to the Lord. And I tell you, it was incredible. God used me. Or God used you in some wonderful way. The way God uses you is real interesting. All it takes is the filling of the Spirit, the control of the Spirit on your life. And you may not even be aware of it, but if God's got control of your life, you are going to be used. You're going to be a pawn. It's wonderful. What a glory to be a pawn for Jesus. I'm not in control. I just keep my heart right before the Lord. I just keep loving Him and giving Him everything I've got and He just takes me like a pawn and pulls my strings. I don't mind that. You know what? When I move into a time in my life when I'm disobedient to the Lord and the Spirit does not have control over my life and bitterness begins to flow through me and into me and I hang on to it and I just decide I'm going to have my way and it's going to go my way and I harbor that negative attitude and I spread it to everybody else around me and I'm jealous of my brother and all that kind of stuff. You tell me who you're a pawn for. Don't tell me Jesus is using you. Or me. And I see it in me better than I see it in any of you. I know me better than I know you. I just know this. That when the Spirit of God does not have control of this guy right here I become a pawn of the enemy. all sorts of good intentions i want to tell you something when the spirit of god does not have control of your life you will become a pawn of the enemy to destroy our church guaranteed satan used them as pawns and again very possibly they had no plan in their mind to destroy the church that might not have been their intent no but you know what they were they were jealous petty people who did not have the spirit's control who because they did not have the spirit's control thus became handy tools for the enemy's use. And he still does it today. Enough about that. The third phrase I want to nail you with and share with you is this concept of spying out their liberty. They were false brethren who came in unawares. They were passively used of Satan to do this. And their function was this, to spy out their liberty. That simply means literally, they were looking at the message of liberty and they looked for a weak point in it. They looked for a weak point in it. They looked for a place where liberty didn't work. Okay? Here this guy is preaching liberty and freedom in Jesus. And I'm telling you, I'm going to find a way that doesn't work. And I'm just going to watch him. And I'm going to watch the people that that message affects. And as soon as they trip up, as soon as they fall into some kind of sin, I'm going to say, aha, liberty doesn't work. Look at that. They're just lascivious and they're just using their liberty as license to do whatever they want. Spying out the liberty. It's looking at the message of liberty and trying to find somewhere that it falls apart. you know what as we go through this book in Galatians we are going to discover I hope at a level you've never seen before the liberty you have in Christ I tell you when I get into this and I have the incredible privilege of studying the word of God all the time that's why I'm here studying, studying and bring it to you what a joy that is but I get excited when I look ahead in our study and I think about the things we're going to learn when you start thinking about your liberty in Christ you can't help but get excited. What a joy it is to discover how simple and how free the Christian life is when really there's only two dimensions of the whole Christian life. It's exciting. You know what it is? I could tell you two things and you'd be set to go. You know what they are? One, beloved, be filled with the Holy Spirit. Okay? Be controlled by the Holy Spirit. Second, that already taken care of, you're filled. Do whatever you want. go ahead fill with the spirit do whatever you want and you know what some people hear that and they go did you hear that he said do whatever you want to do he's telling them they can just live anywhere they want to live guess what that's exactly what it means to spy out their liberty I'm going to find a loophole in this yet he just said do whatever you want didn't hear didn't hear didn't hear listen this time be filled with the Holy Spirit you know what people who have never been filled with the holy spirit first of all people who are aren't christians don't understand that people who are christians but have never been controlled by the holy spirit don't understand that they have no idea at all what it means to be controlled by the holy spirit of god they've never been controlled by the holy spirit of god they've always been in control so for someone to say do whatever you please they got to go a little berserk they're just giving them liberty but to those of you who understand what it means to have the spirit of god control your thoughts and your attitude and and deliver you from your bitterness and the bondage of all that junk. You know what it's like to have the Holy Spirit control your life. And then you know what a liberty it is for someone to come along to you and say, be filled with the Holy Spirit. If you are, do whatever you please. Because if you are filled with the Holy Spirit, what you do is going to have, and who you are is going to be a deeply godly, holy life. Only it's going to be real holiness. It's going to be real godliness. It isn't going to be a cloak that you wear. it's going to come from within beloved Christian liberty is not licensed and I am very concerned that you hear that I preach freedom I will preach freedom till the day I die till the day I die and I even get comfort that very often people didn't understand Paul when he talked about freedom people got a little nervous and he always had to answer their questions do you mean that they can do anything they want he always addressed it Romans he addressed it in Galatians he's going to address it so I'm not even going to get into it now I'm very concerned though that we realize that liberty doesn't mean license I heard an illustration this week, it isn't mine but I just have to share it with you because I think it's one of the best illustrations that capsulize and capsules my whole concept of what freedom really is and too often we think of freedom as meaning just kind of flighty go off in any direction you want to go here's the thing good illustration you ever work on a mass problem? you're working on it And you know what? Until you find the truth, you're in bondage to that problem. You work and you strive. The scientist in the laboratory, you got it? He's trying to figure out this little thing and he's working and he's striving and he just doesn't fall together and all of a sudden, he's in bondage to that thing until he finds the truth, what the real formula is. He's in bondage to that thing and he works and he's thriving. Nothing works and all of a sudden, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. It comes together. He goes, Eureka! Ha! I got the answer. You know what? He's free. He's free. no more striving no more struggling I know the answer I know the formula it's right here wonderful liberty guess what God comes to you and to me and he says guess what friend human being you got a problem the problem is sin you know what sin has done for you it's made you separated from the one who made you and it's caused you to strive and strive and it's given you not only separation but it has planted in your heart the sense of shame it has planted and every person here feels it it has planted in your heart a sense of shame and it has planted in your being a sense of guilt and it has planted in your being a loss of value you feel worthless and you know what you do? that's the problem you feel shame you feel guilty you feel valueless and you know what you do? you strive and you work and you're in bondage to that problem how is it that I can get rid of this shame get rid of this guilt get rid of this sense of separation not only from God but from other people and I just work all my life trying to find things if I'm successful in my job I'll get rid of it if I'm successful in a marriage have lots of kids I'll get rid of it if I land the prettiest girl if I land the best looking guy I'll get rid of it I'll feel worthwhile I'll feel valuable and I work and I work and some people take the religious route and thinking they grow up in a church I'll carry my Bible I'll memorize scripture I'll serve on the board I'll go into the ministry somebody told me this week Somebody told me this week about listening to John MacArthur. I didn't hear this, but several people came to me and shared with me that one of the things they had was a testimony time. They had a baptismal service. And one of the testimonies was of a guy who had gone to Biola College. He had gone to seminary. He finished seminary. He went to work for Campus Crusade for Christ, won people for Christ, went into the ministry, and then you know what happened? He got saved. We work at the problem, and we work at the problem, and we sense our shame and guilt, and all these different things, and we try getting religious. And you know what the Bible says? The Bible says this, you shall know the truth, and what? The truth shall set you free. You know what? Your striving's not going to do it. Your cloak of decency isn't going to do it. Your memorizing scripture isn't going to do it. The only thing that can set you free from your struggle, from your shame, from your guilt, is looking into the face of Christ and saying, Jesus, I accept the gift. and I've ceased my striving and I am no longer separated I've been drawn near and I'm no longer guilty I've been forgiven and I'm no longer valueless I have infinite value he even gave me gifts I'm a new creature in Christ I'm not just a dirty old guy who's got my sin covered I'm a new creature I'm enjoying it with Christ freedom and then these Judaizers came along and said, that's not the whole answer. Do you know why Paul is so angry? Yes, Jesus is the answer. That's the little formula that sets you free. But that's not all. It's circumcision too. And you know what it did? It got them right back in the struggle. Got them right back in the struggle. They weren't free anymore. And Paul said, you've been cut from grace. You've been severed from Christ. Verse 5. Verse 5. but we did not yield in subjection to that phony message not even for an hour why so that the truth of the gospel might remain in you paul is so stubborn isn't he what a hardhead not really not really you know in first corinthians chapter 9 he says this i'll be all things all men i'll be all things to all men to the jew i'll be a jew to the greek i'll be a greek that i may win the more you know what there are some things that aren't worth fighting for and I'm going to take some things that I'd kind of like to do all things are lawful all things aren't profitable though and if I've got to lay some things down in terms of little dinky lifestyle things that we disagree about and put that aside so I can reach you I'll do it when it came to method Paul was flexible and he made concessions to weak Christians but I want to tell you something else to false Christians people who were wearing a cloak of decency but had no inner life he would not budge and neither will we why not because some things are worth fighting for the third point is simply this his commendation i don't even have time to go into it i'm not going to make any comment the commendation is simply this that after having heard the the gospel that paul preached the apostles took and gave him the right hand of fellowship and said buddy you are preaching the gospel go to it what about you are you real in jesus i don't know or are you a sham christian two reasons i would have you consider that this morning and deal with it first of all because if you're a sham christian one who looks like you are but you aren't and people around you are accepting you as one your influence on us is going to be negative there's no other influence you can have if you're not real none so I'm concerned that false Christians be exposed but there's another reason that it's important and that's for your own sake I don't know who is and who isn't don't even have any idea but one day that separation is going to be known and those who are wearing a cloak of decency but have never been regenerate who never did enter into a relationship with Christ, all they have is just a bunch of rules and codes and things that they observe that keep them secure and convince them that they're Christians, but they're not, are going to be gathered and burned. And that's a frightening thought to me. There may be others here this morning, though, and you may be saying with great confidence, you know, Dave, I know I'm not a false Christian. I know I'm real in Jesus. But you know what? you'd never know it. You'd never know it. I've been used as a pawn of Satan. I love the Lord, I do. My heart, I love the Lord. But the Spirit isn't controlling me. And I've been used to spread bitterness and negativism and... This morning I would just have the Spirit of God break you and I would invite you to come and let the Spirit of God take back what is His. You. If some of you need to deal with that this morning, I just have you come and we'll pray. This concludes the message on this cassette. If you would like further information...
