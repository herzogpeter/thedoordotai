Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. In Matthew's Gospel, the 13th chapter, beginning in the first verse, the Gospel writer indicates that it was when Jesus went out of the house and was sitting by the sea that a multitude gathered. It was a plethora of people. I'm sorry. We've got to pick on Jack for saying the word plethora in the announcements. So the multitude gathered, and he got into a boat because the multitude was so large, and he sat down in the boat with a multitude standing on the shore, at which point it says in Matthew 13, 3, that he began speaking many things to them in parables, as have we here at Open Door for the last several months in a series on the parables of Jesus, beginning as we did back in April. I don't know if you remember that, but spent most of the spring and all of the summer dealing with the parables of Jesus. Well, today, believe it or not, and I say that because this doesn't happen that often here at Open Door when we begin a series or end a series. Our study of the parables is coming to a close today. And next week, believe it or not, we're going to be bringing to conclusion this bigger theme within which we've had these sub-themes flowing for quite a long time. We're going to be bringing to conclusion this series we've been in for almost three years that we've been calling the way of the rabbi. It began in January 14th, 2007, almost three years ago. But that's not entirely true. This rabbi thing is not entirely going to be gone because the new series that we're going to be beginning in just a couple weeks is already being loosely referred to us behind the scenes kind of as the way of the rabbi according to Paul. We're going to go into Paul. And the way of the rabbi theme, in some ways loosely, will be connected to it still, because Paul, in Jesus' day, had a rabbi of his own. And we're going to find out that Paul was raised under the rabbi Gamaliel. And at one time in Paul's life, he took on the yoke of Gamaliel. And when Paul talks about being willing to suffer the loss of all things, one of the things that cost Paul in his life was when he, as a Talmud, a disciple of Gamaliel, saying, I will, that's the sacred vow, follow your way, Gamaliel, he turned and went to a different rabbi, and it cost him a lot, and the new rabbi he began to follow was this rabbi Jesus, and the teachings of Paul are the teachings of Jesus from Paul, and we're going to move into a series of sermons on the book of Colossians in just a couple of weeks, I'm very excited about that, as Steve is as well and just one of the things to kind of whet your appetite for that as we've considered Jesus in his humanity and in this way of the rabbi and it's kind of expanded our ideas and our vision of who Jesus is and we've fallen in love with him in some really new ways in Colossians especially at the beginning we're going to see visions of Jesus as transcendent and the cosmic Christ and we'll fall in love with him again and again and again. But next week, we need your help because next week we are going to look back on this series and we're going to remember where we've been in the series of the rabbi. And it's been a long time, almost three years, so there's a lot of stuff there. And the ways we've been formed, paradigms in your own mind that have shifted. And you don't remember even some of the ways you maybe have changed in your thinking and even in your living over the last three years until you kind of stop and think about it. James talks about people who receive the word implanted and by that they grow, but you don't always pay attention until you think about that. So spend a little time this week, if you can, to think about what are some of the ways I've really changed in terms of my thinking and in my living around Jesus and this way of the rabbi and bring some of those thoughts, bullet point kinds of things with you next week. We're going to have a way to be interactive, which is a little unusual and weird for me. I'm an old guy, and so how we're going to do that, I don't know. But it's going to be very exciting. And bring your phone. That's the only thing I guess I can tell you. So there. You'll be calling me and telling me things. And anyway. Let's pray as we go to the Word. And just kind of focus with me. Would you open up your heart wide to the Word and to the Spirit of God among us as we prepare ourselves for the table? Father I thank you for these journeys That we've been on and that we go on And how they're directed by your spirit Through your word And just as we spend even this week And next week Reflecting on the things we've Had our eyes open to Relative to who you are We're grateful And ask that you would continue to do that work among us Through your word by your spirit And even now as we enter into a time Of sitting at your feet And preparing our hearts for your table we pray your spirit's presence and power to move swiftly and sweetly among us in Jesus name amen well the word passion basically means at its root to be affected by something to be affected by something is where passion comes from and passion says Thomas Moore in his book care for the soul is the essential energy of the soul it's what drives us it's what fuels us it's at the core of every ambition and desire. So put it together, having been affected by something, I now pursue that something that has affected me with passion. Which actually brings me to the parable that we're gonna deal with today, this final parable in a series of parables found in Matthew 13, 44, where Jesus tells a parable that speaks to this dynamic. In fact, I'm calling it a parable of passion. Because in it, Jesus compares the kingdom of heaven in Matthew 13, 44 to a treasure that was hidden in a field which a man found and then he hid again. And from joy over it, and there's your passion, it was joy that stimulated all of this. He goes and sells all that he has to buy the fields. please keep in mind that selling everything he has sounds like great incentive. It sounds like a great sacrifice, but selling everything he has is being done for joy, for passion. In fact, as in Jesus' day, buried treasure was actually a fairly common thing, particularly in Palestine. There were no banks or public depositories where you could put valuables, and in Jesus' day, it wouldn't have been so much money like we think of dollar bills. It would have been valuables that you might have had, rubies and diamonds. If they would have had anything like that, or some precious heirloom in their home, a golden chalice or silver cup, that kind of thing. And so people would often take their valuables and hide them, sometimes literally bury them for safekeeping. Palestine was, in Jesus' day, a place of war, as it is today as well. So because of that, sometimes people would bury their valuables to keep them from invaders. But in a war, people die or are captured, taken captive by invaders and brought off to another country and sold then into slavery. So a lot of these treasures that were buried to keep them away from invaders were lost and forgotten. They were just left in some cases. Indeed, the historian Josephus records, and I quote, that the ground of Palestine was dotted with treasure, buried and forgotten. So a lot like a lot of the parables, Jesus is, in this parable, taking something very common to them, something very well known to them, to teach about and invite people into the kingdom of heaven, to give them a picture, to give them a taste of what the kingdom of heaven is like. And so he says, it's like a man who found a treasure hidden in a field. And so affected by this splendid find was he that one thought absorbs him. Indeed, it so controls him that he can no longer work undisturbed, undistracted by day, nor sleep undisturbed by night. This field must be mine. Sell everything I have? Big deal. Mere trinkets are they compared to this treasure I have found. I must find or purchase this field. So again, you really need to delve into this. The picture here is not one of agonizing relinquishment in selling everything he has. For in the finding of the treasure, joy has been kindled, passion has been born. Indeed, it is precisely the kind of passion that's embodied in the Apostle Paul. when in Philippians 3, verse 7, he says this. And I see this passage, it's kind of parallel. It's almost like Jesus says, the kingdom's like a treasure, and for joy, someone sells everything they have. This is like a testimony of someone who's found the treasure. Listen even to the language. When he says that whatever things were gained to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of the treasure, which is Christ. More than that, I count all things to be lost in view of or when compared to the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, but don't feel sorry for me, is the paraphrase here, because I count those things as rubbish. Mere trinkets are they compared to this that I have found, for I have found a treasure. Which, again, important, is not the language of agonizing relinquishment. It's not the language of someone who has responded in fear to a message that said, you better turn, because if you don't, you'll burn. It's not that snow. For this is a man who has found a treasure, who has discovered joy, a joy that has ignited passion in his spirit. And passion, says Thomas More, is the essential energy of the soul. It's what drives us. It's what fuels us. It's at the core of every ambition and desire, such that having been affected by something, And Brendan Manning, in that phrase, I just love, he speaks of people who have been seized by the power of a great affection. Having been affected by a great affection, you now pursue that thing that has seized your affections with passion. And Jesus in this parable is saying that the kingdom of heaven is like that. It's like finding a treasure. And Paul in Philippians 3 is saying, I have found the treasure. and while there are many things in this treasure chest that is consistent with the kingdom of God in fact in your mind if you can kind of picture a treasure chest kind of like you know a pirate's treasure chest and it's full of sparkly things and diamonds and rubies and wonderful things and in the kingdom of God there's these things like the forgiveness of sin and that's amazing and it makes you weep and there's the grace of God and access to God and there's the gifts of the spirit and it just keeps on going and going, but right in the middle of the treasure, that before you even see anything else, by far the brightest and the fairest and the purest treasure is Jesus. For Jesus is the sweetest name I know. For in him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins. The apostle Paul said that, and in him the fullness of the Godhead dwells in a bodily form, and in him we have been made complete, and the Apostle Paul said that. And in the book of Colossians that we're going to be going into in a few weeks, the Apostle Paul says this, and in him, that is Jesus, and by him and through him, all things were created, both in the heavens and on the earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities. All things have been created by him and for him. And I just give you that verse to give you a taste of where we're going to be going and the kinds of things we'll be experiencing about the transcendent Christ in the book of Colossians. But it isn't just Jesus who is the treasure for which I would suffer the loss of all things, says Paul. It's knowing Jesus. And while it may sound like I'm splitting hairs when I say that, I really believe that there's an important distinction to make in this relative to this. That this knowing Jesus, that is for Paul, this treasure for which I would suffer the loss of all things, that this knowing goes beyond the cognitive. In other words, the treasure for which I would suffer the loss of all things is not simply knowing the pertinent facts about Jesus. It's not simply knowing that Jesus died, that he lived, that he even rose. The treasure is not that I might know Christ lived and died and rose, though those are important things to know. The treasure is actually knowing the Christ who did. It's actually knowing intimately the Christ who lived and died and rose. The treasure is being in a constant place of life where I might learn more and more, and at deeper and deeper levels, to actually know the heart of the rabbi Jesus, to feel his touch, to recognize his voice, to experience time and again, his relentless tenderness and his amazing grace. The question as we come to the table is, do you know him? See, I think instinctively all of us know the difference between knowing about someone and actually knowing them. And I think we also know the difference it makes when you know someone. I mean, we have impressions of people. And sometimes you have a good impression, especially if it's at some sort of a distance. and sometimes you have a bad impression, same way, because of the fact that you don't know them. But often when you get to know them, that impression changes. And this person you thought from a distance was a jerk, when you actually get to know them, you find out they really are a jerk. Anyway, they really are. You know what I'm talking about. And indeed, the Greek word for knowing, actually, when Paul talks about it in Philippians 3, has as its root the Hebrew word yadah, and what it means is union of love, which speaks obviously to intimate knowing. This is the same word. The Hebrew word is used in Genesis when it says that Adam knew his wife, and they bore a son. It's obviously intimate knowing. In Amos 3, verse 2, God, through the prophet, says, Amos, or Israel, only have I known, which doesn't mean that God wasn't cognitively aware of anyone else's existence on the planet. When he says, Israel, only have I known, it's speaking of intimate knowing. John 10 says, my sheep hear my voice, and they know me. They recognize my voice. That's about knowing, intimate knowing. Jesus to Peter, after Peter's denial, after Jesus' resurrection, one question, three times, Peter, do you love me? Do you love me? Maybe I'm being goofy, but he didn't ask him, Peter, do you know all the pertinent facts about me? Can you recite to me the Sermon on the Mount? I think Peter might have been able to, but it would have been because he loved it. That's why I remember your words, because I love you. This is the language of knowing. Indeed, there is throughout all of Scripture, this language. I've referred to it in the past. I call it this language of knowing. And sometimes it speaks of how we can know God through Christ, but also of how God knows us as well. And I want you to listen for this language of knowing as God speaks through the prophet Isaiah to you and to me through these words. And I want you to use these words even to begin to stir your heart and open your heart for our time around the table in just a few moments. Isaiah 43, verse 1. Hear the word of the Lord to you. Do not be afraid. For I have redeemed you. I have called you by name. I know your name. Some of you are going, no, he doesn't. Yes, he does. I know your name and you are mine. For the mountains may indeed depart and the hills may indeed be shaken. And in your life, they may be shaking right now. But my loving kindness will never be removed from you and my covenant of peace with you will never be shaken. Whatever else that means or whatever else it touches, it is the language of knowing. It's the language of love. You see, there is a kind of knowing that goes beyond dry knowledge of pertinent facts, a knowing that plunges us into mystery and beyond that Henry Nouwen refers to as stimulating for him radical amazement. Brennan Manning actually says it this way, and I love this quote. He says this, When the night is bad and my nerves are shattered and infinity speaks, when God the Almighty shares through his son Jesus the depth of his feelings for me, when his love flashes into my soul and I'm overtaken by mystery, it's time to decide. Shivering in the rags of my 59 years, I have to decide either to escape back into skepticism and intellectualism or to, with radical amazement, surrender in faith to the fact that I am loved by God. And that is the treasure for which Paul says, I would suffer the loss of all things. Frederick Buechner says it this way, my favorite quote, I've used it many times, repent and believe that the gospel is true. It's true. Turn around and believe that the good news, that we are loved by God, is better than we have ever dared hope, and that to believe in this good news, to live out of it, to be in love with it, and the author of it, is of all glad things in this world the gladdest thing of all. And that is the treasure for which I would suffer the loss of all things. And again, it raises this question. Do you know him? that way. John, the disciple that Jesus loved, and I love this, the reason we know that John is the disciple that Jesus loved is because John told us in his gospel, John, yeah, it's so funny. I guess not that funny. John knew him. John knew that Jesus was God. In fact, in his gospel, speaking of Jesus, John says, the word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory. Glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. John was fully aware that Jesus was more than a man. He was fully man and fully God. But he was not intimidated. He was not afraid to lean back on Jesus' breast, to hear his beating heart. To John, Jesus was not a hooded mystic, abstracted by heavenly visions, to John, Jesus was God, and Jesus was Messiah, but see, John knew him, and that kind of made a difference, and because he knew him, he leaned into him, he came close to him, instinctively went toward him. Mary Magdalene, she was called that because she was from a town called Magdala. She knew Jesus too. And maybe if anyone should have been intimidated by someone who was a holy man, even God in flesh, it should have been her, thought by many, was she to be a prostitute. The scene I have in my mind is after the death of Christ, it was Mary and Martha, the women who saw the tomb first. They come to the tomb. It's empty, but they aren't rejoicing. They're frightened. They're despondent because their way of thinking is simply this. He's not only dead, the body's been stolen. It just couldn't be worse. But then she hears this voice. And she runs to him. And the Bible says she clings to him. Why? Because she knew him. She knew him. And when you know him, that's what you do. You go this way. You go toward him. One of my favorites on this is actually Peter, because Peter knew him too. Peter, the denier of Jesus, the failure as a friend, the coward before the servant girl, I'm going fishing. And the disciples joined him in John 21. They fished all night. They caught no fish. And then they heard this voice. And it was in this place of the day where they'd been up all night, and now it's beginning to be light, so they can't quite make out this figure that they see coming at them. but they hear the voice say, cast your nets on the other side. And when they did, their nets were full. Who is this guy? And then verse seven, the disciple that Jesus loved, John, again, identifying himself that way, says to Peter, and I think he said this to Peter because of all the guys in the boat who needed to know who this guy was, it was Peter, because of his failure. John says, Peter, it's the Lord. And so when Peter heard that it was the Lord, it says that he put on his outer garment and threw himself into the sea as fast as he could swim to get to Jesus. And what strikes me about that scene, obviously, I think you're probably ahead of me, and that is this, that though Peter did in fact deny him and desert him and fail him as a friend, Peter wasn't afraid of him. Why? Because he knew him. And so he ran to him. This might sound weird, and maybe it's an errant thought, but I think of Judas, who never did run to Jesus after his betrayal and failure as a friend. Pretty big, both of those failures, Peter's and Judas's. But he didn't run to Jesus. Maybe he didn't know he could. Maybe he didn't know Jesus, which is weird and really doesn't hold much water because Judas, just like Peter, had been with Jesus for three years and had heard his teaching and seen his life. But I wonder if Judas knew that he too could have run to Jesus on his worst day in the middle of his worst failure. horrible sin. And when I think of that, I just wonder about, I hear kind of this echo in my mind. I hear the words of Frederick Buechner again, this time being directed to Judas, or maybe some Judases among us. And the word would be Judas, repent and believe that the gospel's true. Turn around and believe that the good news that you are loved by God, even now in this horrible place you are in, that you have actually made for yourself, is better than you have ever dared hope. And that to believe in that good news and to put your trust in that good news is of all glad things in this world, the gladdest thing of all. Oh, Judas, believe it. Can you receive it? He never did. He ran not toward Jesus. He ran away, which makes me wonder if he knew him. Because if you knew Jesus, you'd run toward him on your worst day. A couple questions as I close. Most obvious would be this. Do you know him? Do you know him enough to know that you can come toward him? today. That you can come even to his table. It's been said just for you. All of it was for you. Because for some of you, that's what you need to remember, that you can come. And if you don't know him, here's my question for you. Would you like to? Then open wide your heart. right here, right now, and invite him in. Ask him in. Because God is here, you guys. We really believe that. The power, the presence of his spirit is here. And he responds to people who don't even fully know what they're saying when they say, I want your life in me. Open wide your heart. You can know. He is knowable. because for some of you like Henry now and it really is time to decide either to escape back into skepticism and intellectualism or maybe with radical amazement surrender in faith to the fact that you are loved by God and that beloved is the treasure for which Paul said he would suffer the loss of all things and so we pray Holy Spirit come would you pray with me now you can close your eyes if you want to but you don't have to what I care about is that we not just me I'm going to pray that we right now would have a spirit of prayer something you can feel in your heart and words might come to your mind your eyes are open your eyes are closed here's what we pray Holy Spirit come and even And as I say that, Spirit of God, we know you're here, but we're inviting you here. And we know of your presence, but we really desire, as we come round this table, we really desire manifested presence. And pray that you would reveal yourself to someone who are having a hard time seeing you and hearing you. Lord, I think of that story in the book of Acts when Peter was preaching that God opened the heart of Lydia to believe. And I pray, God, that you would move by your spirit among some of us that way, that you would open the hearts of some to believe and they would notice that they see and that they hear. I pray too, Lord, that by your spirit among us, as I think of all the different people here coming from so many different circumstances of life with so many different needs, that you would come with the dancing hands of God and distribute your gifts to us. There are some who need gifts of healing in their body, in their spirits, in their mind. Holy Spirit, come with gifts of healing and reconciliation. Reconciliation may be to you. Gifts of revelation as well. Come make blind eyes see. Deaf ears here, as we gather around your table, we pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Let's continue in this time of silence and prayer as I invite the communion stewards and prayer team to come forward. Thank you. so do you know him do you really know him you can he's here and he invites you to come today in just a moment there's going to be a number of things that happen in this room there's going to be a time of worship and we invite you into that celebration of truth. The cross is up front and it's available to you if you'd like to come and just kneel and pray. The communion stewards that are up front are going to take their places at different stations around the room and you're welcome when you're ready to receive communion to go to any of those stations and the first person will hand you a cracker and say a few words to you and you'll take that and you'll dip it in the cup and that person will say a few words to you and then you can partake it as you wish. If you have a child with you, you can ask them to bless your child if they're not old enough, in your opinion, to take communion. We also want you to know that this weekend, there's a prayer team, and they're going to be down front, and they're here to pray with you for any reason that you'd like to be prayed for.
