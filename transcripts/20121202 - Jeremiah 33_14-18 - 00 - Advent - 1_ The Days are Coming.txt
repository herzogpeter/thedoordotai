Music Hi, Rita Gantos. My name is Gabe. My name is Sawyer. Hi, my name's Glenn. Hi, my name's Judd. Hi, I'm Chrissy. And I'm Murray. We'll be doing the first Advent reading and lighting the candle this week. As I read the scripture to you, then I'll say, this is the word of the Lord. And then you will all say, thanks be to God. Today's reading is from Jeremiah 33, 14 through 16. The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I'll fulfill the good promise I made to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah. In those days, and at that time, I'll make a righteous branch sprout from David's line. He will do what is just and right in the land. In those days, Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will live in safety. This is the name by which it will be called, the Lord, our righteous Savior. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. All right, Gynthers, let's hear it for the Gynthers. Amazing family. Yes. Hey, welcome to Open Door. My name is Steve. I'm the associate senior pastor here. And you made it. You made it through the fog. Yes. I'm so grateful to see you all are alive and even made it into your parking spot. It's great. We are entering into the first week of Advent this weekend. and Advent is the beginning of the Christian calendar. Many of you don't even know that there is a calendar that Christians worldwide follow and it starts with Advent which speaks to our longing for the arrival of Jesus to come into our world and then the calendar moves to Christmas where we celebrate the arrival and to Epiphany where we recognize that Jesus really is the light of the world. And then we move to Lent, 40 days, where we repent of our sins. And we look to Easter, resurrection, where we celebrate the forgiveness of our sins. And then it moves to Pentecost, where Jesus sends his spirit out to the church so that the church can be the light of the world. And then we move again to Advent, where we remember that Jesus still needs to come into our broken world. So Advent speaks to longing. And what I want to do today is simply to teach you two prayers to pray during Advent. Two prayers, I think, that speak to our longing for Jesus to come into our world. And the first prayer can be evidenced by this deal that my wife and I experienced with our kids just a couple of weeks ago. Now we have three kids ages five and under, so a lot of chaos in our house. A lot of moments where we're hanging on for dear life, but this was not one of those moments. We were at French Park, kind of hiking in the woods, and the kids were up in front grabbing sticks and shooting each other. It was beautiful and brilliant. Three boys, what are you gonna do? And then Mary looked at me and she said, honey, this is it. This is one of those moments. And I knew exactly what she meant because there we all were, all five of us together, celebrating each other, laughing about life. And on that, during that afternoon, my son Isaac finally lost his first tooth. And this is a picture of Isaac post-losing his first tooth. But Isaac is a little cautious sometimes, and so he waited for this tooth to be dangling from one thread. And on this walk through the woods, he said, Dad, I think it's time. Could you take it out? So I reached in there, took out his tooth, and we kept it in a little Ziploc bag until that night when the tooth fairy came, and it was really, really beautiful. It was a season, just for a moment, where all was right with the world. And in those moments, we pray a very simple prayer. Thank you. You know these moments. And they hit you many times with surprise, where you go, oh, thank you, God, for what you have done in my life that I didn't deserve. you drive through the Starbucks line and the barista tells you oh someone's paid for your drink and you go what? thank you you get the phone call back from the doctor and it's good news instead of bad news and what springs out of your heart is a thank you your kid who's been estranged from you for a long time makes the phone call you see on the caller ID that it's her and you just go, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. That's the first prayer that we're taught to pray during Advent. When something that you didn't even know you were longing for, maybe, comes and I mean, tears come to your eyes and thank you comes to your lips. There's another prayer and maybe it's a more common prayer that we pray during the season of Advent. And this is evidenced by this picture that I saw on the news. Many of us saw it, but it absolutely broke my heart to the point where I had to just shut my laptop. This is a Palestinian man, young man, holding his 11-month-old son in his arms who had been killed because of a rocket blast in Gaza. And as you look at that picture, no matter where you fall on the political spectrum, we can all agree that that represents life not as it should be. And I thought about this guy, and I thought he's never going to experience a moment like I had with my son where I pulled out his first tooth. That's not going to happen for him. And sometimes when I think of these kinds of things that happen around the world, it literally brings up a feeling that's so overwhelming to me that I immediately, I have to push it out and go do something else to distract me from it. But I think during Advent it's a time to remind us not to push it away too quick. We see a picture like that and we're invited to pray the second prayer of Advent, the more common prayer. And that prayer is, Come Lord Jesus. This is the prayer you pray when you get the bad news that you were hoping not to get. This is the prayer you pray when something unexpected happens, which is not at all what you wanted, and yet, come Lord Jesus, is the only thing you can spit out. Have you ever been in that moment where come Lord Jesus is just about the only? I mean, you don't even know how to pray other than to pray something desperate like come Lord Jesus. The psalmist in Psalm 13 prays this kind of a prayer when he writes this. And I love the poignancy and the urgency, the longing and the honesty of these words found in the scriptures. Psalm 13 verses one and two. How long, Lord, will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? How long must I wrestle with my thoughts day after day and have sorrow in my heart? And so if you are new to the church and you're wondering, can I bring what's real to God? All you have to do is to look in the scriptures to see that the God of the universe, the God who comes really does want you to be honest, especially in this season, with what really is. And during Christmas especially, because I think our longing for what should be gets especially piqued with some of the false joy of the season, we feel our longing even more desperately. Last week after the service, I was kind of on my way out, and then someone sort of shouted, Steve! Across the auditorium. So I went and talked to this guy and I said, hey man, how's it going? And he said these beautiful words. He said, not good. Because how many times do we go, how's it going? It's going great. How about you? It's going great. How about you? It's going awesome. How about you? Kids are great. Good. Kids are great. Good. And you know, it's like, ah, it's so exhausting. And part of the reason why we answer it's good is because we have that moment in ourselves where we go, do you really want to know? Because it's not going well. And I don't have the time or the energy to even tell you how much it's not going well, because it's 10.59 and I have to go. But I love this guy. I just said, man, it's not going well. My job's not going well. And I don't really know what to do. And I looked at him and I just said, I'm so sorry. And that's what you say. This season, Christmas time, with all the hustle and bustle and busy, I think the longing in us for what really should be is almost the same as that overwhelming feeling that I get when I open up the laptop and see a picture like I showed you earlier. It piques something in us that says something is not right. And during Christmas, I read this blog this week from this pastor in Denver. Her name is Kathy Escobar. And she said, during this time of the year, many churches are like, Woo! Celebrating Christmas. We had a big Christmas service coming. Everyone coming? Yeah, let's do it. All right. And she goes, my congregation is more like this. Here's what we're struggling with. We're struggling with the fact that we aren't where we wish we were. Anyone in the house like that, like spiritually? Oh, I thought I'd be so much further along than I am now. and here I am stumbling over the same things that I continue to be stumbling with. I'm still there. I'm still stumbling. It's horrible. God's way out there. How long, oh Lord? How's it going? Fine. We aren't where we wish we should be. We feel alone. I think in this season more than ever, we're surrounded by people at parties and dinner tables, and there's so much excess, and we feel like no one knows our story. No one really knows it. And then Kathy, you know, she writes this. I love the third one, which I think is much more diplomatic than it really actually is. Our families are, hmm, tricky. Now, if you're among the 1% of the people who actually, you know, getting together with my extended family is awesome. I mean, it is great. Everyone loves us well. No one says a kind word. No one gets drunk. I mean, it's really, really sweet and awesome. but if you're part of the 99% of the rest of us that maybe have to deal with getting together around the extended family table, and it's actually hurtful, then Christmas time and the holidays is a time to pray, come Lord Jesus. And you might have a new prayer now as you're driving to that family gathering. Oh, come Lord Jesus, please. We want more connection with God, but we aren't sure how to get it anymore. I mean, can we just be honest? Can we just be honest that Christmas brings that up? And many times we get to the 25th and we have the same feeling. Oh, I thought this Christmas season I was going to use it to really connect with God. I mean, the Advent, I'm going to do Advent this year. And then 25th, oh, we want to connect with God, but we don't know how. And that last one, I had to read it several times, that we speak about hope during Christmas. But if we're honest, hoping is a very vulnerable thing, isn't it? To actually hope that something might be made right that isn't right right now. It's so much easier to numb out and just say, it's never going to happen, so I'm just going to go toward whatever it is that's going to make me feel okay in the moment. Because hoping takes a tremendous amount of courage. And we're scared of that kind of hope. So we look to the Psalms, and this psalmist says in Psalm 130, verse 5, I love the honesty and the courage of this prayer. I mean, this might need to be on some of your refrigerators or your smartphone screen so that you see it a lot. But the psalmist writes this, I wait for the Lord. My whole being waits. And in His word I put my hope. That's a come Lord Jesus prayer. That's a I'm not going to medicate my prolonged desire which has felt hopeless by moving to something that just isn't going to satisfy anyway. This psalmist writes this, my whole being waits. It's a kind of aggressive, courageous, and vulnerable person that can pray that kind of prayer. My whole being waits. And in his word I put my hope. So question, what is this word in which we put our hope? Well, it's what Murray read just a few minutes earlier from Jeremiah 33 verses 14 and 16. And we read these four words, these four words on which we pin our hope. The days are coming. The days are coming. It's not now, but it will be, declares the Lord, when I will fulfill the good promise that I made to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah. Here's the promise. In those days and at that time, I will make a righteous branch, sprout from David's line. In the family tree of David, there's gonna be a king that's gonna come and he will do what is just and right in the land. And in those days, Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. And at the time in which Jeremiah said those things, Jerusalem was laying in ruins on the ground. The gates had been burned. The temple had been destroyed. The city was lying in ruins. So to hear this, the day will come when Jerusalem will live in safety, must have felt like, well, when is that day going to come, Lord? How long? And this is the name by which the city will be called. The Lord, our righteous Savior. Now, question. What would it look like for a community of people with invisible boundaries, a citizenship of people that said, my hope is that the Lord really is coming to make all things new. In my life and in the world, that's where I'm putting my hope. I'm a citizen of that invisible kingdom where there is a king that's sitting on the throne and that king's name is righteousness, the one who brings justice and rightness to our crazy, disordered, chaotic heart and our crazy, disordered, chaotic world. There is a king who is coming to make all things new, and that is the king in whom I'm putting my hope. What would it look like for the church during Advent to stand up really straight and really alert and look for the moments that the Lord is coming into our world right now, breaking through the darkness and bringing light where there is chaos and darkness? What would it look like? Friends, we are citizens of that city. We already are. That is our true home. That city is our true home. That's where we hold citizenship. And so every time a citizen of that kingdom prays the prayer, come Lord Jesus, the boundaries of that city expand. Every time, every time you turn toward Jesus to be the light of the world where otherwise there is darkness, every time you say, I'm not gonna put my trust in things that can't bring light, I'm gonna put my trust in the only one who can, the boundaries of that city really do expand. It's invisible, we can't see it, but it's happening. So come, Lord Jesus, we pray. in Isaiah 9 verse 2 we read this the people walking in darkness have seen a great light on those living in the land of deep darkness desperation and hopelessness here's the good news church lift up your heads because a light has dawned and his name is the righteous Savior, Jesus. And it's a beautiful kingdom. Into our dark world it comes, silently and obscurely as a baby at first, in poverty and in seclusion. But the light grows until one day it will expand to every single square inch of this planet. when our Jesus will really reign. And so right now in the season of Advent, the invitation is to live as citizens of that kingdom right here and right now. And in really small ways, bring that light to your world. Buy CityKid Java coffee. Buy that kind of coffee. Instead of buying another kind of coffee, buy CityKid Java coffee, knowing that you're gonna help people that are living in poverty right here in our city. That's a little way that you can do it. Go to the global marketplace today and buy some items for yourself, buy some stuff for your friends, knowing that the actual people who actually made those things were saved from human trafficking and cycles of poverty. And you are making a difference by just buying gifts. I mean, that's a tiny little way. Go to the tree. that's right over there in the gathering place. Race out there so you can be one of the last few people to actually get a need met and meet the need. Go to the Next Steps kiosk after the service. The wall is filled with ideas for you to take a next step, a small step, toward being the light of the world this Christmas season. There's a little half sheet that you can take that Jen talked about, about tangible ways of celebrating the king who really is coming and being the light of the world and expanding the boundaries of this city. During Advent, here's just four ways, five ways. It's expanded. For you to enter into Advent, Bonnie Johnson and her daughter-in-law Annika are going to be leading an Advent retreat on an upcoming Saturday. Check it out online for the details. It's a Saturday morning, a few hours, where you can just come together with other people to breathe and hear scriptures read and hear reflections about Jesus, the coming King. There's a daily Advent reflection. If you sign up for it, go on to our website, thedoor.org. Click on your door, and then you'll get directed to a way in which you can sign up, and you'll get daily emails, Monday through Friday, that speak to subjects of Advent. If you go to our bookstore, there's a little pamphlet that you can go week by week. I'm doing this at home with myself. Just a little pamphlet week by week with the scriptures that Christians all around the world are reading during Advent. And there's a little CD you can buy that's beautiful instrumental music that just is filled with longing. You can buy that CD in our bookstore. Go to the Global Marketplace. We've talked about that. And then get involved with Christmas serve, some of the ways in which Jen has talked about. These are all just, you guys, as we're waiting and as we're longing and as we're even feeling our own come Lord Jesus moments, I think one of the great ways to just move into the spirit of the season is just to say, I'm gonna do one thing. Don't do 50 things, please. Some of you type A people, all right, I'm gonna do Christmas serve, I'm gonna race, I'm gonna do the global marketplace, I'm gonna grab a thing, I'm gonna get City Kid Java, and then do one thing, maybe two. And as you're moving through your moments this week and this month, and a gift hits you right in the face, your prayer is, thank you. And as you're moving through your moments during these next four weeks, And a moment of hopelessness and fear and desperation comes. Your prayer is. So come, Lord Jesus, into our life, into our moments, and into our community. Come and be the light of the world because we need you so badly. Come and save us from our sins. Come and deliver us out of darkness and into light. And as we come around your table now, God, build a unity in our church that is centered around the fact that you are our only hope and you really are coming into our world and into our lives. In your name, amen.
