James chapter 3, verses 2 through 12. We are entering today our sixth week. This is also our final week. We're going to kind of just pull our thoughts together, put a little capstone on this thing. A series of sermons that I have entitled, The Taming of the Tongue. And all of it's been born out of these 11 verses, verses 2 to 12. In this series, we have been examining the power of the tongue to do, among other things, three things. Number one, it's power to set the course of a life into life or death. Number two, the power of the tongue to damage people. Number three, the power of the tongue to reveal what's at our core, literally, to reveal where it is we leak flammable fuel. Now, that analogy of flammable fuel was drawn from verse 6 of chapter 3, where James likens the damage that a tongue can do to a fire. A fire that is ignited by hell itself. The role of hell we have discovered over these weeks is simply this, to light the match. A match that quite frankly has very little power to do much damage at all unless that little tiny match finds the leaking built up fuel of my spirit. At that point, a fire is ignited and if that fire engages my tongue, with my tongue damage will be done. And with that understood, the question we've been asking for the last couple of weeks has been this. From where do we leak flammable fuel? Two of the most common areas we have identified are these. Number one, hurt. That is specifically the kind of hurt that is incurred when we don't get what we want, when someone says no to us. The second kind of hurt that causes us to leak flammable fuel is historic hurt, Far beyond the pain or frustration of a thwarted agenda, we began to deal here with deep wounds of the soul unhealed. Our thesis around this was simply this, that unhealed wounds poison the heart. And a poisoned heart poisons the tongue. You may be redeemed, love God from your toes, a wonderful person in many respects, but if you have unhealed wounds, You will from that wounded place, wound. You will from that hurt place, hurt. You will from that place you have been sinned against, sin against. Step number one, therefore, to the taming of the tongue is the healing of the heart. And we spent some significant time on that. And I think some incredible ministry came around that. Today, as we just wrap our thoughts up in this series, I'd like to introduce to you what I believe is another key element to the taming of the tongue. It is simply this, on a very practical level, our need not only to have healing in our heart, but our need to submit to the bit. In fact, I've entitled the sermon, Submit to the Bit. The principle is powerful. The picture is graphic. It is revealed in the text in both verses 2 and 3. It speaks to the fact that while healing grace is critical to the taming of the tongue, so also is spiritual discipline. Verse 2 speaks of a need for a bridle, a bridle that covers the whole body. Verse 3 speaks of a bit in a horse's mouth. Let's read this. Now if we put the bits into the horse's mouths so that they may obey us, we direct their entire body as well. From that, the call is this. Submit, therefore, to the bit. The picture is that of a horse. I picture a big one. I picture a strong one in fact you can have any kind of horse you want but here I'm going to share with you mine it is big, it is black, it is beautiful it is shining and powerful proud, prancing, snorting someone said to me last night that the picture I was painting of a horse was in their mind like a war horse maybe it's a magnificent animal it is the embodiment of two qualities many of us greatly admire and many of us greatly desire, this animal, magnificent in its physical presence, embodies power and independence. This horse is the leader of the pack. This horse is the corporate head. This horse cuts you no slack. This horse is the I don't need anybody but me, American dream horse. If I were a horse, the kind of horse I'd want to be is this kind of horse, of course. Mr. Ed, anyway however while this horse is indeed resplendent in beauty impressive in stature intimidating in its power here is the truth about this horse it is absolutely useless until it submits to the bit it will never win a race it will never plow a field if it is a war horse it will never effectively move into battle it will never fulfill its purpose as a horse until it submits to the bit it might prance in the field it might be able to draw a crowd it might cause people to go oh and ah it might intimidate people want to might want to take pictures of it but until it submits to the bit it cannot be written it cannot be used it cannot fully function and it will never be safe Jesus said it this way in Matthew chapter 5 blessed are the meek the Greek word for meek many of you know because of our study in the Beatitudes is praos and if you're like me the impression we have of meekness is weakness the problem with praos is that praos Meek does not mean weak. Literally, it refers to a condition where all of your personal power is intact, but under control. Indeed, in classical Greek, the word praos was a word that was commonly used in reference to the taming of wild animals. When a wild horse was broken, when a wild horse was trained, it was referred to as now being praos, being meek. That does not mean this horse turned into a spineless pile of mush, which is often our image of what meekness looks like. All of its power is still there. But now, having received the discipline of the bit, its power is under the control of the master. And now this incredibly magnificent animal is useful for whatever the task might be. It is functional and this animal is safe. I don't know a lot about breaking a horse. I mean, I grew up in the south side of Chicago. That's not one of the things I did a lot. Most of what I know about breaking a horse I learned from Roy Rogers on Saturday morning. But I do know, in my limited knowledge of what it looks like to break a horse, that somewhere along the line, a saddle is involved. They kind of had to put a saddle on the horse. I'm not even sure if that's the first thing or the tenth thing, or if that's even irrelevant. Every time I saw them break a horse, they had to put a saddle on the horse. Somewhere along the line, this animal has got to allow itself to be ridden. Spiritually, I think you're making some of the connections that is true as well. Somewhere along the line, this proud, magnificent animal called the human being, very full of himself, incredibly full of herself, and living in a culture that tells you that that's where your fulfillment's going to be by coming more in tune with your personal power. Absolutely useless till you submit to the bit. Somewhere along the line, the human animal is going to have to allow itself to be ridden. The saddle needs to be put in place. Somewhere along the line, men and women, if they're going to, I believe, experience the fullness indeed of their humanity made in the image of God in right relationship to that God needs to come to a place where they yield to the life of God, the supremacy of Christ, the power of the Holy Spirit. somewhere along the line they need to allow themselves to wear the saddle they need to allow themselves to be ridden but leave the picture right there just kind of with the saddle on it this is all I know somewhere along the line a saddle has to be on it and say the horse comes to a point where they're willing to be ridden and the saddle is on there and the guy is riding it if I'm a horse he's in the saddle God's in the saddle what dawns on me about this picture is that a saddle is not enough in fact a saddle quite frankly in the breaking of a horse the riding of the animal isn't much in fact as I think about it and I see this horse not with a saddle not with a rider maybe the metaphor here is that they just became a Christian a saddle in fact has more to do with the comfort of the rider than it has to do with the function of the horse. Picture it. It might have some guy sitting in the saddle. That's really good. You're making some progress, but you're not going anywhere. Until the rider picks up those reins, reins that are connected to a bit, a bit that has been inserted into that most vital of places, the mouth wherein resides the tongue, and all of James' talk is revolving around the power of the tongue, bridled to affect the whole body as well. All of that's in verse 3. Until that happens, this horse is going nowhere. To tame the tongue, the tongue which directs the entire body as well, requires two things. For several weeks we talked about what is required being the healing of the heart. I'm here to cap this off by adding this. It also requires submitting to the bit. A little point of clarification. A bit is not a muzzle. Now the reason I bring that up is because earlier in our series we heard David in the Proverbs say this, I will guard my mouth as with a muzzle. And we indicated that there are indeed critical moments of high explosive emotional potential that I need to take that advice and wear a muzzle. But also early on in our series, we indicated that just the wearing of a muzzle is not the kind of control of the tongue that we're talking about releasing God's people into consistently experience. We're not calling you to a muzzle. See, the purpose of a muzzle is to silence. Absolutely silence. There are times a muzzle is appropriate. The problem with a muzzle, however, if that's your mode of operation, is that sometimes, by God, we are called to speak. Into difficult circumstances, speak even hard words. Sometimes, to remain silent, because I'm wearing a muzzle and thinking that's a godly response, sometimes to remain silent is the sin. The purpose of a bit in the mouth, the discipline of the bit, is not to silence you. It's to control you. Thomas Akempis, in his book, The Imitation of Christ, said this. It is easier to be silent altogether than to speak with moderation. That's incredibly true. Control, not silence, is the key to the discipline of the bit. Ecclesiastes 3.7 says this There is a time to keep silent And there is a time to speak Proverbs 25.11 says Words fitly chosen at the right moment Are like apples of gold and settings of silver Here's the deal If we are silent when we should speak We are not under the discipline of the bid And by the way as we're talking about this whole dynamic of control of the tongue over six weeks, some of us have assumed that we are kind of living under the discipline of this silence and control of the tongue. But the truth is for some of you, your silence is what you hide behind, not the proliferation of words, which is what some of us hide behind and control people with. Some of you have incredible control with your silence. If you are silent when you should speak, your tongue is not tamed if you continually speak when you should be silent you are not under the discipline of the bit either your tongue has not been tamed either this is not an easy place to walk it calls for balance it calls for the working of the spirit it calls for maturity it calls for discipline maybe the best picture best illustration of this truth is embodied in Jesus himself at his trial. One of the impressions I think that many of us have of Jesus at his trial is that he was silent. And one of the reasons for that is that there were parts of his trial where he was. And those places are so amazing because many of us in the same circumstance would be defending ourselves and running off of the mouth that we get, that they're highlighted. We talk about those silent times in his trial all the time. So much so that we get the impression he was silent the whole time. He was not. He spoke a lot at his trial. He explained his mission to the Sanhedrin. He defined or defended rather his actions and he rebuked the entire Sanhedrin. What he did not do at his trial was this. He did not answer fools. He did not fall into verbal traps when baited. He did not revile when he was being reviled. And being reviled, 1 Peter 1.23, he reviled not again. When he was being cursed, he didn't curse back. He did not threaten or try to control. He did not use words to manage their impression, to somehow change their mind. He did not walk away into the cross running off the mouth, if I could only explain. There were some profound times in which his tongue was absolutely silent, didn't defend himself. It's an incredible picture to me. When being cursed, he cursed not again. And I picture myself being in a place, in a context where somebody is to my face reviling me offending me and the run of words, whoosh, I'm pretty verbal, that come to my mind and you got those words, I got better words. This guy, a little disrespect, God, Jesus, Jesus is God. I mean, I don't know what else he's got, but being God, I kind of have this impression he's got this incredible lexicon of words in his brain. He could have ripped them to shreds verbally. he was not entirely silent there were times he spoke there were times he didn't a bridled tongue is not a muzzled mouth control not silence is the key now with all of that kind of understood or at least somewhat understood we're kind of wading into this i want to back up just a bit even even into the study we've been doing the last few weeks because i i i just become aware that it could be right about now, some of us are getting a little frustrated and even confused. You've been in on this series for a few weeks, and in the previous weeks, you began to get the impression, as we dealt especially with the healing of the heart and the need to see healing there for the tongue to ever be tamed, you began to get the impression that if you experienced healing in your heart, the tongue would then be automatic. The fact is this, some of you over the last couple of weeks may have experienced some very significant healing in areas where you leak. I think two weeks ago we had an amazing time of ministry. I don't know what it is specifically that God did for any of you. But I believe that God turned off the gas in some significant areas for some of us. But if you've lived with it for a couple weeks now, one of the things you may be discovering is this. even though you've experienced some significant healing, you still find yourself sometimes, maybe not as much as you used to, but still sometimes almost reflexively sliding into a lie, embellishing a fact, passing on a juicy morsel. Maybe you're a little bit more aware of it, but you still find yourself doing it. You're on the phone, you're in a conversation, you embellish it, make it a little bit bigger, you pass on this little thing, you didn't need to do it, you walk away and you go, why did I do that? I thought when the healing in my heart I must still have all tons of wounds and things it must be all about my wounds you know what there is a time you need to understand that while healing in the heart is critical to the taming of the tongue there are times the issue has nothing to do with your need for healing you have no need for healing what you And you have no wounds that need healing What you have is some habits that need breaking You have no need for healing What you have is some patterns that need changing What you need for that is not healing of the heart What you need for that is reining in of your tongue What you need for that is the discipline And the balance of the bit What you need for that is to submit To the bit the question that rises out of all of that is this what does it look like to submit to the bit what does that involve what might that require well true to form three things occur to me always three things one is this I think to submit to the bit requires first of all humility which by the way while we're talking physically about the tongue and the need to bridle it when I talk about humility what's that about that's about a heart thing the first thing that I think is necessary to submit to the bit is humility. The second is faith. And the third is practice. Let me talk briefly about all three. First of all, humility. Somewhere along the line, the horse in this analogy has to quit fighting and has to begin receiving the bit in its mouth. Have you ever put a bit in a horse's mouth? Me neither. Some of you have. I've never put a bit in a horse's mouth but I've watched people do it Sherry Meyer is one of my favorites she's about this tall nah she's not that tall she's about here little lady she's a huge animal I've watched her put bits in a horse's mouth and she's not particularly gentle and some of you have put bits in a horse's mouth sometimes you know that the horse receives the bit easily and you can be gentle and it's not a big deal there are other horses that don't receive it well at all and generally the people I've seen put bits in horses mouths who aren't receiving the bit very well don't stand before them and say you know I love you, do you know how much I love you you know if they just know you love them they'll open their mouth and receive the bit this horse has a self esteem problem I'm just going to build them up you are so brown, you are so brown this is the nicest brown I've ever seen would you please open your bit no, it's almost kind of if you don't know about horses you think they're being mean they grab them and they jam it in and the horse is going like this and they hurt them. Don't be gentle. Fact is, some fight, some resist, and some receive. I even found out in kind of looking at this as I talked to some horse people, evidently some horses have different kinds of mouths. I don't mean necessarily different shapes, but they might have that as well. Some horses have soft mouths. Are you making a connection with the heart? Some horses have soft mouths, and they receive the bit very easily, and you know what? They don't need a very severe bit. I understand that there are some bits that are even almost like plastic, and they're flexible, and they don't do much because the horse responds very easily. Other horses have hard mouths. They literally become calloused, and some bits look like torture devices. They come down around the chin. They're very restrictive. This is magnificent. They need a major bit. And you almost feel like this horse becomes a person and you kind of want to speak to the horse. Okay, horse, you want to do this the hard way or the easy way? It's up to you. Are you going to get the bit easy or hard? Go back to this image of blessed are the meek. Blessed are those who receive the bit. You know what comes before meekness in the progression in Matthew chapter 5? Blessed are, what's the first one? Blessed are the what? The broken. Blessed are those the broken. Blessed are those who mourn. People who are broken, people who are mourning, are generally very gentle. They are ready to receive the bids. First characteristic, the first requirement of receiving the bit of discipline on your tongue is a spirit of humility. You know what? You may be, as a human being, quite a specimen. Powerful and proud, much like that magnificent war horse prancing and snorting the embodiment of what many of us wish we could look like and be. You may be the corporate head, powerful and independent, a magnificent animal, but until you submit to the bit, until you allow yourself, first of all, to be ridden in the first place, And in my mind right now, that's a metaphor or an analogy for even becoming a Christian, allowing the life of God to invade your heart until you allow yourself to be ridden, but past that, until you then received a bit for the direction of your life and the control literally of your tongue, you are absolutely useless. That's a shaming thing to say. That is a true thing to say. What do you mean useless? I'm the head of a corporation. I didn't say you wouldn't be successful. I did not say you wouldn't be rich and people wouldn't admire you. We'll take pictures of you. We'll put you on the cover of a magazine. But you will not be safe. And you will not be useful in the kingdom of God endeavor. And let me tell you, on this side of eternity, we have ideas about what the most important things to be involved in are. And you may be the ultimate success until you submit to the bed. Allow yourself to be ridden. You will never reach your potential as a human being. You'll never win the race. You'll never keep the faith. You'll never fulfill your purpose. Humble yourself, therefore, under the mighty hand of God. Open up your mouth wide to receive the bit. Just to pause here and I'll tell you who I'm talking to. This word I'm giving right now at this part of the sermon is powerful for people among us who may never have in any way bent their knee to Jesus Christ as their sovereign king. And I'm not saying that my words are going to convince you or make you do it. I'm speaking a truth that you need once again to assess. Do I allow myself to be ridden by the king of kings, declare him as the Lord of lords or not? You can decide. And I think a word like this can become a pivotal moment in some of your lives to decide. Hopefully, you decide life, not death. This is a powerful word also for believers who have kind of put on the proverbial saddle. God's kind of in your life, sitting in the saddle, as it were. But basically, you do what you want. You go where you want. It's your agenda. It's your life. The spirit of the age is all over you. And I'm here to tell you, in a kingdom context, you are absolutely useless. that is so mean that is so true until you submit to the bit I can just go on and on I wish I could convey to you the picture I have I really do see the magnificence of this animal this horse but that animal is never more magnificent and never more noble the human being is never more noble and magnificent than when it bends its knee than when it bends its knee to its sovereign king and says, I will serve you. And in that place of submission to the bit and to the saddle, men and women find their identity as human beings under the sovereign grace of God. First dynamic I believe required for entering this discipline of the bit in the mouth is humility. The second is faith. To get this, return with me to the scene of Jesus' trial in Jerusalem. Return with me again to 1 Peter 2. I think earlier I said it was chapter 1. It's chapter 2, 1 Peter 2, verse 23, where it says this. And Jesus, being reviled, reviled not again. While suffering, he uttered no threats. Ask yourself a question. If you were being reviled, what would empower you to utter no threats? I mean, literally put yourself in a position where you're being reviled and you decide not to utter threats. What occurred to me was the thing that generally separated from the power of God that's necessary to do this, just in terms of my flesh power, the thing that would empower me to utter no threats back is that if they were bigger than me. And that would keep me quiet. I just received that and looked spiritual because I didn't say anything. Well, it has nothing to do with being spiritual. you were afraid. Fear would be a great one. If the playing field is equal, and I'm really not afraid of you, in fact, you might be in some stature sense less than me, and I'm more verbal than you, you nail me, what then would keep you from reviling again? Not much. Which means there is no virtue in your silence if what's keeping you silent is only fear. So What empowered Jesus? Verse 23, it says this, And being reviled, he reviled not again. What did he do? Was he afraid? Was he like this meek, spineless, dormant? Okay, just pick on me. No, no, here's what he said. He had a tough-minded faith. It says, instead, he kept on entrusting himself, his very life, his very soul, to him who righteously judges the living and the dead. He was being slandered. He was being lied about. He didn't defend himself. What did he do? He trusted God. He believed God. here's the deal you will never know the taming of the tongue without faith for you to be quiet when you are being reviled demands faith can't tame the tongue without faith Richard Foster in his book Celebration of Discipline about this dynamic says this one reason we cannot bear to be silent is that it makes us feel so helpless? How can we control what people think of us if we don't talk? A frantic stream of words flows from us because we are in a constant process of adjusting our public image. We fear what people might be thinking of us, so we talk to straighten out their understanding. We fear that our virtues might not be appreciated, our shortcomings might not be understood. So we explain and clarify and defend and talk and talk and talk. If we are silent, who will take control? Who will be careful to manage what people think? Foster says, God will take control, but we will never let him take control until we trust him. Silence is intimately related to faith. To where the bit of silence requires faith. Let me apply this to something you wouldn't necessarily see faith as being the key ingredient to, and that is taming of your tongue relative to boasting. See, usually I think, and by the way, I think this is part of boasting. The problem with boasting is I feel insecure, I have low self-esteem, and because of that I have to toot my own horn. That is clearly in there, and there needs to be the healing dynamic that we spoke of for about three weeks applied to that. But there are some of us who continue to do that. And you've got to move past sometimes. That's how you just have a low self-esteem thing. Faith is the problem. Where do you get this? Listen to Dallas Willard on this dynamic in his book, The Spirit of the Disciplines, where he says this. The discipline of silence enables us to place our public relations department entirely in the hands of God. we allow him to decide when our deeds will be known and when our light will be noticed but to wear that bit where I'm going to allow him to be the one who determines when the light's going to be noticed you have to believe God he goes on to say this the frantic efforts of religious personages and groups to advertise and certify themselves as a stunning revelation of their lack of substance and lack of faith Jesus surely with some humor said that a city set on a hill cannot be hid Matthew 5 where's the humor? well here's the humor imagine the task of trying to hide Jerusalem go ahead give it a try well that's ridiculous imagine the task of trying to hide Paris or Minneapolis for that matter the gospel stories tell us of how hard Jesus and his friends tried to avoid the crowds and how badly they failed quite candidly If it is possible for our faith and our works to be hidden, perhaps that only shows that they are the kind of works that should be hidden. To put your public relations department in the hands of God requires faith. I'm going to tell you, the taming of the tongue requires the healing of the heart. But it also requires us submitting to the bit. And what that requires is humility and faith. Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, and he will exalt you at the proper time. Last thing that requires, to close with this, is this. It requires practice. It requires practice in a practical way to find ways to bridle your tongue. Practice is the key word. Practical practice. Like, some of you are from Chicago, so you need this. Like this. Shut up. Don't say that. I get chores in our house if you say shut up. So put a cork in it. Just be quiet. Like for the rest of the day, be quiet. Just don't talk. You know, there are very few things that are going to make you more aware quicker of your need to talk and manage people's impressions and make sure they know you're smart and funny and got a better story than the one they told than when you just decide for a period of time during the day, I'm just not going to talk. Now, don't be rude. You see, I can just see, I'm entering into the spiritual discipline of science. Someone says hi, and you just ignore him. No, that's not the spiritual discipline. No, you're being an idiot now. Don't do that. And by the way, too, I'm not in terms of the bit and the practice that you need to do, I think, to enter into this. I'm not talking about quantum leaps. I'm not talking about white-knuckled promises to tame the tongue today. I will never again speak a word. Now the fact is the taming of the tongue is not going to happen today. And this is where the practice dynamic and spiritual discipline comes in. You don't learn to play the piano by walking to the concert hall and filling up with people and playing Mozart or something, or Mozart, whatever, some guy who plays. You start small by learning how to do the scales. The taming of the tongue, in some respects, is about changing some habits you have that you don't even think about anymore. Because it just rolls right out of your mouth. What are some things you could do practically, practice practically today, even this week? You could practice this, being slow to speak, being slow to interject, being slow to jump in. Those are good practices for me. You know, you're in a conversation and somebody tells a joke, you got a better one. Somebody has an insight, you have a better one. Just for a day. Know you have a better joke and not tell it. Thank you, God. What a victory. And let yourself feel how much you need to do that. I know I'm talking to somebody here. I got a mirror right in front of my face I hate this sermon somebody claps again I want to nail some of you others I don't want to be the only one to get nailed here some of us do hide in silence I don't ever do that some people do hide in silence and that's their protection the discipline of the tongue for you would not be to be silent. That would be for me. It really would be. And it is. And it's something I'm learning to do. I know you don't ever see it, but it's behind the scenes where nobody's watching. When I'm by myself, I do it. Just a little, you got to start small. For some of you, discipline would be to speak. For some of you, a discipline of your tongue would be to initiate. And go out of your way to talk to somebody you don't particularly want to talk to or enter into a conversation that doesn't feel comfortable to you. And all of this raises the issues of how we use our tongue. At some meeting you're in this week, decide to listen before you talk. Fast from criticism. Fast from criticism. In your journal this week, pick a day. Pick a day where maybe there's a critical meeting and decide just like you would fast from food for a day or maybe several days, fast from a critical word, from entering into critical speech. And the minute you do that, the day you try to do that, you will buy the attention you're paying to your decision to put a bit in that kind of speech. You're going to come in contact really quick with how quickly you criticize. You may not see yourself, and you may not be a particularly critical person. But put a spotlight on that for a day and see what rises up. You know, what's really weird, what occurred to me, is some of you are bosses. Some of you are teachers. And part of our job is to evaluate. And I'm not even saying that in a sarcastic way, just a neat way to criticize. You have to evaluate students, and you have to evaluate employees, and you have to say to some people, you are not doing your job, and there needs to be a critical aspect to your job. And you know what? The day you fast from criticism, you still have to evaluate. And you're going to ask this question, how do I do that? How do I do my job? I have a hard meeting with George today. I have to tell him he's not doing well. How do I do that without... Here's the fest. You have to do your job. Do your evaluation. Even give the bad report. And then let yourself feel how often it is after the evaluation you give. You carry that on the rest of the day. You share it with somebody else. Put a button on it. I kind of halfway joked about this a while. ago, but some of you can consider the possibility of fasting for a day, just like you would from food. Fast from speaking for a day. Again, don't be rude, and don't be sullen. Just be quiet. Once again, very few things. It's just like I'm sure many of you have fasted from food from time to time for some reason, maybe for a day, maybe for several days. One of the things I know about fasting is that on especially on the front end of a fast what happens is is your body starts screaming at you I mean our body we're we are babies I mean we really are you don't fast for a day and my body's in there screaming I mean go what are you doing you're gonna kill me or something I'm gonna die in here give me some food you just whine you get crabby you fast from food and all your stuff comes to the top fast from speaking and and and in ways that you even think you really got a control tool. You will be amazed how much you feel this to control somebody's idea, control their impression, make sure they think the right thing about you, defend yourself over here, and then you'll have something to journal the next day about all the stuff that came up. You won't be able to tell them how bright you are and funny and insightful. How are they going to know if I don't tell them? The fact is they might not know. I'm melting. I think this is really good practical stuff that just bathed with all sorts of grace can allow us in practical ways to enter into the discipline of the tongue. Here's the deal. Submit to the bit. To put on the discipline of a bridled tongue and to tame the tongue requires, first of all, faith. requires also humility, and it requires practice. It requires also grace. It really does. If you're going to really walk into this, you're going to need to give yourself a lot of grace. Because if you really start paying attention to how your tongue gets used, even by entering into some of these disciplines, while it might feel really good, some of you, I mean not all of you, but some of you go, I'm going to do that. Those are good suggestions. I'm going to do that. Well, I'm glad you feel good about it. When you do it, you won't feel so good. And you'll probably fail. For many of us stumble in many ways, and you're going to have to give yourself a lot of grace. And when you learn to play the piano, you learn one note at a time, and you're going to get better, and you're going to get better, and maybe one day you'll be able to play really well. And you will really notice over time, with discipline, there will be on your tongue blessing, not cursing. Far more blessing than cursing. Let's stand as we close. as always is the case the altar team will be here for people who need individual prayer but I'd like to pray as we close Father I thank you I feel really grateful this morning for just the work of your spirit among us as a church around this incredibly important topic I thank you for sounds odd, I thank you for James I thank you for his tenacious revelation around how vital our tongue is to every aspect of our lives. It occurs to me it's something that we on our own wouldn't think of, wouldn't notice as being that central. But it is and we're grateful. I pray in your name that the power of your spirit would be released among us to help us grow deep and strong in these kinds of issues. Bless us with with tongues that are learning to come under the authority of the bit of your spirit in our mouth and over our tongue. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
