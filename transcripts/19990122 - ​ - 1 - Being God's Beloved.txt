I'd like to begin tonight with a bit of blank verse. On the first day, God made Budweiser and bourbon. On the second day, God made noon. On the third day, God made the inner city. On the fourth day, God made needles and syringes. On the fifth day, God made lice. On the sixth day, God made man, placed him in the inner city, said increase and multiply, and fill the bars and the brothels. On the seventh day, God rested and he went to church, heard a nice sermon about something or other, sin and judgment and hell and how to keep Christ in Christmas. Kind of nice. On his way home that night, God thought a lot about sending fire or government aid or social workers. or something equally clever to destroy the inner city. God even thought of sending his own son, but he figured now the cop will see him talking with a prostitute and run them both in on a moral charge. Once is enough. And then God said, I will come. And I will live in the inner city, and I will stay there until the end of time, if such be the need. But I'll disguise myself in such a way that they'll never see my face, only my works. Together we'll do, and then we'll talk about jobs and rent and books and human dignity. Later, perhaps much later, they'll say, he really loves us. Let's make him our God. Then I'll be tempted to drop my disguise until they demand, show us your God. Then I'll tell them, My God lives in all men and women. Don't leave the inner city. Go farther into it. Come, let's look together, and we'll find God wherever men and women suffer, wherever men and women love. And there in deep disguise, far within the inner city, I will be their God, and they will be my people. These words were written by John Egan, who died in 1987, an obscure high school teacher who taught in the inner city of Milwaukee. For 30 years, he ministered to street kids. He had never wrote a book, never appeared on television, never gathered a reputation for holiness. There was no pizzazz, no aura, no halo around his head. He spent endless hours with kids, teaching, praying with them. And then he'd eat, drink, go biking through the woods, teach his classes, sleep overnight in the street with the kids. And what nobody knew was that he kept a daily journal. It was found the night of his death and published a year later, and it's one of the most stunning pieces of literature I've ever read in my life. The title of it is A Pilgrim Toward the Dawn, and in the introduction, a well-known writer from New York City, William O'Malley, writes, to me, the point of John Egan's journal is this. We ourselves are our greatest obstacle to our own nobility of soul. We judge ourselves unworthy servants, and that judgment becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. We deem ourselves too inconsiderable to be used even by a God capable of miracles with no more than mud and spit, and thus our false humility shackles an otherwise omnipotent God. From the depths of his own inner life, John Egan, a seriously flawed man, with large and numerous character defects, learned that brokenness is proper to the human condition, that every day we must forgive ourselves for being unlovable, irritable, inconsistent, incompetent, and many of us pot-bellied. Egan knew he learned that he should never confuse his perception of himself with the mystery that he really is. That all his self-commentaries, all the praise and the kudos and the compliments of others had nothing to do with his real dignity in Christ Jesus. He knew his sins, which were numerous, could never keep him from the Lord Jesus because he'd been washed away in the blood of the Lamb. And every morning, Egan took his sinful self to the cross of Jesus Christ, and he dared to live as a forgiven man. Do you do that? is your trust in the merciful love of the redeeming Christ so unyielding so uncompromising so unwavering so boundless that you dare to live as a forgiven man a forgiven woman Egan wrote in his own words God is asking me the unworthy to forget about manworthiness and dare to advance in the love of Christ and then to laugh at the preposterous idea of worthiness. He was a very earthy man, very unassuming man, very witty, very affable, and he pursued a life of serious prayer with ruthless fidelity. It was during the course of an eight-day silent retreat he made in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, that Egan discovered who his true self really is, and it hit him with sledgehammer force. He's sitting down, talking to his spiritual director, his mentor, a guy named Bob, and that morning, Bob says to him, John Egan, by God, this is your call. It is the way God is calling you to live each moment enveloped in his love. Then Egan writes in his journal, Bob says something that I will ponder for the next 20 years. He says it deliberately, he says it slowly. I asked him to repeat it a second time, so I can write it down. John, the heart of it is this. Define yourself radically as the beloved of God. Do you hear me, John? Define yourself radically as the beloved of God. Let God's love for you be constitutive of your personal worth. Let it become the most important thing in your life. Egan writes, Bob and I discuss it. The basis of my personal worth is not my possessions, my PhD, my talents, my ministry to kids, the esteem of others, the kudos of appreciation from parents, rather my worth lies in a healthy and joyful freedom. In an independence from the fickle, ill-informed judgments of people around me, this morning, he says, I stand utterly naked before God, who says to me, John, you are my beloved son. John Egan was an extremely ordinary man. He's a guy who shivered in the cold of winter. He sweated in the heat of summer. As he wrote in his journal, he woke up every morning unreconciled to getting out of bed. He would sit down greedily before a tall stack of pancakes. Then he'd weave through traffic, spend a day with kids. He'd come home, he'd make love and he'd make snowballs. He'd fly a kite, listen to the sound of the rain on the roof, and get caught up in the very mundane stuff of a lackluster existence. And this very ordinary man ravished the heart of Jesus Christ. The false self, what I call in one of my books the imposter, draws his identity from achievements in career, achievements in ministry, and from the admiration and the adulation of people. The true self finds his or her identity in their belovedness. We encounter the God of ordinary people in the very ordinariness of our lives, not in the search for spiritual highs, not in peak moments, not in extraordinary mystical experiences or fantastic successes in ministry or career, but in our simple presence to the God of love, present with us at this moment, You are my beloved. This is how I know you. This is how I relate to you. And I dare you to live out of that core identity. Henry Nouwen wrote to a highly intellectual friend in New York City, a guy named Fred. And Nouwen wrote in his letter, Fred, all I want to say to you in this letter is this: You're the beloved. And I hope you can hear what I'm saying with all the tenderness and force that my love for you can hold. I just want this letter to reverberate in the depth of your being. Fred, you are the beloved of God. One of the three women in my Catholic tradition, honored with the title of Doctrine of Theology because of the depth of her writings and the spiritual life, a woman named Catherine of Siena, she was asked one day, would you tell us about the God of your journey? And this fiery Italian contemplative woman shouted, he is pazzo da more, he is crazed with love. He is drunk with love for his beloved. when we live anchored in the wondrous mystery of our own belovedness. We don't have to act out to get attention from people. I don't have to be witty, charming, profoundly spiritual to get your attention. I mean, does a sunset, a rose, Or a Pomeranian puppy need fanfare? They give glory to God just by being themselves. The God and Father of Jesus created you and me with but one purpose in mind. Union with himself. And this God is defined in 1 John 4, 16 as love. The original purpose of our lives is union with God who is love. And the living awareness of our own belovedness is the axis around which the Christian life revolves. Being the beloved of God is our primary identity. It is the core truth of our existence. It is not just a lofty thought. It's not just an inspiring idea. It is the name by which God knows you, and it is the way that he relates to you. It is the name written on the white stone in the book of Revelation, known only by the person who receives it, known only by the God who gives it. And your name is beloved little one of the Father. When I made the 20-day intensive retreat out in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado in 1992, I met every morning at 6 a.m. with a therapist, a woman named Kenna Barron, who rose to get me in touch with repressed memories and feelings from childhood. One day in passing, she gave me a definition of codependency that really stunned me. She said, codependency is throwing the full weight of your existence on anyone or anything but Jesus Christ. the lack of subtlety in that definition made me wonder are there maybe only four or five free people in the entire world if I have to seek an identity outside of my belovedness then the acquisition of power successes in ministry applause for the books I write gathering the brick and brack of honors all that becomes an alluring alternative or maybe I find my center of gravity in my network of interpersonal relationships and I suddenly name draw about the important people who think well of me and my ministry it's really ironic but the church itself fosters codependency through its practice of conferring and withholding honors honoring this person because of money given to the church or some success in the ministry, withholding it from others, and it would create an illusion of status in the church because of performance. When the shattering love of God is eclipsed by the vanity of belonging to some particular group, when my sense of self-worth rises and falls like a sailboat on the winds for the people's approval, when I draw life and derive my identity from any source other than my belovedness, I am spiritually dead. When the God who is Pazzo de More, Ebro de More, gets relegated to second place behind my victories in the vineyard, my successes, Do you know what's happened to me? If I stand here tonight and get in the way of the encounter between you and Jesus, I have swapped the pearl of great price for your approval, your applause, and the same reproach addressed to the Pharisees is addressed to me. You value the approval of men more than you value the honor that comes from God. I was at a meeting in Gethsemane, Kentucky, years and years ago, and I was in the Trappist Monastery, and the speaker for a thousand of us spiritual directors was Thomas Merton, known all over the world because of his writing. And after his 45-minute presentation, this old priest raised his hand and said, Tom, who are you? You've written 65 books. I just read the paper the King of Spain came to spend three days with you. The Secretary of State, John Dulles, was down here hanging out with you for a week. Who are you? And Merton didn't blink. He said, the deepest awareness I have of myself is I am a man passionately loved by Jesus Christ. it is the furious love of God bodied forth in Jesus of Nazareth that is the foundation of the true self to live and move out of this awareness that is the existential experience of the freedom and the glory of the children of God why then is it that tomorrow walking around the mall of America there'll be so few Christians aware of their awesome dignity as the beloved? Why will there be so many who gather in church this weekend overcome with shame, fear, anxiety, self-hatred, remorse? Why are so few of us aware of who we really are in the eyes of God. Why do we not let Jesus come to us on his terms as the son of compassion? Because I think somewhere along the way we've discovered that the price is exorbitant. Because the indispensable condition for developing and maintaining the awareness of our belovedness is silent solitude. And by that, I mean every day, simply spending time alone with God, where we tune out the naysaying whispers of our unworthlessness, and we sink down into the mystery of our belovedness. Our longing to know who we really are, which by the way is the source of most of our discontent, that's never going to be revealed to us until we confront ourselves alone in silence and in solitude. Our real identity lies in the relentless tenderness of God enfleshed in Jesus Christ. When you go off these 35 minutes alone with the scriptures, after I stop speaking, I'd ask you to pray this simple prayer. Lord Jesus, help me to discover the truth about myself, no matter how beautiful it is. Let Jesus come to you on his terms. You know, you've heard me say this before, but to really believe in the love of God is not an intellectual assent to a doctrine. The essence of biblical faith lies in trusting God. in his love that is creative, intimate, unique, reliable, and tender. Creative, out of his love I came forth, through his love I'm sustained in existence. My next heartbeat is love and gift in the Father's hand. His love is intimate. You got that skeleton in your closet in your past life? Something you did so shameful, I've got it. Oh God, I've got it. That when I think about it, my palms start to perspire. And I think, please, God, don't let anybody ever find out about that. The intimate love of God reaches into that dark place. You know, in the Bible, reconciliation is not primarily making peace with somebody else. It's first of all, making peace in that part of yourself where you could never find peace before. That is the intimate love of God. His love is unique, meaning God loves me, not as you think I am, or as I think I'm supposed to be, but as I really am. And the real Brennan Manning is a bundle of paradoxes and contradictions. I believe in God with all my heart, but on a given day when I see a seven-year-old girl raped and murdered by a sex maniac or a four-year-old boy slaughtered by a drunken driver, I wonder if God exists. I trust Him and I get discouraged. I love and I hate. I feel bad about feeling good. I feel guilt if I don't feel guilty. I'm wide open and I'm locked in I'm trusting and suspicious I'm honest and I still play games Aristotle said I'm a rational animal I say I'm an angel with an incredible capacity for beer that's the real Brennan God's unique leverage has to embrace me as I am and not as I should be you accept with your heart as well as your head that god's love is reliable meaning it's never let you down i know this if we shared your life story in mind we'd find a striking similarity at least one respect both of our lives have been a celebration of god's faithfulness in good times and in bad i came up here to the twin cities on november 23rd this past year. I told no one that I was coming and I spent 30 days in St. Bonifacius. I made a 30-day retreat, an AA retreat. There were 12 of us on the retreat. There were six six crack cocaine addicts and six recovering alcoholics. I was not there as an observer. I was not there as a mentor. I was not there as a spiritual director. I was there as a drunk who was one drink away from his next drunk. And for 30 days we steeped ourselves in the spirituality of the 12 steps. We immersed ourselves in the big book. We had a raw experience of community. And I claimed who I really am before the Lord Jesus, a beloved drunk. And the God that I have experienced is not something I read in a book or heard in a sermon. The Jesus of my own journey revealed himself in the most powerful fashion when I was a broken down bum in the gutter in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. April Fool's Day, 1975, I wake up in a doorway in Commercial Boulevard, sniff and vomit all over my sweater in an alcoholic fog, staring down at my bare feet, didn't move a whiner still in my shoes to buy a bottle of Thunderbird. Come on the sidewalk, there's a woman, about 25 years old, blonde hair, attractive lady, got a four-year-old son in her hand. The boy broke loose from his mother's grip, ran over the doorway and stared down at me. His mother came up quickly behind him, cupped her hand over his eyes and said, "Don't look at that filth. All that is is pure filth." And a little more than 23 years ago, that filth was Benny Manning. And the God I've come to know. The Jesus I've met on the grounds of my own self. The God who was Pazzo de More. And Hebro de More. Loved me as much that morning in this state of disgrace. As he does tonight in this state of grace. For his love is never, never, never based on our performance. It is never conditioned by our moods of elation or depression. It knows no shadow of alteration or change. The love of God in Christ Jesus is reliable. By the way, tomorrow night, eight of those ragamuffins, the crack cocaine addicts and the alcoholics who were with me on the retreat in St. Bonifaceous are coming to the 5 o'clock service tomorrow night. And they asked me to teach them how to pray up there. and at 6 o'clock in the morning on December 17th to see them come trooping downstairs it's pitch black at 6 a.m. and it's 18 degrees below zero outside with a little thermometer we had out there and these are three women and nine men that never prayed in their lives before I told them a little method of how to spend 20 minutes and they'd sit there, their eyes closed and then after 12 minutes they'd open the 24 hour book and read the meditation for the day and close their eyes some more and end with the Lord's Prayer. The desperation, the hunger, the longing for God. What happened there if I lived to be 200 years old? I could only stutter and stammer about what I saw. God hears the cry of the poor. You'll see men and women in their late 20s in the early 30s, walking here tomorrow night, who in the depth of their being laid hold of their belovedness. Yeah. All you gotta do is let Jesus come to you on his own terms. And his love is tender. Tenderness is what happens to you when you're deep and sincerely liked by somebody. If you communicate to me you really like me, I just love me as a brother in Christ, but really like me. Then you open up to me the possibility of liking myself, accepting myself, loving myself. The look in your eyes banishes my fears and my defense mechanisms like sarcasm, ridicule, name dropping. Giving you the appearance I got it all together. All that falls away, if I sense you like me, I'll become more open, sincere, vulnerable, and affectionate with you. I never dream of being, you didn't like me. What happens is I grow tender. I got this good friend in Detroit, Edward Farrell. Written some great books, by the way, Prayer is a Hunger. And he takes his two-week summer vacation and goes over to Ireland because his favorite uncle is celebrating his 80th birthday. Well, on the morning of the great day, Ed Farrell and his uncle get up before dawn. They get dressed in darkness and silence. They go for a walk around the show of L.A. Killarney. Just as the sun is about to rise, his uncle turns and stares straight at the rising sun. Ed Farrell didn't know what to do. Stands beside his uncle, shoulder to shoulder, 20 full minutes, not a word exchange. And then his uncle, his 80-year-old uncle, goes skipping down the road. He's beaming, radiant, smiley ear to ear. Ed Farrell catches up with him and says, Uncle Seamus, you really look happy. He said, I am, lad. you want to tell me why yes you see and the tears washed down the old man's face he said you see the father is very fond of me oh me father is so very fond of me if I ask you right now do you really believe God likes you not loves you, because theologically, God has to love you. God loves by necessity of nature. Without the eternal interpretation of love, God would cease to be God. If I asked you, you really believe he likes you, and with gut-level honesty, you could reply, Oh, yes, the Father is very fond of me. There would come a relaxedness, a serenity, a compassionate attitude toward yourself and your brokenness. Can you be close to what I describe one of my books downstairs as living one day at a time in the wisdom of accepted tenderness. Living daily in the wisdom of accepted tenderness. Back out to Denver. Back in 1971, there was a woman about 37 years old who claimed she was having visions of Jesus. Well, you know, this gets around the city, and it's such a fine line between the authentic mystic and the lunatic fringe that the Catholic Bishop of Denver goes down to check her out. And he said, Ma'am, do you really have visions of Jesus? She said, Yes, I do. He said, well, next time you have a vision, I want you to ask Jesus to tell you the sins that I confessed in my last confession. She said, what? You want me to ask Jesus to tell me the sins you confessed? He said, yes, call me if anything happens. Ten days go by and the woman calls and the bishop goes down to her house and he asks, did you have a vision of Jesus? She said, yes, I did. And the bishop said, did you do what I asked? She said, yes, I did. And now, this is Archbishop Regis Stafford. He leans forward. His eyes narrow with the apocalyptic glint of an aimed gun. And he says, what did Jesus say? And the woman said, Bishop, these were his exact words. He said, I can't remember. do you believe that that every repented sin of your past life is not only forgiven but so entirely forgotten that Jesus cannot remember what it was the prophetic word spoken to a 34 year old widow in the year 1667 in Lynn Massachusetts a woman named Marjorie Kemp. It's as valid and powerful tonight as the night it was spoken. Jesus said to that woman, more pleasing to me than all your prayers, your works, and your sacrifices is that you would believe that I love you. It is in active silence and in silence you're not waiting for God to make a move you're becoming aware of the moves God is making in that silence in that solitude the noise of the self-despising internal critic, the critic that's saying you're a loser you're a phony, you're a hypocrite you're a fraud, if people got to know the real you, they wouldn't want to know you, that voice becomes still, muted, and then we hear the voice of the Abba of Jesus. My beloved, I love you in the morning, sun, and the evening rain. Without caution, regret, boundary, limit, breaking point. No matter what's going down, I can't stop loving you. Some of you know a fella named Mike Iaconelli. He's probably the most dynamic and gifted youth minister in the country. He has an organization called Youth Specialties and puts on two conferences a year, one on the East Coast, one in the West, that attract maybe 8,000 youth ministers from all over the country. And Iaconelli himself is an extremely gifted speaker. published his first book, a marvelous book called Dangerous Wonder. And Iaconelli is a good friend of mine and for years was convinced that his whole life in the ministry was phony. He was using the pulpit to compensate for success and honor and praise you could never get in the corporate world. And he knew that his motives for ministry were vain, that his personal life was soiled, and that God was extremely disappointed in them. Well, in a state of depression bordering on despair, Mike and his wife, Carly, went to Toronto, Canada to spend five days with Henry Nowen and his community of handicapped people in L'Arche. And Yekineli was hoping that maybe the preaching of Henry Nowen, maybe the witness of all these handicapped people would serve as some kind of inspiration. And instead what happened was Iaconelli on the first day found his true self. And here's what he said. It took one hour before I began to hear my soul speaking. Just one hour to discover that I was not alone. God had been trying to shout over the noisiness of my life and I couldn't hear him. But in the stillness, in the solitude of Toronto, Canada, I heard him saying within me, Michael, I'm here. I've been calling you. You haven't been listening. Michael, can you hear me? I love you. And I've been waiting for you to hear that. But you've been so busy trying to prove to yourself that you're worthy of love. You haven't heard me. And Mike, 50 years old, says, I heard him. And my slumbering soul was awakened with the joy of the prodigal son. And at that moment, I did something I've never done in my life. I accepted my brokenness. I accepted that I was a sinful man with hereditary faults and limited talents. I had never come to terms with that. Let me explain, he says. I knew I was broken. I knew I was a sinner. I knew I continually disappointed God, but I could never accept that part of me. It was the part of me that embarrassed me. I always felt the need to apologize, to run from my weakness, to deny who I was and concentrate on who I should become. Yeah, I was broken, but I was trying to get to that place where I wouldn't be broken again, or at least very seldom broken. But that first night in Toronto, Canada, it became clear to me that I've totally misunderstood my Christian faith. I came to see that it was in my brokenness, in my powerlessness, in my weakness, that Jesus was made strong. It was in the acceptance of my shallow faith that God could give me faith. It was in the embracing of my own brokenness that I could identify with the brokenness of others. From now on, it is my role to identify with the pain of others, not relieve it. My ministry is going to be sharing, not dominating, understanding, not theologizing, caring, and not fixing. And Yachinata concludes, what does all this mean? He said, I really don't know. All I know is this, that at some moment in every one of our lives, we make an adjustment in the way we're living. Maybe a lot of people wouldn't notice it. But there really is a change. And I can tell you, my life is so different now. There's an electricity about God's presence in my life. And I've never known that before. All I can tell you is, for the first time in my 50 years, I hear Jesus whispering to me in my brokenness, Michael, I love you. You are the beloved. That's a man without pretense. Not some spiritual giant, not a Martin Luther, not a John Wesley, but on a wintry night in Toronto, Canada, one of our brothers, an earthen vessel with feet of clay, who'd been in ministry for 32 years, laid hold of his belovedness in the heart of his everyday existence, in the yaw and pitch of moral struggle, in the maw of heartbreaking failure, of broken promises, of failed dreams. And Iaconelli learned who he is and how God relates to him. And what happened to him to me is just too powerful for any commentary. Either you accept that in its shimmering simplicity, or you say, I've got to get more insights. I've got to get deeper revelations. Iaconelli to this day, that was four years ago, lives in the daily awareness of his belovedness. And Jesus looked at Iaconelli, and right now he's looking at you. He's looking at me. He sees through our failings. He accepts our weaknesses. He reads the intentions of our heart. He extends his hand in friendship and affirms our belovedness. Is that miracle enough for you and me? Or has the rolling thunder of the infinite love of God gotten so buried in the roar of religious rhetoric that we're not even aware that God has tender feelings for us? Do we need something else? Something more than what Jesus gave to the trembling Apostle Peter, what he gave to Mary Magdalene, what he gave to Iaconelli, what he wants to give to you and me this night? it is in silence in solitude by that I don't mean isolate yourself live in a cave like I did for a long time in Spain I just mean everyday being alone with the alone a time to experience the transcendent God and grow in the awareness of your core identity as the beloved in my own life it is silence, the solitude that has made my speech personal. If I'm not in touch with my own belovedness, I'll never be aware of the sacredness of your life. If I'm estranged from Brennan, I'm going to be a stranger to you. I connect best with people in ministry when I can connect with the core of myself. When I can disengage from people and all their praise and all their criticism. When I can get free from that unhealthy dependence on human approval, then I can listen more attentively, love more and selfishly, speak more compassionately, play more playfully, take myself more seriously, become aware that the breath of the Father is on my face. And suddenly be aware my face is bright with laughter in the midst of a game I'm thoroughly enjoying. What I call conscientiously wasting time with Jesus. That's prayer. Just hanging out with Jesus as an end of itself. A night like this I would call holy loitering. Those moments enable us to speak and act from greater strength, to forgive rather than hold grudges, to reconcile rather than massage the latest bruised, raw wounded ego. This time alone with Jesus empowers us to be magnanimous when everybody else around us is being petty and critical. Most of all, if you spend this time alone with God, and I'm talking specifically 20 minutes each morning before breakfast, and 10 minutes in the evening before dinner, if that doesn't work, sometime in the evening, a total of 30 minutes each day, what will happen is the Holy Spirit will move you from the head trip, from intellectual cognition about your belovedness, to the experiential awareness. In other words, the Spirit moves you from the notional knowledge, where you know something in a vague, abstract way, yeah, God loves me, but it never intrudes on your consciousness, doesn't affect your daily living. But real knowledge means you know something vaguely, but that's still so powerful that you act on it anyway. In one of his poems, T.S. Eliot said, It's bad tonight. It's real bad, man. My nerves are shattered. Just stay with me, and I'll make it through the night. In solitary silence, we listen to the great attentiveness to the voice that calls us the beloved. God speaks into the deepest strata of our souls, into the gooey mess of our narcissism, our shame, our self-hatred. He takes us through the night into the daylight of his truth. And he says, you listen. Do not be afraid. I have redeemed you. I have called you by name you are mine you are precious in my eyes you are honored and I love you the mountains may fall the hills may depart but my love will never leave you and my covenant of peace will never be broken I ask you right now to pause with me to gently close your eyes in faith become aware of the presence of the indwelling Christ recall his word in John make your home in me as I make mine in you grow still and listen. The God from whose fingertips this universe fell tells you that he's called you by name. The God beside whose beauty the Grand Canyon is only a shadow is calling you his beloved. The God beside whose power the nuclear bomb is nothing says he has tender feelings for you. We find no words to respond. We are plunged into mystery, what Rabbi Heschel called radical amazement. It is simply speechless humility, hushed, trembling in the presence of a love that defies human comprehension, that escapes human imitation. It is a moment of truth, and we cannot escape into hand-clapping liturgies, hand-clapping worship. We can't escape into cerebral scripture studies. What God is saying to us this moment is not the dry knowledge we've all experienced, whether sitting in a Bible study or a theology class. We've all been through that stuff. We received the knowledge without appreciation, the facts without enthusiasm, the information without transformation. We've studied all the scholarly periodicals and when we were done, we were struck by the insignificance of it all. we'd learned didn't seem to make any difference. And so we didn't care. But when the night is bad and your nerves are raw and infinity speaks, when God Almighty shares through his son Jesus, the depth of his feelings for you. When the power of his love flashes like lightning in the depth of your soul, when you are overtaken by the overpowering love of God, then it is kairos, the decisive inbreak of God in your personal life and right now no one can speak for you. You stand utterly alone. It is a solitary journey and you are faced with a momentous decision. Shivering in the rags of your 25 or 35 or 45 or 65 years, you can either escape into skepticism, cynicism, you can intellectualize all this, or with radical amazement, you can surrender right now to the truth of your own belovedness. Procrastination, The decision to postpone a decision is a decision itself. This moment, let Jesus come to you on his own terms. Let him love you as you are and not as you should be. If you sense resistance, shame, guilt, fear, anxiety, low self-esteem, just with total honesty say, Jesus, here they are. And I can't free myself, but you can set me free. I want to be free. Lord Jesus Christ, glorify your Father this moment by empowering me with the courage to accept acceptance, to surrender to your truth that I am the beloved of God and to yield without reservation. That no matter how great I believe your love is for me this moment, your love is always greater. Thank you.
