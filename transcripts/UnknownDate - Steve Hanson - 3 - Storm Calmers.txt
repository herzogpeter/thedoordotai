Oh, what wonderful worship this morning. I love those words of worship this morning. Thank you so much for your feedback over the past several weeks regarding the Beyond Our Door special fund this year. I appreciate any encouragement like that. Also, as some of you have asked, is there something that we might be able to do in the HIV arena in the next summer? and I just wanted to make this announcement that the Saturday, June 10th, World Vision is sponsoring a walk in Minnetonka. It's called 29,000 Steps, or the 2,900 Steps. One of those two. We'll have information in the gathering place next weekend, next weekend for that. Let's pray together. Lord, I thank and I praise you that you want to lead. and Lord I continue to pray for people that want to follow and sometimes into those dark places sometimes into those dark places Lord take these words words that you've given me through personal experience words you've given me through your precious word words you've given people to give to me through book, through article, through video Lord I pray for a gift to speak well for abducted children in northwestern Uganda. Lord, I want this more than good video footage. I want it more than good talk, good story. Lord, I ask that your spirit would breathe power into these words and open our hearts to this dark place where I feel absolutely sure you are leading us. Anoint us. Amen. Amen. Two weeks ago, Dave Johnson introduced us to our Beyond Our Door special fund drive for this coming fiscal year, 2006-07. That starts June 1, goes through May 30th. He reminded us that this Beyond Our Door fund began three years ago. However, the journey actually began about ten years ago in the hearts and minds of several of us. A journey towards the city and a journey towards the HIV-AIDS pandemic. The journey to the city led us to North Minneapolis. The journey towards HIV led us to Uganda and Kenya. He reminded us that three years ago, and in those three years, we have invested, we have intentionally, strategically, and in some cases, for some folks, sacrificially invested $650,000. Many of you were involved. And we've done that generous investment during a move to Maple Grove, which increased our budget needs, of course, during a flat economy. And Dave's words were thank you. Two weeks ago, Dave challenged us towards another $300,000, which would bring our four-year total of $950,000. But then as he did the math, he'd think, you know, that's so close to a million. Why don't we just scrap the $300,000? and let's go for like 330 or 340 and reach the million dollar figure for four years. And I said, okay. I said a big okay. A big okay. Dave introduced us then two weeks ago again to our friend and partner Ephraim Smith, pastor of Sanctuary Covenant Church located on the near north side of Minneapolis. And Ephraim took us to the north side in a boat using Mark chapter 4, 35 through 41. He took us in his boat to introduce us to their storms, well-documented storms, crime, injustice, poverty, teen pregnancy, drugs, hopelessness, gangs. And he challenged us to be storm calmers. Do you recall that? That storm calmers, only as Ephraim can do. He took us in a boat to join him and his people as they join others within the near north side to calm the storms. And we will join him. With part of next year's funds, we will continue to sit in the boat with Ephraim, paddle, set sail, ask Jesus, in our shared journey, just 20 minutes beyond our door, North Minneapolis. Then last week, I continued the beyond our door ask, and I used that same passage, asking us to get out of our boat as, or get in our boat as we are, asking us to be willing to go to the other side, asking us to be willing to acknowledge the storms, sometimes boat sinking storms beyond our ability to paddle storms. And last week I told you of our desire to be involved in a ministry bigger than ourselves where we look back and see the obvious fingerprints of God, where sometimes we ask that provocative question asked in chapter 4, verse 41 of, Mark, who is this man that even the winds and the seas obey? Last week I told you of our desire to be a people who are humbly aware of what he's given us. A people who are grateful and humbly aware of the needs beyond our door. A people who are intentional, strategic, sacrificially responding to those needs, the needs that he brings our way beyond our door, the other side. A people asking how can we join him in his boat with his gifts, the gifts he has given us to touch the needs of his people that he has brought us to. Open door in the next 30 minutes. I'm going to ask you to join me in a different boat, a different journey, heading to a part of the world where I believe God is clearly calling us to. Elder Todd Bertelsen and Dave Johnson through video will be sharing this morning as well to part of the world where the numbers of HIV is about double any place else in the world and you'll see why that is so I invite you to jump in the boat let's go to the other side Thank you. Well, after having seen the suffering of the civilian population in northern Uganda, I'm appalled, frankly. It's a moral outrage to see thousands of children that have been abducted, that are maltreated, that are going through the most horrendous torture by the rebel movement and also the same groups now being neglected to some extent by the whole international community. I cannot find any other part of the world having an emergency on the scale of Uganda with so little international attention. John Edgeland, British Broadcasting Company, the BBC on May 2003, used these words, moral outrage, horrendous torture, neglect, maltreatment of thousands of children. He says, and I quote, I cannot find any place in the world today with such an emergency, such a crisis, with such little international attention. May 2003. He's speaking of what he's seen in northwestern Uganda in an area called Gulu, a city, a province called Gulu. It's referred to as Acholi land because it's full of the Acholi people. He's speaking about a 20-year civil war, the longest continuous running war on a continent known for civil wars, a war between the government and what he called the rebels. And I clearly want to say in this country the rebels are the bad guys. It's not always the case. You know that. The rebels, the Lord's Resistance Army, the LRA, used to be called the Holy Spirit Movement. It's a satanic cult, a mind-body-spirit-controlling satanic cult. It's evil with skin on. It's evil with skin on, led by Joseph Coney, the self-professed Son of God, Jesus Christ himself, led by his aunt, Alice LaQuinta, the Holy Spirit, led by her father, the self-professed God, the Father. But on that May 3rd, 2003, John Edgeland, BBC, was not concerned about just another civil war in Africa, another tribal war. There's too many of them to be concerned about, any one of them. He was referring to later on in this video what he called a dirty war, a war where one side, the rebels, use abducted children, terrorized children, brainwashed, choiceless children to shoot and be shot to be their weapons. children a war where one side the rebels uses abducted children forced then to go back to their villages to torture their parents leaving them no place to run children uses abducted children that are told that the government wants them dead that ministries like World Vision wants to poison them because of all the things that have gone on children with no place to run. Choiceless children. A war where one side uses terrorized children to bring terror to a region full of innocent people. Where one side uses young boys and gives them a choice. You can become a corpse, a tortured corpse, or you can become a killing machine. Where one side uses girls and turns them into this kind of choice, you can either become one of our sex objects or you can become dead. In 2003, John Edgeland was pleading with the world via BBC about these children in this region, about this dirty war. During that same month, during that same year, I was sitting at lunch in southern Uganda, some 200 miles away, with World Vision leader James Oteem. This man is the man who introduced us to child-headed households in southern Uganda, grandmother-headed households in southern Uganda. He introduced us to the Katabasis. He introduced us to Grandma Oliver. He introduced us to Robert Kalissa. He began our movement in southern Uganda with HIV. Things you heard about last week, and we celebrated together. But James Oteam also introduced me to the fact that he was not from Masaka. He was from Gulu, a place I'd never heard about. And he began telling me about his homeland. James Oteem is an Acholi. And so back in May of 2003, he introduced me to his homeland. He introduced me to Gulu, to the Acholiland people, verbally and with passion. And so there at the Pravada Hotel in Masaka, Uganda, he told me that I needed to see Gulu, but only when it was safe. That I needed to see, I needed to smell, I needed to hear the sounds of death, the sounds of torture, but I also needed to hear the sounds of life and the sounds of hope. Steve, he said, my people are being killed, my children are being abducted, they're being stolen, they're being enslaved. 75 children a day are being abducted and turned into sexual objects, turned into killing machines. And if they're fortunate enough to flee, they flee with HIV. Steve, thousands of children walk miles if they haven't been abducted. They walk miles every afternoon, late afternoon, to go to Gulu so they can sleep without fear of being abducted. They sleep there on a concrete slab near the police station, near the military, because there they can sleep and not fear being stolen, abducted. Thousands every day. Some of the children we saw, I'm sure, have no recall of ever being tucked in. Some of the children we saw probably have no recall of ever sleeping at home. Every night. Steve, you need to go. You need to go see. You need to hear Gulu. So on April 19th, April 20th, and April 21 of this year, four weeks ago, I did go, along with seven others from Open Door. And we did see. And we did here. And part of what we saw were hundreds and hundreds of children, thousands of children, who are called night commuters, night walkers. They walked a gulu every night. I'm sorry. Thank you. Come on. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Thank you. ¶¶ ¶¶ I'm out. Gulu. It's a word I'd want everybody here at Open Door Family to know. Gulu. Over the past 20 years, certain words have become part of us beyond our door. When I say the word shoebox, at least some of you think of Operation Christmas Child. When I say Project Mercy, some of you think of the word coins and special needs. when I say Haiti some of you think of Pastor Dio or I say Belize some of you think of Rahim when I say Gulu I want us to think about children Gulu is a town of 75,000 people and at times the town of 75 people has swelled to 140,000 people so a headline in a newspaper when I was there that talked about a time when 65,000 night walkers. And at this point, it's 7,000 night walkers. We were in a sleep center with 400 kids. It was a World Vision sleep center where there was some supervision and some tutoring and some Bible stories and some music and some registration. But you can bet that many of the sleep areas, there's no supervision. You know, when you're housing 7,000 or 65,000, you can imagine there's a number of places with no supervision and older kids take advantage of younger kids. Kids sleeping wherever they feel safe or relatively safe from bus stations at schools, at the hospital, at verandas, somewhere near the police, somewhere near the army. Gulu is not only a town, it's also a province and it's a province where a number of people have left their village to resettle near a police station, near an army encampment. They come to places called internally displaced people camps, IDPs. Scores of families have left their farms, their animals, their livelihood to live on top of each other in these camps. 80% of that region has moved to those kind of camps. They've left everything and they have nothing to support them. They live on nothing. So you can imagine what goes on in those places. Feelings of hopelessness, alone, despair, and wondering why the world doesn't listen to them on their plight. HIV rates there are double anyplace else in the world. Why? Because desperate women who are hearing their children cry do desperate things for a meal. Desperate women inherit this virus. They pass it on to a baby through breastfeeding. Children in these sleep centers, abducted children drink blood for spiritual discipline purposes. They wash in blood to keep bullets from penetrating them. And the cycle continues. Four weeks ago, we were in Gulu because World Vision thought it's safe. We went to a hospital. I saw lots of images there. But one image that stays with me is a 12-year-old mother in a wheelchair. I'm trying to get my arms around the thought of a 12-year-old mother in a wheelchair, and in a wheelchair because she had something that looked like a nail driven through her heel. She'd been in the bush for three years. A 12-year-old mother in the bush for three years living in slavery. Four weeks ago, we drove into the World Vision compound, eight-foot wall with razor wire around the top of it, and this particular compound was called the Children of War Recovery Center. Children of War Recovery Center. You can imagine what we saw there. What we saw there was children who were courageous enough or fortunate enough to have escaped the rebels. Fortunate enough, courageous enough to have escaped evil with skin on. And they arrived at this compound afraid, distrustful, ashamed, angry, full of nightmares, confused. And you only had to look at these kids to know they were different. A piece of candy, a soccer ball meant nothing. They arrived at this camp, this compound, with wounds, deep wounds, physical wounds. Some of our people saw a 16-year-old girl with a bullet hole that had not been treated. They come with viruses. They're spiritually wounded, emotionally wounded. And they also come to the unbelievable loving arms, outstretched of World Vision counselors, who understand their wounds because they've had the same wounds. The same wounds that are healed or are healing. And there these children learn to tell their stories, to vomit their stories. They learn to draw their stories. They learn to dance their stories. They learn to sing their stories. It will all take time, and there's many techniques and many methods helping those wounded get past. But there was one clear constant that was part of the healing for everybody. The one clear constant wasn't drawing, wasn't dancing, wasn't singing, it wasn't even telling their story. The one clear constant was forgiveness. And some of the stories we heard left us silenced. Forgiveness, forgiving the unforgivable. Forgiving those who weren't even asking for it. Open door, would you listen to these children? The children that James Oteam referred to, the children that John Edgeland wanted us to hear. Because I believe, I believe that God is calling us to the other side in northern Uganda as well. To the other side of the globe. But I think also to the other side of forgiveness. I still get bad dreams and wake up screaming. Even when I'm not asleep, I get bad dreams. I hear rebels threatening to kill me. I see a long line of children tied with probes and rebels ordering to kill their children. I was so scared because I see people's arms and legs being cut off. I thought this would be done to me because they do bad things to those who are arrested and abducted. I tried to protest and ask for mercy, but they still went ahead and beat me until nightfall. I slowly moved ahead and asked a certain boy to rein it in a cup for me. I think there are those few drops of urine that saved my life. When the rebels came, I came out of our home trembling with my heart in my mouth, fearing that I would be killed any minute. Some children who were too weak to walk were just chopped up with knives and left to die on the way. This scared me so much. In the bush, I was given to a man to be his second wife. If you refuse to show respect, you are beaten thoroughly. I have witnessed this death with my own eyes. What does the government think? Do they think this is right? They entered in the ambush of the UPDF soldiers. There's something happening here. What it is ain't exactly clear. There's a man with a gun over there telling me I got to beware. I think it's time we stop. Children, what's that sound? Everybody look what's going down. And being the leader, he was the one to be shot. He was the first to be shot. And that is how he lost his sight. There's battle lines being drawn. Nobody's right if everybody's wrong. Young people speaking their minds are getting so much resistance from behind. Every time we stop, hey, what's that sound? Everybody look what's going down. What a field day for the heat A thousand people in the street Singing songs and carrying signs Mostly say hooray for our side it's time we're stopped hey what's that sound everybody look what's going down mostly say hooray for our side it's time we're stopped hey what's that sound everybody look what's good when we better stop hey what's that sound everybody look what's going we better stop Now, what's that sound? Everybody look what's going on. We better stop, children. What's that sound? Is there hope? Is there hope? Since we've been back, I've been wondering about a lot of things. I'm wondering if there's hope for places like Gulu. I'm wondering about the power of forgiveness. As I share a few stories of our time in Gulu, I invite you to also wonder with me. Inside that walled sanctuary of World Vision's Children of War Recovery Center, we met a 21-year-old guy who, at nine years old, was abducted from his family and forced to kill. He was given a gun and trained to kill and abduct other children. During a battle, he was wounded, and with little medical care, he now still has a bullet lodged in his chest. He's been told while he was in captivity that his parents were killed. But we listened. We listened as this young man and others like him played their musical instruments, sang, and worshipped our God. We sat with a 15-year-old boy who at age 11, as he was sleeping, was abducted from his home. tied up with his own shirt and carried into the night. He, along with other abducted children, became weapons of the rebels. They became children's soldiers. Four years later, in March of this year, he was rescued by the Ugandan army and brought to the medical center. His family has not shown up. But he was sitting next to Catherine, who at age 10 was abducted with her sister on their way to school. forced to travel by foot carrying heavy tins of ammunition they were marched to Sudan. In Sudan, Catherine's sister was killed by the Sudanese army. At 15, Catherine became pregnant as a result of rape. On March 29th of this year Catherine was captured by the Ugandan army and brought to the World Vision Center. As we were listening to her a small child peeked her head in the door walked across the floor and then Catherine lovingly pulled this little girl, her daughter up into her lap. As we sat amongst these kids these teenage boys who were abducted and who then became abductors and sat amongst these teenage girls who had been abducted and worse we saw acceptance we saw love we saw worshipping we saw peace. Then we met Barbara. As a teen, Barbara was abducted from her family and was forced to become a rebel commander's young wife. Eventually, she escaped. Now, in her mid-twenties, Barbara is the director of counseling for World Vision and Gulu. Having gone through this horror herself, she's helping these kids release the hate. Barbara told us that the only way, the only way that she's been able to stop this trauma in her mind was through forgiveness. We heard about a mother. Her daughter was stolen from her and raped by the rebels. In anguish over the loss of her daughter and retching from hatred for the rebels, this mother cried out, pleading to God to take the rage. One night, God said to her, Come unto me, all who are weary and heavy laden, in her desperation she repented of the hate and gave God the weight of her pain and bitterness. I want to say that again. She repented. She then asked for God to forgive her. As she felt the freedom of this forgiveness from God she came to a point of being able to then extend freedom to the very people who stole her child. A peace filled her. It's so hard for me to get my hands around this, how to understand somebody forgiving the unforgivable. What started as her desperate plea led to repentance, forgiveness, and peace. This one mother's forgiveness and peace has been noticed by many. Other parents who had lost their children longed for this peace in their souls, and they were moved by her story. As soon as they chose, excuse me, and soon they chose repentance, and eventually they were able to forgive. This group of parents has grown to many. This was so extraordinary, so extraordinary, that it caught the eye of area pastors. Many of these pastors had lost their courage and voice. They were numb by the years of war between the rebels and the Ugandan army. They had also grown distrustful of each other. Yet when they saw these parents and heard these stories of forgiveness, something happened in their souls. Their faith was moved. This new faith mobilized the pastors to reconcile and unite with one another. The Gulu area has a deep generational tie to witchcraft. And in the center of this rebel area is a rock outcropping. At the base of this rock is a pool of water that was thought to have such strong demonic power that if you simply touched the water, you would die. It was also considered a great source of strength for the rebel leaders. With new courage and faith, these pastors went into this area. With the Ugandan army there to protect them, Yet standing behind them out of their own fear, these pastors walked into this evil place, prayed over the pool of water, asking Jesus to break the power of the enemy. Soon these pastors were jumping in the water, splashing, and even drinking of it. When some of the soldiers from the Ugandan army saw this, they fell to their knees. They repented and asked Jesus into their lives. and soon they were being baptized in this same water. Some generals of the Ugandan army have heard this, and now they know that this is not a conventional war, that this is a spiritual war, and this has led to a new strong connection between the pastors, the army, and the government of Uganda. The army now believes so strongly in the spiritual component of this war that there's a general on their staff in the army that is a trained intercessor. This has been considered the breakthrough that has turned the tide of this 20-year war and in a sense, going from 60,000 night commuters to seven has happened because of this. This all began with one mother's desperate act of faith. I wonder, I wonder if we're desperate enough. I'd like to introduce you to our friend Sam this is Sam with Tom McClellan from Open Door we spent a lot of time with Sam in Gulu as we traveled one morning Sam told me his story Sam's father was an educated man who worked for the government Sam was 16 and one night the rebels came into his village to his home and broke down the door of their home the rebels told his father to come with them he refused they told him that if he didn't come they'd kill him in that moment his father made a decision he turned kissed each child kissed his wife and said goodbye that was the last Sam ever saw of his father now years later Sam is the area director for World Vision in Gulu Sam is in a strategic position to help those formerly abducted kids become whole again. One day, Sam wore his World Vision shirt and it had this statement on the back. I have come home from Africa with a deep, deep wonder about a lot of things. I wonder about the beautiful and brutalized people of Uganda. I wonder about a son forgiving those who killed his father, about children's soldiers forgiving each other. I wonder about parents forgiving those who stole, raped, and killed their kids. I wonder who is this Jesus? This Jesus who can bring redemption out of this kind of horror. This Jesus who can make it possible to forgive the unforgivable. I believe we have been given a gift from Hulu. I believe Jesus is showing us how to forgive in a way that is so dramatic. This Jesus whose work through a mother's repentance, forgiveness, has changed a nation. Is there hope? There's hope. There's hope in Hulu. and there's hope in here. There's hope in this church and there's hope in this country. Jesus is that hope. Thank you. Dave is, Dave was gonna be here and Dave's mom died early Friday morning and he is where he should be. He is with the family in Florida. But Dave spent some time Friday morning videotaping his piece and this is a piece that he wanted to to wrap up what we've been talking about. So if you'd listen to that, that'd be great. I know Steve just told you why I'm not there with you this weekend. I appreciate your prayers and support for our entire family. My mom was a great lady. But our entire family has a very strong sense that my mom is not only with the Lord, but she is with my dad. And we're actually very grateful about how this whole thing has happened and what this is all about. So thank you very much for all of your support. It was a couple weeks ago that Todd Burleson came and met with our elder board. Todd being one of our elders, his check-in was about the very story that he just got done telling you. And when I heard the story, the first thing I thought of when he told the story of forgiving what was unforgivable, quite frankly, the first thing I thought of was this, love wins. Do you remember that theme? We had that theme for several weeks prior to Easter, including Easter. And one of the key phrases in that whole thing was this, when the worst that man in hell could do to inflict pain, humiliation, and death as embodied in the cross was met by Jesus on the cross with forgiveness, generosity, inclusion, and grace. The forgiveness being Father forgive them, the inclusion being the extension of grace to the thief on his side. It was as if for the first time in history, Evil was being overcome, not with more evil, but with good. And one of the themes that we landed on with that was that very act of Jesus' death, extending forgiveness while he is being abused so horribly, changed the way the universe works. Because now, because of death, the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ in power, now love wins. Love wins now. Love wins. Can at one level sound like mush, to tell you the truth, a bit romantic, something we'd all like to think. Isn't that a nice thought, that love wins? But in the real world, where you and I live, it doesn't work, not really. It evaporates like the morning mist from the midday sun, and then I hear a story like the one Todd and Steve have told you this morning. So when I heard this story, I was overwhelmed. quite frankly, encouraged and challenged, that in one of the darkest places on the planet right now, love wins. This really is true, you guys. The gospel of grace is bigger than we thought, and living this way really does have power to break the power of evil. Evil, Steve used the phrase in some of our preparation that this was evil with skin on. We talk about Jesus with skin on. This was evil with skin on, what was happening to these young children. And among the other things that I was struck with, as Todd told this story, and it was, again, quite moving and challenging, a bit disturbing, actually, to me, was how humiliatingly petty I and we can sometimes be with what we decide is unforgivable. And I don't even want to talk to you about it. I don't want to admit to you, but I'm sure some things are stirring in you when someone doesn't say hi or some minor offense and sometimes significant offense, abuse, and things that should not have been and should not be. But this word that Steve and Todd have shared today is bigger than a story. Isn't that amazing? It calls us to live a different kind of life, to be followers of Jesus in a way that could be frightening but incredibly liberating. And another thing that struck me about this very quickly is how the power of God moves into obedience and how the power of God is released in this whole concept, in this context of forgiveness. This one woman who decided literally to kind of come out from under the burden of her own rage, began to move into forgiveness. That thing rippled out, as you heard, but nothing else had the power to break, or begin at least to break the power of this demonic hold in this part of the world. And that just speaks to us. I hope you hear. Let him who has ears to hear. Let him hear what the Spirit is saying to our church through this story. A few weeks ago, we began to talk about giving and how central that is to what it means to be a follower of Jesus. And while it's true, this thing of giving is true for us as individuals, it's also true for us as a church to give beyond ourselves, beyond our doors, indeed to be giving precisely when we have some needs of our own. So I want to leave you this morning with two things. One, we want to be a part of this, the story that's unfolding in Gulu. Actually, we are a part of this already, and I think it has to do with just the ability to hear God, Steve's sensitivity to just promptings that he had and a networking of relationships that I just can't explain any other way than the moving of the Spirit and his attentiveness to the promptings of his own heart strategically, supernaturally. We are there, and it's compelling to me. In one of the hot spots of the world right now, the Spirit of God has given us an opportunity to be involved, to make a difference, to just be there, to affect and to be affected by this whole thing. And so the second thing I'll leave you with is this, we want to give. The goal, I think, that we have been talking about is $300,000. I think that matches the other years that we've been involved in this beyond our doors thing. But I've got to tell you, I'm really hoping for, and I hope you kind of get it in your spirit, that we could move ahead and do $330,000 this year. That's the goal, because if we do $330,000, that will kick us over a million dollars of money that is going beyond our doors, beyond ourselves, to the least and the lost. Pray about this. Be involved with us in this. God bless you. Over the last few weeks, you've heard about the storm in North Minneapolis and the boat that we're sharing with the sanctuary ministry there. You've heard about the boat we've been in in southern Uganda where we're involved with child-headed and grandmother-headed households. We're involved with beekeepers who are producing honey, kazava, and coffee, all for people who are infected and affected with HIV. You've heard about the Kawangori slum of Nairobi, Kenya. We're at Huduma Ministries. part of this funding goes to support trade schools that provide for young women and young men who are infected and affected, trade schools that teach them how to build furniture, teach them how to sew dresses. We have a public health nurse at the Kalan Gwari slum who care for women who are infected, help them with their antiretroviral medicines and take them properly. And we'll also be involved in Gulu at the Children of War Center. I'm not sure how, but we'll wait for proposals from the sanctuary. We'll wait for proposals from southern Uganda. We'll wait for proposals from Kawangori Slum. We'll wait for proposals from Gulu. And I just assure you that the monies that you give will be invested wonderfully. And we look forward to providing a presentation next year that gives you another glimpse of what God is doing on the other side through your gifts. Would you stand? And I challenge you to everyone in order to do this this year, everyone, we ask everyone who calls open door your home, everyone to consider prayerfully what part you'd play in this. Paul's words in Ephesians 3, let me close with these words. Now unto him who is able to do immeasurable, immeasurably more than we can ever ask, that we can ever imagine, that we can ever think, that we can ever plan, that we can ever prepare, that we can ever give to, unto him who's able. We're not able, but he's in the boat, and he is able. According to his power, not ours, according to his power, that is alive and at work in us. And as it is at work in us, the unimaginable can happen that'll cause us to ask that question, who is this man? that even the winds, that even the seas, that even HIV, that even evil water can be changed. Lord, I pray that you might breathe over us. Breathe on us. Cause a storm to go on inside of us that we need to go to you about. and whether that's about our resources or whether that's about our forgiveness cause us to not only know and then respond. Lord, the only way I know how to close a prayer is in the name of Jesus. Amen. You're dismissed. Thank you.
