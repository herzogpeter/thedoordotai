Well, thank you so much for that warm welcome and good morning, Church of the Open Door. I am just so excited to be here with you this morning. I have looked forward to this for some time. And as I come, I bring you greetings and good tidings from Sanctuary Covenant Church there in North Minneapolis, where we have just been so humbled and overwhelmed by your partnership in the gospel. And especially just your tremendous outpouring of love and support. So it's good to be here with you all this weekend. And this is service three for me, but I'll tell you, I am just as fired up as I was when I showed up here last night. Because it is just a privilege to be among the body of believers. And, you know, sometimes we lock ourselves into thinking that that has geographical boundary or ethnic boundary or class boundary. But I want to tell you, I feel your worship here, and I hope that you feel this message. I believe that we are just called, all of us, to be about the throne of God together, worshiping and praising God. And so I felt that this weekend, and I just want to thank you all. You know, I had an opportunity to come a little earlier this week and just spend some time with some folks from your prayer ministry. Peggy and Shanie, and oh, I was just so, just tremendously blessed by that. And as we've journeyed together, our churches, I've come to know something of your pastor's hearts, Pastors Dave and Keith, and I've just got to tell you, I am so privileged to be able to call them brothers in Christ and friends, I know, and so I just, plus I know it's no small thing for a pastor to relinquish his pulpit. And so I really just want to thank you, Pastor Keith, and also Pastor Dave, and again, you all, for welcoming me here. You know, there's a song that was out a while back. I'm not going to tell you how many years. But the first verse of that song said these words. It's a song that I've just come to embrace in my life. The first verse was this. I love the Lord. He heard my cry and pitied every single groan. Long as I live, as troubles arise, I'll hasten to his throne. And this morning, I'm going to talk for just a brief time on hastening to the throne. of God. But before we begin, if it's all right with you, I would just like to bow my head and thank this God of ours one more time for the opportunity to be with you today. So pray with me, if you will. Oh, Lord, we just thank you so much once again for the opportunity to be before you in worship today. Lord, I thank you for every facet of this service, Lord. I thank you for the glorious glorious worship songs that we've been able to sing the music that has been played to honor you I thank you for prayers this day Lord and for announcements I thank you Lord that that you have used every bit of this service thus far to honor you to bring glory to your name I thank you for that, Lord. And now, oh God, I just humbly bow before you, and I just yield myself to you completely, and I ask you, Lord, that I would decrease and that you would increase within me. Lord, I am so excited about what you will speak this morning, and I gladly hide myself behind your cross now, that I would not be seen, but that you would be seen all across this place. Holy Holy Spirit of the living Lord, we invite you to come now and move from mind to mind and from heart to heart and speak to us the things of our Father. Speak to us the things of our Savior. Oh, Spirit, have your way in this place. We pray that our God might receive all of the glory and honor and praise that is due him. We ask these things in the mighty and the strong and the amazing name of our risen Savior, Jesus, who is the Christ. Amen. Amen. Well, before I begin, I hope this is all right, Pastor Keith. I just want to acknowledge I have a sister here, and I just want to acknowledge her. Now, she doesn't look like me. In fact, her hair is blonde, and mine obviously is not. And her skin is very light, and mine obviously is not. But she's my sister, and she probably couldn't be closer. And she's been a partner with me in the gospel for many years, and she's taught me so much about prayer. So I just want to say, Mary, I love you. And I'm so grateful to see you. It's good to have you here. So with that, I want to tell you that this morning I have a message for you called In the Throne Room. And the text for this message is found in the New Testament book of Ephesians. Paul's letter, the Apostle Paul's letter to the glorious church. And so if you have your Bibles this morning, you can turn with me to Ephesians chapter 1. And while you're turning there and we're preparing to project that scripture for you, I will just tell you that we know that this particular letter wasn't written just to the church at Ephesus. It was a bit of a circular letter, so it went to Ephesus and some churches around. And it wasn't necessarily addressed to the glorious church, but it was addressed to a church that was experiencing a wonderful move of God. It was addressed to a church that had so many things that were good and that were right. And they were close to being glorious. And so Paul had a few pieces of advice for them that would bring them up to this place of being just the bride of Christ that he called for. So Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 15. And this morning I am reading in the Revised Standard Version of the Holy Bible. Now we're projecting something that's not exactly the same but very close. So I think you'll be able to follow along. Ephesians 1 verse 15. For this reason, because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him. Having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power in us who believe, according to the working of his great might which he accomplished in Christ when he raised him from the dead and made him sit at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and all authority and all power and dominion and above every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come. And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all. in all. Praise be to God for his glorious, his marvelous, marvelous word in the throne room. Well, first of all, I want to just give you a couple of observations on this passage. Just a couple of things that I noticed as I was surveying it. First of all, it's worthy to note that two things have attracted the attention of the apostle as he prays for the body. Their faith in the Lord Jesus and their love for all the saints. Their faith and their love, not their works, not their size, not their programs. Secondly, observe the empowering way Paul prays for the saints. Oh, if we ever need a model of how to pray for one another in the body, if we ever need a model for how to pray for the church universal, we should review the blueprint that the Apostle Paul establishes in his letters. Listen to this. To the Colossians, he writes, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will, to lead a life worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God. Oh, I love that. And to the Philippians, he writes, this might be about my favorite. It is my prayer that your love would abound more and more with knowledge and all discernment so that you may approve what is excellent and be pure and blameless for the day of Christ. Oh, what would happen if we would begin to pray for one another in that way? And in this, his letter to the church at Ephesus and beyond, Paul prays that the Ephesians might be given a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of God. Toward the end, that the eyes of their hearts would be enlightened, that they would understand the hope to which they were called, and the abundance of riches which are stored up for them, and perhaps above all, that they would know the immeasurable greatness of his power. That is, where? Where's that power? Thank you for tracking with me. In us who believe. Oh, church, the power we seek is not far off. his power is in the believer it's in the beloved son the beloved daughter of the living God and it's the same power it's that resurrection power that power that was on display when he raised Christ from the dead and sat him at his right hand side in glory unfathomable limitless power at our disposal So how about that? Now, I am just a very visual person. And so I like to kind of picture things in my head. So if you'll just bear with me, I want to encourage you this morning to picture with me, if you will, the place that Paul is describing in this passage. I mean, just try to imagine this setting. Oh, it's the same setting of which the prophet Isaiah said, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne. He was high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Can you imagine this place around the throne? Can you imagine the majesty? Can you just even picture the tremendous splendor, the unsearchable glory of our God? Isaiah says it was glory so magnificent, even the angels had to cover their faces with their wings. The place Isaiah points to, and the place Paul points to, is the heavenly throne room of God. And so, Jesus, having been raised from the dead, is at the right-hand side of God the Father Almighty in heaven. Where, then, are we? where's the church? Can I show you one more thing? If you kept your Bibles open, I want you to just look down in Ephesians chapter 2. Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 4. Oh, I just want you to see this and to hear this. But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ and raised us up with him and made us sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the coming ages he might show us the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us through him. Oh, it's starting to get good now. Oh, I'm starting to like this part. Are you reading this this morning, church? Are you listening to this word? We have been made alive. We have been raised up with Jesus. We are even now able to sit with him in heavenly places, all past tense. This is the finished work of Calvary. We have a seat in the throne room of God and an opportunity to be in dialogue with our daddy and our savior. Oh, I don't know if you can hear me this morning, church. We have got a prayer chair in the heavenly realms. A prayer chair with each of our names written upon it. And because of our union with Christ, a lion's share of royal status and blessing. Furthermore, as the Gospel of John records, Jesus said, When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth. For he will not speak on his own authority, but he will speak what he hears. and he will declare to you that which is to come. We not only have access because of what Christ has done for us, we not only have a seat, we've got a Holy Spirit transport, one that propels us into the presence of God. The Spirit of God. One who tells us, one who declares to us what is to come. Folks, that's what he's hearing. what's he hearing? the discourse of a father and a son where's he hearing it? in the throne room now if the spirit is our safe passage and our guide what then is our vehicle? my friends, our vehicle is prayer every believer has a seat in the throne room of God where we can have an everlasting audience with the king the problem today is that altogether too many of those chairs are empty now if you know anything about the enemy of god we don't like to talk about him much over at the sanctuary except for to acknowledge that he does exist and he's got one three-pronged agenda that is to kill, steal, and destroy. If you know anything about him, if you've read passages like Revelation 12, which says, woe to you, O earth and sea, for the enemy has come down to you, and he's filled with fury because he knows his time is short. If you've read Ezekiel 28, even Genesis 3, you know about the fact, and I'm not surprised to hear that the enemy was in the throne room before we were in the throne room. Just as the enemy was in the garden before we were in the garden. He knows full well the glory and the majesty that is in the throne room. He's very acquainted with throne room business. You see, he worked for God until iniquity and violence was found in him and he was cast down. And now, you see, we have something that he will never, ever, ever have an invitation for discourse and a place to sit down. But is it any wonder then, is it any surprise to you at all, that the first thing the enemy of God comes to kill, steal, and destroy is our closet time, our prayer time, our devotional life, our very intimacy with God, which is built up and maintained through a life of prayer, oh, I'll tell you, he will do whatever he can to keep us out of the presence of God because he knows there is wonder-working power in the presence of God. He knows there's righteousness, peace, and joy in the presence of God. He knows there's restoration. There is salvation in God's very presence. The Bible says, is it not Christ Jesus who died? Yes. Who was raised from the dead? Who is at the right hand of God? Who indeed intercedes for us? Yes. And again it says, is it not the Spirit who intercedes for us with groans too deep for words? Church, yes. Now over at the sanctuary, we just like to repeat things. So I'm going to ask you to repeat this after me. My Savior is praying for me. His Spirit is praying for me. Oh, church, that's good news. That's good news. We have a Savior and a Spirit who are interceding for us even now. That's good news. Now, simply because Christ is in the throne room, there are many characteristics about it which should compel us to want to be there. But this morning, very quickly, I am going to highlight just three. Three little gift-wrapped packages, if you will, that can be found at the throne. And the first of which the Apostle Paul prayed for the glorious church is revelation. Revelation. The hidden things. The secret things. The deep things of God. The things of which the prophet Joel spoke when he said, In those days I will pour out my spirit, declares the Lord. Your sons and your daughters will prophesy. Your old men will dream dreams. Your young men will see visions upon my men servants. And yes, women of God, even upon my maid servants, I will pour out my spirit, and I will show you wonders in heaven and upon earth. Revelation causes the believer to perceive knowledge and wisdom that is hidden from the rest of the world. For example, the Apostle Paul said elsewhere, in Galatians, as a matter of fact, he said, Listen, look, this insight I have, this knowledge, this gospel I preach is not a gospel of man. I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it. But it came to me through divine revelation by the Spirit of God. In fact, if you know Paul's story, you know that God even blinded Paul for a season. He closed his eyes completely so that Paul, I think, could no longer even see in the natural, but only in the supernatural, according to the Spirit of God. Revelation helps us to see the hidden things of God, the mysteries of God, the deeper things of God. And this is why the Apostle Paul prayed that the church would be given a spirit of wisdom and of revelation. But I have to ask you today, wisdom and revelation of what? Now I just want to zero in on this for just a moment, just a brief moment, because I think this is so important. Many churches, including our own, are praying for God's revelation just now. It just seems to me to be a good prayer to be praying in these uncertain days. Even as we survey the global scene, for some of us who live, work, and worship in North Minneapolis, even as we just survey the local scene, it just seems that that's good praying. Don't get me wrong, those are good prayers. Many churches are praying that God would give them revelation. And so we just pray for knowledge of what is to come. We pray for wisdom about how to proceed. We pray for insight as to where and how to most effectively position ourselves for his work in this earth. Those are good prayers. But we miss out when we don't read the text thoroughly or closely. because the Apostle Paul is saying here, I have prayed for you that you might be given a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him. I'm not praying that you would receive general or even special revelation about general things. I have prayed that you would receive revelation about who he is. I want you to know him. I want you to know who he is. I want you to know who he says you are. I want you to apprehend and to internalize what is the report of the Lord for your lives so that you don't have to be tossed to and fro believing the report of the world about you. I want you to know above all things, before anything else, I want you to know him. This is what Paul is praying for the church. Because friends, everything else flows out of that. Everything else flows out of that deep place with God. Everything else flows out of that place of intimacy. His mission, his purpose for our church. His mission, His purpose for your life. His mission, His purpose for the nations. It flows out of our knowing Him. And this is why Paul prayed that the church would receive that. Oh, I want to tell you today, friends, that prayer informed by the power of the Holy Spirit is the means by which we ascend to the throne and engage God. It is the means by which we come into his presence and get filled. It is the means by which we get to that place with God and then get our marching orders for the rest of life. I want to make a statement here today. It's a bold statement. You would think I'd been in this pulpit before. I just want to say this, so I have to say this. Because I want to contend that if we are not in the throne room, if we are not bowed low before God in our hearts, then we're just really not even in the place to receive the revelation. You see, the throne room, well, it's kind of like the Pentagon of heaven. Listen, when our nation's leaders gather together and take up a discourse on personal or national security, When they talk about strategic next moves and other such sensitive subjects, they don't have those conversations out on the White House lawn. They take those things up in the council room, in the boardroom, in chambers. I want to tell you, that's where the action really is. And so it is in heaven. The strategies of God are discussed in the throne room. Church, the battle is waged And by the way, the victory is won in the throne room The foundation for every plan is laid in the throne room And guess what? You and I have a seat there It's where we're purposed to be Revelation Revelation in knowledge of God. Revelation of the hidden things, the deeper things. It's gift-wrapped at the foot of his throne. Well, if you'll let me, I want to tell you about one other thing. Well, maybe a couple other things. At least one more thing that is gift-wrapped at the foot of the throne for us. And that is called authority. Authority. Listen, Ephesians tells us right here in chapter 1, verses 20 and 21, that God has raised Christ to the dead and set him at his right-hand side in glory, far above all rule and all authority, all power and all dominion, above every name that is named in this age and also in that which is to come. And he has put some things under his feet. Oh, someone's tracking with me. I hear you. Okay, okay, okay. He has put most things under his feet. Oh, bless you, saints. He says in his living word that he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things. Jesus says, all power and authority has been given to me. All of it. But then he turns around and he does something really interesting. You can read about this in Luke chapter 10, verse 19. He says to his disciples, but behold, I give you power, and I give you authority to tread upon serpents. I give you power over the enemy, and nothing will harm you. I've given you power. I've given you authority. Oh, if we could just catch a revelation of that. There is some authority that is associated with the seat that we have in Christ Jesus. He said, if we would just have faith in God, and if we would believe and not doubt that whatever we have asked of him will happen, get this, we could speak to the mountain, and the mountain would have to move. Now I want to just, can I just take a minute to talk about timing though? I think it's so important. We just have, you know, and I could preach a whole sermon about timing, so I just really, just one minute, because it's so important. I heard a preacher say it really in a marvelous way at a leadership conference I was at last week. He said these words, God is always on time. But he passes by plenty of opportunities to be early. God is always on time. I just love that. He is always on time. He says if we speak to the mountain, if we believe and do not doubt, if we have faith in God, the mountain has to move. But he never promised us that we would see the manifestation of that mountain being moved. And so if you're like me, our tendency is to give up. Our tendency is to stop praying. Our tendency is to be concerned. Maybe, God, you're not hearing my prayers because I haven't seen it. God said all you have to do is trust me and believe me that what I say is true. If I said the mountain is going to move, it's going to move. Don't stop praying. Listen, I'm in North Minneapolis, where this summer we have launched what we call prayer transformation, 90 days of peace and power. and after reviewing the criminal statistics of our communities last summer, we said there needs to be something drastic that has to happen here and so we said we are going to collaborate with other churches in these communities, we are going to collaborate with community development agencies, we are going to get together and we are going to take this thing by force through the power of prayer because we just believe that God has a work he wants to do on the north side of Minneapolis. So we began to pray and we began to meet in other churches and pray and we began to take these prayer walks. We have one coming up at the end of this week where we would walk around the community and just flood it with prayer and with God's spirit. And do you know what happened shortly after we began to pray? Oh, it got worse. More homicides. People began to get killed. One day I walked out to my car just outside of Sanctuary Covenant Church offices and 10 feet away, a young man had been slain in the street, right across from where I work. It got worse. But do you think we gave up? Do you think we said God is not here, he's not working? It seems to me that that is evidence that God is there and that he is working because it seems to be escalating in our community. Apparently, we have gotten the attention of heaven and hell, I would imagine, too, because we refuse. We are relentless. We are shamelessly, unapologetically hopeful and in the know that God wants to transform North Minneapolis. He wants to bring life. We just know it. And so we pray all the more. If I can just be transparent with you, you know, I used to be that kind of a Christian who would give up kind of easily. In fact, you know, if I can just be really honest, I used to be what I like to call a bit of a grocery shopping list Christian. And of course, you know, I just get that pen and paper out the night before. And I just write all the things down. And I knew when I got into that prayer time in the morning with the Lord, I was just going to have his agenda all set. And so I would go to the prayer time and I would set forth the list. And I would say, okay, now, Lord, you know, I've got to go here today. And I've got to see this person today. And I have to talk with this person. and I've got a minister to this person and I've got this to do and that to do and I have to shop and I wouldn't mind if you would heal my mom and I wouldn't mind really if you would take care of that little car problem I'm having and boy, we could use some additional finances. So here are all the things that I really need you to do today, Lord, and I'm going to need you to show up in power. Here's my list. If you could just really pay special attention to this list and make sure you come through for me on all the things I need, I'm going to be in good shape today. Thank you. Have a good day. I was just that way I don't know if your laughter indicates that some of you have been that way also and when I wouldn't see the hand of God moving in every single thing I requested of him I would get a little discouraged but what God is teaching me as I mature in him as I continue to be a student of prayer before him is that his plan transcends my mere personal authority. It goes beyond me. It was never meant to be just for my for and no more. It goes beyond just me. And he began to minister from the parable that Jesus told in the Gospel of Luke where he said sometimes we get to the banquet table and we take a low station, but occasionally the master will come by and say, friend, go up higher. Let me illustrate. My husband and I were traveling not long ago. We were heading out west. We were having just a really a great flight. It was a good flight. We were just clipping right along until we got to Colorado. Now, no offense to any Colorado people. We just happened to be flying there. And the plane began to shake. Really violently, really suddenly. Turbulence. Just turbulence or so I thought. Those of you air travel, you know how it is. Turbulence. But it was some kind of turbulence. Turbulence. And so the fasten seat belt sign came on, and all of a sudden we heard the voice of the pilot. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your pilot speaking. I've illuminated the fasten seat belt sign because we've begun to experience a few bumps. I thought you'd think. Unfortunately, all the planes flying over this route today are reporting a rough ride as we cross through the front range of the Colorado Rockies. We should be through the worst of this in about 10 to 15 minutes. And no sooner had he said it than our plane began to bounce. It began to bounce. I mean, it was skipping across that sky. Folks, it was skipping across that sky like a polished stone across a calm pond on a cool day. Skip, skip, skip. And then all of a sudden, it banked. And we were almost on our sides. And then it swerved and it banked to the other side. And people were screaming. Things were flying. I don't know. I'm really holy, but I might have even let out a yelp myself. It was about one of the scariest things I'd ever encountered in my entire life. And as the pilot struggled to get control of that plane, he came on and he spoke something else, something so revelatory, if not prophetic. He said, ladies and gentlemen, hold on. Hold on, ladies and gentlemen. But then he said, We're going to attempt to remedy this situation by adjusting our altitude. In other words, we're going to go up higher. And just that quickly, the plane began to accelerate, and he began to climb to a new height, and within what seemed to be just a few moments of elevation, that turbulence, that storm-like condition, That thing that had caused our palms to sweat and our hearts to beat and our mouths to get dry and some of us to think, wow, this must be the end for sure, was calm. It was calm. Altitude gives us perspective, doesn't it? Friend, go up higher. I wonder if God is calling some of us to go up higher this morning. To go up higher. Authority causes us to be able to go up higher. And then we realize it's no longer all about our grocery list. It's no longer about what's just personal, about what's just relative, about what's just on our radar, because we understand that God's got that. He's got that. But then we begin to pray beyond us. We begin to see a need to pray for the church and its leaders without ceasing. We begin to see a need to pray for the lost, fervently to pray for the nations. And soon you know what happens. Every nation, every kindred, every tongue, every tribe that God gave his son as an inheritance in this earth is not beyond the scope of our prayers. He transforms our itty-bitty view into this big old world view and we begin to pray with what I like to call throne room authority. Authority, revelation, revelation and authority. It's for the believer at the throne. Well, there's one more thing as I come to my close. It's called utterance. You know, we're not going to turn there, but I would like to just have you note that it's in Ephesians 6, 18 and verse 19. God wants to give us one more thing, and that is utterance. Paul said, pray for me that I might be given utterance to proclaim the mysteries of the gospel, to speak with holy boldness as I ought. There is utterance gift-wrapped for us at the throne because God wants to make a deposit in our lives. He wants to speak something to us in the prayer room, in the throne room, that will cause us not only to experience victory in our own lives, but to go out of here today and speak life and victory to someone else. He wants to give us some utterance through the power of his Holy Spirit that would cause us to be able to speak life in our neighborhoods, life in our own homes, life in our communities, life in our churches. Utterance. It's a wonderful thing. And I want it because God wants me to have it. Revelation, authority, utterance. Friends, this prayer business, it's transforming. And it's not all that difficult. I've told you a little bit about the throne room today. I've told you who's in it. I've told you what's in it for you when you get there. I've even told you how you get there through the power of the Holy Spirit. Can I just tell you before I go where it's at? It's in your living room. It's in your bedroom. It's in your laundry room. It's in your car on the way to work. It's in your car on the way to school. It's in your closet, Jesus said. It's in your prayer closet. It's right here, right now. It's anywhere that you are where you can tap in through the access that Christ has provided for you, through the power of the Holy Spirit into God's presence. It's anywhere where you can practice that presence and experience intimacy with him. It's really not difficult. it's the place where you can go to cry out or to be quiet it's the place where you can go just to weep before him it's the place where you go to get a knowledge of who he is in addition to what he wants you to do and where he wants you to go it's about intimacy not experience and so my prayer for you today as we close is that you would begin or continue to experience the intimacy with God that is there for you through the power of prayer. It's not about a dialogue or not about a monologue either. It's about a dialogue. You speak, he listens. He speaks, you listen. It's a wonderful place to be at the throne room of God. And so as we close today, I am just persuaded that you're all in a seat you all happen to be in a chair right now and so I'm going to close us in prayer but I would ask you this morning well it's afternoon now I would ask you this afternoon as I begin to pray for you and to close this service of worship if you might not just imagine that the place where you are sitting right now is the holy throne room of God just imagine that you are in the presence of God who is on the throne and Jesus who is at his right hand side and the spirit who is washing over that setting hearing what the father is speaking imagine right now that you're at the throne and begin to cry out to him cry out to him for your needs or the needs of others begin to cry out to him maybe you're here today and you would say wow, my prayer life, boy, I just don't know, Cecilia. It feels dry. It feels like a wilderness. It doesn't feel like any of that stuff you talked about. Cry out to him. Tell him that. He knows all of our needs before they roll off our lips anyway, but tell him, Daddy, I want intimacy with you. So let's pray. I'm going to pray now and just begin to cry out and tell God the secret things of your heart. with belief that he is hearing them. Lord God in heaven, we come. We come in the name of our Savior, Jesus, who is the Christ. And we come by the power of his Spirit. And we just say thank you today, Savior, that you are praying for us. We say thank you, Spirit, that you are interceding for us. You're groaning for us even now. And so we bow low before you in our hearts, oh God. We sit before you in these seats that you've given us with Christ on high. And we just begin to cry out that we need you, oh Lord, how we need you. We need you every moment. We need you every hour. We need to know you. God, we want intimacy with you. We want to be in your presence so that we can hear your heart and your mind. We need you. And so, Father, all across this place, I just pray for your saints right now. And I pray, Lord, that you will meet them at their points of needs, the things that have been spoken in prayer and even those which have not. And I pray, Lord, that you would meet the one who says, yes, that's what I want. I want a deeper prayer life with you, Lord. Yes, Father, meet them right now in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus. Meet us all, O God, as we go from this place, because we want your utterance to be able to speak of who you are to those in our circles. Give us that, Lord. Thank you for your authority and power now. And thank you, oh, thank you for your holy word. Lord, we give you all of the glory and all of the honor and all of the praise this afternoon. and we ask that you would go with us now and that you would stay with us forevermore. And we say to you, Jesus, we'll stay in you. We'll stay in you. In the mighty name of Jesus, we pray with thanksgiving. Amen. Amen.
