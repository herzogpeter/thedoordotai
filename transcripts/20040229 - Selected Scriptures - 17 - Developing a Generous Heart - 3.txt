We are dealing, as most of you know these weeks, with what it looks like and what it means to have a generous heart on what we're calling, in a broader context, the journey of the heart. A generous heart is embodied for us in the life of David, who had, among other things, a very generous heart. But a couple of weeks ago, we realized that even more than David's heart, this reality of a generous heart is revealed to us and embodied in the life of Christ, who for the joy set before him endured the cross. Who for the joy? What joy was that? I didn't see any joy in the clip we just saw. The joy set before him was simply this, that by his act of sacrificial love, extravagant generosity where he gave everything he had because of that generosity. We who were far off have been brought near. We who were strangers to the covenant of promise, we who had no hope and were without God in the world were brought near by what? The blood of Christ. In other words, the extravagant generosity of God who gave everything he had. Point is this issue of a generous heart begins with God's generous heart, the embodiment of a generous heart. Last week I was on the phone with Ephraim Smith, who spoke here last week. Did you enjoy him or what? You know, first thing I did, I said, Ephraim, I just need to talk to you. This is a little embarrassing, but you know, and I'm not real sure what to do with this. I know you're just starting out in your church, but we really need to send you a bill for the hole you blew in our roof. It was just very weird. We talked about it. I actually did say that to him. We talked about a number of things, and he had just gone to this movie, the Passion movie. He told me, he says, you know, Dave, I often struggle with these religious films, depictions of Jesus' life. It's almost always white people. It's hard for me to relate. You might recall one of the first sermons Ephraim ever preached here months and months ago was his struggle as a young man with perceptions of heaven. All the pictures or depictions he ever saw of anybody in heaven, they were all white people. So where am I? How do I fit in this picture? was his struggle. And then he added, though, this movie that he saw. It didn't bother me. It didn't bother me because in this movie, Jesus wasn't white and he wasn't black. He was red, covered with blood. He gave everything he had. When I talk about generosity, you have to start with God. 2 Corinthians 8, 9, for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, who though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor. What does it mean he became poor? It means he emptied himself, Philippians 2, of all the rights and riches and privileges that belonged to him as God, taking the form of a slave, becoming obedient unto death, even death on the cross. In order that we, through his poverty, through his extravagant giving of himself, extravagant generosity, Through that, we might be made rich. We might be brought near. We might be redeemed. We might be reclaimed for God. He gave everything he had. Making this issue of a generous heart absolutely central to the gospel that we preach and profess to believe for a generous heart is the kind of heart God has. also making a generous heart one of the primary indicators, revealers that you know God, makes a generous heart one of the primary indicators that you've been affected by God, that you're engaged in an authentic relationship with God, thereby becoming more and more like God, who is, among other things, primarily generous. He gave everything he had. And it is, I believe, the primary reason why David, whose life we are studying, in spite of some very serious flaws in his life, some of them we haven't even gotten to yet in our journey of the heart, in spite of those flaws, David in Scripture is referred to, as you know, a man after God's own heart because David had a generous heart. In other words, he had the kind of heart God has. We saw his generosity, first of all, toward that Egyptian slave starving in the deserts. 1 Samuel 30. This Egyptian who would have been so easy to ignore, so easy to run right by. I got problems of my own. You remember the story. The Amalekites had come and taken the women and children, burned Ziklag to the ground. They were trying to find them. But in the middle of that, David and his men stopped, gave him water to drink, fig cakes to eat. His generosity was seen there not so much in how much he gave. He didn't give that much, just some water and some cake. The generosity was seen, rather, in that he noticed him at all. We talked about generous eyes. He had generous eyes and had the capacity to notice people who were easy to ignore. We saw his generosity again in his sharing the spoils of war with the 200 men left behind at the Brook Besser. And when the wicked and worthless ones among them complained at David's generosity, wanting to share the spoils with these who didn't look like they did very much, David's response, 1 Samuel 30, 23, With what the Lord has done for us, you guys, how he has kept us and delivered us, how can we be anything but grateful? And from that gratitude, generosity flows extravagantly. So, David, just with his generous spirit, makes it very clear that he understood grace toward people who didn't deserve it. Understood grace. You know, we talk like that. We talk about understanding things. Do you understand grace? I'm a preacher, and I want you to understand grace. David didn't understand grace. He was full of grace. It just flowed out of him. So what are you full of? That's a good question, isn't it? What are you full of? Because whatever flows from you is what you're full of. It might be a good time right now to stop, not listen to the rest of the sermon, and do some work with God. What are you full of? Jesus was full of grace and truth. Jesus, the son of David. David, a man after God's own heart. We saw his generosity again in that marvelous story of Mephibosheth. The story, I absolutely love it. There's so many dimensions of it we could go into, but I saw it as the embodiment of the gospel. When David spoke to Mephibosheth, Mephibosheth, who had been living in a faraway land, taken there by people who didn't trust the heart of the king and grew up with false impressions of the king who was David's. He didn't know the king's heart. He didn't ever hear his voice. And so when the king came looking for Mephibosheth, Mephibosheth was afraid. First words out of David's mouth, the king's mouth to Mephibosheth, who I think, by the way, these words are God's words to the Mephibosheths of the world, the Mephibosheths being lost humanity. Men and women who today are living in a faraway place, far away from God. They don't know his heart. They've never heard his voice. Here's the voice of God to you, Mephibosheth. Don't be afraid. I want you back. I will restore everything you have lost. I invite you to my table. I include you in my family. So come and eat the bread and drink the wine. Generosity embodied the gospel. Finally, we saw David's generosity in his physical giving of his physical resources, his silver and his gold, to the building of the temple in 1 Chronicles 29. And when he gave so generously to that endeavor of all of his wealth, this time his generosity was contagious. You might remember it. We spoke of it a couple of weeks ago. For the people became generous as well, infected, as it were, by the generosity of their king, resulting in two things as they gave generously, not only the king this time, but his people as well. First of all, they rejoiced. There was a big party. Look at 1 Chronicles 29, verse 9, first of all. It says this, they rejoiced because they offered so willingly, with a whole heart, and David also rejoiced. And the second thing they did, they worshiped. Verse 10 says this, so David blessed the Lord in the sight of all the assembly, and David said, blessed art thou, O Lord God of Israel, our Father forever and ever. Verse 13, now therefore our God we thank thee and praise thy glorious name. But who am I, and who are we, who are these people that we should be able to offer this generously to you? Here's who we are, and here's why we can do it, because everything we're giving to you came from you. And from your hand we have given to you. So it's kind of weird, God, Everything we're giving you, it's actually yours to begin with. This is kind of weird. And we're just grateful that you've given us so much so we can give it to you. Verse 15, see, here's how we see ourselves as sojourners before thee and tenants. We don't own this stuff. It's not our stuff. As all our fathers were, our days on earth are like a shadow and there is no hope. That doesn't mean he's a hopeless person. He's meaning that I'm not going to find my life and the fulfillment of my life in this stuff. We're tenants here. I have a different home. I'm living in a bigger story. verse 16 oh lord our god all this abundance that we have provided to build the house for thy holy name it is all from your hand and all of it is yours verse 22 so they ate and drank that day before the lord with great gladness and i don't think i'm reading into the text if i just add of heart gladness of heart two things to notice there in this extravagant generosity at the end of David's life. In fact, if you read the next verse in 2 Chronicles, Solomon now becomes king. So from beginning to end, there's this generosity, this grace that just flows from David. But two things, just to notice quickly, from this last expression of generosity. Number one is this, a perspective that David had on and a relationship with physical things, physical resources, silver and gold, that lived as if it's not my stuff. We saw that in verse 15, we are sojourners, tenants. Our days on the earth are like shadows. Verse 16, all of this abundance we're providing for you is from you. It's all yours. It's not my stuff. It never was. By the way, Abraham had this same posture of life as well. Some of you might remember what we've taught on it before. Genesis chapter 14, verse 22, Abraham says this, with his hands raised, Lord God most high, possessor of heaven and earth, everything I have came from you and belongs to you. And from that posture of life, acknowledging that it's not my stuff, out of that posture he gave a tenth of everything. He had the second thing that marks this kind of generosity is joy. It's all through this story in 1 Chronicles 29. It says, verse 9, Then the people rejoiced. David also greatly rejoiced. Verse 17, So now with joy we give generously from the heart. Verse 22, So they drank and ate before the Lord with great gladness of heart. But all of that, for me, raises a question that I want to deal with now for the rest of our time. The question is, what kinds of things can rob us of that kind of joy? The kind of joy that is so clearly the product of a generous heart. Let me rephrase this. What kind of things can hinder us from embracing this perspective that David and his people so obviously had? It's not my stuff. that can hinder us from experiencing this joy, this gladness of heart around the releasing of their resources that David and his people so obviously had. Well, actually, I thought of several things that can hinder us from that. I'll just give you the biggies. The first, most obvious is this. An unredeemed, unbelieving heart can certainly hinder this perspective and this experience. and as I said a moment ago, maybe it is too obvious to mention actually. Maybe it goes without saying. I don't think it does go without saying. See, I just need to tell you, even as I stand here in ways that would compel you to move into things, I don't have any hope. And I don't even, I'm not eager to spend a whole lot of energy trying to convince someone who is still living in a faraway land. Now I want this person to come near, but I don't have any hope that someone who doesn't know the heart of the king, who's never heard his voice, who's never come to his table, who's never tasted his food, who's never drunk the wine of the Spirit of God, who's never experienced the amazing grace of God, the extravagant generosity of God, to embrace this perspective on their things that it's not my stuff. I'm not even gonna, I don't have any hope that an unbelieving, unredeemed person would ever adopt this. I don't expect someone who doesn't know the king to have this perspective, but it also, if you put another spin on that, It also means, however, that if you don't have this perspective at all, and by the way, I think we struggle with this perspective from time to time. Life is ebbing and flowing, and we are aware and then not aware. But if this perspective of it's not my stuff never even dawns on you, it's not even on your radar screen, it's never even occurred to you, absolutely foreign to you, it may be because you don't know the king. It may be because, I mean, you go to church, but it may be because you've never heard his voice, you've never tasted his bread, you've never experienced his grace, Because people who do give it away. So the first and most obvious thing that can hinder us from embracing this perspective and experiencing this joy is an unbelieving, unredeemed heart. Second, is a subtle variation of that, and that would be a religious, legalistic, Pharisaic heart. I talked about this a little bit two weeks ago. The reason, by the way, I call this a subtle variation is because it's harder in a Pharisee or a legalist to spot the unbelief because they look like they're believers. Why? Because, well, among others, they give. Remember, the Pharisees gave, they tithed everything they had, even right down to the seeds, dill, mint, and cumin. But there's not much joy and there's not much generosity because to the legalistic Pharisaic giver, their giving never amounts to anything much more than the doing of religious duty, than the covering of religious bases, than the paying of religious dues. It's like they're paying a bill. And I, quite frankly, can't think of many things that kill the joy of giving quicker than the feeling that all you're doing when you're giving is paying a bill. As I throw out that scenario, that paying a bill would certainly separate this from a joyful experience, I need to acknowledge the fact that some of us feel like that from time to time. And I think it's normal, actually, and it doesn't mean you're a Pharisee. See, here's the deal. Anyone who's ever entered into the very necessary discipline of regularly giving, routinely giving, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 16, 2, that on the first day of the week, let each one of you put aside and save, do this routinely first day of the week, and do that in order to give. Anyone who's ever entered into that very important discipline of routinely giving has from time to time felt like all you're really doing is paying a bill. Because when you're in the routine of that, you don't always have an immediate sense of joy and so with what I just got done saying you might have stirred up in me I even gave a little bit ago and I was just going to hear it you know you felt okay about it but am I a Pharisee? well I'm always looking as to whether I'm a Pharisee so the possibility that you're becoming like a Pharisee is there so look at that but not necessarily sometimes the thing that hinders this perspective it's not my stuff and this joy in giving is because we have a religious Pharisee card But sometimes it's not that. Sometimes we have a forgetful heart. Let me talk about a forgetful heart. You know, just about forgetting, I heard a very wise person once say that most apostasy, most apostasy, most wandering away from God is simply forgetting what we know. We forget. And because we forget, we need to be reminded of things we already know. And I'm going to visit some things here that we already know, that we've already heard, I think, if you bend open door, about giving in the kingdom of God. One of the biggies that I think we already know, that in the context of the kingdom of God, we need to be reminded of in order to realize this isn't just this debt we owe. when we're giving. It's a seed we sow, making our giving fundamentally different than the paying of a bill. Consider the farmer, says Paul, in 2 Corinthians 9, verse 6. He sows his seed, and then he reaps. He has to wait sometimes, but he sows the seed. Now I say this, verse 6, 2 Corinthians 9. The one who sows sparingly, you're all careful and worried, oh no, if I give this seed away, I won't have anything, is going to reap the same way. And he who sows bountifully, generously, is going to reap the same way, generously. Verse 10, now he who supplies seed to the sower will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness. I promise you, says God through Paul in that verse. Let me break that verse down for you as it relates to what we're talking about this morning. Every farmer has costs. Every farmer has expenses to do what they do, bills, if your will, that they have to pay. They have to pay for land. They have to pay for labor. They have for equipment. They have to pay for gas to put into the equipment. They also need for a lot of money. They also have to pay for seed. But seed, in the mind of the farmer, and The money they have to pay for seed is fundamentally different than all these other things because unlike equipment which depreciates and breaks down and unlike fuel that gets burned up and consumed, seed when planted, given, multiplies and grows. Often, multiplying and growing into something very different and much bigger than the seed itself. I want you to think about that analogy. I mean, if I were to have a seed up here, of a, I don't know, a bush of some kind. I'm not into this very good, but the seed doesn't look like a tiny, oh, I can see the little leaves, and there's the roots, and it's, no, and then I put it in the, no, it doesn't look at all like a bush. It just looks like a seed, and then it becomes a bush. That seed planted grows into something that looks very different than the seed. It's much bigger than the seed, and it doesn't just apply to money. Get the analogy and let your mind expand with it. See, this is why that cup of cold water given in Jesus' name, all it was was a cup of cold water. It didn't look like evangelism at all. Do you get that? Here, I'm going to evangelize you. And you do a kind thing, or you love someone, or you do a kind gesture, or you help someone, or you get involved in their lives, and all of a sudden they're interested in the king that you serve, whose heart you know, whose voice you've heard. Oh, it just looked like a cup of cold water to me. The seed, when planted in the kingdom of God, grows bigger. Not just that, it grows into something that doesn't look at all like the seed. David was helping the starving Egyptian on the side of the road when he was desperately trying to recover his family. This helping of the Egyptian on the side of the road didn't look like a way to catch the Amalekites. It didn't look like that. It just looked like a guy we need to give bread to and water to So they did. And then he trusted David's heart and told him, I know where the Amalekites are, and it became something that God used to help him win the war. Didn't look like that when he planted the seed. He just gave generously, and something happened that looked totally different than the seed, and much bigger. When David's extravagant generosity was poured out on the 200 men at the Brook Besser, when his extravagant generosity was poured out upon Mephibosheth and was manifested in his giving of his resources to the temple, it didn't look at all like what it was really doing. Because what those acts of generosity were really doing were planting seeds for a kingdom that David would rule over that would bless and honor and protect thousands of people for generations. Matthew 13, 31 says this, the kingdom of God in general, just the way it works, the kingdom of God is like a mustard seed. In other words, though it's small, once it's planted, it grows. So the word is plant, sow, give. That translates into real life as this, that the little things we do, the little things, the mustard seed things we say, the mustard seed things we give in Jesus' name once planted, they grow. So here's the word of the Lord. Give and go and do and help. Galatians 6, 9, let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap. If we don't grow weary, doing good, what is that? It's not complicated. Simple acts of love and grace and kindness and service that when you do them seem small, but like a seed they grow. 1 Peter 1. This one encourages me. The Word of God is like a seed. I pray that the Word this morning would be a seed and grow. The Word of God is like a seed. Once planted, it grows. So what do you do? Here's what you do. You study it. You learn it. You teach it. You preach it. You spread it. And you do it in hope that it won't return void. I got news for you. This is not a debt we owe, it's seed we sow, and when it's sown, it grows. And when we forget that, it becomes a bill we gotta pay, I gotta preach Sunday. You know? When we forget these things, it shrinks our hearts. We lose our perspective. It starts becoming our stuff again. When we lose our joy, we have forgetful hearts. We just do. It's okay, but we need to be reminded. Sometimes what hinders us from embracing this perspective, it's not my stuff, from experiencing this joy that David and these people experience is because we have an unbelieving heart. Sometimes it's because we have a religious heart. Sometimes it's a forgetful heart. Sometimes it's a divided heart. Last one, this is it. Jesus spoke to the divided heart this way in Luke 16, you cannot serve two masters. For either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will hold to the one and despise the other. But what I'm really getting at here, he says, is this, you cannot serve God and mammon. Because if you try to do both, it will shrink your heart, it'll steal your joy, you'll lose your perspective, and start to think it's all your stuff. Now, this issue of mammon we've dealt with before here at Open Door for the last several years, actually maybe once a year. Talked about it with the message team and said, you know what? Because we are forgetful, we need to talk about it again. For some of you who are new, you've never heard this stuff. It's fundamental. It's fundamental. Mammon. I want you to understand this about mammon. Be reminded about this about mammon, that while mammon clearly has something to do with money, Indeed, some translations render the Greek word mamonos as money. You cannot serve God in money. Most scholars agree that what Christ is really speaking of here is more than money. It certainly involves money, but it's more than physical coinage that he is speaking to. I want you to understand this about mammon. Be reminded about this about mammon. That while mammon clearly has something to do with money, indeed, some translations render the Greek word mamonos as money. You cannot serve God in money. Most scholars agree that what Christ is really speaking of here is more than money. It certainly involves money, but it's more than physical coinage that he is speaking to and about a rival God. Richard Foster sheds light on this in his book, The Celebration of a Disciplined Life, when he says this. When Jesus declares in Matthew 6 and Luke 16, you cannot serve God and mammon, he is personifying mammon as a rival God. He is making it unmistakably clear that money is not some impersonal medium of exchange, but that behind money, there are very real spiritual forces that energize it and give to it a life of its own. Hence, money is an active agent. It's a law unto itself. It is a power capable of inspiring and then demanding, I would say enslaving you, but then demanding great devotion, worship, if you will, a rival God, if you will. Milton in his book, Paradise Lost, gives even more light to this when he personifies Mammon this way when he says that before the fall, Mammon existed as a spiritual being, much like an angel. And even before the fall, he was thought to be the least upright of all the spirits. For even when Mammon was in the presence of God, before the demonic hordes followed Satan into his rebellion against God, even then the angel Mammon studied the gold of the streets more than the glory of God. And I want you to notice that posture, studying the gold of the streets. Remember the posture of Abraham I gave you a few moments ago? Abraham, who lifted his hands up to God and said this, Lord God, most high possessor of heaven and earth, everything I have belongs to you. And from this posture of life that acknowledges you as God, I come to you open-hearted and open-handed. Mammon's this way. I picture Gollum in Lord of the Rings, my precious. It's about bondage. It's about death. It's what mammon does with that in mind. Understand it this way, that mammon is not just money. It is a spiritual force behind money to which all of us are susceptible. The job of this spiritual, because money itself is not bad or good. It can be used for kingdom purposes. It can be used for other purposes. The purpose of mammon, the spiritual force behind money, is to seduce people like you and me into believing that in money there is life, that in money there is joy and peace and security, and then to believing that, pursue it, attach yourself to it, as if it did have the power to indeed give you life and joy and peace and security. Which, if embraced or if that embraces us, is obviously going to keep us from any kind of perspective that says it's not my stuff. I mean, if we're embracing these things as if it's my life, I mean, we may never say the words, but the clear expression of every fiber of our being is this. It is my stuff. Don't you touch my stuff. all of which raises this question how is the grip of mammon broken well the first thing about breaking mammon's grip is this you need to understand it's usually not broken once for all it's part of the energy I have behind bringing this teaching again because I can look at times in my life and by the way I don't know if it's the most recent time but I remember when we were still at Earl Brown, I did a series that lasted a year on money, sex, and power. Remember that? And at the end of each one, we broke the power of disordered sexuality and disordered power and disordered money, and we consecrated ourselves. It is an incredible thing. Now we're done. Never have to do that again. No, it doesn't work like that because that disorderedness comes back, and we fight with it again, and we forget. Indeed, I believe that breaking the power of mammon in our lives requires a kind of practice discipline around three things. Three R's, I would call them. Redirecting, remembering, and releasing. Let's do the first one, redirecting. Redirecting what? Simply this, your vision. What you're looking at, what you're gazing at. See, it occurs to me that if we've become fixated on the gold down here, that we need something that shines more brightly than the gold. to break the trance. I'm not gonna, if you're into the gold, if it's my stuff, I am not gonna get you to give that to God by wrestling you. I'm not gonna do it. I don't have the energy. You're bigger than me anyway. The only way to do it is if we see something brighter, more glorious, more lovely, more worthy than the gold. Like, oh, I don't, the glory of God. How about that? First step in redirecting, in breaking the grip of mammon is to redirect what you're looking at. Redirect your gaze. So, people of God, look up. Redirect your gaze. We sing a song, turn your eyes upon Jesus. Look full. Take time to do it. Look full in his wonderful face. And the result of that is that the things of earth, not because you were trying to get away from, no, they just don't look as good. They grow strangely dim in the light of something that is far more glorious than the gold, his grace. See, that's why we worship regularly. It's one reason we worship regularly, because it's a practice and discipline of redirecting our gaze. Second, remember. Remember what? Well, remember what we've been talking about for several weeks relative to this generous heart. Remember this. We had a debt we couldn't pay, and Jesus paid it all. We've been saying it this way. The generosity begins with a gratitude that remembers that at one time we were separate from Christ, excluded from the community of faith, a stranger to the covenant of promise. At one time we had no hope and were without God in the world, but now we who were formerly far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ, who gave everything he had. Generosity begins with a gratitude that remembers the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that remembers that though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor, which means he emptied himself of all the rights and privileges that belonged to him as God, became a slave, obedient to death, even death on the cross, in order that we, through his poverty, through his extravagant generosity, might be made rich. Let me ask you a question. Are you interested? Do you have any interest? See, some of you don't. Do you have any interest in breaking the grip of mammon? Any at all? Here's how. Redirect your gaze. Remember the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Third, release. What? Your grip. On what? Your stuff. How? By giving. Richard Swenson says it this way in his book, Margin. There is one act, above all, that has the power to break the grip of mammon by going directly against the law of mammon, an act for which money is not made. That act is giving. When we give money away, we not only neutralize mammon's power over us, but we also bring it under the domain of the kingdom of light. God is honored and his lordship is reconfirmed. quote. But guess what else will happen when you release your grip? You will experience something that you thought the money you were grasping would provide but didn't. You know what it is? Joy. Do you know what kind of joy you will experience? You will experience the exact same kind of joy that God experienced when he emptied heaven of its finest treasure, when he gave everything he had to save everyone he could for joy. This is the gospel. So here's how I want to close today. I don't always talk like this, but God gave me this yesterday morning, not this. God gave me, thank you. Wait a minute. I ruin these moments. oh thank you you turned it off didn't you that was good we're a team it was how to close it was a picture of how to close and the picture I had was to just have some time here at the end we got some time actually to we're going to sing a song and the purpose it's a worship song it's a song that's going to help us redirect our gaze so when we stand in just a moment I want you to redirect your gaze I want you to remember what you've been remembering as I've and speaking the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Remember and redirect. And then I got this impulse, it was weird to sing, I don't know if this is going to be weird. I want us to, we have to release, to give. And I think you'll notice we've already taken our offering. So this isn't going to be another offering. In fact, the word that came to me so strongly was this, is it kind of went from one idea to another here, that we're going to stand and sing in a moment and not pass the plates, but at the exit of all of the doors here, whatever, there will be buckets. And what I want you to do, it's important, and in fact, I think it's important that you do it, that we physically, here in a moment, worship, redirecting, remembering, and then physically release. And here's the deal, where's the money gonna go? It's really important that even as a church right now, that whatever it is that we collect, we release that. It's going somewhere else. I don't know where it's going. And some of you have financial problems right now. I'm not giving you a get rich quick formula here. I'm talking about how the power of mammon is broken. And I think there are going to be things that are broken in your lives and maybe things broken in the life of our church. We have financial problems as a church right now. We're struggling. Everybody is. Who isn't? Isn't boo-hoo. Everybody is. God's telling us to take an offering from people who are releasing. And we're not supposed to keep it. We're supposed to release it. We're doing the discipline together. And I think you need to give. It's about you and God. It's not about a project for us. It's not about our budget. This is a kingdom thing. It's important that you find something and give it. To break the grip of mammon, let's pray. I want to pray. Let's stand, stand. My brain said stand. My mouth said something else. Father, as we enter in now to this brief time of worship, I pray that you would just anoint it and fill it and flow through it and use it to help us redirect our gaze, that that would really happen, and that we would remember the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and then in some very tangible ways give us the energy to release what we need to release. you
