We're returning today to study in the Ten Commandments, Exodus chapter 20. The final three commandments are these, Thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not lie, thou shalt not covet. Taken together, I'm referring to this final section as a call to character. You may recall that the first four commandments dealt with how it is we relate to God. Have no gods before me. Create for yourself no graven images, no idols, and revere my name. The next three commandments dealt with how it is we relate to others. Honor your parents. Don't murder. Don't commit adultery. And while stealing, lying, and coveting all have to do clearly with how it is we treat each other, I want to examine these three in the context of personal integrity. How it is I relate to myself. Why is it that I might not steal, might not lie, might not covet, are all questions and issues that deal with character and speak to integrity. The first one I want to deal with, admittedly out of order, is this. You shall not lie. Proverbs 6, 16 says this. There are six things which the Lord hates. Yes, seven are an abomination to him. They are these, haughty eyes and a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises evil plans, feet that run rapidly to evil, a false witness who utters lies, lying being mentioned twice in the list of seven, and one who spreads strife among brothers. Proverbs 6, verse 12 further reveals that a worthless person or a wicked man is not that hard to identify. He or she is the one who walks with a false mouth, who winks with his eyes, who shifts with his feet, who points his fingers to other people to misdirect you, who with perversity in his heart devises evil things. Proverbs 12, 22 says, lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, but those who deal faithfully in truth are his delight. One of the reasons that lying is such a big thing to God, one of the reasons it made the top 10 list, as it were, is because truth is part of the character of God. Psalm 31 verse 5 says he is the God of truth. Exodus 34 verse 6 says he is abundant in truth. 2 Samuel 7, 28. He is the God, he is God, and his words are truth. Psalm 119, 160 says, His words are true from the beginning. It was said of Jesus in John 1, 14 that he was full of grace and truth. Of himself, Jesus said in John 14, 6, I am the way, the truth, and the life. One of the reasons truth matters, it makes the top ten, It's because truth is consistent with part of the character of God. Understand this, however, about truth, that it's more than simply saying true things. Larry Flint, publisher of Hustler magazine, known as a skin magazine, in the news of late because he's saying true things, gleefully exposing the behavior of people who he considers to be hypocrites in the Republican Party who he thinks are attacking Bill Clinton and that whole thing. And to be sure, the people he is exposing are hypocrites. They have a double life. They have broken their vows. They have committed that that's where he's going. But no one would mistake, I hope, Larry Flint for a man who loves the truth or the God of truth. He doesn't. See, being truthful speaks to things like this, authenticity, reliability, stability, sincerity. It speaks to more than simply lies ever having had passed over your lips. Every person in this room has lied, including me. We are all liars. But a way of life that is about lying is a different thing. We're speaking of people who, in their living, are authentic. They are unmasked. They are undeceived about themselves and their own sin, and they are undeceiving of other people. And because of that, they are trustworthy. And if you know any people like this who speak the truth, whose way of life is the truth, such that even when they speak a lie, they identify it as such and come back around in repentance, you find yourself, even if they speak to you in truth some hard things, very safe with them. There are many ways to lie. Slander, gossip, boasting with exaggeration are all ways to lie. There are little white lies most of us consider harmless, even polite. Is it really necessary to tell the truth about that bad haircut? Well, it depends if they ask you. Don't you hate that? How do you like my hair? I got this moral dilemma. Do I tell them the truth or do I keep my friend? You know. Here, let me just give you some help here. If they ask you, like, how do you like my dress? What do you think of my sermon? Maybe in interactions with me, I just need to let you know this is like fair warning. If you don't want to know the truth, don't ask. Because if you ask, I think you need to tell the truth. You don't have to be mean, but you have to tell the truth. That doesn't mean you have to offer your view of truth unsolicited. You don't have to walk up to total strangers and say, boy, is that an ugly hat. Your nose is huge. You know, it's true. If you've ever had kids, you've experienced this kind of thing. Our oldest daughter, Andrea, was four years old. We'd been at Church of the Open Door for about a year. I was speaking with a man and having a pleasant conversation with him. He was a person that was struggling with some of the changes we were making. In fact, he was strongly opposed to most everything we were trying to do at the time. But we were having a pleasant conversation and maintaining a pretty decent relationship, I think, when Andrea, my daughter, oblivious to what we were talking about, spoke this truth. Boy, are you fat. And then she turned to me, looked up at me and said, Daddy, don't you think he's really fat? I'm going to kill you. My daughter, I'm happy to say, is still a truth speaker. She really is, but at 22, she's learned you don't need to speak every true thing that comes into your brain. Some discernment you need and still be a truth speaker. Sometimes we lie to protect ourselves. This might be where our lies become instinctive almost even before we know we're lying to avoid a consequence. Did you do that? No. And why did I say that? Because now, I mean, I can't. It's almost instinctive. We lie to draw attention to ourselves, to enhance our image. Another place that many of us frequently stumble. And later you feel like, oh, why did I have to make it bigger? What is the source of my insecurity? And by the way, Those are some of the questions of character we ultimately need to go about understanding some of our inner drives that keep us lying. It's not just don't lie that keeps us from doing it. There are things that drive us. Enhancing image, things like that. Sometimes people lie for revenge, turning evil here, sometimes for malice, for control, to get what we want, like the false accusation of a child molestation that isn't true in order to get custody in a divorce settlement. And every time a lie like that is perpetrated, it makes it harder for true victims of child molestation who need to be protected from the molester, makes it harder for them to get that protection because maybe this person who's making the accusation is lying too. And the impact of lies just continues to dismantle an ability for us to even make wise choices because one person lies. Now you who may never lie, I'm going to suspect you because people lie. Sometimes we shade the truth and innocent thing is put in an unflattering light. And now this innocent thing looks bad because of how I framed it. Don't lie, says God. But the ninth commandment, Exodus chapter 20 verse 16, does not simply say don't lie generally. And if you've read the verse, you might be ahead of me on this, because what it specifically says is, you shall not bear false witness, specifically. In other words, you shall not lie under oath, in a court of law. The lying that God is prohibiting in Exodus chapter 20 verse 16 is not just lying generally, though that is in view. It is perjury specifically. Don't bear false, keyword, witness. Oh boy. It has been said that one of the defining moments of American history was the day that John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Most of us remember where we were, who we were with, what we felt on that day when the news came to us. Many have since then discerned that that moment marked for many, it's why it's called a defining moment, the loss of our national innocence, the death of what's referred to as Camelot. Another defining moment, some say, in our nation's history, was the day that the space shuttle Challenger exploded right before our eyes. Again, that's one of those experiences that you remember, where you were, who you were with, what you felt, it was a defining moment. And those who call it that say that what it marked for many was the death of our absolute confidence in science to cure our ills and to protect us. I wonder if one day another defining moment in our nation's history will be identified as the day that William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, looked sincerely, passionately, and convincingly into a television camera and declared to the world unequivocally these words, I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Monica Lewinsky. I will never forget where I was, who I was with, or what I felt when I heard him say those words about a year ago right now. Some of us believed him, some of us didn't. I remember hearing those words and thinking, somebody's lying. And we all know now, he lied. A defining moment? I don't know. If it is, I'm not even sure what it's a defining moment of. But history will record it, if it is. But I'll never forget it. And we've been embroiled in it for over a year. It is with no sense of joy, but with a very strong sense of responsibility to faithfully teach the Word of God and in practical ways apply the Word that we are teaching to our living, that I am going to both this week and next connect our study of the Word of God to the historic events that have been unfolding in our nation's capital over these last several months. I'm going to do this for three reasons, and I want you to understand why. Number one, because it's in the text. I mean, it's really kind of hard to avoid. Remember when we came to, thou shalt not commit adultery, I, you know, I didn't, we dealt with adultery strongly, and just kind of pushed this off, And I came to this, and it was really hard to avoid. When I began the study of an exodus, you need to understand, over a year ago, there was obviously no way of knowing that we would come to, you shall not lie, the very week that President Clinton's impeachment trial was to begin for lying under oath. And by the way, while there has been some public confusion as to why he's on trial, I'm trusting that everyone here understands that President Clinton is not on trial for having sex with Monica Lewinsky. While that is immoral, it's not illegal. He is not on trial for having tried to have sex with Paula Jones. While that is immoral, it is also illegal, but that's still being litigated. That's not why he's on trial right now. What he's on trial for, I think you understand, is because he put his hand on the Bible, and when he did, he swore to God to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and then trying specifically under oath. Thou shalt not bear false witness. In our country, lying under oath is not just immoral, it's illegal. Why? A little history. The reason our forefathers included the oath, so help me God, to courtroom proceedings was because they understood what we, I think, still understand, and that is this, for there to be justice, we have to have truth. And while I understand you might lie to me and you might lie to him and to her and kind of spread this whole thing around, their understanding 200 years ago was this, that even the most callous among us won't lie when the name of God is invoked. And what that assumes is that all of us believe that there really is a God with whom we will have to do. And you might lie here, you might lie there, but you invoke that name, and that will call forth the truth. But again, that presupposes an actual belief in God, who we think actually is real, to whom we will one day be accountable. Without truth, you can't have justice. And without justice, we can't have a civilized society, at least not for very long. That's why it's illegal to lie in an oath, because we need to get to truth if there's going to be justice of any kind. Second reason I'm doing this is because while lying always matters, no matter who does it, the ramifications, implications, and consequences for a people are always greater when a leader lies. That is not just true for a country. That is true for a church. That is true for a business, for a school, for a country. If you work for someone who doesn't just struggle from time to time with embellishing the truth, but has their way of life, winking the eye, shifting the feet, pointing the finger. If that is the way they do business, and that is your leader, that has an incredible effect on you as an employee. James 3.1 says, let not many of you become leaders or teachers, brethren, knowing that as such you will incur a victor, a stricter judgment. Why a stricter judgment? Because leaders, when they lead, lead you into things. And if you lead people into falsehood with falsehood, you affect more than yourself. Proverbs 17, 7 says, lying lips are not fitting for a prince. Proverbs 29, 12 says, if a ruler is given to lies, all their servants will be wicked. Think of that. That sounds like an extreme. How can you say that just because he's a liar, people around him are liars? How does that work? It works like this. If a person in leadership is given to lies, if that's his or her way, again, not just a lie that he stumbles in or she stumbles in once in a while, but that's their way of doing business, I promise you, over time, that person will accumulate people around him or her who are just like them. How do you know that? Why do you think that's true? Here's why. Because the only people who, over time, can tolerate lying as a way of doing business are people who are themselves comfortable with lying. The bad news, therefore, if you are a liar, is this, that you're soon going to be surrounded with liars. How secure would you feel? See, if my way is to wink the eye, to point the finger, to shift my feet, the reason I'm doing that most of the time is to get what I want, to manipulate you to get my way. People with integrity are repulsed by that, and for a while might confront it and give a person room to change. But if that is really the way, people with integrity who love the truth are going to walk away. People who will tolerate that are people who lie themselves. And all of a sudden, you're surrounded with people who lies, and you think you're manipulating them and getting what you want. You need to know everybody around you is manipulating you right back, and you never know who's telling you the truth. I would think that's a scary place to live. Third reason I'm going to deal with this was, for me, the most compelling. It actually, I mean, the text was the strongest, and this was even stronger than that. It's kind of what put me over the edge, caused me to believe I couldn't avoid this. It's because of the response of the American people to the events that I'm describing. The response I'm talking about is this, that the clearer it becomes that our president is not only an adulterer, but a practiced liar, the higher his approval ratings have gone topping. In December, 73%. I looked in the paper yesterday, and a lot of the polls are still right around 70%. My question is this about that. Why is that? Well, the answer that I've been giving myself in my self-talk in terms of trying to figure out that personally is this, that the polls aren't asking the right question. I mean, Dave, be fair to the polls and be fair to the people who are doing this. If the polls were asking, is Bill Clinton moral? Do you think it's okay to lie or have adultery? It could be that the same 73% who say we think he's doing a good job, it could be that that 73% would say, no, he's not moral. He's not truthful. But the question hasn't been, is he moral? Is he truthful? The question has been, is he competent? And 73%, in fact, the more it becomes clear that he has been lying, the higher his approval rating has been going. So just kind of giving the poll people a break, we might be saying, we don't have a portion that vexes me after that, and that is this. Why is it that to some 73% of our population, it doesn't matter that he keeps his vows or tells the truth, even under oath. The answer to that question, I believe, sadly, is found in Romans chapter 1. I want you to turn to Romans 1 with me, where we'll spend the rest of our morning. Why doesn't it matter? Here's why. We have, in my opinion, become a Romans 1, 32 people. A people who, although we have known the ordinances of God, that those who, as a way of life, practice such things. Now, if you're reading, you need to know that I'm kind of going to back up here to verse 29 to tell you what such things are. Such things as envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice, gossip, slander, arrogant boasting, inventing of evil, untrustworthy because they lie. Although we know that those who practice those things are worthy of death, we not only do those same things, but give hearty, keyword, approval to those who practice them as well. I've been senior pastor here at Church of the Open Door for 18 years. In that time, I don't believe you've experienced me as an alarmist about these things, however, I need to say I am alarmed. And it's not just the specific behavior of Bill Clinton, but of our cultural response to that behavior, for it reveals to me things about our moral climate that are of biblical proportion, that are of grave consequence. Let me explain by giving some history. Verse 32 begins by speaking of people who know the ordinances of God. Some of your translations say, you know the righteous judgments of God. Historically, those words apply to us. We are people who have known the righteous judgments of God, with the possible exception of Old Testament Israel. There is no nation on earth that has had more opportunity to hear and know the ordinances of God than the United States of America. Most of us in our culture probably couldn't name them, but most of us in our culture are at least vaguely aware of the Ten Commandments. There is right now a major motion picture at theaters doing very well called the Prince of Egypt. It's based on the Bible. In fact, Nicole, the book of Exodus. Now, I'm not saying the producers of that movie or the actors whose voices contributed to the putting together of that film believe in the Bible or in God. But the fact that one of the top movies in our nation right now is about the Bible and kind of God in general speaks to a reality that there is an awareness of God in the Bible. Belief in that, different story. Awareness of, absolutely. our country was founded on what's commonly referred to as a judeo-christian ethic and i would leave it there i'm not a big parader of we have a christian all of our founding fathers were christians i don't believe they were judeo-christian ethic right and wrong those kinds of things it's hard to hard to deny that it's a weird thing my wife and i last week were i was on a speaking thing my wife was able to come and we were close to a savannah georgia we took uh had a little time we took a tour of savannah georgia the uh historic region of that fascinating city and and as as we're looking at the architecture and all the different things in that place it was interesting that the third building was a beautiful building still standing today third building erected in savannah georgia a couple hundred years ago as pre-revolutionary was a church central to their life was a church john wesley was their pastor it's part of our roots and an awareness that there is a right and wrong immoral and immoral, a true and a false that we can know and base our lives on. Generally, we know about God and the Bible, sin and forgiveness, heaven and hell, and that the wages of sin is death. And not everybody in our culture, this is ridiculous to say that they would, believe that those are true things, that the wages of sin is death, that they believe in heaven and hell. In fact, they might spend enormous amounts of energy debunking heaven, hell, wages of sin is death, even that sin is a word we want to use. But the very fact that they would spend any energy Debunking that means that it's part of what we're aware of. The words of verse 32 are describing and directed to such a people, people who although they know the ordinance of God. Beloved, the sad fact, I believe, is this. A 73% approval rating should not surprise us because we have become a people who regularly do what President Clinton is being accused of. The approval rating, think about it this way, may simply be a mirror of who we are. Could it be, just think, that 73% of the people in America approve of him because we're just like him? Hard to confront something that you do. one editorialist said it this way bill clinton is the man for this culture he's exactly the right guy in every sense of the word because he represents what the culture practices and that is why we're not offended keep this in perspective it's very important that we do everybody lies you lie i lie everybody sins the problem in romans 1 however was not that sin existed sin exists and it exists in this church and it exists right here. The problem in Romans 1, however, was that beyond sin's existence, it had become normalized. Here's the scary real deal about that. When that happens, God does something that needs to get our attention. It's this. He gives us over to what it is we've decided we're going to do. The giving over, verse 24, Romans 1. Therefore God gave them over, verse 26. For this reason God gave them over, verse 28. And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over. What does it mean to give over? Important that you understand. It doesn't mean he blows you up. There are different kinds of judgments. I'm not going to go into all of those simply because of time. There is eternal judgment. That's how there is cataclysmic judgment, like the flood and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. This is not referring to that kind of judgment. This is a judgment that simply says, I am going to remove my hand of restraining grace from you, that internal restraint that would keep you from doing that, not only keep you from doing it, but you know, quite frankly, make you miserable when you do. I'm going to release that from you so you feel great about it. when you sin. It's like God says, you want to do that? I said, no. You're going to hurt yourself if you go there. You just got to do it. Okay. He'll let you do it. And you want to do that too? All right. And you just have to do that too, don't you? Okay. Okay. And it's not like he punishes you. The giving over is, I'll give you what you want. And the design of God in this, I believe, is that when he gives us over, the design is that we get a belly full of this and then come up hungry for real life and for him. I believe, sadly, and I think it's like just something to note. It's certain things intersect in the context of our lives and it's something I've noted. It's this, that as I stand in this pulpit on January 10, 1999, I am and so are you living in a country that God has given over. I do not believe, important, don't misquote me on this, I do not believe that God has given up. But he has, I believe, given us over to what we've wanted. Well, that's a pretty bold statement for you to declare publicly that God has brought this judgment and given us over. How do you know? Here's how you know. When the sins of Romans 1, 29 to 31, what are they? Unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, envy, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice, they are gossip, slanders, haters of God, insolent, on and on and on and on and on. When those sins, past existing, are embraced, normalized, and applauded, don't wonder about this. You are living in a given over culture. Again, it's not the existence of that sin, it's the normalization of that sin that indicates God's giving you over. He's giving you what you want. And the evidence of that God having given us over is not anymore only the Jerry Springer show, which might be one of the best examples of God having given us over. Now it's in the highest office in the land, and it's also manifested in the 73% approval rating. For we are among the people who not only do these things, but give hearty approval to those who practice them. Please note this, the things I'm talking about, getting to a place where God has given you over, is not something that happens overnight. There is a process involved, and we are living in an amazing time in redemptive history where if you're my age, maybe a little younger, certainly if you're a little older, that you have seen this process happen in your lifetime. The process is described graphically in Romans 1, starting in verse 21. It begins here, For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations. Their foolish heart was darkened, professing to be wise, they became fools. Exchange the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and of four-footed animals and of crawling creatures. Step number one in God saying, if this is what you want, I'll just give it to you, is this, that though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God. Step number two is verse 24. Therefore God gave them over in the lust of their hearts to impurity, that their bodies might be dishonored among them. for they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever. Amen. Step number two in our culture is not just the existence of, but the normalization of sexual sin. And again, I just got to, you got to know. I mean, this has happened in my lifetime. I've watched this and saw of you like a movie. Date it. It's got a date. late 60s, early 70s, we experienced what historians refer to routinely as a sexual revolution. In that sexual revolution, we were liberated from the horribly repressive biblical mandates of things like virtue, fidelity, and modesty. In fact, we have reaped so much hurtful realities from that, that even our culture is beginning to realize we need to reel this back in. The absolute shattering of the family. The normalization of the commandment we dealt with a few weeks ago, adultery, no big deal. In fact, remember part of the thing I dealt with with adultery was that in some circles, it's being promoted as a healthy thing, might even spice up your marriage. step number three verse 26 for this reason god gave them more of what they wanted to give them over to degrading passions for the women exchanged a natural function for that which is unnatural and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. Once again, Romans 1 is not going ballistic because these sins exist. These sins have existed since the beginning. Since the beginning, people have not honored God as God. They have struggled with sexual sin. Homosexuality has been a real thing. What Romans 1 is dealing with and exposing and saying that it is an indicator that God's given you over to these things is that when these things become normal, indeed applauded, indeed to oppose them makes you out of step with the 73%. question how can you tell when god's given you over forget about the national implications of this just bring it down to your own heart how can i tell if god's given me over in a certain area here's how you can tell when your sin doesn't bother you anymore that's how you can tell you know some of some of you think you know the judgment god's gonna get you i mean if you keep doing this he's gonna strike you bolt of lightning he'll get you yeah well i i do think god deals that way sometimes. But you need to know that one of the judgments of God is that you get away with it, and you get away with it, and after a while, you don't even care. You know, one of the most precious repentance realities is when people come to me. You've experienced this yourself. You'll be sitting in a service like this, and the thought will come to you that, you know what, I remember four years, I remember four years ago, and you're still walking with God. You love God, and many, but you're sitting there, and you think, you know, I remember four years ago when I couldn't lie. I couldn't lie. In fact, I remember I would even embellish a little thing there and brag and boast, and it would keep me up for three weeks because I made such a fool of myself. And I had to call him, and I had to do this humiliating thing in front of a number of people, the same people that I was going about and saying, you know, I just, I, half that stuff, I, it was true, but this is true, and this is not true, and I'm just an idiot. And then you lost three nights of sleep, and now four years later, you're thinking, I can do that, I can do that, I can do that, like that. Something's been given over. The alarm in Romans 1 is not the existence of sin. It's a normalization of it. Step number four is verse 28. And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God anymore, God gave them over to a depraved mind. Among other things, what that means is simply this. You've come to a point where you are no longer capable of thinking clearly about moral truth. Indeed, you are incapable of discerning between right and wrong, truth and error, moral and immoral. In fact, it goes this far to be incapable of deciding if there even is a right or wrong. I mean, who's to say? We take a poll. 73% say it doesn't matter. Well, then I guess it doesn't. But here's what God says. And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them over to a depraved mind to do things which are not proper, like what? Like this, to be filled, not just to have, but to be full of these things, unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, that's lying, malice, they are gossips, that's lying, slanders, that's lying, Haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents without understanding, untrustworthy because they lie, unloving, unmerciful. And although they know the ordinance of God that those who practice these things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but give hearty approval to those who practice them. So what do we do? How do we respond? You know, I called my daughter, or she called me this week from Kansas City, and I told her some of the stuff, and she says, well, what are you going to do with that, Dad? Just tell them all to despair? I says, yeah, we're just going to despair the whole morning. Fact is, I think far from despair, there are some good news things in this for us. First thing we need to do is pray. I think we need to recognize, just be aware of the fact, and we're not going to talk about this stuff every week, but I do think it's important as a church that we are aware of the fact that we may be living at a critical time in world history. And what we need to know is this, that the darker things become, as despairing as that might feel, the good news in that is this, the darker things really do become in our culture, the more possible it is going to be for people who are experiencing that darkness to be really authentically hungry and ready for some what? Light. There is a positive dimension to this. I really do believe that as this stuff gets further exposed and we begin to really experience the belly full, as it were, of this process we've been in for a long time, that we as a country are primed for massive revival. We're primed for some bad things too, but there is the potential for incredible revival. Because as we do get our belly full of this stuff, There comes in the human heart a hunger for something else, like maybe a different way to live, like maybe a desperate need for amazing grace. What else could turn this around? We need to pray. We need to pray for our leaders. One of the concerns, I have many concerns about this talk. One of them is that it will just stir up a lot of government. We need to pull back from that. We really need to pray for our president. And you know what? I think we would do well to ask God for a heart that would have sincere concern for him as a person. To mobilize people all over the country to pray that this man would come to a saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. Not just for our country, for him. That he would receive gifts of true repentance. And that by his true repentance, he could experience the wonder of amazing grace. Like many of you have when you came face to face with the fact that you were a liar. And you couldn't do anything about the fact that you were a liar. And you had to come clean and you came face to face and you experienced amazing grace. But not until you repented. one of the things that flashes in my mind when I see his face on TV anymore and I'm going to ask God to help me go to a compassionate place and a pray for him place it's this what does it profit a man if he manages to stay in the White House and gain the whole world but lose his own soul I would think that believers would at some point care about him. Something else we can do, we can recognize in this critical time in our nation's history that we appear as lights holding forth the word of life. Philippians 2, 12 to 16 says this, my paraphrase. It's a place where it says, work out your salvation with fear and trembling. You've heard me preach on this. Work out your salvation does not mean work at your salvation. Salvation is a gift of grace received by faith. You can't work for your salvation. What it means is this. Work out into your living the life of God you already have. The reason you have it is you have received it by faith. It's been given to you by grace. That life has come to you. Work out that life in you, into your living where people can see it. Do it with fear and trembling, meaning be a little bit afraid of not doing that. Why? Two reasons. Because this is a God thing we're involved in. It is God who is at work in you. The one who planted his life in you is the one who by the word of his power spoke the world into existence. That God lives in you. We are not playing church when we come together on these weekends. We are not here to play spiritual patty cake. Don't you feel better when you go to church? God lives in you. Work out that life out here where people can see it, because it's a God thing. Second reason that's important is because in a crooked and perverse generation where evil men and imposters are growing from bad to worse, people of authentic faith who have the genuine life of God in them, working through them, are that generation's only hope. final thing is this we need to look to ourselves again, again, one of the fears I have is that we walk out of here all self-righteous and all, oh Clinton, I'm glad you went for him don't say that to me we need to look to ourselves we need to consider the ways that we have unclean lips Jan Brose last week spoke in this pulpit of preparing the way for God making straight paths so God can come into our church and into our lives and how we need to bring down high places and that was an image of repentance and how we need to remove boulders and there's other places in the scripture that talks about even binding the things that will rob thieves and bandits on the road that would keep the king from coming. And she spoke of ways that personally we need to do our personal work so that God can come to us. She even spoke of how corporately we need to bring down high places and repent of things that we may not even be aware of so that God can come not only to us, but God by his power can flow through us and link that word up with this word to a lost and dying world. But to have hope that it's going to affect the culture, we've got to do our work first. So everybody, off your high horse. Isaiah, did you know? Released a kind of revival when that prophet had an experience, whether it be in a vision or a dream of God. He saw God. He experienced what you and I would too if we saw God, and that was he saw himself. And this was a guy that I think everybody here would consider before this event, a holy man who walked with God. What he said when he saw God and saw himself was this, oh God, I am undone for I am a man of unclean lips. I think I'm a pretty good truth teller, But when I see you, God, I am made aware that I don't have a clue about my own motivations and the ways I twisted myself and enhance and frame things for my agenda. Not only am I a man of unclean lips, but I live in a land of people who have unclean lips. Then in his dream, one of the seraphim flew with the burning coal in his hand, and he touched Isaiah's mouth with it and said this, Behold, this has touched your lips, Isaiah, and your iniquity is taken away and your sins are forgiven. It was then, Isaiah said, that I heard the voice of the Lord saying, Whom shall I send and who will go for us? Then I said, Here I am. Send me. Very important that you understand that Isaiah said, here I am, send me, that he said that after his lips, full of lies, were touched. After he went through his own repentance and saw his own sin and got up off his own high horse, all of the self-righteousness was driven from him and he came up desperately aware of his need for amazing grace in the very arena that he was desiring to attack somebody else, for I am a liar. What I'm talking about here is why the Word of God says things like this. Judgment begins in the house of God. Don't be worried about the culture before we bring down the high places and we remove the boulders. And we see the ways we speak falsehood even to one another. And if we're going to be light in this critical time of history, Dave, you think you're going to save the world? Ah, ah, I'm trying to do me, you know? We're trying to do us. Will we be living? Oh, I really believe we've got to bring our high places down and remove our own boulders and believe that as the light begins to authentically shine in us and the us is a corporate us, it will begin to be noticed. And it will have a positive, leviting effect. Not because we're just correcting everybody else. I am a man of unclean lips. And I live among people who are just like it. Lord give us grace to do our own stuff so that we can be the sent ones in this critical time I would like you to stand as we close in prayer I think this prayer is important I'm going to ask you not to move just don't move I want you to be quiet listen to God I want to pray Lord before we would presume to fix the world come touch our lips I would invite you to pray this prayer personally Lord before I would presume to fix my husband my wife my family my neighbor Lord come touch my lips. Come, Holy Spirit, reveal my falsehoods. Come heal our hearts and then fill us with your truth so we can be people who speak truth. Father, I pray that more than being a people who don't lie, that we, by your Spirit's power at work among us, would be a people who love the truth. I pray in your name that you would fill us with passion for true things in our innermost being. That even when we would stumble in a lie, the truth that we are so passionate about would rise and say right now, don't be comfortable with that even for a second. Say you're sorry. Acknowledge the lie. Fill us with truth. Give us passion for truth. I pray these things in Jesus' name be done among us. And all God's people said, amen. Amen.
