Young infants, if you're wondering about that and you may be visiting with us. The rest of you, open your Bibles with me to the book of Matthew, chapter 9. We are, as you know, in a section that includes chapter 8 and chapter 9, that we are entitling the miracles of Jesus or the healing ministry of Christ. The latest healing that we have dealt with was in chapter 9, verses 1 through 8, and it was the healing of the paralytic. But the real wonder of the healing was not that this man who got lowered through the roof, threw a hole in the roof and could never walk, could not walk. But the real focus of the healing and Jesus' intent and the message in the miracle was that he forgave his sin. In verse 2 it says, And behold, they brought him a paralytic. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Take courage, your sins are forgiven. He did that before he healed him physically. And there was a message in that, and that was this, that along with all the other miracles that I do and the manifestations of my power and presence, The reason I do all of those things is that so you might know, verse 6, I forgive sin. And that is the ultimate miracle. That is the ultimate work of God. I give people back their identity, their souls, their spirits. I make them clean. And that's what redemption is about. When we come to verse 9 through 17, which is the section we're dealing with now. You may remember a couple of weeks ago I dealt with verse 9 to 13. Verse 9 to 17 is a section. When we come to this, it is Jesus, through the writer Matthew, making application of the wonder of this miracle of forgiveness as it relates specifically to people and how they live and also relates specifically to ministry and how it operates. If forgiveness is God's ultimate agenda, then it is also going to be our agenda as we minister to one another. The key verse in the whole thing is verse 13 where he says, Go and learn what this means. I desire compassion and not sacrifice. Because this is one unit, verse 9 to 17, I'm going to kick back a little bit, bring you up to speed, and then we'll, like a slingshot, move into 14 through 17. But before I even read it, I want to pray. Let's do that. Father, I just pray that by your Spirit you would invade this time. And Father, we can hear words and words and words, but unless your spirit breathes life into them, they are pretty useless. And so in a way that we don't even understand, I pray that the work of your spirit be known among us and empower this time. And I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Jesus had healed the paralytic, but the focus was forgiveness. And when Jesus, verse 9, passed on from there, he saw a man that really needed forgiveness. And his name was Matthew. In fact, from what we learned last time, the people who would have known Matthew most would not have only said he really needed forgiveness, but this kind of person was beyond forgiveness. You may remember that Matthew was a tax gatherer of the most despicable kind. He was what we called last time a small mochas. Remember that? That was the type of publican who would set up his office in the middle of a main thoroughfare, and every single person who walked by would get taxed for every nitpicking little thing. And he was sucking the life out of literally the people that he lived with. And he was doing it under the tutelage of Rome. He was not a happy, he was not a well-liked person. We also found something else about this man, this sinner, this despicable man. And it was this, that he was not just a sinner in general, but he was a sinner who was sick of his sin. That was found when we saw Jesus come to him and said to him, Follow me. And without hesitation, he followed. He left his sin. He walked away from his old life. That is what people who are broken over their sin do. You don't have to sit there and wrestle and talk them out of how it really won't be that bad if you let go. People who are ready for the kingdom and are ready for the message of grace are people who are sick of their sin. They are broken over it. They are mourning over it. They run to forgiveness and they run to Jesus. And Matthew is wonderfully redeemed in verse 9. And the first response of the heart of the redeemed, the heart of the forgiven, is to find other people like him who need that same touch of grace and forgiveness. And it happened that as he, that's Jesus, verse 10, was reclining at table in the house of Matthew, that's all inferred there and clear from Luke and Mark accounts, behold, many tax gatherers and sinners came and were dining with Jesus and his disciples. We heard, first of all, Matthew's story, his conversion in Matthew 9, and then we went to Matthew's party. And you might even remember that a couple of weeks ago we reflected on the fact that in many ways this is what church looked like to Jesus. People who were sinners, people who were publicans, who were sick of their sin, they were the ones who were ready to hear this message of redemption, of repentance, and of grace. But when the Pharisees saw this, the church kinds of people, the religious and the pious, they didn't like it because they didn't understand it. You see, church goes on among the moral, the good people, the slick and the shiny people. And I do not have any category in my mind where religion, godliness, spirituality would happen in a context among people who don't look spiritual. And so they asked a question of Jesus' disciples, again, significant that they didn't have the courage to go right to him. Why is your teacher eating with these kinds of people, tax gatherers and sinners? Good thing Jesus heard them, and he did hear them, and so he said to them, it is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick. your very confession, from your very mouth, Pharisees, you have admitted that these people that I am having dinner with are of a most despicable nature. And that is why I am there. But you go and learn what this means. I didn't spend much time on this last time, but that is riddled with sarcasm. Go and learn what this means, O ye great Bible study scholars. Go look at the Old Testament. In the book of Hosea, what this means, I desire compassion and not sacrifice. Go have a Bible study and figure this one out, guys. I didn't come for you. I came for them. And you will not be in my kingdom, and they will. And then I gave you an illustration. I never want you to forget in Luke chapter 15, three parables. Parables that we've heard many times, but I had never even understood them in the context within which they were meant to be understood. The context was the same as this. Jesus had gathered with publicans and sinners. The Pharisees were upset they didn't understand. Religion to them was in the context of stained glass windows and everything looking shiny and neat. And then they came to Jesus and said, why do you meet with these people? And he told them a parable of the 99 and the one sheep that goes away. And all of my life, I had always understood the 99 as being the good Christians, the stable people. And if one from the fold of a hundred wanders away, we leave them because they're stable and they're going to be okay and we go get the one and isn't that a model for ministry what we began to understand was this in the context of his confrontation what Jesus was meaning was this the 99 were not the stable in the okay and the broken in the hungry in the morning were really walking with God well they were the self-righteous who were self-content had no need no no desperate panting after God them none they were self-content they were self-righteous and what Jesus was saying I'm going to go after the one who's broken, who's asking for help, who's ready for the kingdom. And the reason we know that interpretation is correct is because in verse 7, it says this, there is more joy in heaven over the one sinner who has broken over his sin and repents than the 99 righteous persons who think they don't need any help. I'm going to leave them. I'm going to go there where the kingdom is. Saw the same thing in the nine coins and the one coin that went away and the prodigal son and the son that stayed at home and always did it right. You go where the people are broken. You go where they're ready for the message. And self-righteous people never are. And my kingdom never goes there. Now, we better know that as radical as that kind of message is to us and to our culture, and it is a radical message in this culture, it was even possibly a more radical message to that culture. And while it blew up the Pharisees and probably made them incredibly angry, it would, in the minds and hearts of even genuine God-seekers, raise some questions. How radical is this? This is so different than anything I've ever heard. I'm not sure I'm really ready to receive this. It's kind of scary. Questions would arise. And as we come to verse 14, I want you to be aware of the fact that the questions are not coming from Pharisees anymore. I think they're coming from genuine God-seekers. Legitimate questions from people who are still caught in kind of a religious system and a lot of rituals hanging on them. But they're legitimate questions. Let's read the first one. Then the disciples of John came to Jesus saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't fast? I don't get it. See, that means spirituality to us when you fast, when we fast, and you don't even do it. I'm trying to figure this out. And Jesus said to them, The attendants of the bridegroom cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast, and no one will have to tell them to do it. But no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results. Nor do men put new wine into old wineskins, otherwise the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved. What does all that mean? Big surprise for you today. I'm going to break the text into three parts. What it's going to be is three questions and three answers. Now, the first question is in the text, verse 14. The second two questions are implied questions that we are going to see implied in verse 16 and verse 17. Let's just get to question number one. And the disciples of John came to him saying, Stop right there. It's important for us to understand who asked the question. I've already alluded to this a little bit, but the people who are asking him this question are no longer the Pharisees asking questions to trick Jesus and to discredit him. These people are now the disciples of John, literally, the Baptists. That's who they were. Let me give you a little background here. At this present time, John the Baptist is in prison. We know that from Matthew chapter 4. When John was put in prison, it was a signal in the divine economy of God for Jesus to begin his ministry. He went to Nazareth. He went to Galilee. And the ministry of the kingdom began. He is in prison. He is about to die. Near the end of John's ministry, and right around the time of his baptism of Jesus, John recognized Jesus as the Messiah. And so he began to transfer all of his disciples to Jesus and saying, listen, I am not the one I want you to focus on. I must decrease. He must increase. So move it over there. Move it over there. There was a problem. Not all of them made the transfer. Some of them were simply hesitant. they loved John a lot, they didn't know this Jesus that well, some of them didn't even know about Jesus yet and so they wouldn't have made the transfer. In fact, as late as Acts chapter 19, Paul on a missionary journey ran into some disciples of John who had never even heard of Jesus. When they did, they received him and became redeemed. The point, however, is this. If they were indeed disciples of John, you know what we know about them? They were genuine God-seekers. They loved God, they had a heart for God, and they wanted to do what God wanted them to do. But while they did indeed have a heart for God, they were still tied in many ways to the Pharisaic tradition, to the Pharisaic ritual, to the Pharisaic formula. The result of that was this, attention. See, on one hand, they could be around this Jesus, this Nazarene, and they could sense, because they had a heart for God, they could sense God there. There's something real there. There's something compelling there. I cannot deny it. But at the same time, they were kind of being held back by this system they grew up in, the church, if you will, they grew up in, the Pharisaic tradition and all of that stuff. And something wasn't fitting. We saw life and power and reality there, but I don't see the kind of trappings that I have begun in all my life, not begun, I've all my life identified these things with real spirituality. So something's not fitting. And so it is when they come to Jesus, these are legitimate questions. Jesus, we see some things here that are real compelling in you, but why don't you fast the way we do and the way the Pharisees do? Because obviously that's what spiritual people do. They fast, and they fast twice a week. I mean, everybody knows that. If you're spiritual, you fast twice a week. Everybody knows if you're spiritual. You tithe. You tithe dill and mint and cumin. You do it just right. And some of these disciples of John might have done that because they really loved God. And Pharisees might have done it to prove they were spiritual, but they were still stuck to the system. And they would pray loud and long. And Jesus, you come along and you do all those things. We see you give and we see you fast and we see you pray. But when you give, it isn't measured out. It isn't measured out. You say things like, don't let your left hand know what your right hand's doing. What kind of thing is that? Just give, and you pray, but, but, you know, it's not at this prescribed time like we do. You pray in the morning, early in the morning. Lost the time to do it. No, but see, then I see you pray at night, and sometimes I don't see you praying in the morning, and I see you pray at night, and sometimes I hear you pray long prayers, and sometimes I hear you pray short prayers, and sometimes you pray in the temple where you're supposed to, and then I see you praying in a garden. I don't get it. I'm confused, so tell me, why don't you fast like us and like the Pharisees? And his answer in verse 15, and then also 16 and 17, is just kind of flowing from that. There's a dialogue, at least I see one. His answer, not only in verse 15, reveals something about the true nature of fasting, but this is wonderful, because his answer that looks just like it's about fasting really reveals something about the reality of the kind of relationship kingdom people are going to have with their God. First of all, let's take a look at what this statement in verse 15 reveals about fasting. The attendants of the bridegroom cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them. When the bridegroom is taken away, then they will fast. For Pharisees, the fast that I mentioned earlier was twice a week, was a religious ritual. And you could go up to a Pharisee and say, why do you fast? That would be a very hard question for him. They would love to answer, do you fast? Yes, I do. Hard question, why do you fast? They didn't know anymore. They had lost the connection of what that really was all about and its purpose and motive. I'm not sure anymore. It's a spiritual thing to do. What I do know for sure is this, that if I don't fast, I feel guilty. So two reasons I fast. One, it is a spiritual thing to do. Number two, I feel terrible if I don't do it, so I do it. It's like some people go to church twice a week. Why? Some people do it because their heart is moving in there. Some people do it because they feel terrible guilty if they don't. It's become a ritual. It's become this little form. The problem is this. While going to church and praying before meals and having devotions at 530 in the morning, even though he can't see straight, are all legitimate. And the Spirit of God may be in that. The problem is this. Sometimes for some of us, we can lose the whole purpose of it and it becomes mechanical, ritual, and absolutely altogether useless. That's exactly where it was with the Pharisees. And also with the disciples of John. See, I see the disciples of John. and it's kind of opened up a whole new category in my thinking of people in the church who really do love God, who really have a heart for God. It's genuine, it's real, but in many ways they're still stuck to and bound by the Pharisaic tradition of doing it just like this. It's all prescribed, and the only reason they do some of the things they do is because they feel guilty if they don't. There isn't any life there anymore. And I think Jesus is trying to set these guys free. You'll see it. True nature of the fast. You remember from the time we studied this just a few chapters ago, was this. When it comes to a fast, you don't pick a fast, it picks you. Remember that kind of talk? You don't choose it, it chooses you. What we meant by that when we dealt with this was this, that a fast is simply the external response to an internal reality. In other words, sometimes I'm in grief and I'm in pain and sometimes I'm mourning over my sin because God has brought brokenness to me. And sometimes I'm confused and God's will and His direction and what He's doing in my life doesn't feel real clear. And I don't fast at that point in order to try to get God's string to be pulled and push a button so I can get what I want. I fast at that point because I am so preoccupied with my hurt, and I am so preoccupied possibly with my brokenness over sin, and I am so preoccupied with wanting to get a hold of God that I literally lose my appetite. You remember when we dealt with that? I think it was in chapter 6. We talked about the fact that every one of us have had times when God has brought to us a fast, and we never understood that that's what God was doing, and so we kind of even forced ourselves to eat. Remember? a fast is not a ritual you perform to make something real okay a fast you remember is a natural response to something that is real my body simply accommodates what the spirit of god is doing in my spirit so i say no to food for a while because i wouldn't want food anyway and i spend the time in prayer i spend the time before god's altar and i do the business i need to do and then 2 Samuel chapter 12, David's little baby was dying, and he fell on his face, and he prayed night and day, fasting with tears. Why? Because he knew that would pull God's string and his baby would live. Well, his baby didn't live. The reason he fasted was because he was so preoccupied with his own grief and trying to get a hold of God that he set that aside and did what came natural. That's exactly, by the way, what Jesus is saying in verse 15. The attendants of the bridegroom cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. We may not still connect with what he's saying there, so I need to teach. First of all, about the attendants, the bridegroom attendants. Weddings were different in those days than they are now. The weddings lasted seven days. Today, marriages last seven days. The attendants had more responsibility than the attendants today. The attendants today light the candles, they usher people in, they bring the runner back. That's about it. In those days, the attendants were responsible to keep the seven-day party going the whole time. So generally, you've got a guy like Spuds McKenzie to do the whole deal. The point he's making here, using a wedding, is an allusion to himself. My disciples have the bridegroom. I am the bridegroom. I am with them now. And you know what? This is a time for celebration and joy. There's nothing to be sad about. What's he saying there? Well, the reason that's significant is because fasts are for times that you're grieving. And you need to pray. But I'm here. But there is going to come a time when I am gone. And what is in the Greek here, by the way, when it says he will be taken away, the day will come when the bridegroom is taken. The Greek there is he will be violently snatched. He is speaking there of the cross. And when the cross comes and they see me nailed to a cross and they see me planted in a tomb, they're going to fast. You know that? and nobody's going to have to tell them to do it. Their body will simply accommodate their grief. The point is this. The fast is going to be real. The fast is going to be an internal response to something that is real that is happening, not an external show to try to prove they're pious, to prove they care, to even prove they're spiritual. If they care, they will fast. By the way, I think he chose this specific illustration to kind of lovingly pull these disciples of John out of their bondage to see that a moving with God is a relationship response. You need to respond to what God's doing on the inside, not this external ritual. Let me explain what I mean. At this time, I already told you that Jesus says these words. John was where? In prison. About to what? Die. Do you know what would have been real natural for the disciples of John to be doing even right now? Fasting. Why? Because it was the thing to do. Well, that was one of the reasons these guys fasted. These disciples knew about the ritual. But maybe for the first time in these disciples of John's lives, they were fasting because it felt like a real thing. And Jesus uses an illustration that could hook their hearts right now and set them free to a kingdom reality that a relationship with not me is not encompassed by ritual and performance and doing these things you've always done because you've always done them, but a response internally to what I am doing right now. His confrontation in verse 15 is this, your pharisaical religious activity, the problem with it is not that it's wrong to fast, but it is totally out of sync with reality. Get that. The problem with your fasting is that it is totally out of sync with reality. It is a cranked out routine irrespective of what God is doing in your life now. And that kind of activity is useless. What you need to do is learn how to respond to what God is doing in your life now and do what you do because of what he's doing in your life. Just follow this form. And by the way, with those words, that kicks me into the word that verse 15 is not only about fasting, but about the whole revelation this is, about our relationship with our God. Kingdom life, this verse reveals. And the religious practices that attend them are not about ritual, they're about relationship. And what relationship does is this. It pulses, it moves, it grows, it responds, it's alive, it is real, it's a real thing. It is not mechanized, ritualized, programmed, and routine. Jesus is saying this. My people will fast. My disciples are going to fast. And they're going to pray. And they're going to give. And they're going to worship. But their worship and their prayer and their fasting and their giving is going to be a response to what the real relationship of God is doing in their spirits. They're not going to do it twice a week. They might do it for a whole week. And then not for four months. the key is the relationship the relationship it's real it changes respond to what's real by the way in order to do this what do you have to have a relationship with God people who are just religious are absolutely incapable of entering into this kind of dialogue we're having this morning absolutely incapable because if you don't know God there's no way to respond to the God you don't know. All you've got is the external religious. You're kind of doing these forms, and you're following these codes, and you do these little things. It's all the shell. One way to illustrate it would be to look at a marriage relationship. If the marriage relationship is healthy, there will be some things that characterize it. It is like anything, a relationship is a living thing. And there's an ebb and a flow to relationships, and there is a responding and a moving back and forth. That's what life is like, you see. And in a relationship that is healthy, there are times when intimacy is felt. It's right in the front. It's what you're focusing on. There are other times, even in a loving, healthy relationship, where you feel distance. Nobody wanted to get like that, but that's one of the things you feel from time to time. And sometimes there's fun and play, and that's a wonderful thing. And other times, there are times for serious contemplation. Other times, there's times for fighting. And then there are times for making love and making up. It's wonderful. And then there are times for relaxing, sitting on the couch, saying nothing. Please give us a time like that where we don't say anything. But then there's times where you work, and you work, and you do talk, and you do fight through the issues, and you do that. There's an ebb and a flow. Let's put it on a schedule. It's great. Monday at five, there will be intimacy in this home. I tell you that. You sit on the couch. It's five o'clock. Okay, okay. Ready? Go. Intimacy. Here we are. Boy, isn't this just great. Monday at seven, you feel distant because the trying to be intimate was so stupid. Tuesday at four, we will have a time of serious contemplation. At nine, we will have fun and games. Thursday at 10, we will have fighting and arguing. Friday at 11, we will have making up and lovemaking. Thank God for weekends. It's great. Ready? Go. Okay, you know? Serious contemplation. go. Fun and games. Are we having fun yet? Is this it? No, relationships that are healthy aren't like that. There's an ebb and a flow, and they respond out here to what's going on in here, and there are times you feel like playing. So you go, want to play? Let's play. Let's do something goofy. It's time to do that. We've been serious too long. Time to switch. Ebb and a flow. Going back and forth. Listen, this is getting silly. All we do is play. I think we're avoiding some issues. We need to talk. Time to get serious. Put it all on a schedule. Would you like that? Now listen, there may be times in a relationship, and even in a relationship with God, when certain aspects of that relationship have been so neglected that you may be neat to say, listen, at six o'clock, we're going to talk, okay? Or even, I think some relationships are the other way. They are so heavy, well, so relevant. Oh man, like wow, you know? Hey, Hey, hey, call it. It is time to play today. No serious talk, okay? Okay, so you schedule it like that a little bit. But the real truth is this. Healthy people are simply learning to respond to what the needs of the relationship are, and that's why God says, I hate your ritual. Keep your songs in your mouth. I want a real relationship so that what is being done in your life is a response to the real life of God in you. What a concept. And I think that leads to the second question. The second question is kind of inferred in the answer in verse 16. Let me give you the question before we go into the answer. We're these, we're these, uh, Johns of, these disciples of John. That's who we are, okay? And again, we're kind of, we're really compelled by this and it sounds really good, but we're still kind of stuck with this old ritual stuff. And so we ask a question, it would go like this. Okay, Jesus, I'll buy that. If it's really true that what you want is reality and not ritual, I'll buy that, but you've got to tell me something else. At what point does this system that I grew up in and I'm still very attached to, at what point does it intersect what you're saying? At what point does my legalistic, ritualistic, externally focused system connect with what you're saying? Let me give it a little bit more current language. Jesus, what I need to know is this. I like the reality, not ritual. What I need to know is this. How do we get our Pharisaic, Judaistic, evangelical, even, Catholic, Lutheran, Baptist, Christian and Missionary Alliance rituals and traditions to mesh with what you're saying? How can we do that? Because see, what I want to do is hang on to my structure and my systems and my forms and my way of saying it and my way of doing it and just get you to come and breathe life into my system. How can we do that? Verse 16 says, You can't, because it doesn't mesh. No one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results. Just giving you that. A pair of pants are made of wool. They've been worn a while. They've kind of shrunk as much as they're going to shrink. You've got a hole in the knee. You put a new patch of wool on that hole. stitch it in there real nice, you wash it, the new patch shrinks, and then it just pulls everything in. You got the picture on that. And it ends up destroying both. What Jesus is saying here, I believe, is this. Folks, I am not willing to be added to your tradition to make your tradition better. I am not willing to be added to your ritual to make your ritual better and breathe life into it. You see, this is not this relationship with God and this kingdom stuff is not things go better with Coke time. It's not things go better with God time. Like what we can do is just add Jesus to your life along with all the other nice things you've got and all the other religious things you've got. We'll just add Jesus to it and now all the religious things will be alive. You don't get it. I am not being willing. I am not willing to be added to your system because I am the system. I am not being, I am not willing to be added to your meal because I am of the bread. I am not willing to be added to your life because I am the resurrection and the life. And I am not willing to be added to your garment because I am the garment. And if you don't get that, you won't be in the kingdom. You won't understand kingdom life. All of your idols have to die. Especially, disciples of John, your religious idols. Your little rituals, your little formulas, your little things that have encompassed for you and been the embodiment of a God relationship. I'd like to see, he's saying, if you could have a relationship with me without that. Okay? Well, a question would rise from that. And the question would be this. I'm frustrated. You know, you're telling me to put the old system aside and all the forms and all the rituals. But Jesus, is there any place at all that systems have a place, where a structure, where a program has a place, where rituals and traditions have any place at all? The answer is yes and no. Yes, there is a place for systems. Yes, there is a place for structure. Yes, there is a place for the way we do it kind of mentality. Yes, there is a place for tradition, but, verse 17, you don't put new wine into old wineskins. There is a place for systems, there is a place for tradition, there is a place for ritual, but you better know that they are always going to change. Otherwise, if you don't understand that, and I'm going to explain this in a minute, the wineskins will burst, the wine will pour out, the wineskins are ruined, but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, fresh containers, new systems, new patterns, new rituals and traditions, if you will, so that both are preserved. Let me explain it like this. I need to do some teaching. The wine in this verse, in my opinion, is a symbol of life. It is a symbol of the life of God in the presence of people. It's a symbol of the life of God in your life. It's a symbol of reality and joy, the moving of God and the life of God in our midst. The skin is simply that which contains the life, that which structures the joy and the moving of God in our midst. It's what we use to contain the wine. But we always need to remember that the life of the body, the life of the church, the life of my relationship, is not in the container, it's in the wine. You may not have this whole thing down yet, just keep coming with me. There's a problem, however. Okay, the life is in the wine. That's where the joy is. That's the Spirit of God, if you will. The Spirit of God in our midst. The skin is all our programs and our systems to try to kind of contain what the Spirit is doing in our midst. Problem with wineskins is this. They grow old, they dry up, they become irrelevant, and they lose their usefulness and elasticity. I don't know if you know this, but when wine is poured into a wineskin, by the way, the way these things worked was an animal was skinned, And from what I could get, it's almost as if the animal is skinned in total. It's like the four feet would be tied up, and then the neck would come, and that's where the wine would come out. I don't know if they carried camels around like that, but anyway, just so you get a picture. When they were fresh, the wine would go in, the wine would expand, and the skins would stretch. It'd be okay. It could fit. But the problem is skins, systems, that's what he's dealing with here, systems, forms, the way we do it, the way we talk, dry up. And see, there's another problem. Not only do they dry up, but the wine keeps pouring, you see? And the wine and the reality and the life of God keeps coming. But there's a problem. You see, sometimes we have been in situations, in churches, in families, in our individual lives, where we have seen the Spirit of God come. The wine of the Spirit came. And we found a container for us at a certain time that would contain it. It was the expression of our love, the expression of our worship, the expression of the life of God in our midst, our program. But somewhere along the line, we really began to believe that the thing that made it work was the system we got, the skin we developed, the program that evolved. And all of a sudden, we start hanging on to that program as if that was where the life was. Problem. Skins grow old. They dry up. The spirit keeps coming. You hang on to the skin. The skin bursts. You lose everything. The wine gets spilled on the floor. The system you adored and thought was what worked all the time is absolutely demolished, and it sits impotent on a street corner with a nice little steeple. No life. the life is not in the skin the life is in the wine systems look around church of the open door we are a fairly non-traditional church what people would call a non-traditional church I suppose non-ritualistic we've made some changes with the skin that is all but the truth is we do have systems here we do have a skin that we have developed and are continually kind of developing that is designed to be the container of the moving of the spirit among us right now whether you notice it or not when you come to this what you might consider a non-traditional church we meet every Sunday that's a nice tradition, every Sunday we keep you moving because we change the times though at least we tell you But when we come together, we worship the same way. When's the last time we didn't have a praise time? I think that's great. Don't hear me say we shouldn't do that. That is the container, that is the skin that God has given us for now to contain the juice, the wine, the expression of the Spirit among us now. We hear a sermon every Sunday, delivered the same way. The guy screams at us. all that is and it's a good thing it is a good it is the skin that we have found to hold the wine of the spirit but the skin is not the life the life is not in the skin it is in the wine you know it's going to happen to you and to me and to us and we better know it all the time whether we know it or not we're going to start getting attached to the skin oh i like the way we worship The way we worship is the way to worship. One of the things we're doing in our training center right now is we're equipping people for ministry, and we're teaching them how to pray, and how to pray for healing, and for deliverance, and things like that. And we're finding a skin to use. We're finding a form, a structure, a model, if you will, to have people pray. And one of the things we like to do is have you lay hands on people. And we have you lay hands on people, and we'll put them on their shoulder, and we'll put them here, put them on. And you'll see people putting hands on people's heads. And a few weeks ago, remember, I was talking about the leper, and Jesus touched that guy, and I talked about the importance of touching. And I kind of made fun of the fact that we have this idea, the power is right there in the center, so we touch. Because there's this little formula we've got. You need to know that even the way we pray, putting hands on is a skin. That's great. But the power is in the wine, not in the skin, of putting my hands on. The skin is this form I've found, this model I use. Some people say, close your eyes when you pray. Some people say, open your eyes when you pray. A while ago, it was conversational prayer. Everybody did conversational prayer. Some people, conversational prayer worked. Some people, they did it, and it was just such a blessing, it was mush. Why? Because the power isn't in the skin. It's in the juice. It's in the spirit. And the focus of the church of Jesus Christ and believers in him have to be this. God, bring your juice. Bring your spirit. Bring your power. Bring your life. When he comes, you find the skin. He'll give you the skin. but you better know this, as soon as the skin comes the form, the way we do it, the way we say it you're going to start getting attached to the skin and if you do it's going to dry up and the wine is going to keep coming and then the skin is going to bust and we will be left with wine all over the floor no power anymore and we'll still be singing worship songs the way we do and we'll still be meeting in these really neat things the issue isn't to get creative see some of this might sound as I'm speaking it might sound like so you people better just be learning how to chain because the wineskins got to change. Well, the sad truth is, I believe, that is a message that needs to be heard. There are many Christians that you know that I know who have altogether lost their joy. They have altogether lost their vibrancy and their reality and the power of God that they knew. It was a real thing five years ago, 10 years ago, 20, 30, 40 years ago. The power of God, they really knew it. But see, when the Spirit of God came and the wine of the Spirit came in their midst at a certain time in their life, there did develop around that moving of the Spirit a program, a system, a ritual, a skin, a container that held the juice. But they made a real bad mistake. They hung on to the skin, thought the life was in the skin. The juice kept pouring, busted open the skin. They're standing there now with a dead skin, no life. now I get back to that thing so let's get creative so let's just change all the skins but see that isn't a manifestation of somebody who still believes that life is in skin I had somebody come up to me once well not once more than once boy you guys are really doing some creative things over there I don't think you do creative things by trying to be creative. I think the only way it can possibly work is this. As God's people begin to ask for the Spirit to come and start asking and seeking and knocking for His kingdom to come and for His will to be done and for His name to be honored and as we come broken and hungry and mourning to Him, saying, God, unless you move, we have no hope. And bring your Spirit and do your work. what happens is that is our only agenda, as that is it. What happens is it starts with a little trickle. The Spirit of God begins to trickle. And then it starts to drip. And then it starts to flow. And then it becomes a stream. And then there's a river. Ezekiel 42. What a passage of Scripture. Ezekiel 42. 47. 47, verse 2. It starts in 2. And it's a picture of the moving of the Spirit among God's people. And it's a barren land. And I'm not even going to read it because I think I can just create it like this. There's a barren land, and from the temple, the door of the temple, where was the presence of God and the Spirit of God, came a little trickle of water. And everywhere that water went, you know what happened? Life came. And a trickle turned into a stream, and a stream turned into a river. And it talks about the prophet going into the stream, ankle deep. And then he goes knee deep, and then he goes waist deep, and then it was deep enough for swimming, and he started getting carried along by the Spirit, by the water, and everything around it got life. the key to revival the key to kingdom living is not getting creative that's still believing that there's life in the skin there is no life in the skin the key is getting on your knees broken hungry mourning bring your spirit bring your life bring your power and when that river comes you start finding a container to hold it in and you call it meeting at cooper and singing praise songs and having a training center on wednesday night and as the spirit continues that's all going to change. I don't even know how. But as soon as the Spirit moves and we get a container, we get attached to the skin. And that can't happen. Because when we do, we lose the wine. And I believe that with that kind of description, I have described every movement of God that began as a legitimate movement of the Holy Spirit of God but ended in a ritual. Every church that began as a real movement of God and the pouring out of the Holy Spirit, the wine of the Spirit, but ended up with a shell. And every denomination that ever began by a moving of the wind of the Spirit and a genuine expression of the life of God in people that some years later has nothing left but a nice building, a slick program, a dead ritual, but the life and the wine and the power of God is something we talk about that we used to know. And we hang on to the skin. Verse 13, but go and learn what this means. I didn't come for the righteous, I came for sinners. Major confrontation. Go and learn what this means. I will not be added to your religious garment I am the garment go and learn what this means I will not be contained by your routine by your ritual and your tradition because not only am I the garment but I am the wine and the life is in the wine not in the skin in fact you know I think one of the reasons Jesus does this is number one for us to constantly know it's a relationship and it's going to change and it's going to flux and it's going to be different but also I got a feeling that Jesus he's so I don't know this might sound not very holy or something, to say he's got a sense of humor. I think he just keeps changing the rules on us, changing the forms, taking all these little things we get attached to away to find out if what we really love is him or the form, him or the ritual, him or the guitar, or the synthesizer, or this pulpit, or this church. What's he love? What are you excited about? Me? Good, because then when I take all this away, you'll still have the joy. go and learn what this means I want a relationship that is a process that is a pilgrimage that is alive and moving and changing I want a relationship that is real so when you fast it's because it's coming from inside and I'm not added to your life I am your life and you can constantly change the form in which my spirit comes but your deepest desire is for my spirit not the skin and you can have that relationship and some of you do have it but some of you have that relationship and in some very hard ways for you to look at you're hanging there hanging on to a skin that you've mistaken for life and it isn't and maybe even today some of you by a miracle of God could for the first time in your life let go of like the disciples of John needed to while they had a heart for God they had to let go of the pharisaical ritualistic tradition that had their whole life prescribed for them and enter into relationship. I think there are some Christians who need to enter into relationship. That sounds bizarre. Because while they have a heart for God, it's all a mechanical thing. And there is no wine. Ask God for the wine. Would you stand with me? Let's pray. you
