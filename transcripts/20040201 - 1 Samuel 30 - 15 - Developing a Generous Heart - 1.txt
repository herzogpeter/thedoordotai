For rivers of living water to flow from this word, giving life to everything it touches, is my request this morning, and I ask it in Jesus' name, amen. I think you'd all agree that one of the most amazing moments for parents of small children is when they utter their first word. Parents wait for this moment with bated breath. They try real hard at times to actually accelerate it, something they eventually regret, repeatedly saying things to their little ones, hoping that they'll parrot back the word, Mama, Papa. We all make a big thing about the fact that in our family they said Papa, they didn't say Papa first. Whatever their first word, however, is, the second word is always the same. no psychologists tell us that that's a very important word in the development of a child to establish boundaries, a personal sense of identity and autonomy they say it's a good stage, this no stage although most psychologists who say this have never had small children of their own but right around this same stage of development they usually pick up another word that's a lot like the no word It's in the same family. It has the same energy. When someone else moves into their space and wants to play with their toys, wants to borrow their clothes, wants to eat their food, the word they say is what? Mine. And in a small child, there's nothing wrong with that. It's even kind of cute. But some people go to their graves, and it's still their favorite word. Now, they're a lot more sophisticated by this time. They don't actually walk around saying mine. It just marks them. Marks their checkbook. Marks their house and car, their time, their stuff. It's mine. And while we happily, especially those of us who go to church, even sincerely recite the words of the Lord's Prayer, which affirm that it's His name and His kingdom and His will that we desire, the truth for many of us is that it's my name, my kingdom, my will, I care about mine. It turns out, beloved, that among the most significant and difficult parts of our spiritual journey and the formation of our hearts into the likeness of Christ is that process wherein which we learn to authentically say your name, your kingdom, your will, not mine. I think most of you know that we have been involved these weeks, even months in what we've been referring to as a journey of the heart using the life of David as our guide. And while there are many areas of David's life where he really messed up in big ways, and we will speak of those things in weeks to come, there were a number of places, and one of them is what we're going to talk about tonight or this morning, where he really did well. And he did well in this area his whole life long. You will see this characteristic in his youth. We will see it in his age, for he was consistently marked by this. He had a generous heart. He had somehow gotten free from everything having to be mine. I want to talk this morning about a generous heart. And to keep it simple, just two things about a generous heart, what it looks like, first of all, and secondly, where it comes from, how a generous heart is formed. And we're going to do that concurrently as we go through the sermon. It's not going to be point number one. It's just going to be we're going to look at what it looks like and how it's formed in a way that hopefully will make sense. What it looks like, what a generous heart looks like, will be revealed in a series of stories, several episodes in David's life that illustrate a generous heart. And we're not going to be able to get through them all today, so we're going to be on this for a couple of weeks. What a generous heart looks like, how it acts, The first example, the first episode, actually picks up where we left off a couple weeks ago. In 1 Samuel 30, verse 9, if you have your Bibles open to that passage, 1 Samuel 30, verse 9. While you're doing that, let me catch you up with the story. All of this is happening as we come to verse 9 here in the context of David's 10-year desert cave experience while he was running for his life from Saul. During that season of his life, David had developed a little community of people, described in 1 Samuel 22, verse 2, as being distressed, in debt, and discontent. They were homeless and helpless. They were a ragtag group, to say the least. I think it's actually an interesting picture of the church, of who you and I were and are a ragtag group, distressed, discontent, in debt. In fact, in terms of sin and our relationship with God, we had a debt we couldn't pay, hopeless and without God in the world. But these people in David's life ultimately became known as the mighty men of valor. And the redemption of God comes to us and we get renamed. And we come into hope and we come into life. Interesting pictures here all through this stuff of the church. But this is who David was with. They had established a little refugee village at a place called Ziklag. If you've been with us the last few weeks, you're familiar with that name, Ziklag, that in the first few verses of chapter 30, we were told, was overrun by the Amalekites while David and his men were out fighting the Philistines. It was burned to the ground. The women and the children, the wives and the children, were carried off, not killed, just captured and taken away, so they lost their families. David, upon returning with the men after weeping until they had no more strength left to weep, were told by God, in effect, this in verse 8. David, get up off your lament and do something now. So David went. Chapter 30, verse 9, we pick it up there. So David went, verse 9. He and the 600 men who were with him and came to the brook Besser where those left behind remained. But David pursued, he and the 400 men now, for 200 who were too exhausted to cross brook Besser remained behind. These 200 who stayed behind at the brook Besser had fatigue that was understandable. I mean, even before they saw the devastation at Ziklag, they had been fighting the Philistines. When they saw the devastation, their grief was overwhelming. They barely had any time to actually get into their grief. They were more in shock. Before they were able to even press through that whole thing, they were off on a mission to rescue their families. When 15 miles into this journey to find the Amalekites and bring back their children and their wives. At the Brook Besser, a full third of them, 200, could not take another step, had no more strength to move. So David leaves them at the Brook Besser to stay with the supplies. Now we're going to come back to them. In fact, that's why I told you about them. We're going to come back to them. And in coming back to them, we're going to see something of David's generous heart. We're going to see David's generosity toward people who some might think don't deserve it. it'll make more sense when we get through the story but first verse 11 we're going to see david's generosity to a person that i would consider to be in the category of what we would call the least and the lost david's generosity in helping people who could not help themselves in helping people in generously helping people who would be very easy to ignore especially at a time when david himself needed some help. You've got to really keep this energy in your mind. They're on their way to try to reclaim their lives. Not a lot of energy to be generous to somebody else. I've got to take care of my stuff first. Then I'll be generous is how I think about this stuff. Here's how it happened. So in the middle of their rescue mission, chasing down the Amalekites, again, trying to reclaim their lives. Verse 11 begins with these words, now they found an Egyptian in the field. Now the field It sounds like a very nice place. The field was in the middle of the desert. It was a desert field. And this guy was starving. No food or water for three days. He had been left behind by his master in the desert to die. Connect some dots so that you can enter authentically into this scene. Dot number one, this guy is an Egyptian, which means probably nothing to you one way or another. But it would have meant something to them because the second dot is this. David and the men he was with were Israelites. Do some history in your mind. Israel had been in bondage to Egypt for 400 years. So there's no love lost on this Egyptian guy here. And maybe I'm presuming some things, but as they're riding by this guy or coming up to this guy, some might have had spin into their minds and hearts. What a wonderful turning of the tables. It's kind of nice to see the Egyptians starving instead of us. Could easily bend the response of some. But even without a vengeful spirit like that toward this Egyptian who's starving, dot number three that I would connect here is this. We're coming along this Egyptian. He's starving. Somebody, this is not my responsibility. Somebody else's responsibility. And here's the biggest thing. I got problems of my own. And they're legitimate. I'm trying to reclaim my life. I got no time for this. So see ya. I wouldn't want to be ya. I mean, good luck. And maybe as they're driving you by, even some would have waves of compassion on you. I feel so sorry. I feel really bad. I feel really bad. We've got to leave you here. But you're on your own. See, we're doing all. We've got problems of our own. It's in that context that I notice some things about David because what David does, it's on the screen, verse 12. Verse 12 tells us this. He gives him water to drink, and not just David, but his men, the men he was with. Fig cakes to eat, two clusters of raisins, and then his spirit is revived. His spirit is revived. In symbol, I just think of people who, with a glass of water, a couple of fig cakes, a cluster of raisins. I'm not talking even necessarily here now about real food. Just the time it takes to give a drink of water. The spirit is revived. And then this Egyptian begins to tell his story. I've already kind of given this away, but the noteworthy thing, there's many noteworthy things about this scene and David's generosity here. But the first that occurred to me, most obvious, it is not in how much he gave. When I think of generosity, I think of giving a lot, but that's not what I noticed first about his generosity here because he didn't give that much. Again, just a little water, fig cakes, some fruit. What's notable about his generosity on the front end is that David and the men noticed at all this guy who was there, given the circumstances, that they even saw him. I've got problems on my own. I'm in a big hurry here. And it's not even that I'm so selfish. It's just that there really are some issues that I am absorbed with. I don't know about you, but I don't see other people, especially Egyptians, whoever the Egyptians would be to you. I don't see other people very clearly when I'm preoccupied with me. And David, as I've already, I think, made clear, had lots of reasons to be preoccupied with himself. He had problems of his own. So just as we wade into this stuff, first thing I noticed about David's generosity is that he noticed. here's the principle. Generosity sees things. Generous hearts see things that other people literally don't even see. Generous hearts see people that are easy to ignore, that under normal circumstances, you literally would just walk right on by. Not even see. Generous hearts see things, see people easy to ignore. But there's more in this story and in the application of the story. See, beyond simply noticing this Egyptian and maybe feeling sorry for him, which was maybe what it would be what we would do, David's generosity did something. It's very important to notice that. It's obvious. There's some deep perceptions here. David's generosity acted toward this guy. It stopped. It touched. administered to the real life need of this guy. And in this case, the real life need was food and water, something that basic. Eugene Peterson, in his book, Leap Over a Wall, a book that we've been referencing several times through the course of this study, because it's a book about the life of David, speaks to this very thing when he makes an important distinction between mere sentiment and authentic compassion that expresses itself in true generosity. Peterson says this we live in an age that has replaced compassionate and active generosity with sentiment sentiment he says is a feeling disconnected from relationship and doing sentiment is spilled generosity it looks like compassion it could develop into generosity but it never does sentiment is the patriotic catch in your throat as the flag goes by A feeling, however, that never gets connected to the patriotic honesty of paying your income tax. Sentiment is the tears that flow in a sad movie. Tears that never, however, get connected to visiting your dying friend. We feel sorry for people, he says. We truly lament the pain and suffering in the world. These Egyptians, they're everywhere. But having felt the internal motions of pity, wept a few requisite tears of sorrow, sent off $10 to a charitable appeal. We return to our homes and jobs without knowing the names of the people we've shed tears over, without visiting a single prisoner whose fate we lament, without writing one letter to the lonely one over whom our heart breaks. End quote. As I think of what he's confronting there, what occurs to me is this. I think sentiment is what a lot of us do, myself included, in church. We feel moved. We come because we get moved and we're hoping to be moved. But here's the deal. If we never move, if we never act, we'll never change. See, generous hearts, very important. And we're talking about how to form a generous hearts are formed in the doing. Not just in the feeling of compassion. James says it this way in his epistle, chapter 2, verse 15. You see a brother or sister without clothing or food, and all you do is feel for them. And then you say to them, go in peace. I feel so bad for you. Be warmed. Be filled. I love how James speaks. He goes, what good is that? do you get this just just where we start here a generous heart is marked first by generous eyes generous eyes that notice what other people don't notice that see what other people don't see but beyond generous eyes it has generous hands it acts it touches it gets involved. By the way, this is just kind of a side note here. It's very interesting to me, hopefully to you as well, in the bigger picture of things. As I tell this story, does it sound familiar to any of you? Have you noticed the similarity between the story of David and stopping for this Egyptian that he could have easily walked by, an Egyptian that, in terms of culture, we would have nothing to do with, and Jesus' story of the Good Samaritan? It's absolutely parallel. In fact, there's no doubt in my mind that David's story was the basis for Jesus' parable. It's a very interesting thing. I just want to get you to get your arms around the fact. You know, I kind of grew up in my way of thinking that the Old Testament was old, the New Testament was new, so the New Testament's the good one. And the New Testament is because it's new. And the New Testament is the one where it's full of grace. And the New Testament is where we discover things about the kingdom of God. Are you getting the picture that as we do this journey of the heart and we talk about David's heart, that David in the Old Testament was living in the kingdom of God. Jesus got his story. The story he made up, Jesus made that story up to teach a profound truth about the kingdom of God, the Good Samaritan. He got that story from David who was living that story out. Back to the story. Or rather, back to the question. Where does a heart like this, like David's heart toward generosity, come from? How is it formed? How does a person develop generous eyes? I've never heard that before, generous. How do you develop generous eyes? Well, I think it can be done. And I can give you a real simple tool to help you develop generous eyes. Start with this by asking God to heal your vision. Just do it all by yourself. You can do it here. I would encourage you, you know, maybe tomorrow morning when you wake up, if you have a quiet time, if you don't do that on your way to work, turn off the radio and just, in fact, I dare you to do this. Because you know what? If you do, honestly, just test this. If you spend the next week and whatever else it is you pray about and whatever else you read, just every morning say, Lord, heal my vision, heal my sight. Help me see some people that normally I don't see, that maybe normally I just walk right by. Help me see what I don't normally see. I'm going to just make you a promise. You're going to see some people that normally you don't see. And see, I think they're everywhere. They're on your school bus. They're in the locker rooms. They're in the cafeteria. It's a kid who sits by himself maybe. Some of them live next door. They're at our workplace. Just think about this. Just real quietly praying every morning, Lord, who are the Egyptians in my life? right here, right now, in the middle of my problems that I got of my own, people that I don't see. And here's the deal on the Egyptian. People who could be revived with just a little bit of bread and just a little bit of water and just a cluster of raisins. People who could be revived by just a little bit of time and a little bit of help. And it won't cost me much, just a little generosity. But past, God help me see them. What do I do? Beyond sentiment, what do I do? For beloved, it is in the doing that you will begin to develop a generous heart. Not in the sentiment. I think we're really good on the sentiment. And we kind of look at ourselves. I have a really good heart because when he tells those stories, his eyes are crying. And that's great. You got eyes. That's great. See, most of us do connect the heart with feeling. We're on a journey of the heart. And if you feel things, we're there. And so if we feel generous, if we feel compassionate, I must be compassionate and generous. Here's the deal, hard truth. Not till you do will you become generous. Back to the story. Turns out this Egyptian was a servant of an Amalekite warrior that one of them that David was pursuing. And after this Egyptian makes sure, after he's revived, and then he makes sure that David and his men can be trusted in verse 15, he's more than happy to help and tell David and the men where the Amalekites are. Pick it up in verse 16. And when he, that is the Egyptian, brought him, that is David, down, behold, they were spread, that is the Amalekites were spread all over the land, eating and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines. and from the land of Judah. See, they thought the game was over. And they were already in their locker room spraying champagne all over the place. This would have made a great movie. And David slaughtered them. Whatever. See, it says it. Now, David slaughtered them from twilight, from the twilight, until the evening of the next day. It's a bloodbath. Don't you wish that wasn't in the Bible? Anyway, make a great movie. And not a man of that escaped, not a man of them escaped, except for 400 young men who apparently had motorcycles called camels and fled. So David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken and rescued his two wives. I hope you wouldn't notice that. Don't ask me any questions about his two wives for a couple weeks. At the beginning of the talk, I told you there were a lot of places that David messed up. Remember that? In a couple weeks, we're going to talk about it. we're going to look at the heart of David that produced some pretty significant dysfunction in his family. In fact, I don't think you should miss those weeks because we're going to talk about the dysfunction in David's life and the depth of it in such a way that it's going to make you feel really good about your family. It'll be very encouraging. But nothing of theirs was missing, verse 19, whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that they had taken for themselves. David brought it all back. So David had captured all the sheep and the cattle, which the people drove ahead of the other livestock. And they said, this is David's spoil, which sounds like the end of the story. The battle is over, but the story isn't over. Verse 21, when David came to the 200 men, now we're back to them, who were too exhausted to follow David, who had also been left at the Brook Besser. And they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him. Then David approached the people and greeted them. Then all the wicked and worthless men among those who went with David answered and said, what's the deal? Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered. We'll give them back their wives and their children, but then let them leave. they're called wicked and worthless these men who don't want to share the spoils and while I'm preaching and while I have time to look at the text and see how the story ends I kind of have the perspective that I can see how they're wicked and worthless but if I'm honest I've got to admit I understand their complaint I might even have their complaint Again, not when I'm preaching, but in real life. If I was really there, I mean, why should we be giving anything to them? We did all the work. And if we give to them, there's going to be less for us. They don't deserve it. And they were right. Well, whatever else these wicked and worthless ones were, they were small-minded, they were self-absorbed, They were grasping and greedy. And people like that, who are self-absorbed, grasping, greedy, small-minded, literally see the world in an entirely different way than people like David do. They literally, getting kind of back to the blindness thing, they literally do not see things or do see things. That people like David with a generous heart, they see the whole thing a different way. In fact, their experience of life is a different experience. Oren McManus, in his book entitled Uprising, says that very thing, that people like this not only see the world differently, but they experience life differently. People who are greedy and people who are generous. Quoting McManus, while the greedy see the world with limited resources, thus they must grasp and hoard. And the thought of sharing, I mean, it's not even on the radar screen. The generous always operate from an abundance mentality. And when you're operating from an abundance mentality, you just see the world differently. So when you see a need or a possibility, you just give. Why? Because there's an abundance mentality. There's going to be more. There's enough. The greedy hold and take to ensure that they will never be without. The generous give without fear. but it's more than an absence of fear. For the generous, there is an undeniable presence of joy, which means, again, that people marked by generosity actually experience life. Their experience of life is different than grasping people. Back to McManus, who says this, it isn't that the generous aren't concerned about their own lives or well-being. It's just that they have discovered an unexpected secret. it's this, that life is most enjoyed when you give yourself away they experience undescribable pleasure in serving the good of others and knowing that someone else's life is enriched because of what they gave is like a secret indulgence to them by the way, when you're talking about generosity and greed there are just a number of ways this just kind of floats or flows into a number of arenas of life. The generosity and greed can be applied to things far beyond money or stuff. Have you ever experienced someone who was emotionally greedy or emotionally generous? Well, you have. You might not have used that term before, that phraseology. Emotionally generous people in a relationship, whatever else they do to keep it at a real simple level, they give more than they take. Now in any relationship, any good relationship, there are things that you get and there are things that you give. Emotionally generous people generally are going to be giving more than they're taking. The problem is nobody's measuring that. So it's not that you're noticing. You're not in a relationship, I'm giving more than I'm getting. Oh good, I'm... You don't measure that, so that's not what you notice. What you notice when your relationship with an emotionally generous person is simply this. You like being around them. That's how deep my perceptions go. When you're with an emotionally generous person, what you notice is that you look forward to being with them and seeing them and you don't get tired of them. Emotionally greedy people are the opposite. They take more than they give. Now again, no one's measuring that. So that's not what you notice. What you notice is every time you're with them, you feel drained. You know why? Because you've been drained. It's not that you don't notice. What you notice is you find yourself avoiding them. You can only take small doses of them. Lots of people like this in church. Now, there's lots of people like this. I mean, there are people who are emotionally greedy at your work and your family. You see them everywhere. And in some ways, though, churches are interesting breeding grounds for this. And if you think about it, you could even see why. I mean, churches are places where we say, come, and we're going to point you to God. But there's kind of this other thing. We will meet all your needs. We will meet all your needs. And so people go to a church, and they're emotionally greedy. And they're taking, they're taking, they're taking. They basically come to church, and they say, God says you need to love me. So here I am. Meet all my needs. Love me. and they take and they take and they drain and you wonder why you're tired every time you see them. Because they're takers. The point around this whole thing is this issue of a generous heart and a greedy heart flows in many directions. We can be generous with our time. or we can be stingy. We can be generous with our encouragement or we can be greedy. How many fathers do you think have ever lost their sons because they were just too generous with their praise? Boy, I don't want them to get cocky. You just got to knock them down a pig. Yeah, well, good. We can be generous with grace or we can be stingy. We can be generous with mercy or we can withhold it. We can be generous with love or we can just hold it back and make you jump through hoops and then you'll get it. You know, all of us want grace, don't we? We all want mercy. We all want love. Let me tell you something. This is the hard piece. You will never ever become graceful or merciful or loving until you give it. I'm always waiting to get enough full of it and then maybe give up, but I'm so scared if I give any, I won't have enough for me. See, this just applies to everything. It applies to your stuff. It applies to how you love people. It applies to how you give grace to people, how you give time to people. And you will never have generosity formed in your heart until you give it away, ever. Back to the story. David's response to the 200 who had been left behind, big surprise. was to be generous. And by the way, just a little thing on David's generosity. We have a couple weeks on this because it just gets, it spills out into every aspect of his life. The reason David is generous here isn't because he goes, what would be the generous thing to do? He didn't just do generous things. He was a generous person. So whenever he came into these situations, the natural thing that flowed out of him was generosity. That's why it's no big surprise when it comes to these 200. he says this, verse 24, everybody gets the same. For as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the baggage. They shall all share alike. Why? Where is this generosity that we see in David to people who don't deserve it coming from? Such an important question. How is this kind of generosity formed in the human heart? Well, actually, verse 23 gives us some clues. Because, well, once again, verse 23 just kind of gives you how it is that David is looking at the world. And so different than the wicked and the worthless are looking at the world. Because here's how David's looking at the world and looking at this situation. He's saying this to the wicked and the worthless. He says, with what the Lord has given. us. How can we be anything but givers? I mean, I don't even get it, you guys. The actual verse says this, you must not do this, my brothers, with what the Lord has given us, with how he kept us, and delivered into our hand the band that came against us. This is a story that actually happened with David, but do some of the symbolism in terms of spiritual life and spiritual warfare, be like you or I saying, with what the Lord has done for us, how he has kept us and he has delivered us from the hand of the enemy and he has redeemed us and lavished on us his grace. How on earth can we be anything but generous? I don't get it. You see, David remembered something that these wicked and worthless ones had forgotten. See, David remembered where they were from. I don't see it in the text, but I hear the energy of it. I hear David in some way say to these guys, who do you think you are? Do you remember where we came from? Do you remember who you were? In chapter 22, verse 2, we were just a bunch of ragtag, indebted, distressed, discontent vagabonds. We had no home. We had no hope. We had no help. But now, with what God has done for us, we not only are alive and have some, we got the spoils of war, we got all this wealth. How he has kept us and delivered us, how can we be anything but grateful? And with that, we get another clue as to how generosity is formed in the human heart. For generosity begins, get this, generosity begins with the gratitude that remembers. that I was at one time separate from Christ. Ephesians chapter 2. Generosity begins with a gratitude that remembers that at one time I was excluded from the community of faith. At one time I was a stranger to the covenant of promise. I had no hope and I was without God in the world. But now with what God has done for us, with how he has kept us and how he has delivered us, We who were formerly far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ, who in generosity shed his blood so we could know him. How can we be anything but generous? I don't get it. Generosity begins with a gratitude that remembers, I had a debt I couldn't pay. Generosity begins with a gratitude that remembers that though he was rich, yet for our sakes he gave generously of himself, becoming poor, pouring all of his resources out in order that we, through his generosity, through his poverty, might be made rich. Not so I could now hoard it, but so that I could become just like it and give it generously. It, what's it? Every aspect of life. Grace, mercy, forgiveness, stuff, time. David's generosity was formed in his heart with a gratitude that remembered the graciousness and generosity to him as a person and to them as a people, raising then in him this question Since he's been so generous to me, how can I be like him? Oh, I know. I could give. I mean, this is a constant theme in the kingdom of God. Remember Zacchaeus? You know the story, Zacchaeus. It's this penny-pinching, more than penny-pinching. He was a hoarder who was ripping other people off to gain his own wealth, and then he had an encounter with the king of kings, and the generosity of Jesus landed on him, And he gave back everything that he stole. In fact, he multiplied and gave back double and triple what he had stolen. And he became generous. Where did it come from? I promise you. It's clear his generosity was born in his gratitude. Remember the prostitute? Broke the vial of alabaster and washed Jesus' feet with her tears. She was generous. Simon, the religious guy who was very, very appropriate and would never do anything crazy, was appalled by what she was doing. This woman was generous. Her generosity, where did it come from? How was it formed in her? The generosity was formed in her. It was born in her gratitude. Generosity begins with a gratitude that remembers, but sometimes we forget. And when we forget where we're from, gratitude dies. And with gratitude dying, generosity dies with it. I don't care how many sermons you hear. We ought to be more generous. We ought to be whatever. If you've forgotten where you're from, that you were without Christ, that you had a debt you couldn't pay, the amazing grace of God, it doesn't move you anymore. If you've forgotten that, gratitude dies, and with it generosity. Matthew 20, Jesus tells a parable. And like the story of the Good Samaritan that paralleled the story of David meeting this Egyptian in the desert, this parable in Matthew 20, it's the same thing. You have a parable in Matthew 20 that parallels the generosity of David, sharing with the 200 the spoils of war that technically they didn't deserve. The parable is this, Matthew 20. It's of workers invited into a vineyard by a great landowner to work. And it was a great deal. This invitation into this vineyard was more than they ever expected. It was exceeding abundantly beyond everything they could have ever asked or thought. And the pay was amazing. They couldn't have gotten this kind of wealth in any other job, in any other way. And so when they came into the field at the beginning of the day, they were so grateful. And they sang songs. I know I'm adding here. But they were so grateful to the landowner for this invitation, not only to come into the vineyard, but for the privilege of working in the field. But later in the day, near the end of the day, stretch it out, the parable to what it's really talking about, near the end of the life, near the end of the age, some of the other workers came into the field as well. but they came in later. They didn't do as much. They didn't work as hard but when the landowner settled the accounts at the end of the day, at the end of the life he gave them all the same. He just lavished this grace all over them. Gave them all the same. Predictably, a complaint arose just like from the wicked and the worthless in David's story. Where do you think Jesus again got this story? The complaint arose, and the complaint was this. It isn't fair. We did all the work. They don't deserve it. Now, the things that you can draw from that parable in terms of application, just are, you could go on and on. The point of the parable, as it relates to what we're kind of landing on this morning, however, is this. That the longer, sometimes, not always, but sometimes the longer you've been in the vineyard, the more likely you are to forget that you had a debt you couldn't pay. And with that forgetfulness, gratitude dies. And when gratitude dies, generosity dies with it. And I don't care how many sermons you hear about how you ought to be generous. People who aren't generous have forgotten because they're not grateful. we have more to say about David's generosity in weeks to come I want to tell you how about again it's about this generosity that was in him and it just applies I want to tell you about the time in the weeks to come of how he's just sitting there one day and goes is there anyone in Saul's house that I could show favor to Saul who betrayed me Saul who tried to kill him is anyone left in in Saul's house that I could I could just bless why I just want to bless him. I just want to be generous with him. And they call out Mephibosheth, and we'll tell the story of Mephibosheth. And in that same thing, a little bit later in David's life, we'll see at the threshing floor when he says, somebody offers him all the implements of worship, and he'll say, I don't want to do this. I will not give to God. That would cost me nothing. And he's generous, and he's giving to God. And then at the end of his life, at the very end, now he's an old man. Now he told me from the beginning to the end, you see this generous heart there. Because he had shed so much blood, God said you can't build the temple, but he was given permission, maybe because of his genera, you can take the offering, and so David, first thing David does, he doesn't go, you need to all give, you know what David did, he just started looking at all his own stuff, and said, I can give that, and I can give that, and he gave, and he gave, and he gave, and he gave, and then it caught fire in the people, and they started to give, and one of the greatest privileges David ever had in his life, I think, was as an old man to look at his people and go, they get it. They get it. Because they're giving. But what do we get today? What do we get today? What we saw was this, that David was generous to the least in the lost as embodied in this Egyptian In the deserts. To people who desperately needed generosity. To some who didn't deserve generosity. At least technically. That was embodied in the 200 people. Who stayed by the brook Besser. And we saw that. That generosity of David was formed. In a gratitude that remembered. The generosity. Of God toward him. Working to give him. Number one. Generous eyes. to see those who would be very easy to ignore, but it didn't stop there. It gave him generous hands that beyond sentiment acted and moved and gave generously. More on this in weeks to come. Let's pray. Father in heaven, we want and need this kind of heart. First of all, we need it for ourselves because the experience of life that people who are generous have is one of joy. And we need that. We want that. That we would be able to see the world a different way with generous eyes. and generous hands. But Father, beyond our experience of generosity, that's actually, that's a benefit. It's not really the point. The truth is this, as a people in this community, the fact is if we really have desire, any hope at all, to bring the kingdom of God to the Egyptians, to the people who don't deserve it, to whoever is in this community that you're calling us to, it's It's just never going to happen unless this kind of heart is formed in us. And so we pray. Help us see what we don't see. Help us see who we don't see. Beyond sentiment, help us to give a glass of water and share our fig bread and clusters of raisins and give it all away. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. As is always the case, the altar.
