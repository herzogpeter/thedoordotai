Righteousness is like a radio tower. That's as good as I could get. You know those radio towers? There's like those three big ones over by Bethel, and there's one on Highway 100, I think that's KQ. You know what I'm talking about? Great, big, tall structures. They're triangular in shape. They reach straight up to heaven, and they are supported by three opposing forces in the forms of cables. If any one of those cables were to break, the tower would fall. But with all three of them pulling with equal force, that tower stands incredibly tall under incredibly high winds. I think this is an incredible picture of righteousness. I'm Bruce Belgard I'm your worship and music pastor and before I'm going to talk about the subject I'm going to talk about we need to start with getting hungry and thirsty for righteousness this is how the Greek word is interpreted for righteousness a state of him or her as he or she ought to be integrity, virtue, purity of life correctness of thinking, feeling, and acting. Wow. That encompasses a lot, doesn't it? The correctness of thinking, feeling, and acting. Around here, we call it a rightly ordered life. That's what Dave talks a lot about. A rightly ordered life. It's a life lived well in the kingdom of God. Matthew 5, 6. Jesus says, Blessed are you if you're hungry and thirsty for this kind of right living. for you will be satisfied. Matthew 6, 33, seek first the kingdom of God and this, righteousness, right living. Stick with me, all right? I think some of the mysteries of the gospel are in here. It's hard to talk about mystery in practical terms, but stick with me. Trinity, this idea of three things coming together as one is in everything. Everything from the creator himself all the way down to the atom. The atom is the proton and the neutron and the electron together. God himself is the justice of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the power and love of the Holy Spirit. He himself, in his oneness, decided to make these three kind of opposing forces. Okay, let me give you an example from Scripture when talking about opposing. Ephesians 2.8. It's by grace that you've been saved through faith. It's not because of your works. Is that true? Yes. But here comes James 2.20. But faith without works is dead. Okay. Now think this through. Which one's true? They're both true. We need to live in the tension of those two truths. If we just did one of them, if we just did grace, then we'd keep on sinning, going, I can just keep waking up day after day and praying for forgiveness. Isn't grace wonderful? Now that's out of balance. And your tower will eventually fall if that's how you're living. Now, if just the other side works, I'm going to earn my way to heaven, boy. I'm going to be good, good all the time. you know well you aren't going to make it guess what you need some of what the grace has and if you're all about grace you need some about the works it's both you know it's why the bible's a book and not a pamphlet alright seriously I think that the enemy of righteousness is self-righteousness is just one truth and it's the notion that Keith Meyer talked about a couple weeks ago about pride it's the I'm right instead of the God is right and the God right is a God that represents himself in three different persons and false unity is made up when a bunch of self-righteous people say they're just this cable right say they're the left cable well they get a bunch of other left cables to agree with them yeah I've got like a bunch of people we're right we're the grace people it's all about grace well that's a false unity based off of pride and you can kind of see that you know that's what divides churches get how it divides them because they're all left cables well here's all the right cables right that is self-righteous disunity false unity looks like unity but it's not we need to realize that unity is that i've got part of the answer and you've got part of the answer. True unity is that we come going, man, I think I've got a truth. What do you have? And we live in the tension of the fullness of Christ, the fullness of the gospel, not just a part of it. That Ephesians scripture, re-read, I'm going to read it again. Jesus, or excuse me, in Ephesians, Paul says this, It was he, Jesus, who gave some to be apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastor-teachers, all these different people, so that that would prepare God's people for the work of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until it reaches unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Then we are no longer infants being tossed back and forth by waves or blown here and there by every wind of teaching. Okay, imagine this tower. How does it happen? It takes on the fullness of Christ. That's the only way it's not going to be blown down. By every wind of teaching. Notice it doesn't say false teaching. It's a truth. But if all you do is one truth, the latest fad, the latest thing that's going on, and you disregard the other truths, then you're going to fall. It goes on. Instead, speaking the truth in love. Boy, that kills the self-righteousness, doesn't it? Speak it in love. Meaning you're going to love the people that you're going to bring your peace to. We will in all things grow up into him who is the head, that is Christ. From him, the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament. Get the picture? grows and builds itself up in love as each part does its work. Are you getting excited about righteousness? Huh? If we do this, we're going to stand tall. We've got to get hungry and thirsty because if we don't, if we fall for the false one, we're going to, Satan is just dying to get us to be self-righteous and to let go of this idea because our towers will fall if we do it. Why am I telling you all this? because we're going to talk about worship today. And we're going to talk about a very specific part of it, and that is why do we, week after week, gather together in this room and do what you guys are doing right now? Why do we do it? This is a very delicate subject matter that if we don't approach it being hungry and thirsty for this balanced life, then we run the risk of tearing it apart. So I beg of you as we move forward that we would consider the fullness of God. Let's pray as we enter in. Lord Jesus, I really do pray for a vision. For me, a radio tower works. Lord, give whatever these people need so they will become hungry and thirsty for the full gospel. That we would set down our pride and we would know that we have only part of the answer. So with humility, I try to delve into this subject matter. Lord, let your righteousness be made known among us. In Jesus' name, amen. Okay, I have to move quickly to get us to what this is, this weekend thing we do here. It's not the whole deal. And I preached a sermon about, almost three years ago, about what the foundations of worship is, and I have no time to reteach it. But if you miss this, you miss the whole point. Because worship isn't a thing you do on Sunday. It is a way of life. The interpretation of the word worship throughout Scripture is interpreted bow or serve. And it is the first tension that you've got to enter into. Worship is a lifestyle. It's what makes us disciples. That we submit our will and bow to Jesus. We let go of our pride and say, it's your will, not mine. And then, those are the times that we immerse ourselves in his presence, that we're present to him, to hear from him, to let go. But then Jesus says, okay, time to get out of the river of God's presence and go and serve some people. Do you know that feeding the hungry is worship? Do you know that being light and love to your people at work is worship? If you don't know that, you're going to miss the point of why we gather here. Let me just sum it up quickly by this. It would be as if you're in a marriage relationship, but you don't see your spouse except for an hour and 15 minutes on Sunday. And you go, I love you, honey. And then you go off and do your own thing. That's what it would be like if you'd missed the actions of worship. So you've got to bow and serve. But if you have that bowing and serving going on in your life, then there is this incredible thing that we can do to enter into God's presence and immerse ourselves in his love. And I'll tell you what, that's a popular subject right now. There's been a rebirth in our nation, and I think around the world, around those times of declaration and ascribing. I went on a Christian website, there's 1,975 books available on the subject. Do you know how many worship CDs there are? It's selling. There's like 1-800 numbers on the television now that you can get worship stuff. But I think we need to fire a warning shot across the bow, because I think we're starting to get a little out of balance. And that's what I want to look at today. Because a lot of what that, all the hubbub is about, is between just us individually and God. And that's not what we come together here. That's a good thing, the first balance. I'm not saying that we all need those one-on-one times with the Creator. We have to have it. But if it's all about me, then why are we gathering together today? Is this just a representation of a thousand individuals completely apart from one another? The answer is no. We're going to talk about three things today of what these meetings are about, I believe. They're about a discipline. They are about truth, and they are about unity. We're going to start with discipline. Discipline is more than a feeling. We do it because it's good, not because it feels good. It's like exercise. if you just did exercise because it felt good we would never exercise I'm known as the skinny flabby guy you know I hide it well but I have trouble with exercising I do because I'm a victim of the feel good culture too and it feels bad it does now if you do it enough I love riding bike and if I ride bike enough there's times when it feels good but if I based exercise on whether it felt good or not, I wouldn't do it. It's more than a feeling. It doesn't mean that feelings are bad. That's where I want to start. I want to read to you what I think is a letter to the church. This is from a book called Adventures in Missing the Point. It's written by Brian McLaren. The part I'm going to read is from Brian McLaren but Tony Campalo helped him write it too. It feels like a letter that Paul would write to the church and what I like about it, It's our first challenge of correction and balance. And what I like is it's not coming from me, so I can include myself with you as I read it. From Adventures in Missing the Point, Brian McLaren says this, I think worship is a lot like what researchers are discovering about sexuality. Scientists cited in a PBS production on evolution the biological basis of infatuation. The brain seems to be wired to release all kinds of pleasurable, brain-bathing chemicals in response to romantic sexual involvement in an especially attractive object of one's desire. These chemicals make the brain experience a combination of euphoria, obsession, and desire, essential feelings to the procreation of our species. But under the influence of this chemical cocktail in our brains, we are stimulated to make changes in our lives we would never otherwise make, like leave our father and mother, get a better job, discover the joys of personal grooming, perhaps? Become at least a little less self-absorbed. But as essential to the survival of the species is an end to infatuation, the effects of these chemicals gradually wearing off, the scientists say, so that the couple can settle in and get on with life and the responsibility to raise any of these children that were conceived through this time of passion. Passion and obsession and euphoria must give way to hard work, nurture, and responsibility. A problem is created when a person becomes addicted to the euphoria of infatuation. When it begins wearing off, they lose interest in their partner and move on to another partner, seeking an encore infatuation experience, which again inevitably fades. Such a person mistakes this inevitably fading euphoria with a malfunctioning relationship. So they regularly short-circuit the intended process, which is infatuation, bonding, commitment, responsibility, nurture, by moving on to find another high. The addiction that ensues, the scientists said, is every bit as addictive as crack, heroin, alcohol, and perhaps as destructive as well. So what does this all have to do with worship? Just this. I wonder how many of us develop a kind of addiction to a spiritual feeling, a spiritual infatuation with God, a beautiful thing, a needful thing, but a thing that is not the real point. And I wonder if we worship leaders don't become enmeshed in this addiction, the unwitting codependence of a people addicted to spiritual infatuation, dealers in a kind of high. I know in my city there are floating congregations of Christians who migrate from church to church, wherever the biggest bang is being felt is where they'll be. They have Christian words for it, like the anointing, perhaps, or intimacy with God, or being in the presence of God. But I sometimes secretly wonder if they have become spiritual infatuation addicts. Whose sermon will give them the feeling? Which worship leader, which songs, which instruments, which vocalists help them get it? Which order of service, how many songs, in which order, which combination of high and low volumes or lentos and allegretos, which pattern of emotional journey, what perfect formula will help him get the feeling. Sometimes I wonder if too many of us assume the feeling is the whole point of worship. Worse, if it's the whole point of Christianity. Hold on, you say. What could be better than intimacy with God or deep worship or being in God's presence or experiencing God? phrases that commonly are used to describe the feeling. My first impulse is to answer, nothing could be better, yet in the back of my head I hear a small voice murmuring, well, there's always obedience and service, faithfulness and humility. Experience has made me doubt that God is as concerned about the feeling as we are. And I've come to believe that worship like sex involves phases. Listen to this folks or you'll miss the balance Yes, infatuations are wonderful Yes, the ecstasy of euphoria are a wonderful gift that I have enjoyed far more than I deserve But worship and discipleship are no more about the feeling than marriage and parenthood and adulthood Are about endlessly persevering the brain cocktail of euphoria Yes, I've often stood in worship and prayed or thought It's not happening Lord Come on Holy Spirit make your presence known. If I could discern any answering voice at all, all it said was sorry, but no. That's not what you and I are all about right now. I have other things for you. Yes, praise me. Yes, worship me, but not to hype yourself into an all about you euphoria. I often hear this other question as well. The father saying, if you never felt the feeling again, would you still worship me anyway? For me? And not just for the feeling? Maybe the lack of the feeling is actually a wonderful gift, a saving grace, a needed interlude, so that you and your congregation don't become infatuation addicts. Maybe the lack of the feeling is a needed no from God, so that you'll move on from infatuation to other things like obedience, humility, endurance, service, maturity. Maybe spiritual infatuation with God is missing the point. A near miss, perhaps, but still a miss. Maybe public worship is about more than achieving the feeling. Maybe public worship is intended to be a runway or a launching pad, or we call it a locker room, To inspire us to rise toward a more holistic kind of worship that expresses itself through the lyric of daily living. Through the rhythm of work, family, rest, and play. Through the music of kindness to strangers. And labors for justice and deeds of neighborly compassion. Maybe the best worship is what happens after the service is done, not during it. Maybe the most inspiring worship is that which inspires us to live well after the amplifiers are unplugged. End quote. Wow. I think that's a letter for the church in this day. Okay, here's our first challenge of balance. Ready? Here's how we could do this in an out-of-balance way. Well, Bruce, this is easy. Just don't do inspiring worship. We could take care of this now. It would be like if you're in a relationship and you're having problems with this infatuation thing, well, that's easy. I just won't shower. You know, I'll be a slob at home. I'll never take my spouse out to dinner. Would that take care of the infatuation? Yes! I've been married for 20 years. You know what? We work hard on being, offering our best to one another. We have to work hard on it because we know it's not all about that. But you know what? My spouse deserves the best. And guess what? Jesus deserves our very best and we're going to give it but here's the balance is it all about that so that if you don't get the feeling wow worship was bad today the worship leader we had filling in for us last week wasn't he great what a great young man he said it this way he was at a worship event he leads worship in a big church in Detroit but he's moving here and he was at a worship event just attending one and he left and he bumped into a fellow person from his congregation and he said, well, just think about the worship. And I can't believe how daring he was. He goes, you know what? I think you got the wrong question. What did God think about your worship? You know what? If we think that, can you see where we're going? I mean, we've been given incredible ways to paint huge pictures about God. We need to be faithful to that. We've been given that. And if I just set that aside going, oh, it's not about that, boy, that would be the wrong, That's exactly what the enemy would want us to do. Just be that one truth and pull down the tower with this, you know, we'll just be ugly for God. Well, no, that's not the answer. You know, so sometimes you come, we'll do the best we can, and sometimes it's going to confirm where you're at because you're in a good place. Other times you're going to come and it's going to convict you because you're in a tough place. That's okay. Sometimes you'll be in a desert. That's all right. You aren't coming because it feels good. You're coming because it's a discipline, and it is good. But I hope that every time you come, you're reminded of the truth, which brings me to my next point. It is about truth. And the first point of that is that we want to say the truth in a truthful way. John 4, 24, God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. How we do that here is that first of all, we really try hard for the songs that we sing, the prayers that we pray, the scriptures we read, the sermons we preach, to be true. But equally as important, if you just did that one, you'd be out of balance. You've got to say it in a truthful way. We have some things. It's why the first be statement in what we believe is be real, be authentic. You need to know a couple things. First of all, on Thursday nights when we do our rehearsal, we have a check-in and prayer time for one another. And we get to admit, you know what? I don't feel like worshiping this week because I've had a really tough week. And you know, when we do that, that allows us then to come up and proclaim the truth, because it's true regardless of how we feel. But when we're able to be accountable to one another about how we really are, instead of putting a mask on it like, Praise God! Everything's great all the time, you know? You've got to present it truthfully. You need to know that in pre-service prayer times, I get to pray in front of Keith and Dave and everyone. I don't feel like it today. And I've got to tell you folks, they tend to be the most powerful weekends I'm a part of. because God is blessed that we do it not because of the feeling. There's a second set of truths that we need to be in balance on. A lot of things fall under these. We need to, as a church, live in the tension of two truths, who we are and who we are becoming. Who we are. We need to take an inventory of who we are. We're the body of Christ, but we're a portion of it. This isn't the whole church around the world. We're just a part of the greater picture. Well, what part are we? What are the strengths that God has brought to us? What is our character? What's our personality? We need to be in touch with that. But then not to be stuck there because the heart and soul of a disciple is that we're constantly growing and changing and learning. We'll be doing that for eternity, by the way. So if you feel like, oh no, I figured it out, we're all done, you're gonna get stuck. Who we are and who we are becoming. let me give you kind of a quick example of this I think all the style debates fall under this do you know how many churches divide over what music style gets played boy we need to stop that because it's all good believe it or not believe it or not you don't know God's favorite music you think you do and it's self-righteousness now I need to hear from you it's a part of finding out who we are I don't want you to think, oh, I can never tell Bruce an idea. No, but you know, so oftentimes people come with this, I got the one right idea, and if you just did mine, oh, it'd be perfect. That really is hard to hear because it's got a self-righteousness to it. We need to come and go, you know, I wonder if I have part of the answer. Would you like to listen to me? And then I'm all ears. Okay, let's just give an example of this, how it works with style. Because there's lots of different styles, right? Let's start with an obvious example. are we a Brazilian church that play Brazilian styles of music? No. Does that make Brazilian music bad? No. It's just not who we are. Well, does God prefer Latin music over, you know, what we do? No, no, no. It's all good. Now, are we becoming a Brazilian church? Maybe. No, follow me with this. Here's a couple ways it would happen, and this is our work as a church leadership and through the elders, and we have a ton of accountability. A couple ways it would happen is that there would be a big bunch of the Brazilian rich and be home to them. You know, another way it happens is that we go, you know what? I had a dream last night, or I had a prayer, and you hear from about 10 different sources that I think we're supposed to reach out to the Brazilian community. It's not who we are right now. And it would be confirmed in prayer, and all of a sudden we'd make a bold step. And what you'd need to do is be intentional. Put some people from Brazil in leadership. You know, you'd need to do some intentional steps. Okay, get it? That's how it works. You've got to live in that tension. And we're always asking, God, what do you want us to become? And who are we? Well, you know, I don't think that, I'm not shopping for pipe organs and hymnals, okay? Oh, you don't like, I love that. I grew up in a Lutheran church. I love singing a mighty fortress, you know? And I hope that we do bring, we just sang Amazing Grace today. There's something wonderful about those hymns. But the style, you know, the packaging, that's not who we are. You know, who we are is a church that about 15 plus years ago got called to be a pioneer in the areas of contemporary music styles. And that was something that wasn't among them, but they said, I really, you know, discern this calling that we need to move into that. And with boldness, they moved into it, and God brought growth to it. And you know what? After 15 plus years, there's a lot of really talented musicians and contemporary music styles here. It's who we are. And so we're going to be who we are. And we're going to try to have a, I hope you sense that there's a diversity within that style that tries to minister to a bunch of people. Here's another way to look at who we are. Just another way to look at it. I did a, or I had Lisa Brinkman here do a search in our database of everyone that's in our database. You know that there's 13,000 people in our database? It just got cleaned up about five years ago, where we took thousands of names off of it. Talking about floating congregations. I don't know where they all are. They aren't all here, but they still are in our database. 7,000 of those 13,000 give their ages. And that tends to be the people who are more involved, because we get more information about them. So let's just look at who we are from the picture of age. Okay? Because it's one of the ways we're diverse. There's some ways we aren't diverse at all. We all know that. But this is one of the ways we're diverse, so we're going to look at it. People 60 and up, 2%. People in their 40s and 50s, that would be the boomers, I thought would be the overwhelming majority. No, it's 28%. People in their 20s and 30s, 32%. People 20 and under, 39%. Do you know that we have, yeah! Yeah! Woo! We got a whole church worth of people that meet down in the basement. A whole church worth. Absolutely. That would be a good attendance in a lot of churches. Well, they're all downstairs. And you know what? And they're coming up. They're coming up. You know what? I'm glad you guys clapped because there is something to celebrate here, ladies and gentlemen. We're still all meeting in one room. Good for you, open door. Good for you. it speaks highly of your character you do get this at some level, you really do get it and so I don't, seriously you need to know how rare it is people come to this church and see this demographic and they go what are you guys doing, they think we figured out some formula or something, you know they just keep showing up they keep showing up well guess what, we've noticed that and so you know what when I hired my two associates. Matt's going to be turning 30 here in a little bit. And we, a year and a few months ago, hired Ashley Millett, 25-year-old female, because that's who we're becoming. And you know what? They stretch me. And you know what's cool is that, you know, I was pretty hip about 15 years ago. It's part of why I was like, hey, I could fit into this church because the gifts that I have actually work in a church service. It was amazing when I figured that out, you know. But I'm not, you know, I just turned 43 Friday, my birthday. Thank you. You know, so, you know, I got James Taylor down, Pat. You know, I'm into that stuff. And he's still around. He's still hip. But you know what? We need Matt and Ashley to stretch us, and they are. It's a good thing. You know why? Because we aren't going to stay the same. If we do, we're going to die. Who we are and who we are becoming. Last point. It's about unity. It's more than just all about me. It's all about us when we gather here. Mark 12, 31. You shall love your neighbor as yourself. John 15, 13. Greater love has no one than this that he lay down his life for his friends. Philippians 2.4, let each of you regard one another as more important than himself. Regard one another as more important than yourself. We come here to be the body of Christ, people, assembled together, and Jesus gets really excited about unity in his body. In John 17, Jesus prayed an incredible prayer. He was praying for his disciples. Then he started praying for everyone who would believe in him because of their testimony. He said, my prayer for all of them, that means for all of us, now listen to this, is that they would be one. What's the example he gives? Father, as you and I are one. Do you have any clue how one the Trinity is? That's a lot of oneness. That's how much he desires unity from us. I believe the greatest reason that we come together, the greatest reason, is to exercise the discipline of gathering together in unity. For when we come together and agree in Jesus' name, we are given keys that unlock kingdom power, more power than what we have alone. In Matthew 18, Jesus answered a question regarding some issues around disputes, which is a form of disunity. disunity. And in the answer, he gives the truth about some keys to the kingdom around the idea of binding and loosing things, meaning that our decisions here matter. They not only affect the world around us, they make a difference in the spiritual world that we don't see. Our decisions matter. What we say yes to or what we say no to really has an effect in the spiritual world. But then he goes on. He said, I also tell you this. If two of you can become a symphony down here on earth concerning anything, you're saying, what? How we interpret it is a word agree. It really misses the point. The Greek word is a root word around symphonize, to make music together. Okay, now go back to this idea. If we were all clarinets playing in unison, is that a symphony? no it's different instruments playing different parts oh which part is right you know what they're all right they just work in harmony together that word really needs to be understood if two of you if any two of you can do this symphony thing concerning anything boy my father's going to give anything you want because it's harder to do than we think isn't it we want to be the i'm right not that God's right. For where two or three, he goes on, where two or three gather together because they are mine, or in Jesus' name, I'm in the middle of that. It says I'm in the midst of it. That word means that when we get together in groups of two or three, Jesus gets excited. You know why? His body's coming together. Think back to the Adam. Two or three, the atoms of the body of Christ begin to assemble, and he gets a foretaste of what is to come when the whole body is put together, and he inhabits his body. He gets really excited about unity. And so he says, do any of this, two or three, come together as my atoms, and you're going to experience power that you've never felt before. They're unique keys to the kingdom. I think that this kind of agreeing only happens when we take away selfishness. That when I agree in this dance of symphonizing, it's when I need to listen to your part. That's one of the most important things about playing together in music, is that we listen to one another. And if we can do that, we unlock kingdom power. For where two or three gather together in my name, I get in the middle of that. Let's stand. We're going to do a little exercise. Touching. No. I want you to grab the hand of the person on your right and on your left. You're going to have to do some moving. Across the aisles is good. Just naturally did that. That's great. Now listen, if you're on an end row, it's okay because Jesus said where two or three are gathered. So you at least have to be hanging on to one hand. Okay, everyone got a hand. But most of us are in groups of threes. What do you mean? There's a thousand of us here. Close your eyes. Okay, there's hundreds of people in this room, but you are in direct contact with only one or two others. Put you in the middle of that, and we are right now in groups of two or three. We are the protons, neutrons, and electrons of the body of Christ. Together, we're the atoms of the body of Christ, and he gets excited about his body coming together. And now we will engage in the discipline of agreeing. Consider the person on one side of you, probably someone you know, if you came here with someone. Maybe they're on both sides of you. But a person that you know, a friend, a spouse, someone you're close to, what do they need today? Are they in a good place? Are they in a difficult place? What word do they need to hear today? what's their favorite song? What prayer do they need prayed today? Now consider the person on your other side, someone you don't know, a total stranger. Jesus wants you to lay down your life for them. He wants you to consider their needs as greater than your own. What word, what song, what prayer, what word of encouragement do they need today, ladies and gentlemen, because there's a greater blessing to be had for you when it's their need that's getting met. And when it's the word that they need to hear and the prayer that they need to pray and their favorite song, Ahead of Your Own. What about your needs, you ask? Well, the person next to you is praying for it. Okay, and now I want to imagine the fact that this is a discipline. So week after week, imagine this person on the other side that you don't know. Maybe sometime they're half your age. What does a person half your age have? What's going to be their favorite way to enter into God's presence? Maybe next time it's someone twice your age. Maybe it's someone of a whole different income level. Maybe they dress funny. Maybe they're a different race or different gender. And we get to see, when we come together, a beautiful picture of unity in the kingdom of God. We are the body of Christ. And now imagine that you're that radio tower. And the people on your left and the people on your right are your cables of truth. Then Jesus, imagine him right in front of you as the third cable. Folks, the truth is you don't have all the answers. But you do have part of the answer. And you need what the person on your left has and you need what the person on your right has. It's how God set it up. Get used to it. Because righteousness, like right living, is like a radio tower. It is the power of three together. And now, and only now, do we get to open our eyes for the most exciting part. Open your eyes. Don't look at me, look around. And see the body of Christ. And I want you to see an army, a loving army of the kingdom of God. And you know what? We realize that we do agree about some things. We agree that the grace of Jesus is amazing, don't we? And we declare that we're going to surrender all to him, and we're going to bow and serve God Almighty. We agree about that. You know what? An atom can't do much on its own, but a body can. And a body can't do much unless its atoms are in a healthy balance of three. As we were created to be, we gather weekly to remember that we're a part of something that's much bigger than ourselves. That's why this is a discipline and it's good. This is a time where we set down the bickering and the stuff. We got part of the answer. We're just a small part of something so much bigger. So much bigger. Let's pray. Lord give us a vision Lord we realize that we live in an all about me culture Lord give us a vision of how hard Satan is working to keep us apart and give us a vision of this army because all Satan has for weapons is lies you took the keys of hell and death out of his hands all he has is lies and we together say we're the army of God and we're done listening to the lies of disunity and of self-righteousness. Lord, we are hungry and thirsty for your righteousness. Give us a vision of what's possible. Lord, and now we ask, what do you want? What do you want your army to do? Whatever it is, we say yes. Let's just close by saying the Lord's Prayer together. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen.
