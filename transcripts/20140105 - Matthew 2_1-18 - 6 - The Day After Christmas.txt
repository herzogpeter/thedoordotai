Now, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying, Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him. When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. They said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what has been written by the prophet. So Herod sent them to Bethlehem and said, Go and search carefully for the child, and when you have found him, report to me, so that I too may come and worship him. But having been warned by God in a dream not to return to Herod, the Magi left for their own country by another way. Now when they had gone, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, and said, Get up, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt and remain there until I tell you. For Herod is going to search for the child to destroy him. So Joseph got up and took the child and his mother while it was still night and left for Egypt. Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the Magi, he became very enraged and sent and slew all the male children who were in Bethlehem and all its vicinity. from two years and under, according to the time which he had determined from the Magi. Then what had been spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled. A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and she refused to be comforted because they were no more. This is the word of the Lord. It was after Jesus was born, Matthew chapter 2, so Christmas is over. The light that we've been waiting to dawn has dawned. But Christmas Day is over, the party's over, and someone now wants to kill this life. And a couple weeks ago, in the context of Advent, we heard a voice, And that voice was calling us into the wilderness to wait. And now we hear another voice. Because we were waiting for the light in the wilderness. And now there's another voice. And it's a voice that's weeping. Because it's not turning out the way we thought. Let's pray as we go to this word. I'll use this, I pray, to prepare us, to dial us into realities of life in your kingdom that we need to know that would even prepare us for this table and coming to this cross. By your Spirit, give this life in Jesus' name. Amen. It was a week ago last Friday that I had the honor, the privilege to officiate at the wedding of someone I know quite well. Indeed, from the day this young woman was born, I've known her, Caitlin May Johnson. We call her Katie, The daughter of my brother Steve is who she is, and his wife Susan, and there she was. I can still see her in my mind's eye, in a beautiful white dress, all grown up, all radiant and ready and eager to say yes, so don't screw this up is all I could think, I'm just telling you. They'd been waiting forever for this day to come. At least it felt like forever, I'm sure, on more than one occasion. at times beginning to wonder were they if it would ever come, but then it came, and here they were, all radiant, at least she was, and ready, all eager to say yes. The waiting is over. The day has arrived. The fantasy has now become reality, as the preacher, that's me, declares them one flesh. And when God has joined together in this very moment, let no one put asunder. So they light the candle, the unity candle. You know what that looks like and where it is. I had to move and it was there. And they light the candle. And the two candles become one candle. And they blow out the two candles because now we're one candle, which means the waiting is over. The day has arrived. The fantasy is now a reality because the preacher just declared one flesh. So it looks like, wow, we made it. To that place we thought we'd never get to, that moment we thought we'd never come to. But then it's here, and here we are. So let's sing and dance and laugh for joy. And so we did that day as a family, sing and dance and laugh for joy. But all of that a week ago reminded me of Advent, particularly the Advent we've been experiencing here at church, because after all the waiting, which is what Advent is all about, and after all the wondering if Christmas would ever come, Christmas finally did. In fact, it was two days before this wedding celebration. The light has finally come. We celebrated it with a candlelight service in this auditorium. The light has finally come. The desert that we spoke of when we were invited into the wilderness by John the Baptist a few weeks ago has finally blossomed. And so we sing joy to the world. The Lord has come. Glory to God in the highest peace on earth. Goodwill toward men, let's sing and dance and laugh for joy. It reminded me of Advent, did this wedding I was in. Because much like Advent, when it comes to a wedding, everything about it, think about this, is pointing to and it's waiting for a day. One single day, one single event. And when that day, that event comes, glory to God in the highest. Peace on earth, goodwill toward men, joy to the world. The Lord has come. The bride said, yes. Looks like we made it because here we are. We made it to that place we thought we'd never get to that moment we thought would never come. But then it comes because here we are. So sing and dance and laugh. for joy. It's fascinating, really, as I think about it, because the storyline that most of us are used to with romantic stories and books and movies and such is almost always focusing on the drama that's involved in getting to that day, to that single day. And the drama is all about before the day. Will we get to the day? But the drama is, how will that happen? And lots of questions kind of come around that will they ever actually meet because they keep missing each other. They're not seeing each other. And if they do meet, will they connect? And if they connect, will they fall in love? And if they do fall in love, will they overcome the obstacles? Aren't they fun? Oh, the obstacles because he's in California and she's in New York and they live in different dorms, and oh my goodness, is this going to happen or not? Will they overcome the obstacles that star-crossed lovers face that all true love must overcome and endure? But the biggest question is always this, although waiting and wondering is always about this, will they make it to that day, to that happy day, fulfillment day, the struggles over day, you know, the wedding day. It's like Christmas day, because that's the day. Christmas day is the day the lights all came on, and a baby was born, and the preacher declared one flesh. So light the candle and blow these out. You've all become one flesh. Looks like we made it. So sing and dance and laugh for joy. And sing and dance and laugh, you should rejoice. Joy to the world. The Lord has come. The bride said yes. But as most of you know, the story isn't over at the wedding day on Christmas Day. And I don't know why, but maybe more than other seasons, I was really aware of that this year. The story isn't over on the wedding day. And that's a day to celebrate. And Christmas Day, celebrate that. But the story isn't over that day indeed. It's the day after Christmas that I find myself most interested in. Because on that day comes the rest of your life. Most of which, by the way, the rest of your life, most of which doesn't feel much like a party. Because most of your life actually is going to call you back into what you thought you got out of on Christmas Day. Because the rest of your life is going to call you right back into an Advent kind of life. Because most of the time we're waiting and wondering. The rest of your life calls you back into this place of needing to trust again today. needing to obey, sometimes in simple ways, sometimes in profound ways, because your actual life is going to call you back into a need to grow up and a need to believe and sometimes believe when you can't even see they left in the middle of the night, did Mary and Joseph. And it's going to call you back in the rest of your life. It's going to call you back into a need to forgive again and to confess again and to choose maybe again today to follow or maybe choose to not follow. Not anymore. I'm not going there. I'm not doing that. And all of that kind of work doesn't involve much dancing and nobody's offering a toast. This is the day after Christmas All of which brings us to this text that Lisa read a few moments ago, because this text's story speaks to all of this in Matthew 2, verse 1, because it was the day after Christmas. So the party's over. In Matthew 2, verse 1, the wedding dance is done, because it was after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea. It says in verse 1, in the days of Herod the king, that the rest of their life, that is Mary and Joseph, and this little baby they had, this life that had come, and the rest of their life was about to begin when magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem looking for the one who'd been born king of the Jews. And when Herod heard about a rival king, it says in verse 3, he was troubled. And all Jerusalem was troubled with him. And the reason all Jerusalem was troubled was because when Herod is disturbed, when Herod is troubled, heads will roll, people will die. So an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph and Mary in a dream, it says in verse 13, said, get up and take this child and his mother and flee to Egypt. You have another journey to take. You took this one from Nazareth to Bethlehem. You've got another journey now to take. You're going to run to Egypt and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for this child in order to destroy him. This life, this light, there are some people who want to put this light out. So Joseph got up and took the child and his mother while it was still night, which is very symbolic. I mean, it was historically, I'm sure it happened at night, but this language here, the reason he's telling us night, it creates an environment. It's dark. It's scary. Nobody sees. You go to Egypt by yourself. So I guess the party's over. The wedding dance is done. The guests have all left. There's no more singing and dancing, laughing for joy, not in this scene, because when Herod figured out that he'd been tricked by the Magi, it says in verse 16, became enraged and sent and slew all the male children who were in Bethlehem and all its vicinity from two years old and under, and then they heard a voice. It was different than John the Baptist's voice calling people into the wilderness, this voice was heard in Ramah weeping. And great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and she refused to be comforted because they were no more. I thought this would be joy to the world. That's a song we sing. I thought the angels sang glory to God. Peace, peace on earth. Is any of this real? Try, if you can, to be with Mary now in Joseph 2, undercover of dark. Again, it's the middle of the night. They sneak away, and they escape. Grateful, I suppose, that they did escape. They still have this life, this little one alive, but horrified His word begins to filter back to them about what's going on because others didn't escape. Indeed, most others, like this child, didn't escape alone with their thoughts in the middle of the night. I wonder if they thought about the words of the angel or the prophecy of Simeon. Because the angel said, blessed are you, Mary, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus, for he will be great. a light of revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel. Simeon called this little one the consolation of Israel. But today, in part because of his life and Herod's reaction to it, there are mothers in Israel who are experiencing no consolation. They are beyond consolation. And Rachel is weeping for her children, refusing consolation because they were no more. So Mary, did you know that when you said, I do, when you said yes to God, be it done unto me just as you said, I want it all. And Joseph, too, it was so clear to you. Joseph, when the angel said, it's okay, this is a little strange, Mary being pregnant without your involvement. But when the angel spoke, it was so clear. It was all so clear. When the lights are on, did you know there'd be days when the lights go out, when the dreams are dashed, when the promises of God don't seem to be true? Because now the party's over. The wedding dance is done. It's the day after Christmas now, and the day after Christmas is the day that the rest of your life begins. And you get called right back into a kind of Advent. You get called right back into this place of waiting. I don't know, and not knowing, and wondering what's really going on. And you get called right back into this place of needing to trust. Because you don't see it today. You saw it yesterday, but you can't see it today. So today you have to trust and obey and stay and believe and believe even when you don't see and then to choose once more again today to follow. Okay, yeah, well, okay, we did Bethlehem. So okay, we'll go to Egypt too. We'll do that journey too. Or maybe today decide, I'm done. I'm done. No more. I've done all that. I'm not going there. I'm not doing that. Mary and Joseph could have said, no, we're not, I'm not moving anymore. You know, we obeyed you so many times already. I'm kind of done. So see, on the wedding day, we say, I do. I will. At the wedding dance, we sing for joy. And well, we should, but it's the day after Christmas, the day after the dance is over that interests me most. It really does because sometimes it's not till the day after that you actually discover what Christmas costs, what this wedding feast costs. Because in the moment of the party, you don't care. I mean, I don't. When I'm in the middle of the party, I'll have another. Sure. Hmm. And in the preparation of the party, it doesn't matter. Yeah, the answer is always yes. Yes, let's get that. Oh, yeah, do that too. So what did Christmas cost you this year? Probably more than you thought. I mean, as you were in it, you were kind of thinking, oh, that's a little expensive. We'll do it anyway. Well, I got a deal on that. But you don't know until you later add it up. And whoa, a little more than you thought. Kind of always does. The truth is, it always has. Because there's always something more going on that you didn't know was going on that made the party actually possible. Fact is, my favorite Christmas story, My favorite Christmas text, some of you who know me know this, is not found in the four Gospels. The four Gospels, I love those stories that speak of shepherds and mangers and angels and such. My favorite speaks of, this is a Christmas story, speaks of a dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven diadems on seven heads. And nothing says Christmas to me like that, quite frankly. It's a fascinating picture, actually, and it's coming out of the Revelation. It's a fascinating picture of the behind-the-scenes activity that was happening and was necessary to happen in order for all this joy to the world, ultimately to come. John describes it like this in the Revelation. Because in the Revelation, what he saw was this, Revelation 12, verse 1. He saw a woman clothed with the sun and moon under her feet, and on her head was a crown of 12 stars, and she was with child, and she cried out, being in labor and in pain, to give birth, verse 5, and she gave birth to a son, to a male child, who is to rule and redeem and restore the nation. So that's good news. And all of that, by the way, is, as you know, apocalyptic language, the apocalyptic language of the Revelation. The male child born to the woman is obviously Christ. The woman giving birth is obviously Mary, but then another sign appears in the heavens. It says in verse 3 of Revelation 12, Behold, a great dragon appeared. That was the sign. It's obviously Satan, both in symbol and in reality, having seven heads, ten crowns. And on his head were seven diadems, and his tail swept away a third of the stars and threw them to the earth, which speaks of violence. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she did give birth, he might devour the child. And then she gave birth to a son, it says in verse 5. And when she did, the dragon did what it wanted to do. It pounced. And it pounced in the physical form, if you will, of Herod back in Matthew chapter 2. And when Herod pounced trying to get this child, all the babies in Bethlehem ended up getting slaughtered. I guess it was that tale that kind of swept all these one-third of the stars out of the sky. And a voice was heard weeping in Ramah, Rachel weeping for her children because they were no more. But the truth is, this dragon, though pouncing, missed the one it wanted to devour because the woman, along with Joseph in the middle of the night, said, yeah, we'll follow you there too. We'll obey again today. So they fled into the wilderness, Revelation 12, verse 6, where she had a place prepared for her by God. She went along with Joseph to Egypt. And so, since Revelation 12, verse 7, there was war in heaven. My earth's Christmas. It's just strange to me because on earth, as far as what we can see, it was silent night, holy night. All is calm. All is bright. Away in a manger. The cattle are lowing. The poor baby wakes, little Lord Jesus, no crying. He makes. But in heaven, something else was, ooh, a war. What was going on was a woman about to give birth to a child who would redeem and restore the nations and a dragon about to pounce to devour this life as soon as it was born. And when the child was born, he pounces in the form of Herod, but he misses because Mary Mary and Joseph followed and obeyed and believed even when they couldn't see. So in the middle of the night, they left for Egypt. And in this scene, there was no singing or dancing. No one was offering a toast to the cute young couple, Mary and Joseph. Because the dragon pounced, but it wouldn't be the last time that this dragon pounced. And it wouldn't be the last time that this dragon missed. Because at the cross, fast forward it now, this same dragon, if you will, Satan, pounced again. But this time, they thought they really had him. This time, he's dead and buried. We've got him now. And for three days, Satan had a party of his own. He had actually finally devoured this Christ. But God, says Peter in Acts chapter 2, verse 24, raised him up again, putting an end to the agony of his death, since it was impossible for him to be held by its power. And all of that is why we sing joy to the world. That's why we sing. The Lord has come. The bride said, yes, so sing and dance and laugh for joy. He did it for joy. for the joy set before him, Hebrews 12. He endured the cross, despising the shame. And then, next verse of Hebrews 12 says, he sat down at the right hand of the Father as if to say, let the party begin. Because I paid for this party, and it costs a lot. But I did it for joy. It's quite a story. With all of that swirling in your head, come back now with me to this wedding I was speaking of a week ago on Friday night because sitting in the front row of this wedding were the parents on both sides. I'm looking at a couple, but I'm looking down here at the parents and also the grandparents on both sides and was told earlier that these grandparents on this side, 68 years married, 58 years married on this side, plus the parents who'd been married 50, Whatever. So with all of that in mind, I talked to Katie and Reed about generations, and I talked to him about foundations and the roots of a tree that speak to things unseen, things that were going on before you existed, things not only unseen but even forgotten. It's not what you look at. It's not what you notice. when people go up north to look at the colors that erupt in the fall. They're not going up there looking at the roots. Look at those roots. They don't think about that. Those are unseen. But it's the roots that provided the possibility for those leaves to have their color, for those leaves to even be possible, for that tree to even be strong. So you need to know, you need to remember. I said to them that you two are rooted. to came from some place. And I didn't say this, but I didn't pay for this party. Some other people did, and they did it for joy. So sing and dance and laugh for joy. But after this party, you have some things to walk out yourself so there can be more joy. Sitting in the front row of this wedding were the parents, as I said, on this side, Katie's side, were my brother and his wife Susan and grandparents of Katie. And I know them. I obviously know my brother and Susan, but I know Susan's parents as well because Susan and Steve, like Bonnie, and I grew up in my dad's church. And so this wedding is kind of bringing back a lot of family things, but also church things. And Susan's parents, mom and dad, Harry and Grace Kaper. Harry was an elder in my dad's church. And at the wedding, Harry looked frail to me. Not only from age, but from the obvious effects of Parkinson's disease that left him unable to control his shaking hands. And in the moments, looking at him as this whole thing is transpiring, I remembered him. Because when I was a kid, growing up in church, Harry Caper, Susan's dad, Katie's grandpa, before Katie existed, was bigger than life to me. An elder in my dad's church, as I said, but he was more than that. He was probably the most trusted elder that my dad had. He spoke with wisdom and grace. He had what I would now call a sorry. I didn't call it then. He just had authority. And then I thought, in the moment of that wedding, that looking at him now as his hands are shaking and he looked shorter than he used to, you'd never know how strong he was. You'd never know how big, how wise, how steady and true. You'd never know how much he gave. You'd never know how much he served or built or cared, and you would never know how much it cost him to do any of that. You'd never know how much it cost him to build and to care and to stay and to serve. So at some level, he paid for this party, not with money, and he wasn't the only one. He kind of paid for this party. See, before you existed, look to Katie and read, before you existed, there were people who were building things. There were people who were sacrificing things. They were believing things. They were sticking with things. enduring things that they didn't want to stick with or endure, and they did it so today, this wedding day, we can sing and dance and laugh for joy, and sing and dance and laugh for joy, we did. But actually, it's the day after, the party that interests me most, because on that day comes the rest of your life, most of which won't feel like a party, won't feel like Christmas, A lot more like Advent, which is this place of waiting and wondering and needing to trust again today and obey again today and forgive and confess again today and believe again today when you can't see and then to choose again today whether you're going to follow like Mary and Joseph did in the middle of the night. The middle of the night means no one could see. There was no party going on. There was no singing and dancing. This is work you do behind the scenes. This is work that no one is proposing a toast to you for. But it's all that inglorious stuff. It's behind the scenes stuff. It's all that obedient stuff, believing stuff, sticking with it stuff. It's all that repentant and forgiveness stuff. And deciding again today to follow again today stuff. It's all that boring stuff that makes the party possible. Because it's all that stuff behind the scenes that builds the roots. So the tree can grow and the leaves. And all of that started here. And it started at that cross. Because he started it. It wasn't Grandpa Harry, and it wasn't me. He started this thing. And he showed us how. Because it was for joy. He did all that behind-the-scenes stuff. It was for joy. He endured the cross, despised the shame, and then sat down at the right hand of the Father, as if to say, let the party begin. Let's sing and dance and laugh for joy. because I paid for this party. But actually, it's the day after Christmas that interests me most because on that day comes the rest of your life, most of which won't feel like a party, a lot more like Advent, which calls you right back into waiting and wondering and needing to obey and trust and forgive and confess and believe when you don't see and decide once again today, Am I going to follow or not? Nothing glorious about it. One foot in front of the other. In the middle of the night, when no one sees, when no one's singing or dancing, when no one's proposing a toast. And I'm kind of just wondering, who's in? Who's in for that? Who would say yes to that? If you're in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I want to walk that out so that can be joy. Come join us at the table. Come join us at the cross. Because what's at the table in the cross speaks more to Jesus being our example. Because he did this. So he's our, no, no, no. He is our life. He gives us his life. We need his life. We need the bread to take this journey. We need his power to take his journey, this journey. So Holy Spirit, come be with us as we go to your table. Thank you.
