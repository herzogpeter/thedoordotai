that sometimes it's hard to see how great God is because our eyes grow dim and our ears grow dull. But when we see, when we see who he really is and when we hear who he really is, the human heart sings. So let's pray. The request, Father, this morning as we prepare ourselves for the table and the time together as a community of faith is that we would see and hear you. And acknowledging right off the bat that there are things that dim our vision, make it hard to see, sometimes certain realities of life, maybe choices we've made, maybe nothing we've done wrong at all, just hard to see today, hard to hear. So Holy Spirit, who we know and believe is here, we pray, Holy Spirit, that you would manifest your presence among us in ways subtle, in ways bold, who you are, how great you are. So in a variety of ways, our hearts could sing. I pray that in your name. Amen. You don't have to stay on the whole service alone. Is he going to make us stand here? For the last couple of weeks, as most of you know, we've been talking in some rather extensive and direct ways about giving. But in the process of that, we've actually been talking in the larger context about money. and the power that money has almost exclusively to reveal the human heart and to, in fact, change the human heart. Jesus said it this way, for where your treasure is, that's where your heart will be also. So where your treasure is reveals your heart, but it changes your heart as well because your heart will follow where you put your treasure. Making this discipline of giving that we've been talking about for the last couple of weeks, in my opinion, among the most effective of all the spiritual disciplines at bringing about not only effective change in the heart, change in the character, but also in bringing about an almost immediate and visceral reaction. Because every time you do it, that is, every time you give, it touches our stuff. And by stuff, I've made it clear, I don't just mean the physical stuff. I don't just mean the money itself, though, that is obviously involved. I'm talking about stuff of life. Because every time we give, it has the potential, at least, to touch our fear. If I give, will I have? And you have to press into that fear every time you give. It touches your trust. It touches our sense of security and contentment, what we think we have to have. And if we give something away, will we have what we think we have to have? Reveals what we love. It can change what we love. But today, as we kind of wrap this thing up, and as we prepare ourselves for coming around the Lord's table as a community of faith this morning, I want to change the tone a bit from the teachy kind of thing we've had for the last couple of weeks to something a bit more reflective. Because this whole thing on giving, beloved, begins someplace we dare not forget. Because if we do forget it, we will not only miss the point, but we will miss the heart. We will lose the heart of this thing. For this whole thing on giving finds its origin, beloved. It finds its roots, its very source, not in a sermon or a series of sermons or a principle or a law, but it finds its roots and source in God himself. Simple verse, most people know it, John 3, 16. For God so loved the world that he what? Gave. It's just what he does. This giving thing has its roots in that. See, the full magnitude of this issue and centrality of its importance in the context of the kingdom of God is most clearly and profoundly revealed, not in anything Jesus said. And for the last two weeks, I've been telling you that Jesus talked about giving more than he talked about anything other than the kingdom of God itself. But the full magnitude of this issue is revealed in what Jesus did, not in what he said. And what he did was this. He emptied himself. Philippians chapter two, of all the resources that belong to him as God, He emptied himself. In other words, he gave himself. He gave all the resources of heaven. Think about that. See, God, being God in all, had some resources as God. That was a bug. Sorry, you didn't all see it, and I'm acting weird. He had some resources, all the resources of heaven. And what he did with the resources, being God and all, was to give those resources, was to spend them for a purchase of sorts. And the monetary language here is intentional. To purchase something that he really, really wanted. That he felt was worth. Whatever it was he had to spend. Revelation 5 verse 9 reveals what it is that he purchased. what he thought was worth emptying heaven of its finest treasure for. He says it this way, that by emptying heaven of its finest treasure, God gave his son. By doing that, God was able to purchase for himself what he wanted most. Men and women, people from every tribe and tongue and people and nation. The price, his precious blood, the blood of his son, his son who gave everything he had to purchase for God everyone he could. And all of that is why this issue of giving, our giving, this issue of how we spend all the resources of our lives, including money, but now I'm expanding it beyond money, is absolutely central to the gospel that we preach, for it finds its source, its original pattern in God himself through Christ. Through Christ, who though he was rich, says Paul in 2 Corinthians 8, verse 9, yet for our sake he became poor. How did he become poor? It's metaphoric language, symbolic language. He became poor by giving everything he had. That we through his poverty, through his giving, might be made rich. Not so that we could just become rich, though he does lavish on us his life and riches, again beyond money. But not so that we could just become rich to hoard it and grasp it, but so that we could continue this cycle. He became poor so that we could become rich. And in his poverty, God highly exalted him. And in our becoming rich, he's calling us to give as well. And in our giving, he gives us more to give. And I'm not just talking about money, but money is included because that's been the focus. But it's the receiving and the giving of our time and our talents, our treasure as well. and in the giving of who we are, our time, our talent, our treasure, it is in the giving that we are becoming just like him because God so loved the world that he gave. It's what he does. All of this giving stuff finds its roots in this very place. Last week, last two weeks, we talked about the Macedonians who gave out of their poverty and we saw the nobility of that and they gave liberally out of poverty and the promise to the Macedonians was Macedonians and it wasn't just to them, it's to anybody who gives like that, give and it will be given to you. You give, even out of your poverty, I'll give you more to give. And I applied it to money. I just want to expand your mind. It applies more than money. It applies your time. It applies your talents. Easter Sunday, I was on my way to church. I didn't have a lot of time. I mean, I was a little preoccupied. It was a big day. And there's a friend of mine who lives on the way to church. And he's been sick and he wasn't going to be able to come to church. And I didn't have the time. And I wanted to see him. And I knew he wasn't going to be able to come and he wanted to come. And I drove by his house. And I was almost here. And I turned around and went back. I just had a couple minutes. And out of a poverty of time. None of us have time, do we? I just went and prayed for this person. And he prayed for me. And out of poverty. And guess what? It's weird. It's weird. It's weird how this works. Give and it will be given. Give some time. When you don't have time, give some time. Some of you need boundaries, and it's a whole other sermon. Okay, but I'm just dialing into this. I was even thinking about, this is a little weird, but actually I was thinking about 25 years of ministry. There's times of, I don't know if you can dial into this, but sometimes I feel pressure to come up with a sermon. I know you can't imagine that. But there's this thing of like every week and every week. And then on one Sunday, I'll just give everything I had. And I'll go, God, I should have saved something. And I feel like God has constantly been saying, give and I'll give you more to give. This is how it works in the kingdom of heaven. And it applies to money too. You know, we've been talking the last couple of weeks about mammon. How Jesus in Matthew 6 said, you cannot serve God and mammon, identifying mammon, therefore, as more than just money. Mammon is indeed a rival God, a spirit, an entity, a ruler, a spiritual force, we believe, in the heavenlies. And it's a spiritual force behind money whose job it is to get us to believe that in money there is life, giving it, therefore, God-like qualities. Getting us to believe does mammon that in money there is security and joy and peace. Because if we believe that, it's all about what we believe, what we have faith in. If we believe that in money there is security and life and joy, you will pursue it and grasp it and need it. More than anything, ultimately becoming a slave to it. Some of you may remember some years ago when I taught on mammon, I didn't bring it in this time, I am now, but the writing of Milton in his classic work Paradise Lost took this concept of mammon as a spirit and fictionalized it, saying this, that even before the fall, mammon existed as a spiritual being, much like an angel. But even before the fall, he was thought to be the least upright of all the spirits. For even when mammon was in the presence of God, before the demonic hordes followed Satan into his rebellion, against God, even then, the angel Memonas studied the gold of the streets more than the glory of God. That's a fascinating phrase to me, and it speaks to his posture. Even in heaven, imagine an angel, the glory of God, but even in heaven, he didn't look at the glory, he looked at the gold in the streets. And that's the posture. The posture is looking down. And in the posture, there's something communicated to you and to me, and we can choose to believe it or not. And the message is this, it's here, it's down here. This is where life is. Look, no, no, don't look up to, look down here. And under the influence of mammon, that's what we do. And we don't have to be bad people. You just get kind of caught up in that. And before you know it, you're looking down and your source of security is here and your home is here and everything you need is here. And you're looking down. And I contrast that posture that Milton was able to capture in Paradise Lost of him looking down and are doing the same with a different posture. And that is not bent over, but standing up straight. Standing up straight into God with hands and arms lifted up and hands open. You know why I think the open-handedness is significant in terms of the symbolic language here? Because open hands can do two things. They can receive. You need to receive. If you're not receiving, you don't have anything to give. but open hands receive and they give. They do both. Which brings us to the table. With three things, four things actually, to do. Four things to do. We're gonna enlist you to do some things. All of which I think will help us change our posture. The four things all start with an R which any pastor will tell you if you have an outline and all the words start with like the same letter or they rhyme that's when you know it's really from God so hear the word of the Lord here you know what they are they're simple words and actually I think it will help you kind of remember, redirect remember, receive and release redirect what? your vision what you're looking at. See, it occurs to me that if we become fixated on the gold, maybe even not wanting to, not even knowing we did, but we've kind of bent over to what mammon compels us to look at for our life and security. If you've been fixated on the gold, you need something brighter than the gold to break the trance. And brighter than the gold, the only thing I know that's brighter than the gold is the glory of God. And I can't conjure that up. You need to change your vision, and we create some space here. We create some quietness. We even dim the lights a little so that the glory of God can be seen. And we'll enter into worship for that very purpose. When we go into worship, do something. And nobody will know if you do or not. This is just for you. As we enter into worship, in just a few moments, redirect your vision. Ask God to help you look up and see something brighter than the gold. We've grown used to physically moving around here at Open Door, particularly on communion services where you get up and come to the communion stations. And we'll do that again. I'm just thrilled with how free you are to move sometimes to the cross as well. And so we'll invite you to move to the cross if you feel just some prompting or desire to go to the cross. And month after month as I see you do that, I see many of you kneel there and doing something with God, I'm sure. But you know what occurs to me? You couldn't possibly kneel at that cross and look at it without looking up, without redirecting your gaze. It'll help you. It'll help you. Second thing to do this morning is remember. Remember what? Well, that's easy. 2 Corinthians 8 and 9. Remember the grace. Because some of you forgot. Some of you forgot this week. Some of you who know all about grace and have tasted grace and received grace, we forget. You need to remember. It's something you need to do today. Remember the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, who although he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor, so that we through his poverty might be made rich. It's amazing to me how simply remembering the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ reminds us, reminds me that my life is not here. But here, standing up straight into God with arms raised and hands open. Which leads to the third thing I want you to do. Receive. Receive. You know, if you don't, again, it's part of, maybe it's even a different way of saying we forget the grace. But as you come to the table today, expect to receive something from the Lord. So some of you are coming, you know, the Macedonians gave out of poverty to give physically of their monetary. Some of you are in a kind of poverty of spirit right now and you really need a drink. Open your hands and receive the bread and receive the cup. Remember and receive the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. And again, you know, these words, Holy Spirit, come, Holy Spirit, come. Water flow, wine flow so we can receive. Fourth is release. Release what? Well, whatever it is you're grasping, let it go. Release whatever it is you're grasping and give. Back to the money thing here. I think you know we're dialing into things beyond money, but this is kind of wrapping up some things we've been saying about money over the last couple of weeks. We really debated at the message team this week about how to do this, even whether to do this, until we decided, yes, we should, in fact, do this. This being gathering our tithes and offerings this morning in a different way. To do it in the context of our communion and our coming to the cross. And that's what these baskets are for here. This is where the offering will be taken this morning. We had some concerns about doing it this way. One was simply this, that in any way this would feel manipulative or showy or awkward. And it might feel awkward to put your offering there rather than have the plate go by. I suppose maybe when we first started doing communion different, we used to pass the tray and then we asked you to come and maybe the first few times you did it, it felt awkward. So this might feel awkward. This is not a special offering. This is just our gathering of tithes and offerings. I'm not wanting this to be some big emotional draw. Like, I wasn't, no, I really want, in fact, last week, I kind of even warned about emotional kinds of giving. that there are times clearly the Spirit would prompt you to give, and it's not that you won't feel some emotion, but one of the things we've been calling our body to is to develop a kind of life around this giving thing. And our other concern was even how we would do this. Like, what are we going to do with people in the balcony? And we kind of, I don't know, that's going to be weird. If you're in the balcony, it's a long way to come. So one of the ways we solved that was that as you leave, if you don't want to come all the way down, there will be ushers at the doors as we leave. Another one was that there are some who regularly give but aren't prepared to give today, and so you're in this awkward place of kind of feeling unfairly left out because you are someone who participates in a regular basis. All of that said, however, we still felt like it was worth it for a couple of reasons. One, I think it's important to make a connection. Sometimes just moving with our bodies, you know it's true. You move to the cross. You don't know why. Something happens when you move. To make a connection between what we've been given and giving. To make a connection between what we've been given, we experience that at the table, and giving, We experienced that with the offering. Another reason we decided we're going to go with this, awkward as it might feel for some, it's this, my belief and hope that some of you, in response to what we've been talking about for the last couple of weeks, are seeing your giving in a new light. Some may be doing this offering this week for the very first time, even, in a way that's designed to be part of your life and not just some impulsive thing and not just what's ever left at the end for God, but there's really come some intentionality. Paul says, as you've purposed in your heart, some of you this week have purposed in your heart to do this different. And if you have, that would make this week kind of significant. And we're giving you a way to mark that. So as worship begins, redirect your vision. Look up as we begin to worship. And if you're having trouble, ask God to help you. Help me see what I can't see, hear what I can't hear. And as we go to the table, remember. And if you're having a hard time remembering, ask God to help you remember the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ who gave everything he had. And if you need something, as you go to the table, ask God to give you what you need to receive. And in your remembering and in your receiving, release. And in your releasing, remember that freely you have received. So freely give. Not grudgingly, nor of necessity, but joyfully and worshipfully. These baskets make our giving today even more connected in ways that we can feel, even in our bodies, to our worship. It's an act of worship. So I'm going to ask the communion stewards to come, and for Al to come and bring us to the table, and the worship team to come and take their place as we enter into our worship and time around the table. on the night in which our Lord Jesus was betrayed he took bread and having broke it he gave it and as he gave it he said this is my body broken for you do this in remembrance of me and in the same way after the bread he took the cup and he gave it and he said this is my blood shed for you do this in remembrance of me and beloved as we come to the table this morning may we never forget that his generosity is our only hope. And his generosity is real and present. So come and receive. Let us pray. God, we are a grateful people and we thank you so much for what this table means. that you did not keep and save and hoard. You poured it out. You gave it all away. You saw something in us that we often don't even see in ourselves, and you gave. God, thank you for your body, broken for us, and your blood shed for us. And we pray your blessing on this time and on these elements. Thank you, Jesus, for not turning back. but for giving it all away for us. Amen. I just want to give you guys some brief instructions on how we do communion here if you're new to this experience together. The communion stewards are being served right now but when they're done, they're going to move to a station and there will be stations all throughout the room. So I will invite you guys to stand in a few minutes and we will worship and sing and you are free to move to one of the stations whenever you're ready. And you are also free to come to the cross or to come to the offering baskets at the front. If you have a child with you who is not yet ready to take communion or doesn't quite understand, just let the steward know and they can pray a prayer over your child instead. Amen. I want you to invite you guys to stand. as we sing and worship and take communion together. Lord, I will bow to you to no other God but you alone. Lord, I will bow to you Nothing yet is ever made but you I will lay down my idols And thrones I have made And all that has taken my heart Lord, I will bow to you To no other God but you Lord, I will bow to you To no other God But you know Lord, I will bow to you Nothing hands up me when you lay And I've laid down my idols And loads I have made And all that has taken my heart I will not give to no other God than you Thank you. I've laid down my idols And bones are made And all that is taken my life Lord, I will bow to you To no other God for you With grateful hearts we remember and release to you all that is yours. For you have created all things and with love formed us in your image. When our love failed, your love proved steadfast in the giving of your only Son, Jesus Christ, to be our Savior. All that we are and all that we have is a gift from you. And so in gratitude for all the gifts you have freely given us, we offer you ourselves and all that we have. you
