As most of you know who frequent Open Door, you know that on the first weekend of the month, we can shift the order of things and bring the ministry of the Word earlier in the service as a way to prepare ourselves for our coming to the table. But before I bring the Word this morning, I have another word about something quite significant in the life of our body and the ongoing ministry of our church. has to do with our financial needs and that we need to catch up with a significant influx of year-end giving. Just to kind of give some context to this, this issue of year-end giving is something that we face every year. I can't remember a year that in the 24 years I've been here we haven't had to talk about at the end of the year we need a significant influx and this year is no different than that. But I had to laugh a little bit when I was watching that video of the stewardship thing and the picture in particular of the car lots and kind of symbols of excessive spending and all this kind of stuff. I had to laugh that we're showing that video right in the middle of the Christmas season when most of us are most out of control. It's like, yeah, thanks a lot. This is really nice. And also an announcement like this as well. But the truth is, it really is part of our life in the kingdom of God. And it even is part of Advent, I think. And we're going to talk about Advent this morning. But in terms of preparing ourselves for the centrality of the kingdom of God and the coming of the king, two at a time when we can get a little crazy, to be reminded to bring our lives back into alignment in the kingdom of God. And so I just bring this need to you. The bulletin tells you it's a $388,000 shortfall. Okay, so catch your breath, catch your breath, and then realize this is a God thing. And to participate in this as the Lord would give you direction, As the Lord would help you to free up your hands and free up your heart to really, really know that small gifts matter a lot and big gifts do too, but how you are aligned to the kingdom of God is what matters. It really is part of our life as a community of faith. And I just give that to you by way of our preparation. We call it Advent this season. Literally, it means arrival. The Advent season is a four-week period of time just prior to Christmas. that Christians for centuries have used to remember, to contemplate, to prepare themselves for the realities of Christmas. The realities of Christmas that, quite frankly, are easily lost in what turns out for many of us to be the chaos of Christmas. I don't have to be in all of your houses to know that there have been conversations about this already. I've had them with my wife where Christmas is already here. But the reality of Christmas, peace and joy, where is that? It just gets chaotic. Advent is about slowing down. Advent is about understanding arrival and the need to wait and prepare ourselves for the coming of the king. Now, the Advent season actually began last week, and we acknowledge it here at Open Door with a brief word, the lighting of the Advent candle, the presence of this manger here. But this week, as we come to the table, and then actually for the rest of this month, right through Christmas in a more focused and intentional way. We want to be bringing some things that will help us remember, will help us contemplate and prepare ourselves for the realities of Christmas, for the coming of the King. We call it Advent, the arrival. And although it was anticipated and waited on for centuries, the historic account of the arrival, its very beginnings, is recorded for us in the Gospel of Luke. The first chapter, the 26th verse, verse 26 says this. It all began in the sixth month. The angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph of the descendants of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And coming in, the angel said, Hail, favored one, the Lord is with you. Hail, Mary. literally means rejoice, Mary. I have good news for you, Mary. Get your joy up, Mary, for you are highly favored. The word favored there is significant. It's also found in verse 30, and all it actually means is grace or graced. You have been highly graced. Why? For grace is coming to you, Mary, in a package that you didn't anticipate, in a way you couldn't have foreseen. Grace is coming to you. Indeed, grace, the embodiment of grace, is going to be placed inside of you. You've heard the phrase, Hail Mary, full of grace. Well, that's Luke chapter 1, verse 28. Later in the same chapter, 42nd verse, Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, says this to Mary, Mary, blessed are you among women. Why? Because grace has come to you. Grace, the embodiment of grace, is going to be planted inside of you. And then she says, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Put those verses together. It sounds like this Hail Mary full of grace. The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women. And blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Now Catholics recognize those words as being part of the rosary. Evangelicals recognize those words as being part of Catholicism. not in the Bible not knowing there are true source and there are true source of those words are Luke chapter 1 verse 29 Luke chapter 1 verse 41 and 42 I recognize those words as being part of what I call the merry miracle the merry miracle is among my favorite Christmas stories actually not only because the story of the merry miracle captures the essence of Christmas, but it actually embodies the essence of the gospel and our need to respond to the coming of the King in the very way that Mary responded to the potential of the life of God coming inside of her. So this Advent season, as we prepare ourselves for the arrival, if you will, I'd like to remind you of the merry miracle. And the merry miracle is this, that the Son of God, Mary, by a work of the Holy Spirit, is going to come alive in you. In verse 35 of chapter 1, it says this, Mary, the Holy Spirit of God will come upon you, and the power of the Almighty will overshadow you. And verse 31 says this, and the result of this is this, that you will conceive, and behold, you will conceive. Second part of the merry miracle is this, Mary, that the Son of God alive in you is going to grow in you. Verse 31 again says this, and you will come alive in you. You will bear a son. It will be conceived in you by the power of the Holy Spirit. But as this thing grows in you, you're going to have to bear this life. You're going to have to carry, as it were, this life. Third part of the Mary miracle is this, that the Son of God alive in you, growing in you, Mary is one day going to come from you, express itself through you. Same verse says this, and you shall give birth to a son and you shall call his name Jesus. That life is going to come from you. Fourth part of the Mary miracle is this, that this life conceived in you by the Holy Spirit that was growing in you, that is now coming from you, is going to change the world around you. How is that going to happen? Here's how. He will be great. This life conceived in you that was growing in you that is now coming from you is great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever and ever. And of his kingdom there is no end. But the real glory of the merry miracle, the real exciting part of the merry miracle, is that the miracle that came to her can come to you and come to me as well, not in a physical sense, but in a spiritual sense. Indeed, this is the part of the merry miracle that is central, as I said a moment ago, to the gospel that we preach. For Mary, I believe it can be argued, is what is called a prototype. A prototype is the first of a kind. A prototype is not unique. It is the first of many to come. Meaning this, that Mary is the first person in whom the life of Christ was ever conceived. Mary was the first person that Jesus Christ, the Son of God ever came alive inside of, but she is not the last. She is not the only. She is not unique in this way. She is not the only person to whom this miracle has happened. For since Christ, the Son of God, by the power of the Holy Spirit, came alive inside of Mary, he has come alive by the power of that same Spirit in many of you as well. so rejoice favored ones get your joy up I've got some good news for you for the grace of God has come to you it has been birthed in you the son of God has come to be conceived in you to grow in you to come from you and as the life of Christ growing in you starts emanating from you it has the power to change the world around you that's the merry miracle that's the gospel that we preach it's something that all of us can participate in if we say these simple words, be it done unto me, I will receive this life. Mary did rejoice at the thought of this when she finally did understand it. In verse 46, she said, my soul does magnify the Lord as all of this began to dawn on her and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, which is what many of us do when we come to worship and we reflect on the life of God in us, growing in us, coming from us. Our soul magnifies the Lord. But that was not her first response to magnify the Lord. Indeed, her first response to the possibility of the life of God being born in her, growing in her, and coming from her was to be afraid. In fact, that fear might be a primary indicator that you actually do understand what you're saying yes to when you say yes to God. Verse 29 is where we kind of pick up Mary's fear. She says this after the angel made this pronouncement of the life coming to her and being born in her and the potential of the Holy Spirit coming upon her. Verse 29 says she was greatly troubled. Why? We can speculate about a few things. One, I think the angel might have had something to do with it. Seeing an angel in the flesh would be a little troubling, and that might have been it. But after she got over that, if that even was the problem, we know from verse 29 what the problem was, because she said what the problem was. Verse 29, she was troubled at his statement. She was troubled by what the angel said and kept pondering what he said, what it might mean. And I think implied in that quite clearly is not only what it might mean, but what it might cost me to say, Yes, I will receive this life. And part of what it might cost, I think, is revealed in the physical reality of the pregnancy that Mary was going to experience itself. And the metaphor that it speaks to is powerful. But what it might cost is seen in the pregnancy. And this is a place where women in the room, especially those who have had children, can really enter into at a very visceral level. Men need very much to enter into this as best we can, but it is powerful in its symbolism. Because part of what the cost is to this is understood when you understand that for me to say yes, or for Mary to say yes to God, I will allow you to plant this life inside of me. Once I say yes to that, things will be set in motion that cannot be stopped. If I say yes to God, that the life of God will come in me and begin to grow in me, things will begin to change in me. And things that change in me, some of them will begin to frighten me, and some of them will stretch me. The imagery of pregnancy here, again, is graphic. And some of them will mark me and scar me. And some of them will thrill me. prospect of giving life is a thrilling thought i remember when my my wife and i were anticipating our first child when when the day that she came home with tears in her eyes and full of joy there was nothing but joy there was just nothing but joy that life has been planted in me and life is going to grow in me and life is going to come from me we celebrated that day and then some days later we were at a hospital saint mary's hospital we were just very young at the time saint mary's hospital and we had just watched a video on what it looks like to have a baby. She's 24 years old. She's 25 years old. We walked outside. I had my, I can't do this. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. It could be worse, honey. It could be me. Okay, that was very helpful. You know, I'm here to serve as a bad example. Don't do it. You know, anyway. Can you feel the fear? Can you feel the exhilaration? The joy? The thrill? Can you feel the stretching? It's an incredible picture of, I think, all of the deep workings of God in our life. There is an incredible price, I believe, for bearing the miracles of God. When God does something miraculous in your life, brings you to a deeper place, or through you does a powerful thing, you just know that that life that was conceived in you and grew in you and came from you, you just know that you know. It was a miracle. God did that, but you had to bear that. You had to carry that. You had to allow it and not abort it than you could have any time. All of which raises the question that Mary needed to answer, and we need to answer it as well in a variety of ways, and sometimes every day in a variety of ways. Do you really want this life? Because on one hand, you'd think the reflexive answer would be, well, of course, who wouldn't? No, wait, wait. You need to understand, before you just say yes, you need to understand that while there will indeed be life, this life of God will cost you, and it will change you, and it will stretch you, and it will mark you and call you and fatigue you and frighten you. So do you want it? At the beginning, Mary wasn't sure she wanted it. She pondered these things and wondered what they meant. I think this is significant to note. See, the question that was being asked of Mary was not, Mary, do you want to go to heaven when you die? See, she would have been sure about that. Yes. Where do I sign? That wasn't the question. It wasn't the question the angel was asking Mary, and that is not the question God is asking you. Well, who doesn't? No, I want to go to hell. Sign me up for hell. It's not the question. The question is, would you be interested in receiving into your spirit the very life of God, knowing that if you say yes to this, it will grow in you, and it will change you, and it will stretch you, and it will scare you. And oh, by the way, once it starts to grow in you, and once it starts to stretch you, it's not going to stop ever. One of the reasons we honor Mary and bless her and call her favorite is because eventually the way she answered the question was the way many of you have answered the question. Maybe with fear and trembling. And I think if you did it with fear and trembling, It meant you understood what you were saying yes to. Here's what she said. Be it done unto me, just as you said. Holy Spirit of God, come into me. Plant your life in me. Grow in me. Stretch me. If you mark me, you mark me. I will bear, I will carry this life. I can't produce this life, but I will carry it and bear it. Be it done unto me, just as. So here's my question. What's your answer to that question? Do you want this life? what's our answer as a church by the way just so you don't get this question fixated on like one moment in time where you decide whether you want to be a Christian or not I think that would need to be answered at that moment but you can ask this question by the spirit of God in your journey of faith over and over again for God comes to us over and over beloved you know this with offers of life of deeper life of more life and basically the question isn't much more complicated than do you want it? now you can't produce it but will you bear it? will you carry it? I even think of the fact as a church after the first of the year we're wrapping up our journey of the heart with the life of David we're going to begin another journey as a church around our understanding of the Holy Spirit we're going to be talking about the filling of the Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit and the baptism of the Spirit and the fruit of the Spirit. And over and over again, in a variety of ways, we're going to be asked by the Spirit this question. You want this? Do you want this? Mary's answer, be it done unto me. I want it. Can't produce it myself. By the way, before Mary did say yes to this, there was one more question she had, one more concern that needed to get settled down for her. And the concern is expressed by her in verse 34 of Luke 1 when she said, I don't understand how this life can come inside of me, grow in me, and come from me. How can this be since I am a virgin? Now, don't get lost in what that literally means because basically in metaphor, in terms of its application to us, what she's really saying is this. I'm not qualified to receive this life and have it grow in me and come from me and change the world around me. You got the wrong person. I have not done the kinds of things you need to do to be the kind of person in whom God could come and live and grow and express his very character and nature and power. I'm not that kind of person. I'm not qualified. I mean, I didn't go to seminary. I'm not very spiritual. I am just kind of regular. The answer came to Mary, and the answer was basically this. Mary, you don't understand this miracle. I'm talking to you about this life I'm offering to you. You can't achieve this miracle. You can't achieve it. You can't produce it. The only thing you can do is receive it. Now, now, you will have to bear it. You will have to carry it, and it will stretch you and scare you. But I will achieve it, says the Lord. In fact, it says that very thing in verse 35 specifically when it says, here's how it will happen if you say yes to this, Mary. The Holy Spirit, here's the deal. The Holy Spirit will come upon you. And the power of the highest will overshadow you. So that the Holy One of God will be born in you. So that the ways of God can be known by you for the rest of your life. For the rest of your life. Changing you and stretching you and marking you and calling you. And sometimes fatiguing you and sometimes frightening you. But as the life begins to flow from you. thrilling you, changing the world around you. And Mary said, be it done unto me, just as you said. I can't think of a better way to prepare ourselves for the arrival of the king. Now here's the tie of Mary's story, the connecting point of Mary's response to God and this table, because what occurs to me is this. that the response that Mary had to God relative to the life he was offering her was the same response that Jesus had to God the Father when he was anticipating the cross. Basically what Jesus said was, be it done unto me just as you said. Not my will, but thine be done. And the divine pattern that we really need to understand about the gospel and life in the kingdom of God is that life, supernatural life, almost always comes through some kind of suffering, some kind of willingness to bear. I will carry this life. I will allow this life to come to me and grow in me and change me and sometimes scare me and then come out of me, actually, in quite a painful way in order to get this life, in order to see this life. And Jesus said the same when he anticipated the cross. He didn't like the cross. He didn't want, but thy will be done. Thy will be done. And from that willingness to bear it came life. This morning, as we come to the table, we always come to the table as receivers, grateful for what he did. Here in the story of Advent, however, just another twist, that the table and the manger would also be inviting us into the same kind of life that would say, God, as you call me deeper, you are always asking me this question over and over again, do you really want this life? Do you, and some of you, do you still want this life? Or do you want to abort it? Maybe our spirits this morning, as we prepare for the coming of the king, would be to come in humility and say, I don't even know all that it's going to cost, but here's my heart. I want it to be what Mary says, be it done unto me. Just as you said. As we go to the table, let's further prepare our hearts by joining together in this responsive reading and Jan will lead us in that. Jan. Join me in prayer. Into our world as into Mary's womb. Into the forgotten places as into the stable. into the lives of the poor bringing hope into the lives of the powerful bringing caution into the lives of the weary bringing rest into the lives of the content bringing restlessness into our lives and longings whatever our estate this is the good news Christ is coming and blessed are those who wait on the Lord. Amen. Amen. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. And so we prepare our hearts this morning to come to the table, to say yes, to participate in the life that Jesus has offered us, To say yes, to join our yes with Mary's yes, with Jesus' yes. To say yes to whatever may come, whether it be suffering, joy, fruitfulness, even barrenness. To say yes, that God's life may be seen in us, may be experienced through us. This is the promise of Advent, of Christmas, and of this table. And so let us remember. And let us receive and let us participate. On the night in which our Lord Jesus was betrayed, he took bread and he gave thanks. And he said, this is my body. It's given for you. Take and eat of this. digest of this life and remember me. In like manner, after supper, he took the cup, and again he gave thanks, and he said to his disciples who were gathered all around him, this is the covenant. This is the new covenant in my blood. It's going to be shed for you, for the forgiveness of sins. Take and drink of this and remember me. as the communion stewards come forward. Please join me in prayer. Lord God, we ask for a gift. We ask for a gift in this moment. That you would give to us courage to say yes to you. To say yes to participate more fully in your kingdom, in your coming here on earth, in our lives. In the everydayness of them. In the places of great calling where you are calling us. God, we ask for a gift this day as we come to your table. Give us courage. Give us peace. In Jesus' name. if you
