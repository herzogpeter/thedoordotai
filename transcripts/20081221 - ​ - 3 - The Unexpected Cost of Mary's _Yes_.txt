May it be to me, just as you said, said Mary, to what Steve Weems has been calling the last couple of weeks, this unexpected invitation, that like most invitations from God, cannot be handled, managed, or controlled, they can only be received. And because Mary did receive it, be it done unto me, the life of God, because of that, was in fact conceived in her and then began to grow in her like anything you are pregnant with. It begins to grow in her, thus stretching her and marking her, sometimes frightening her, often in unexpected ways, which has been the theme these last couple of weeks. As we've entered into Advent, I love how Steve has been saying it when two weeks ago he introduced it, saying that whenever we say yes to God, in big ways or in small ways, it's not so much a matter of can I handle this? Because most of the things God actually does call us to and invite us into are things that in fact we cannot handle, manage, or control. Thus changing the question from can I handle this to will I receive this? Will I allow myself to go through this? And am I willing to pay the price for this life being born in me and stretching me and scaring me? Because this work of God in you could cost you. in unexpected ways. So Mary, did you know what it would cost when you said yes to this angel's invitation to receive the life of God, this work of God in you? And did that yes, Mary, cost you more than you thought it would when you first said yes? Indeed, if you knew then, Mary, what you know now about the cost of this yes to God, would you still say yes to God? See, keep in mind that when Mary first did in fact say yes to God, to this angel's invitation to receive the life of God in her, she couldn't possibly have known what it would fully cost her, where it might eventually bring her any more than you or I knew or know what it might cost when we say yes to God. Particularly the first time. Do any of you remember the first time you ever said yes to God? Maybe you do, maybe you don't. But some of you were little kids. And your very first yes to God came like a child's song. Come into my heart. Lord Jesus there is room in here for you I receive your life I will follow your way but you had no idea what that yes might cost you where that yes might bring you and all the subsequent yeses that would be called for all the other offers for life to be born in you in deeper ways and in fuller ways that would follow that first yes, which may be why, as Steve said last week, we so often say no to these unexpected invitations. Because instinctively, we kind of know they might bring me someplace. I don't know. I want to go. They might cost me more than I'm willing to pay. So Mary, did you know? That your yes to God would begin for you a journey that one day would actually bring you to, among other places, a cross. Where you would watch that promise die. See, I wonder what Mary thought that day. What she felt that day. And I wonder if she remembered that day what the angel had said several days previous. Indeed, years previous in Luke 1. 32 as she stood at the foot of the cross. I wonder if she remembered these words that he, the one who's on the cross right now, will be great. The son of the most high ruler of the nations, a kingdom without end. Some kingdom this. And yes, I know the resurrection is coming and when it does, every fear is vanquished and every promise is fulfilled. But Mary, did you know that when you said yes to God, there would be days like this one when the lights go out and the dreams are dashed and the promises of God don't seem to be true at all. So did you know, Mary, what this could cost? And was it more than you had expected? Well, actually, we have some indications from Scripture that Mary did in fact know that her yes would cost, but probably not how much it would cost because many of the things that were spoken to Mary about the cost of saying yes to God relative to this life being born in her came to her in veiled ways. Example of that would be one among many would be Luke chapter 2, somewhat obscure prophecy delivered by a man named Simeon to Mary and Joseph on the occasion of their bringing Jesus just after he was born into Jerusalem for his dedication to God in the temple of God. Picture them coming into Jerusalem, into the temple, excited by the birth of this promise, the fulfillment of a dream, but concerned and confused as well as to what all this might mean and what all this might cost. The prophecy was this. Luke chapter 2, beginning in verse 25. Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel. The consolation of Israel would have been Messiah, looking for that, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple. It's a good way to go to the temple. In the Spirit he was. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus to carry out for him the custom of the law, he then took him, that is Jesus, into his arms and blessed God, saying, Now, Lord, thou dost let me, thy bondservant, depart in peace according to your word. In other words, I can die now, for my eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light of revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel. So get your hopes up, Mary. Hearing these words from Simeon relative to the child, get your hopes up because if God through this child really is all that, your life is about to get a little easier, a little better, a little smoother. But then Simeon turns his attention from this baby to these parents. Mary and Joseph, two young kids. Young kids is all they were. Sincere in belief and eager to obey like kids that age often are who've given their hearts to God. Sincere in belief, eager to obey, but alone and afraid. He blesses them. Verse 34, just look at that. He blesses them. Then turns specifically to Mary with these words in verse 34, Behold this child. Just stop right there. Keep it on the screen and kind of look at those. Behold this child. Who in addition to being the consolation of Israel, which Simeon spoke of in verse 25, and a light of revelation to the Gentiles, which he spoke of in verse 32, will also be the cause for the fall and rise of many, a sign to be imposed indeed because of him, and now he's speaking directly to Mary, a sword will pierce even your own soul, Mary. Now, other things about this child were spoken after that, and they were wonderful things, encouraging things to both Mary and Joseph about who he was, that is, who Jesus was. But what did Simeon mean by the piercing of a sword? and why does it feel like the cost of this just went up see I thought all the hard stuff was done when I said yes that first time to the angel and to the spirit to receive this life to receive Christ I thought that he was the consolation and the salvation and the revelation I thought he'd fix my life and make it smooth Turns out these yeses to God Almost always cost more Than we thought they would With all of that stuff in mind This kind of foundation I've laid for thinking I want us to enter into four events in the life of Mary All of which speak I believe To this piercing of swords That speak to the costs that she was willing to pay. But I think there's something universal in every one of them that we can relate to. I certainly can. I think you will too. First scene came not long after Simeon's prophecy when the angel of the Lord appeared to Mary and Joseph in Matthew 2, verse 13. This is early in the story to warn them, don't go back to Bethlehem, but go south toward Egypt. Herod has gone crazy. Power hungry and paranoid when he heard word about a king born to the Jews. Herod considered it a threat. His solution was the slaughter of every baby boy anywhere near Bethlehem under the age of two. And according to Matthew 2 verse 18, the weeping and anguish in Bethlehem because of the slaughter of the innocents. Little boys under the age of two. The weeping and anguish was beyond consolation, says the text. be with Mary now. Grateful they escaped with their little baby boy, but horrified and despairing for those who didn't escape, maybe some even friends of hers. Alone with her thoughts, she begins to wonder and remember the words of the angel and the prophecy of Simeon. The angel said, Blessed are you, Mary, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. And Simeon said, this child would be the consolation and the comfort of Israel. Instead, because of him, there are mothers in Israel who are beyond consolation, and a sword begins to pierce her soul. This is the sword of confusion. It's something most of us feel if we've walked with God for some time. It's not something we feel at the beginning. It's not something Mary felt at the beginning. When the angel first came to Mary, it's like someone who just receives Jesus for the very first time and says, if you will receive this life, it will come to you and be born in you. And she sings the Magnificat. Blessed be the name of the Lord. My soul does magnify the Lord. It's kind of like the newborn Christian, just full of God and full of hope. These doubts and these confusing things come later. See, here's the confusing part. If I really do hold in my hands the answer, the solution, why am I so confused? And why do I still feel helpless at times? I thought when I said yes to God, my questions would all be answered, my promises, my problems would all be solved. And what about the hate? I mean, I know Herod's crazy, so I can kind of put him in a category, but Mary, did you know when you said yes to God, be it done unto me, that some around you would resent this life in you, not understand it at all, be threatened by it, and even try to kill it. No, she didn't. She didn't know that any more than some of you in this room right now knew that when the life of God came to you and began to grow in you and express itself through you, that some people around you, even family and sometimes friends, would resent it, Not understand it. Be threatened by it and even try to kill it. And suddenly, your yes to God costs you more than you expected. And a sword pierces your soul. Second event, 12 years later. Luke chapter 2, verse 41. Joseph and Mary had taken Jesus to Jerusalem. It was the Passover. You know the story. They were traveling with family and they were all about 12 years old and with this many people, the kids were all playing together and so the assumption was we're all together and everyone was together and they were leaving Jerusalem and it turns out a full day and a half transpired of travel before Mary and Joseph recognized Jesus wasn't with them and wasn't with them. Where is Jesus? We lost, have you ever lost a kid? I mean, even for a little while in a department store, you just go crazy and you feel really bad. Like, what kind of parents am I? Well, they lost Jesus. That's really big. Terrified. They run back, find him finally in the temple, dealing with the rabbis, asking questions, dealing with the word of God, and his response to their concern, they're terrified. In verse 49, it was a little odd to say the least. He says this, why are you looking for me? You'd want to smack him. But he's Jesus, so you can't. And then he says these words, did you not know that I am now to be about my father's business? And a sword pierces her soul. Why? Here's why. Because their relationship is changing now. Because the issue of who Jesus really is is beginning to evidence itself more dramatically. Now the fullness of what Jesus is really all about is emerging more clearly now. He's exerting his will. He's not asking my opinion or permission anymore. I can't control him anymore. As if he was there to kind of serve me. He's not doing my plan anymore. He's changing the schedule. I liked him better when he was away in the manger. When he was a little baby. This transition of recognizing that God maybe isn't who I thought he was, and Jesus is asking for more than I thought he was. I think there are several transitions in our walk with God. We go through like this. The first I recall in my life, I just kind of have this memory. I was a young adult. Somewhere around late in high school was the first time I think this was kind of pressed in on me. I grew up in church. You know that. We've spoken of that. And I heard the stories that Jesus loves you, Dave. Jesus loves me. This, I know. Yeah, I know. I know. And Jesus is going to take care of you, Dave. He's there for you, Dave. That's a good message. That's a true message. But then he began to exert his will. And say in a variety of ways things like this, Dave, you just need to understand those things about how much Jesus, that's all true, but it's not all about you, Dave. And this is going to sound mean, but it's not all for you, Dave. This is about my father's business. And do you have any interest in that at all? And I'm calling you, Dave, to something bigger than you, and it isn't your comfort, security, or sense of well-being. In fact, quite frankly, Dave, you may not like this, but your comfort, security, and sense of well-being is not even on my list of priorities for you. Now, when that reality begins to first come to people, especially if their only view of Jesus has been the little baby Jesus, This truth pierces like a sword. See, part of the cost of our yes to the invitations of God is coming to understand who Jesus really is and what he fully wants. For once you embrace the tiny little baby that we focus on at Christmas, you need to understand that this little baby grows up. And as he does, he begins to assert his agenda for our lives. And we begin responding in deeper ways to who he really is and what he really wants. A fact that is illustrated even more graphically in the third scene. I want us to consider this morning, 19 years later. This is recorded in Luke 8, Mark 3, and Matthew 12. The ministry of Jesus has begun on this occasion. Jesus' teaching a crowd has gathered. Mary and the brothers of Jesus have come to visit, but they couldn't get to him. And it was reported to him, Luke 8, verse 20. Jesus, your mother and your brothers are standing outside wishing to see you. But he answered and said to them, Who is my mother? And who are my brothers? But those who hear the word of God and do it. And there's a lady on the outskirts of that crowd who hearing those words feels a sword pierce her soul. See, I understand these calls to obedience, but I'm beginning to wonder, does he care about me personally at all? Because our whole relationship used to be about how much he loved me, how special I was to him, and how everything he did, he did for me, just for me. well know this Mary he does love you and he loves you special just like he loves you and you and you and you and you and he loves you special but know also this Mary that there is a level of discipleship and obedience that he calls all of his followers to including you and it may sound harsh but it's almost as if he's saying here, Mary, people, there is no special deal, no cost reduction, no discipleship discount, simply because you're related. Let me say it this way, simply because you're the pastor, or because you're not the pastor, or because you grew up in church, or you give a lot of money, or whatever. Who is my mother? And who are my brothers and my sisters? Those who hear the word of God and do it. That's who. Reminds me of a story. I love this story. Make reference to it quite often here actually. Matthew 8.18 Jesus is with a large crowd. They've been following him for a while and at this particular time he's going to move away from the crowd so he gives orders to leave the shore, to get in the boat, to go to the other side. The picture is significant because until now I think the symbolism here is significant. It's been relatively easy to follow Christ, to even consider yourself a follower of Christ, because in this particular scene at the beginning of it, everybody kind of was a follower. All you had to do was be in the crowd, kind of go to the first church, or what's happening now, where all the action was, and you kind of felt like, because you were in the crowd, you were a follower of his. But in this particular scene, in Luke 8, verse 18 and 19, it's as if he's saying this, if you're going to follow me now, It's going to cost you a little bit more because now you're going to have to leave the security of the shore and the familiarity of the crowd and get in this boat, leave the shore, and go to the other side. Immediately, verse 19, when that order was given to leave the security of the shore, get in the boat, there was a certain scribe, verse 19, who said to him, teacher or rabbi, I will follow you wherever you go. To which Jesus said, great, but just know this, foxes have holes, birds have nests, The Son of Man does not have a place to lay his head, and if you follow me is the implication. It may just be that way for you still want to come. Well, we know the answer to that because we've made reference to this quite often, that this guy who said he'd follow Jesus anywhere kind of disappears in the white space between verse 20 and 21. Lots of people do. Hang around, kind of part of the crowds, A religious crowd, but followers of the rabbi? We'll see. We'll see. According, however, to verse 23, while some disappeared in the white space between verse 20 and 21, the fact is, some did actually leave the shore, get in the boat. In fact, Mark 4 indicates that there were many boats. So a good number of people stayed with him now, and they had to be feeling good about it because we're the real followers of Jesus, when halfway across the lake, a great storm arose, and they thought they were going to die. And it looked like Jesus didn't care, because he was what? Remember? Asleep. What are you doing? All of which, again, is very confusing. Because we thought if we obeyed and followed you, things would go well, seas would be calm, so the unexpected cost of saying yes to God, once again, just went up. Well, this pattern continues. when later in the same gospel Jesus comes to his disciples again on the water this time they're already in the boat Jesus is walking on the water but this time Jesus says particularly to Peter Peter I want this time I want you to get out of the boat which again it kind of makes you wonder Lord I'm getting I don't know what you want anymore here you say get in the boat later you say get out of the boat what do you want Here's the answer. Everything. Absolutely everything. That's what I want. And a sword pierces the soul. And the cost of saying yes to God just went up again. But the Spirit of Mary says, by the way, not just Mary, but the Spirit of Mary. And some of you in this room have the spirit of Mary, which says, be it done unto me, just as you said, which is to say, I know I can't handle this, I can't manage this, I can't control this, but I will receive it. Final scene. Mary, at the foot of the cross, Go there with her in your mind's eye if you can. Use your imagination and be there at the foot of the cross with Mary. All of us, I think, are moved at this scene. When we place ourselves in it, filled with horror and grief, but gratitude as well as we see Jesus on the cross as our Savior. But Mary, Mary was a mother. She saw him as a son. That's my boy. She had watched as they mocked him and spat upon him, beat and abandoned him publicly, exposed and disgraced him, then executed him. So did she know that in three days, stay at the cross scene, did she know that in three days all of this would turn to life, for he would be raised from the dead? certainly she had heard that but did she believe it as she stood at the foot of the cross well let's assume she did believe it that he would be raised in three days even if she did the undeniable fact before her right now is this that all her hopes and dreams and all her expectations are being dashed they are dying right before her eyes. An angel told me that he would be a king, a ruler of the nations. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Favored are you, blessed are you, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. And a sword pierces her heart and the cost of her yes to this unexpected invitation of God just goes up a little more because now she is being called to love and believe God even when the lights go out and dreams are dashed and hopes are shattered but even there she loves him still. How do you know? Well one way we know is simply because she's there at the foot of the cross. Think about it. When Peter made his I will not deny you speech but did deny him. Mary made no such speech but didn't deny him. And when all the disciples agreed with Peter that we will never flee but did flee. Mary made no such promise but didn't flee. so there she was where she wanted to be where she had to be at the foot of the cross with Jesus G. Campbell Morgan says of this scene she was hopeless, disappointed, bereaved and heartbroken but the love that had been stirred in her heart could not be quenched even by the dashing of her dreams though disappointed it could not be overcome though over the sea of sorrow there was no sighing wind that said the dawn is coming she loved him, still Jesus was the magnet of her soul. And he held her to himself like the sun holds planets in their orbit, even in his death. Even when her dreams were dashed, be it done unto me, even if it means that a sword pierces my soul. Even if it means that I can't always handle it or manage it or control it. I can only receive it. I will receive it. Be it done unto me. Here's what I wonder. How many of you, how many of us are experiencing an invitation from God of some kind right now that you can't handle, manage, or control? You can only receive, be it done unto me. But now, one more spin on this story. Imagine with me what must have exploded in Mary's heart the day the stone was rolled away. No words have I that could come close to describing that, but this is for certain. It was joy inexpressible and full of glory because right in the middle of these journeys with God that at times feel like death, there is life. And it's an eternal kind of life that we enter into right here right now and it's a life that can be yours as well but it can't be handled managed or controlled it can only be received so come into my heart Lord Jesus there is room in here for you but I need to warn you that if you say yes to this invitation if you're willing to receive this life then it will come to you and begin to grow in you. And as it does, it will stretch you, change you, sometimes scare you. But in the end, life will issue from you. So Merry Christmas, everybody. Amen.
