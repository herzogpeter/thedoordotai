Open your Bibles with me to the book of Ephesians, chapter 5, verse 18. Our continuing study in this very rich book brings us to a very key passage. Ephesians 5, verse 18. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation or excess, but be ye filled with the Holy Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father, and subject to one another in the fear of Christ. Let's pray. Father, as I pray this morning, I almost don't know what to say in terms of request. This passage has exploded for me, and it has been alive for me as you have been teaching the depth and the breadth of the truth of this text. But Lord Jesus, even with my excitement about it, there's such a tendency to try to push and generate the excitement in my own flesh. And I pray that your spirit would indeed enlighten us this morning as to the depth of this particular passage in your name. Amen. I need, before I start, to share some things on my heart with you concerning this passage. Do not be drunk with wine, for that's dissipation, but be filled with the Holy Spirit. The filling of the Holy Spirit. We're dealing with a hot potato here. We're dealing with things that there's a divergence of opinion all over the place on what it means to be filled with the Holy Spirit. What it means to demonstrate the filling of the Holy Spirit. How to be filled with the Holy Spirit. But there are people who believe that the filling of the Holy Spirit is some sort of divine zap that kind of happens to me once and for all. And from that point on, I never have any struggles again. There are people who believe that the filling of the Holy Spirit is that time when I get that divine zap. And then I evidence that zap by speaking in tongues. And then we end up with two kind of groups. There's the zapped and the unzapped. And we're kind of always trying to find out where we're at. There are other people, on the other hand, who view the filling of the Holy Spirit of God with kind of a stoic theological reservation, where I just kind of look at it and I go, yes, the filling of the Holy Spirit is such and such and such, and there's really no vitality, there is no life, and for some reason or another we leave exhortations stoically dealing with the filling of the Holy Spirit with some sort of emptiness, feeling like it still is out there in the distance, It's something I'm supposed to know and understand, but nothing that really affects my living. This particular passage is the keystone in our whole study in the book of Ephesians. It is the energy, it is the life, it is the resource. It is the only method that God has given to me to fulfill the worthy walk that we have been talking about. Be ye filled with the Holy Spirit. If I don't understand this passage, every other exhortation we've been dealing with up to this point is just going to be a bunch of legalistic jargon and fleshy trying on your part to walk the worthy walk. This is a very easy passage, struggling just this week in terms of how I wanted to deal with this and present it so that we would catch the life of this. The paradox in trying to teach this particular doctrine is that while it is full of life and hard to put my finger on what it really means and how it really needs to be defined in my living, the paradox in all that is that it's also a very easy passage to teach theologically. I mean, it would be real easy to kind of treat this with that stoic distance. Kind of tell you, this is what it means, and this is how it's applied, and this is how the text reads, and da-da-da-da-da. And we'd all leave cold. This passage is very big. And I need for you to catch my heart in this. There is no way I can teach you what it means to be filled with the Holy Spirit. I cannot give you five little things that you can remember and from now on understand what it means. This is alive. This is real. And just like so many other dimensions of our Christian lives that are real and alive, what we do with them is try to define them in little tiny boxes, in fine little definitions. And for some reason or another when we do that, the meaning and the power is gone. This is alive and it's going to be hard for me to just put my finger on it. What I'm going to do with you is share with you my struggle. What that means is you have got to join in with me in struggling and opening your own heart to the Lord as we are discovering together what it means to be filled with the Holy Spirit and specifically how that filling is to be translated into my living. are you ready? let's go the flow of the book of Ephesians is very clear I think you know it chapters 1 through 3 is telling me who I am in Christ the riches I have the resources that I am among the redeemed I am the adopted I am the sealed in the Holy Spirit I am one of the inheritors I went from death unto life I went from darkness into light wonderful truths and we spent a lot of time just saturating ourselves wallowing in those powerful truths. But something follows that up. In chapters 4 through 6, we've discovered this. That believer, because that's who you are, this is how you'll live. And it wasn't even so much, because that's who you are, this is how you should try to live. It was more, the thrust was basically this. If that's who you are, this is how you will live. There will be evidence of your life. If you're alive, you'll live like you're alive. And if there are indications in your life that there is death and we're doing the deeds of darkness, question marks come flying into our minds. Am I really alive? Am I really in the light? The thrust of this book, and I trust you know the thrust of my entire ministry, is that knowing the Word of God, that understanding the Word of God, that even being able to interpret the Word of God, All those wonderful things I go to seminary for and Bible school for and come to church for so that I can get the tools to understand and interpret the Word of God correctly and I can win arguments is not enough. The blessings of God are attended on those who what? Who obey. Who do the Word of God. Who are obedient servants of the Lord Jesus. We call these characteristics in chapters 4 through 6 the signs of life. putting off the old, putting on the new speaking truth to one another that's a sign that you're alive being angry and not sinning, that's a sign of life letting all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speech being put away is a sign that you have life, that you are in the light being forgiving and tender hearted toward one another is a sign, an indicator that you indeed have life the characteristics of the believer are very clear There's a word I'd like to introduce you to As we're considering the characteristics of one who has newness of life One who is in the light It's diagnostic Write it down if you're taking notes Diagnostic What a diagnosis is is simply this Looking at symptoms and from the symptoms Concluding that this is the source of that problem I go to the doctor and I look like Elvin the chipmunk My glands are swollen up to here I've got a temperature of 104 degrees I've got all sorts of pain in my back and in my stomach And he tells me that I've got mono And he takes some things because the symptoms are clear. The diagnostic symptoms are very clear, indicating that the source is mononucleosis, pneumonia, whatever it is that you have. On the other hand, I go into the doctor, my eyes are clear, there's no temperature, my color is good, everything is fine. That is simply a manifestation of the fact that I am well, that all is well. These characteristics of the believer are simply diagnostic. They are not things that I am supposed to try to go, I'm going to try to be humble. Humble, humble, humble. Try to be patient. I'm going to try to be patient. What a strange paradox that is. Discipline yourself to be patient. All they are is symptoms. All they are is symptoms. These are the indicators, and they're going to indicate to you and to me over and over again who the source of my living is. Galatians 5, verse 19. Turn to it. It's very quick. It's right close. A beautiful list of a diagnostic approach to this. Verse 19 says this, Now the deeds of the flesh are evident. That's easy. I mean, these indicators are simple. They are immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and he ran out of things to say. He could have gone on and on. He goes, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you that those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit, again, diagnostic, these are simply the indicators of one who's got life, who is being controlled by the Spirit, is what? Love, joy, peace, long-suffering. We are not called to muster up love, muster up peace. They're just symptoms of an inward condition. the tough question that comes to the believer then as we're considering the characteristics of the believer in Ephesians 4 through 6 is this I get it, it's this if David Johnson your life is characterized by this bitterness, anger, strife, malice if your life is characterized by those things how is it then that you say you are this Huh? How is it that you say you're born of God, but your life is characterized by anger, rebellion, strife, on and on and on? Jesus asked that very same question in Luke 6.46. He said this, why do you call me Lord, Lord? Why do you come to me and say, Lord, Lord, and don't do what I say? It's almost as if I used to look at that passage as a real indictment on Christ, from Christ to those people. Why do you say that to me and not do what I say? Rather, I would like to look at it like he's puzzled. I don't get it. How come you come to me and say, Lord, Lord, and don't do what I say? These things don't go together. I don't understand. Diagnostic. The way we demonstrate our love, Scott sang, but obey. There's a poem written on the wall of a great church in Lebeck, Germany. It says this, Thus speaketh Christ our Lord to us. You call me Master and obey me not. You call me Light and see me not. You call me the Way and walk me not. You call me Life and live me not. You call me Wise and follow me not. You call me Eternal and seek me not. If on that day I don't know you, blame me not. I believe that most of us look at the things I just said to you in terms of the diagnostic approach and seeing these things evidenced in my life as being signs of life and most of us who have walked with God for any time at all and have known the word of God for any time at all would all say amen, right? We'd say there's nobody here who disagrees with those things. In fact, if I'm encouraged to do anything in this church and one of the reasons I came when I was being interviewed and all these things were going on was this, we want to hear the word of God. We don't want to hear superficial Christianity. We want to hear calls to discipleship and calls to obedience. We want to hear about the godly walk, radical Christianity, obedience, on and on and on. You see, many of us do believe, and I believe that one of the big problems in the church is kind of an easy believism, a cheap kind of grace, that just because I raised my hand, and we've talked about this over and over again in Sunday school and in here that somehow everything's wonderful and they never need to understand what commitment is. That is a danger in the church. And I believe that even for some here, that is a danger for some of you. When Jesus calls a man, he bids him come to die, Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, and I believe that we need to catch the radical nature of our faith. Most of us see the reality of discipleship. Most of us see the need for, quote, godly living. Most of us see the need for obedience. Our problem lies someplace else. And now let me grab you and begin to move you toward what I want to make a point about. The problem that we have most of the time, and many of we believers have this problem, is one that is just as capable of wreaking just as much havoc and rendering us just as useless as the believer who isn't taking his discipleship seriously. Our problem is not that we think immorality is okay. It is not that sensuality is okay. It isn't in our minds that we think that big list of sins that Paul listed is okay. We would confront every one of those things. We would have a board meeting and we would deal with it. Our problem is not that we are lackadaisical in our attitude toward the worthy walk. Our problem is far more subtle than that. Our problem is this, that many of us are trying like crazy to walk the worthy walk. That many of us are trying to do that without a clear understanding of what it means to really be filled with the Holy Spirit. And unwittingly, and with all sorts of good intentions, what we do is we begin, again, it's something that we don't even understand we're doing. And what I need to do is begin to poke holes in some of our delusions. We try like crazy to be humble in those things. And before we know it, you know what we're doing? We're performing. Do you ever feel yourself performing, coming to church and just being humble? Just performing, you know, being loving. Just kind of putting it on and letting it go and it's a wonderful thing. We all know how we're supposed to act. And so we do it. And impressions become important, and what you think of me becomes important, and so I just begin to kind of let myself flow into the kinds of put-on behavior that I'm supposed to have, and I perform for everyone. And I try like crazy to impress everyone, and without even knowing it, you know what I've moved into? I've moved into an area of my spirituality that has stagnated me and placed me into a position where I'm not connected at all. with the Holy Spirit of God energizing me, I'm doing it all. It's real subtle. The problem is that in bread and this kind of spirituality that is energized by the flesh, there is a basic dishonesty. There is a basic dishonesty. Again, the bottom line is this. I perform. See? I'm here in front of you and I'm the pastor. Isn't there a role for the pastor? And I know it very well. And as long as I stay within the bounds of what you think a pastor ought to be, I feel safe and secure. And I'm trying real hard to find out what all those things are. And so I just kind of go through the motions and wonderful, wonderful. There's another basic problem in this dishonesty and this lifestyle that has begun to perform. You know what it is? It's this, that once I start, it's very hard to stop. Once I start, it's very hard to stop. I trust that by the end of our study, we are going to have a grasp on the fact that that kind of, what I would call pious pretending, is not at all a sign of the Spirit's control, but it is an obvious sign of my control. We hear over and over again, by the way, I've got to grab you again here. I know that this particular sermon is not normal. There is a flow of thought that's going through here. This is going to be tough to take notes on. You've got to keep dealing with the concepts I'm throwing out at you. It may well be that you leave this morning with more questions than answers, and that's fine. I want you to wrestle with this. We hear over and over again the fact that Satan is the enemy. The roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. We all know that. And even through Ephesians, one of the things we've seen clearly is that every place that God in Christ begins to move and change people's lives, we see the contrast is always beginning. This is what God does. This is what Satan does. Satan's work is darkness and death and all that kind of thing, and God's work is light and life. Over and over again, we see the contrast. We see Satan deceiving. We say things like this. Satan is the enemy, and Satan is the one who makes me sin. He makes me do the immorality He makes me do the sensuality He makes me get into the drunkenness and all that kind of thing And he leads me into that That's his job You know what else I hope by the end of our study I hope that by the end of our study That we see that kind of perception of Satan's work As being incredibly shallow and superficial Satan is far more subtle I believe With those of us who know Jesus Than he is with some of the people Who he's already got a good grip on He is subtle He is sophisticated, and he infiltrates our thinking and our responses to God in ways that are very hard for us to see. Again, our job, poke holes in the delusion. Satan is the ape of God. You've heard me say that before. Remember, when we talked about love, we talked about God's love. And there is a love that is born of God, and it is essentially what? It is essentially giving. It is essentially selfless. Right along with that is going to be a love that is born of Satan. He is the ape of God. He's going to come along with something that is looking good and feeling good. It is a love that's essentially taking and sucking from you the life that I need. And on and on and on, we see the contrast. Satan is the deceiver. He is the infiltrator. He is the perverter. It is in his subtle infiltration that he is most effective. And the reason is because I don't see it. I don't see it. And if I don't see it, there is no way I'm going to do anything about it. Right? I just live with it. It's like being in darkness. Now, I don't even like to talk about a believer being in darkness. But I want to tell you there are places in my life where I am still in darkness. I don't see things in my life yet. And growth for me and for you is exposing myself to the truth of God's word so that I can see. Subtle ways that Satan infiltrates. Let's just look at this whole concept of the filling of the Spirit. It's incredible the way he has perverted that. The Holy Spirit is what? It is the resource, I've already said this, that is given by God to create and enable us to walk the worthy walk. Let me just focus on one of the characteristics. One of the characteristics of the worthy walk is unity, right? Bringing the body of Christ together. And the enabler for that is what? The power of the Holy Spirit, right? The irony in all of that is this, that it is the very dynamic created by God to produce unity that is now in our evangelical circles being used by Satan to destroy unity, isn't it? One of the greatest hindrances to our unity with some other brothers that you know of right now is this whole idea of the filling of the Spirit. And instead of being that agency that's bringing us together, it's an agency that Satan has taken and twisted because of lack of understanding and maybe lack of application that we're divided over. What a perversion. I hope you see that. subtle. There's another one. This is a little closer to home and it ties in with this whole fleshy fulfilling of these characteristics and it all ties in, I believe, with a basic misunderstanding of the true function of the Holy Spirit. Let me ask you this. What will the control of the Holy Spirit result in me? What will be the result of the Holy Spirit's control in my life. For many, instead of the filling of the Holy Spirit leading me into a deeper reality, a deeper relationship with you where there is honesty and openness and sometimes a blunt honesty and openness, a greater ability to with openness and honesty face my sin, face my pain, face my inconsistency, look right in the eye of my lousy relationships and call my lousy relationships lousy, to face my shallow thinking and weakness, what happens is very subtly we twist it until the filling of the Holy Spirit becomes nothing more for me than a spiritual way for me to deny all those things. Deny my pain because I'm filled with the Spirit. See, I don't have any of those things. I'm filled with the Spirit. I don't ever have any sorrow. I don't ever have any pain. And so the way I take care of it, I go, I'm filled with spirit, and it's over. And I'm happy. And I come to church with my filled with the spirit smile. Right? It's all ready. What I've done is begun to pretend. And I want to tell you something, the Holy Spirit of God will never lead you to do that. It's subtle. I'm a spirit-filled Christian, so that means I've got no problems, no pain, everything is happy, everything is all together. And if I do have a problem, and if I do have some pain, what I'll do is I'll take a little pill, and it's called the Holy Spirit pill, and I'll just say, well, I'm filled with the Holy Spirit, so I can't feel those things, I can't have those things, and it's gone. So I just say it's gone, and it isn't. The wonderful thing about living like that is I never have to go through pain, I never have to go through process of dealing with things, I never have to do any work. I say six praise the Lord's and seven hallelujahs and everything's fine. This is going to tie in. Again, we're not getting to the text yet, but this is going to tie in magnificently as we get to our text next week. It says, don't be drunk with wine, in which is excess. The whole problem in the Ephesian church was that they came out of a culture, and I don't want to do this, we're going to teach it next week. By the way, next week is going to be far more academic than this. We're going to teach the text. But they were coming out of a culture where their religion, now I don't know if you can imagine this, but their religion dictated that the way they got in touch with the Lord, quote, with God, was to get blasted. Okay? They got drunk. They did. And they kind of claimed that this drunkenness kind of gave them a new sense of reality, you know? And every one of us would look at that and say, what kind of way you're fooling yourself. That's not reality. What you're doing, what you're calling being in touch, is really getting out of touch, right? That's what Paul is saying. Listen, friends, you're used to worshiping by getting out of touch and denying everything you're feeling, getting blasted and going into the ozone layer. That's not the way it's going to be for you anymore. What I want you to be is not drunk on wine, but controlled by the Holy Spirit. The function of the Holy Spirit is not a vehicle whereby I escape reality. The function of the Holy Spirit is not a vehicle whereby I escape reality. The function of the Holy Spirit is this. It is the divine energy of God whereby I face reality. Sometimes for some of us, the first time in our whole lives. It is the indescribable freedom where I stop pretending. It is the inexpressible joy where I stop my performance. And face the situations I find myself in. And ask God to fill me so that I can face those things. Deal with those things. Square in the face. Not escaping. I think of the Pharisee. What do you think when you think of a Pharisee? I've painted many verbal pictures of Pharisees before. And what I think of when I think of a Pharisee is somebody who's wearing a black cape and a black hat. And he's got slanty eyes and he looks like Snidely Whiplash, you know. He's got a little mustache and he goes, you know. And he's going to kill Jesus and he's going to really be mean to everybody. And he's a bad guy. Evil. Not a nice bone in his body. Obviously, no pain, no frustration, nothing. It's just bad, and I hate him. He's the bad guy. He's the villain. If it was a movie, he'd be dressed in black. At best, if I can kind of muster up some halfway decent feelings about a Pharisee, it would be this. He'd be a real hard guy to work with. Because the reason is he'd know everything. He'd know what I feel more than what I feel. He'd know what I think more than what I think. He'd have all the answers and everything. It'd be wonderful. That would just be right there for the Pharisee. And I would try to say what was dealing. Forget it. It doesn't matter. I've got all the answers. Da-da-da-da-da. By the way, there's nothing wrong necessarily with having answers. There's nothing wrong with always doing it right. Nothing at all. You know what's wrong? What's wrong is acting like I have the answers when I don't. That's wrong. That's sin. That's hypocrisy. Spirit doesn't lead you to that. The other thing that's wrong is acting like I always do it right when I don't. that's sin that's hypocrisy that's lying the Holy Spirit doesn't lead you to that let's go a little deeper into the Pharisees makeup though so I can understand him a little bit you see what I usually do is I look at the behavior of the Pharisee just like you look at my behavior and I look at your behavior and that's what I judge you on and that's you know hard to get around I look at the Pharisee and he just makes me mad I'm angry with him I don't like him if you were a Pharisee we'd have problems getting along if I'm a Pharisee then you're probably going to have a struggle with me. But we need to look at a little different angle. Let's get in a little bit deeper. That Pharisee, to me, is simply the perfect illustration of everything I'm talking about this morning. He is the epitome of the pretender. Okay? Can you connect with that? I hope you can. The Pharisee is the epitome of the pretender. The guy who's coming to church and kind of knows what he's supposed to do. He knows exactly what's expected of him. He knows all the external behaviors. He knows all the rules. He knows all the hoops that he's supposed to jump through. And he does it perfectly. And everybody in the church thinks that he or she is the most spiritual person in the church. Wonderful. They've got the act down right. He's one who is maintaining an image and keeping up a facade. He's a tremendous performer. But if I would go still a little bit deeper into the makeup of this Pharisee, my feelings, not a lot move to this, but I get a little twinge of sympathy for him. And the reason I move to sympathy for him or for her is this. Because maybe at the core of his performing, and maybe at the core of my performing, and maybe at the core of your performing, and learning all the tricks and never being real, is a raging fear. Could you look at the Pharisee that way? I really want you to. I want you to see that Pharisee who's praying in public, Oh, Lord, and just going on and on and on and just trying to pray for your benefit. You know, he's not even talking to God. I see that and I get so mad. I need to back off a little bit and see that maybe the reason that person is performing like that is because there's a raging fear inside of that person's heart that if they really knew what I was like, if they really saw me, they would never love me. They would never accept me. And so what happens? I perform. And that's why it's so hard not to perform because I get caught in that and I believe that lie from Satan. And my whole life begins to be a performance and I don't even know it. he keeps on pretending and he keeps on pretending and what he calls it is the abundant life and it isn't the abundant life you know I believe that one of the reasons the Pharisee so hated Jesus wasn't just because they had disagreements it was because Jesus got real close to their pain Jesus got real close to saying I know who you really are. And see, I see the performance, and I see behind it. And that made him bristle. I think every one of us can identify with this, because every one of us do it. Every one of us. I don't think there's a person here who's beyond this. Our spiritual growth is a process of learning how not to pretend, isn't it? And I think we can all identify with the fear of that Pharisee as he's being confronted. And what they do when they get confronted, they make their performance better. Right? They just get better at learning the roles and quoting the verses and it's desperate. You can see it in their eyes. You know what else about the Pharisee? He was the epitome of the person that Christ could not help. He was the epitome. He was the illustration. He was the ultimate picture of the person that Jesus could not help. He was too busy pretending. Luke 18, 9 through 13. Jim read it. we see the picture of this publican, this sinner, as he's called, who pours out his heart to God, he spills his guts to God, and he just opens himself and he sees himself for who he is, and he breaks himself before the Lord, and he says, there's an honesty there. And the Pharisee looks at him and says, Oh, I thank God I'm not like him. Oh, I thank God I'm not like those people. I thank God that I'm the happy one. He's so sad. I thank God that I'm the happy one. I thank God that I'm not one of the Catholics or the Baptists or the Lutherans or the CNMA. Thank God that that's who I am. I used to get angry, and now I get feelings of pity because that publican got filled. Ephesians 5.18. That publican got filled. You know why? Because he emptied himself. He said, this is who I am. This is who I am. This is who I really am. And he got filled. It says he went away justified. And the Pharisee went on with the act. Went on with the pretending. And you know what happened to the Pharisee? He had to continue to live with his fear. He had to continue to live with his fear. That if I really tell you who I am, you won't love me. He chose to pretend. But he also has to live with his fear. i said i feel pity for the pharisee i do but there is a way in which i still get angry with this particular kind of pharisee and that's when that pharisee would intimidate the publican can you keep that in your mind let's say the publican is here in our church and he's just letting his heart break before the lord and he's learning how to be honest and he's learning how to look square in the face of what's troubling him, and he's dealing with it. And the Pharisee comes along and says, Oh, I'm so glad that I'm not like... Well, what can I say? You know, it's just a wonderful thing that I'm not like that. And kind of puts the arm around it and says, You know, you really shouldn't do that kind of thing. You really shouldn't share your heart. You really shouldn't do that. That's when I get angry at the Pharisee. That's when I get angry, and my feelings of pity and things begin to go away. Jesus has said it well in Luke chapter 16. where he said it would be better, dear Pharisee, for a millstone to be wrapped around your neck than to cause one of these to stumble. Have you ever had somebody do that to you? You're beginning to open up and you're beginning to think, I've got to be real, I've got to be honest. I know that the hallmark of the Christian is joy, and I want to have that joy. But I don't feel joy, so I need to deal with it somewhere. And you try, and someone puts their arm around you, and you're loving it and says, You know, really shouldn't do this. Just kind of. And so what you do is right now, you go right back into that pretending. I'm never going to do that again. I'm never going to share again. I'm never going to be honest again. And you just kind of go, pretend. Yeah, you've done that. I've done that. I've had people come to me and tell me that people have done that to them. I've done that to people. The filling of the Holy Spirit doesn't lead us to do that. this whole concept of the filling of the spirit ties in very well maybe the best illustration i can use is the one we're using in ephesians 5 we found in ephesians not just ephesians 5 but it's the concept of the light and dark you remember that and and death and life remember that the neat exciting thing about darkness is that i can't see anything right i was talking to jim hanna this week and he was telling me that the lights went on in his apartment. Wonderful experience that is. There's negatives. You can't see your way around. You bend your knee. You fall down in a bathtub and stuff like that. Those are little tiny negative things. You bash your face. You get a big thing on your eye. You can live with that. The neat thing about being in darkness is that I can have a pile of junk sitting in the middle of my living room, just the garbage and coffee grounds and yesterday's meatloaf and all that, Just right in the middle of the living room. And it's wonderful because I can't see it. It's great. I love living in that. You know, I'm not responsible. I don't have to pick it up. I don't see it. I don't see it. Ignorance is bliss, right? It is. It's great. And I can go and I can go in the drawer and I can take a white sock and a blue sock and put them on and not be embarrassed when I go to work because I'm not responsible. I didn't see it. It was in the dark. Then this terrible thing happens. Light comes. oh no see the light goes on and now i see the junk and that's what i do i go yuck now i see it and now i can't sit on the sofa anymore and just go nothing's there i do have a choice though and so do you the choice i have is this i can sit in here and continue to watch the football game and just be lazy or and live with that junk or i can go and pick it up and clean it up the problem is that with the light i'm responsible it doesn't necessarily mean the junk is going to get cleaned up. But now I'm responsible because now I see it. And when I put a blue sock on or a white sock on, I can't plead ignorance anymore. The light was there. I saw the blue and the white. And if you put a blue and a white on, I'm going to call you a dummy. You're responsible. But I still have a choice. And I can still sit there. You see, the problem when the light comes, and that is Christ into my life, when I become light, if I decide to leave the sin, the garbage there, you know what I do? I do it, but I'm responsible now because I can't plead ignorance anymore. That's why we teach the Word of God, to continually reveal what sin really is, and that's light, so that I can't plead ignorance anymore. And now it's a decision. I decide I'm going to deal with it or I'm not going to deal with it. You see, the light comes into my life and my sin looks like sin. It didn't used to look like sin. It looked like a good time before. The light comes into my life and my superficiality looks superficial. My superficiality used to look spiritual. My empty relationships look empty. They used to look normal. And now the light comes and I look at my relationship with my wife or my husband or with my kids and the light comes and I go, oh no, this is shallow. We don't know how to talk. We don't know how to relate. And isn't it easier to live in the darkness? I'll tell you, it's a lot easier to live without the light. Before the light came, I could pretend I was a Christian. You know, I could, I could, I really believed that if I went to church and, you know, took the sacraments and gave a little money and got involved in social things, that I was a It was wonderful. And it was great. Ignorance is bliss. There was no pain. There was no dealing. There was nothing like that. Problem is, I heard this message, and it was the gospel, and it told me that that wasn't what Christianity was. The light was exposed to that. Now I've got to make a decision. I hate it. Because I can't pretend to be a Christian anymore. I've either got to say, that's my commitment, or it isn't. It used to be that I could pretend we had a good marriage. it was great you know we're all just such good actors it's great we know the words to say we know how to act when we're together at a social thing at church you know we know how to smile it's great the problem is the light comes and all of a sudden I realize that my lousy marriage is lousy I've lived for 20 years married calling it good now the light of God's word comes and says it isn't good there isn't communication you don't know how to talk you're not really dealing with your problems that isn't the filling of the spirit and now I got a choice. I can live with a lousy marriage but you better know you're doing it in the light. And maybe that's the most painful thing of all. It is easier to live in darkness because I don't have to do anything. Or I can begin by the power of the Holy Spirit to begin to put those pieces together, take them up, put them out in the garbage where they belong. But that means process and that sometimes means pain and that means honesty and dealing. and some of us who live in the light just choose to ignore we do, I do it used to be that I could pretend I was spirit filled because I had the act that meant spirit filled happy, happy, happy we sing little children's songs about the light come into the sunshine I'm not a singer but the whole idea is that the sunshine is warm and I just feel great and I can relax. And I want to tell you something, the light of God's love is warm and there's a dimension of it that is fulfilling and I can relax and rest in Him. Praise the Lord for that. But the true light is stark, it is bright, it is revealing, it is hard reality and that is why men love darkness rather than light. Why? Because the light isn't always easy to live with. It just isn't. And I can continue to pretend if I want. But if I'm a believer, I'm going to have to do it with the light shining right on it. And I know many of us right now who are dealing with things in your families and things with your spouses and your kids and your friends. And because I'm the pastor, I know about those struggles. thrilling kinds of things and the reason some of you are doing that is why? it's because somewhere along the line the light hit your marriage the light hit your relationships the light hit your pretending and then you had a choice I've either got to deal with this or I'm going to have to sit and let it sit in the light knowing it's wrong and let it sit there and just fester but I want to tell you something and maybe nobody will even understand what I'm saying except those of you who are beginning to do that kind of thing that I guarantee you that if you begin to deal with the things that God is shining his light on in your life that there's going to be times that you wish you just hadn't ever started because it was easier when you didn't see it it was easier when you just walked through your marriage and walked through your spirituality and just felt warm and gooey and then the light of truth hit it and now I can't ignore it anymore I can't pretend anymore but it sure was easier when I could and I also know again that some of you wish the light had never done it the light had never hit it you see the problem however with the spirit filled life is that the filling of the spirit is going to do one thing. You know what it's going to do? It's going to lead me into truth. The filling of the Spirit is going to lead me into truth. And you know what's going to happen when I'm led into truth? I'm not going to be able to pretend anymore. The neat thing about light is that I don't see it. The neat thing about death is that I don't feel anything. It's great. It's great to be dead. It is. Not eternally it isn't. And we understand the fullness of joy when I'm able to face those things. But there is a disgustingly perverse comfort in being spiritually dead. It's that I don't feel anything when I'm dead. But I came alive to Christ, and not only did I come alive to the joy of Christ in me, but coming alive to Christ opened me up to more pain than I ever imagined. And I think we need to know that as believers even when we share our faith. When I was dead, I didn't care. It was great. I didn't care about you. I didn't care about my wife. I didn't care about my kids. If I loved my wife, it was because she fulfilled me. If I cared about my kids, it was because they did what I wanted them to do. When I was dead, I didn't care. Now I'm alive, and now I do. And I want to tell you something. Sometimes I wish I didn't. Because it's harder to care than it is not to care. And when I was dead, my hypocrisy and my games and my lies and my pretending, It didn't bother me. I didn't feel it. I didn't see it. But I come alive in Christ. And now I do. And sometimes I wish I didn't. And when I was dead in my sin, I lived for me. And you were there for me to use. And now, because I'm alive, I've turned outward. And it's introduced me to a terrifying concept. It's called compassion. I care about you. it's so much easier not to care about you. Believe me. It's a lot easier not to care about you. For me as a pastor to go through the motions, to be pastoral, to preach my sins, and not care that people are hurting and not dealing. But I'm alive, and I feel, and I have seen the light, and I see. And we're not going to let the garbage sit there. You know what compassion is? Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it's like to live inside someone else's skin. Get this. It is the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy for you. I had a friend yesterday come to me at the Awana party at Stone's house. and just wanted a slugger. She came and she said, Dave, how are you doing? And I said, and I had the Christian look of bewilderment. What do you mean? And she said, I just feel like something, you know, last few days or something, you seem like you're doing better now. Something's been hurting you lately or bugging you and you just got kind of short and you know what I did? I denied it. I said, me? Me. short crabby me never I don't get like that I'm spirit filled you know what I like about our church we're not letting people get away with that anymore even the pastor you can't pretend anymore and compassion is someone coming to me and saying Dave I can't even really feel joy and feel fulfilled until I know you are. And we got a bunch of people in our church who are going up to people and saying, how you doing? And they want to know. And it was so much easier when they didn't want to know, wasn't it? It was so much easier when I didn't care. Because then I didn't have to give, and then I didn't have to touch, and then we didn't have to talk. But God in Christ has made me alive, and now I feel. And God in Christ has brought the light. And now I see. And now I can't pretend anymore. And neither can you. You know what? I will never try to sell our Christianity to anyone. I'm not going to do a sales job on anybody ever. The kind of thing that I think many of us are used to. And it's this kind of mentality that says, you come to the cross and at the cross you're going to find daffodils and daisies. I don't think that's the message. I don't think that's the gospel. Thank you.
