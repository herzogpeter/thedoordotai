Let's pray as we begin. Father, I pray that by the power of your Spirit, once again, this morning through the working of your Word, you would in particular be our Father, Father, us, your children, in this particular arena of our lives where we need by your Spirit's work to enter into healthy, holy, and happy realities. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, as I promised last week, we are returning today to the series of sermons we were involved in prior to the events of September 11th. A series of sermons that, as Tom indicated earlier in the announcements, is dealing with three arenas of life that are very critical to life. Money, sex, and power. The reason we're doing this is, as many of you know if you've been here these weeks, is because a rightly ordered relationship with those three things are critical to our preparation as individuals and as a people, actually as a church, as it relates to where we're going as a church. In fact, I think most of you know that we're kind of considering this season in our church's life as we anticipate going to Maple Grove and finally being there as a time of preparation and consecration. The first arena that we chose to deal with of those three, money, sex, and power, was that of sexuality. And in particular, what we've been dealing with is disordered sexuality for about six weeks. And the lies we have come to believe that make our sexuality often a disordered thing. I'm not going to obviously review the whole thing, but I want to kind of bring back two primary lies that some of us have come to believe that has created a powerful sense of disorder among us. Lie number one, that the essence of our sexuality involves nothing more than a biological urge, a physical function, or a genital expression. Over these last weeks, we've tried to make clear that that's a lie. For at the root of our sexuality is a powerful spiritual dimension of which we must be aware. We said it this way. Sexuality is more than a physical expression. It is a physical expression, but it's far more than that. It's a spiritual union, which means that something deeper and much more profound than a body part is being touched. When a body part is being touched, something in my spirit is involved. Something in my soul is being engaged, which is precisely why things like adultery are so devastating. Things like premarital sex are so inappropriate. Things like spiritual and abuse, or sexual abuse rather, and rape are so horrific. Because more is involved than skin touching skin. Something in the spirit is being engaged. Line number two. That sex is a biological urge over which I have no control. to clarify that one of the things we said is this that sex obviously is a biological urge and for some people it's obviously out of control our point around this was this that when your sexuality is out of control it's probably not our biological urges that's making it so for the fact is this our biological urges as it relates to sexual expression can be controlled but when you add to normal biological urges, lying messages about what sex has the power to do, you can get pressed or pushed over the edge. You've got a problem now. For instance, if you believe that sex has the power to establish your masculinity, to affirm your femininity, to establish your lovability, if you believe that sex has the power to turn the boy into a man, then suddenly sex is far more than a biological urge. Now it's an identity quest. And if you're beginning to use sex to affirm your identity, masculinity, femininity, lovability, if you're using it that way, then you're going to need a lot of sex. Before you can blink, it's out of control. It's never enough because you have begun to use sex to do things that sex was never intended to do. Sex was never intended by God. It does not have the ability to help you establish your masculinity, your femininity, to affirm your lovability. It does not have the power to help you break your isolation, to medicate your pain, to alter your mood. And none of those things have anything to do with your biology. All of those things have everything to do with disordered sexuality. Now, all of that presses us into the question I want to deal with this morning. having dealt with disordered sexuality what about healthy sexuality? is there such a thing? I mean when you spend six weeks talking about and examining disordered sexuality and notice how familiar disordered sexuality actually is to us you can begin to wonder do those two words actually go together? health and sex there's the whole idea of healthy sexuality an oxymoron see here's what I want to know Is there any context within which sexuality can be genuinely and wonderfully experienced as healthy, holy, and happy? Not just experience. I know that sex can be experienced. My question is, can it be experienced as healthy, holy, and authentically happy? Well, I'm sure there are some people who hear that question and by it are a bit confused because the answer is obvious to them. Of course there's a place where sex is healthy, holy, happy. Marriage. that's why they call it holy matrimony it's holy automatically end of discussion and often times that is the end of the discussion you want holy, happy, healthy sex get married I've heard some people if you can't control your sex get married that'll fix it as if marriage is going to fix whatever disordered sexuality you have it'll all be better when you get married the implication clearly in this kind of thinking is that getting married kind of is automatic in terms of making it healthy, holy, and happy. It'll just happen when you get there. Now, that's pretty much what I heard or at least thought when I was growing up in church. One thing was established for reasons that are very, very good. What we all kind of agreed upon was that sex before marriage or outside of marriage is wrong for very good reasons that I believed then and still do. It's wrong. But the only thing after that we were pretty much given, at least that I was given, was this, wait till you're married. There's your relief. That's when it'll all be better. Because when you get married, it's just all going to be there waiting for you. This big old thing of healthy, holy, happy sexuality is just sitting there. You take one step and you are there. It's automatic. So there I was. A fairly normal, reasonably healthy, 18 to 20-year-old young man waiting. Now, what we're told about reasonably healthy 18 to 20-year-old young men is that they think about sex approximately every seven seconds. Did you know that people do studies on things like this? Actually, we talked about this at our staff meeting on Wednesday, and I knew about this study. I didn't know how many seconds it was, and so I kind of did a poll. And somebody said 28 seconds, somebody said 15 seconds. Most of the people said seven. So I'm figuring that's what the poll actually was. How do they do that? Anyway, it doesn't matter. Every seven seconds is what we landed on. That's what everybody says. Now, just for your own comfort and confidence in me as your pastor, see, I want you to know, I'm serious about this, that I was far more advanced spiritually than most of my peers. Seven seconds, I could do ten easy. Serious. You know, seriously, you think about football for about three or four, and then you think about cars. in your back. Sometimes, sometimes, true story, this is true, I'm telling you, I could sometimes do 14 seconds, which is double the average, so I hope you feel better. So there I was, 18 to 21-year-old guy, every 10 to 14 seconds, saying to myself, wait till you're married, wait till you're married, wait till you're married, wait till you're married. Then I met Bonnie. And when we got serious in our relationship, and it looked like this was going to turn into a possible marriage, we did something very important. Actually, something that I highly recommend, invite you into. We covenanted together as a young man and a young woman that we will wait till we get married. We'll wait till we get married. We'll wait till we get married. And we did. Then finally, we got married. And on the altar, she was very calm and very excited about getting married. I was hyperventilating. Why do we have to do this? But guess what we discovered? What we discovered was that marriage didn't automatically, like a magic wand, make it healthy, holy, happy. It didn't. It was very disturbing. It didn't automatically bring order to what was disordered. It didn't automatically fix what I thought sex could fix. one of the reasons I don't feel odd at all sharing that with you and not embarrassed at all is because I'm quite convinced that there are many people in this room right now probably more than we would expect who if honest would say in our marriage sex is legal in kind of a religious moral way but it isn't healthy and it isn't holy and it isn't happy because even in our marriage some among us would say it still feels like a taking thing, a manipulative and hurtful thing. And I'm here to tell you that if you experience sexuality as being a taking, manipulative, or hurtful thing long enough, it will become a non-existent thing. So here's the question of the day. Is there any way around this? Is there any healing for this? Is there such a thing as healthy, holy, happy? sexuality. Well, once again, I believe that a lot of our sexual struggle has more to do with core beliefs that we have about sex than sex. And the core belief that I want to dismantle today or, depending on where you are, to affirm today is this, that the physical expression of our sexuality is not designed by God, nor does it have the power to create intimacy between two people. It is designed by God to celebrate intimacy between two people that already exists in the safety and sanctity of covenantal marriage. Now that order that I gave that in is very significant. Rightly ordered sex. There's disordered and there's rightly ordered. Rightly ordered sex begins with, is rooted in, and flows from an already established emotional and spiritual intimacy that finds its safety and security in the covenant of marriage. Sexual intimacy, then, is designed by God to be the party, as it were, that celebrates those deeper realities. Those deeper realities, emotional and spiritual intimacy, already there in the covenants of marriage, in that context, sexual intimacy celebrates that reality. But even if you're married, if you continue to experience what we would call sexual intimacy or sexual activity without continuing and deepening emotional and spiritual intimacy, I'm going to make you a promise. I'm going to tell you something about yourself. Your sexual experience over time will become less and less and less fulfilling. You know why? Because the design of God in sex, it's how we're wired by Him, by our Creator. The design of God in our sexuality is to celebrate what's already there, not to try to create what isn't there. So if this gets out of order, and you're trying to use your sex to get intimacy, rather than celebrate the intimacy sexually disordered, even though you may be married. To really get to this, I'm going to back up and do some other teaching, and then we'll unpack this a little bit more as we go along. Wherever it is that people got the idea that human sexuality is dirty, vile, or unspeakable, They didn't get it from the Word of God. For while the Word of God repeatedly warns against the dangers of sexuality defiled, the Word of God also repeatedly speaks of and celebrates the joy of sexual love between a husband and a wife. A number of places we can go to see that illustrated. The Song of Solomon actually is quite graphic in its description of sexual intimacy. An interesting passage in Genesis 26, verse 8, is one of my favorites. it speaks of Isaac who was sporting with his wife, Rebecca. The word sporting there is the operative word. It kind of gives the impression of some sort of athletic event. Well, in some context, in some way, I suppose it was, but you just need to know they weren't playing badminton. No, this was a reference. Isaac sporting with his wife, Rebecca, is making a reference to the kind of sex in the context of marriage that is playful, that is fun, that is energetic, that is altogether holy and wonderful. Hebrews 13 verse 4 says, let the marriage bed be undefiled. Now that verse speaks of two things. Number one, that sex in the context of the marriage bed is undefiled, meaning it's a good thing. But number two, it also means this, that you should let the marriage bed continue to be that way. So keep it that way, undefiled. One man, one woman, no one else alive. It speaks of exclusiveness. And it's that exclusiveness that protects the sanctity and, quite frankly, the joy of this expression. Proverbs 5 may be among the best places to get a snapshot of healthy sexuality and the exclusiveness that healthy sexuality requires. In verse 15, it says this, Drink water from your own cistern and draw water from your own well. That obviously speaks of exclusiveness, of fidelity. Should your springs be dispersed and streams of water poured into the street, may it never be. Let this be yours alone and not with strangers with you. Rejoice in the spouse of your youth. As a loving hind and a graceful doe, be exhilarated always with each other's love. Two things about those expressions of sexuality. Number one, they are exclusive. One man, one woman, no one else allowed inside of this. Number two, they are absolutely, altogether, exhilarating, thrilling. Now, at the risk of being too graphic, let me state frankly what the physical expression of sexuality is. I'm borrowing this from Larry Crabb in his book entitled Men and Women. He says it this way. Physical expression of our sexuality is this. Two people physically approaching one another, one of whom fully opens to the other. The other entering and fully discharging himself into the other person. Pretty graphic. Now, whatever else that definition speaks to, it speaks to this. an absolute abandonment of one person to another. And while that kind of abandonment, that kind of opening up and entering in at that kind of level is wonderfully exhilarating, it is also exceedingly vulnerable. And for some people, incredibly frightening. Which means this, that if that kind of abandonment takes place in any context other than what is safe, exclusive, covenantal. And by the way, the covenantal dynamic, the covenantal marriage dynamic, is what makes this physical expression safe and exclusive. And the sexual experience itself will eventually, and now what I emphasize here is eventually, you can have sex without this other kind of intimacy going on, or this kind of exclusivity going on. But eventually, even your sexual experience itself will be unfulfilling, disappointing, disillusioning, maybe even damaging. Because once again, more is involved in our sexuality than skin-touching skin. Our souls are involved, our spirits are involved, which is part of what explains the difficulty and the confusion people have around sexuality. It's just more involved than skin-to-skin. more if the kind of sexual abandonment or physical abandonment rather of opening up and entering in takes place in a context that is inconsistent with or separated from emotional and spiritual abandonment and that doesn't mean leaving what I mean by that is you may be physically entering in and opening up, you may be having sex, as it were, but if you are not emotionally entering in and opening up, if you are not spiritually entering in and opening up to the life of your spouse, then I'm going to tell you something else about your sexual experience. Over time, your sexual experience will be unfulfilling, disappointing, disillusioning, maybe even damaging, and I am quite convinced that I am describing some marriages in this room right now. Why? Here's why, because the physical expression of our sexuality was not designed by God, nor does it have the power to create intimacy. Rather, it was designed by God to celebrate, illustrate, and manifest the intimacy that's already there. And when you have emotional entering in and opening up, spiritual entering in and opening up, the physical expression of that becomes incredibly exhilarating and wonderfully connected, what I would call rightly ordered. The right order, emotional and spiritual intimacy, sexuality celebrating that. Now, let me say all of that a different way. By inviting you into something that might sound a little weird on the front end, but just kind of work with me. So even if you don't buy what I'm trying to do here for a while, just kind of try it on and then after church go, man, he was nuts. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to consider seeing sex as symbol. Let me just tell you a little bit about symbol. Symbol or symbols are, as you know, something physical, tangible, real, that we can see and touch that speaks to something else that isn't quite so easy to see and touch, but actually is more significant and more real than the symbol. One of the symbols right now that's getting a lot of play and is coming to have great meaning for us right now because of what happened September 11th is the what? The flag. I mean, a year ago we looked at the flag, and we're all Americans. That's really nice. But now what's happening with our relationship with the flag is that there's all sorts of emotions that are being stirred up. Well, the truth is, all that flag is is a piece of cloth. All it is is three little colors, red, white, and blue, big deal. And that's all they are. Unless you understand the meaning of the flag, unless you understand that that symbol speaks to something far more profound. If, however, you do not understand or value what the symbol speaks to, then the symbol has no meaning at all for you. And it's reduced to its basic element, like cloth, or three colors right, right, and blue. Who cares about that? Okay, with that understanding of symbol, let's consider some Christian symbols that we're very familiar with. The cross of Jesus Christ, among the most powerful of Christian symbols. But if you don't understand the symbolism, if you don't understand the meaning of the cross, then all it is is a hunk of wood, right? But we know it's not what it's about. The cross, if we were to see one on someone's necklace, or if we see one standing here is there to remind us of and point us to something much more profound than a hunk of wood that got stuck together. It's something that points us to the source of our redemption. It's a picture of amazing grace for us. It's a reminder of our eternal hope and boundless love. For every time we look at the cross, one of the verses that goes through our mind, at least it goes through mine, is this. No greater love is any man than this. Then he laid down his life for a friend. And the cross stirs all those things up. But if you don't understand or value the deeper reality that the symbol speaks to, then the cross for you is just a piece of jewelry. It's been reduced to its most basic element, a piece of silver, a piece of art, a hunk of wood. And there might be two people even here who have a necklace and it's a little cross. And someone wears it, wears it because they like it. Why do you wear it? I don't know, I just like it. It's kind of cool. It's a nice piece of... My mother gave it to me. And that's fine. But somebody else wears it, and they wear it close to their heart as a necklace. And the reason they do is because it stirs up profound meaning. And they can't hardly look at it without weeping. Once a month, as a body of believers here at Open Door, we come around the table. Communion table. We celebrate the Lord's table. Talk about the Last Supper. And the meaning of the meal. Well, when you think about communion and the elements of communion, one of the things that strikes me about it, when I kind of break it down to its basic elements, the elements of communion couldn't be more basic. What are we talking about? When you come forward, you partake in two things. What? A cracker, not much more basic than that, and some juice or wine. We're working on the wine. No, it's just juice. But when you understand the meaning of the meal, Even the most basic of elements, like a cracker and some juice, become for us a holy thing. And it's not because the cracker itself is particularly holy, but that cracker and that juice speak to something that is profoundly holy. So much so that around these most basic of elements, like a cracker and juice, we have incredible encounters with God, don't we? Our communion services are incredible. If you've never come to one, come. As we come to the table and at the table, a cracker is what you'll get and some juice is what you'll dip it in and people weep as they walk by. But all it is is a cracker. I know. But it speaks to something more. Imagine for a moment this ludicrous scene at communion. Someone coming to the table who doesn't understand the meaning of the meal but they heard me say something about a meal, a supper. They heard something about that, and then they get to the table, and they're kind of ticked off, because when they heard meal, supper, they were expecting a meal. They were expecting supper. I mean, you said it was a meal. So there he is, grabbing fistfuls of crackers. I mean, I know this is bizarre. I'm hungry. You said it was a meal? I'm going to eat. And he picks up the goblet. You know? Now, after we tackled that guy, we would very gently say to him, what are you doing? And then after that we would say, you know you don't get it. These crackers aren't the meal. They aren't the whole meal. These crackers this cracker and this juice is designed to just be a taste of a much bigger a much better a much richer meal and people who understand the symbol understand that and they taste the cracker and it tastes good and they taste the juice and it tastes good. But they're not looking to that, to those elements to be what fills them. In fact, they point to something much more profound. And we encourage people. So as you take the crackling, as you experience the wine, let it remind you that you need to be eating off the one who is the bread and you need to be drinking from the one who is the real wine. And when you're eating the one who is the bread and when you're drinking the one who is the wine, all of a sudden this is incredible. This is incredible. It's such a gift, the communion. I just get chills thinking about it. as bizarre as it might seem to you on the front end I would have you see the physical expression of our sexuality that way sex as symbol okay you need some work let me help you with it as a symbol if I'm right about it being a symbol it's a pretty good one I said the cracker was pretty basic well if sexuality is a symbol it's better than a cracker what you think? I do but here's the really good news as delightful exhilarating and joyful as the physical expression of our sexuality can be the design of God in that joyful, delightful exhilarating experience is to actually be pointing to something even more joyful more delightful and more fulfilling and that's this two human beings who are beginning by the grace of God to exercise the kind of faith and courage required to enter in and open up to each other emotionally and spiritually and in that entering in and opening up to each other experiencing one of the most exhilarating fulfilling joy filled experiences known to human beings intimacy to know and to be known by another human being. Now, think about this. To know and to be known emotionally and spiritually, to enter into someone's life and open up to someone's life emotionally or spiritually, like sex, in terms of opening up and entering in, sexually can be very frightening. I mean, let's look at both of those things. Sexually, it can be in one of the struggles sometimes in a marriage. It's kind of frightening to open up. It's kind of scary. Some people have a hard time entering in. Others have a hard time opening up sexually. Okay? And many of you can relate to that. You know what that feels like. And you've had to kind of work through that and wonder what that's about. And in the context of safety and security and authentic love, people can work that out. It's gentle. It's wonderful. And they're struggling. You work it out. You figure it out gently and waiting and building even more trust. And it's so important that that happens in that covenant. Because that's where it's safe. And that's where we can do it wrong and learn. But if that's hard, difficult to do that sexually. Anybody here give testimony to the fact that it's kind of difficult to do that emotionally too? To enter into someone's life, to open up to someone's life and show them the depths of your soul? Anybody scared about that? More than that. And that's why I called on the grace of God. By the grace of God, men and women begin to have the courage to go, I'm going to show you who I really am, and I'm going to enter into your life and be who I really am, and I'm going to run the risk of being hurt and embarrassed when I do. But every once in a while, you have someone who, when you enter in, they open up, and when you open up, they enter in, and oh my goodness, you experience the most incredible thing that's called intimacy with another human being. Back to the symbol thing. like all symbols. If you do not understand or value the deeper reality behind the symbol that the symbol speaks to, then the symbol itself, again, gets reduced to its basic elements. I said this already. If you don't understand the meaning behind the cross, then all the cross is to you is a piece of jewelry, a hunk of wood. If you don't understand the deeper meaning behind the real meaning of communion, then all it is is a cracker to you. That's a cracker, big deal. And if you do not understand what sex is really all about, the deeper meaning of the sexual expression, then sex to you is just sex. Remember the video we showed some months ago? It was the very beginning of our series on this, of these teenagers in Atlanta and all that stuff. I'm not going to go into that. But I remember this one girl who said exactly that. 16-year-old kid. She goes, sex is just sex. It's just like saying hi. Remember? and in that tragic ignorance of how our sexuality is connected to our spirituality and to our souls and to our spirits and to our emotions and how God has created a place for that to be wonderfully expressed without understanding that we as a culture have become the sexual equivalent of the guy who gorges himself on crackers at communion just can't get enough acting like this sexual thing is the whole deal and the reason he or she does is because he didn't understand the meaning of the meal because he thought that was the whole meal we live in a culture beloved I don't need to tell you this we know this quite well that says sex is the ultimate thing what I'm trying to say this morning is that sex is not the ultimate thing that sex is a symbol of the ultimate thing. The ultimate thing is when two human beings begin by the grace of God to exercise the kind of faith and courage required to enter in emotionally and spiritually, to open up emotionally and spiritually, and to by that entering in and opening up begin to taste and know one of the most exhilarating, fulfilling, joy-filled experiences known to human beings' intimacy. An experience, by the way, that can be deeply and richly experienced, and here's the really good news, by everyone. See, this talk till now is, I'm kind of talking to married people and sexuality being expressed in the covenant of marriage. What I'm talking about, when I say sex is not the ultimate, the ultimate is that everybody can get in on that. married or not. Several weeks ago at the beginning of the series, I spoke to this, the whole thing of singleness and where it all fits in. There's a broader understanding of what sexuality is and you need to get that. I want to reconnect all that right now because this is, I think, an important place. And I also think it's extremely important that we understand these things, be we married or single. Several weeks ago, I said it this way, That the physical expression of our sexuality is only one of the flowers that makes up the bouquet of what our sexuality entails. In other words, created by God as a man, I have gender. So do you. My gender is male. I am masculine. Your gender may be female. You are feminine. One way to express my masculinity, our sexuality, is physically. But it's not the only way. Indeed, it's not the primary way. In fact, what we established this morning is it's certainly not the ultimate way. See, we express our sexuality, that is, our masculinity or our femininity, in a whole host of ways. We express our masculinity, our femininity, and how we see the world, and how we respond to and enter into life. We express it in our creativity, but most profoundly, as again established this morning, We express it and experience it in intimacy. When with another human being, I begin to open up. I learn to enter in. I take the incredible risk of sharing the deepest secret of my soul. And maybe one time I did that and I was embarrassed and I was humiliated. And I walked away and I tried to cover up my heart again. But maybe one day I had come with a friend to a point where I could share with them the deepest things of my heart. And instead of shutting me out, they opened up. And I was able to enter in. And then they opened up and I entered in. And there you were with another human being naked, emotionally naked, but not ashamed. And it took your breath away. Beloved, get the message. The physical expression of our sexuality is one of the flowers that makes up the bouquet of what our masculinity and our femininity fully entails, of what our humanity fully entails, which means this, that it is entirely possible to be a very healthy, well-balanced, fully alive and present to your sexuality, man or woman, and not be expressing it physically. In fact, I'll press it hard the other way. If you don't, as a man or a woman, develop at significant levels other dimensions of your sexuality, like creativity, personality, integrity, and ultimately intimacy, here's the bad news for you. you will probably never enter into healthy, holy, happy sexuality because you're disordered. See, the only way to really experience the fullness of the physical expression of sexuality is when, in a rightly ordered way, you're experiencing the fullness of emotional entering in and opening up, spiritual entering in and opening up. And in either case, the sexual expression is not the ultimate. That's the ultimate. The emotional and spiritual. Richard Foster pulls it together, I think, well when he says this. To be sure, genital sex is a part of the total picture. But human sexuality is a far larger reality than merely intercourse. Human sexuality has many aspects, only one of which is the physical expression. When single persons, for instance, begin to nurture and cultivate the many other aspects of their masculinity and femininity, the physical drives often come into perspective. In fact, what we call sexual needs are not really needs at all, but wants. The body needs food. That's a need. It needs air and water. No one, however, has yet died from lack of physical sex. To understand this can be tremendously liberating, especially for singles. They are not half people, unfulfilled and incomplete. They do not need the physical expression of sex to experience wholeness in their masculinity or femininity, in their humanity. Unless, and this is my postscript on that, they believe the lie that the one flower is the whole bouquet. And if you believe that the one flower is the whole bouquet, you're going to be grabbing at that flower all the time and it will never be enough. But that's not about a biological urge. It has nothing to do with that. Let me pull all of this together and wrap it up with a word from the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 7. Where Paul, primarily speaking here to marrieds, says this. And it may be a word you're familiar with. He says, stop depriving one another. Now some interpret that passage short-sightedly, I believe. And the reason I believe they interpret it short-sightedly is because they have a very narrow view of sexuality. Because maybe their view of sexuality is only this physical expression. And so they look at that passage where Paul says to married people, stop depriving each other, and speaking exclusively to physical sex. As if what Paul's saying there is only this, stop depriving each other of sex. I command you, start having sex. Do it. You know, he's a very romantic guy, Paul. Well, what I believe he's saying is that, but far more than that. To married people, he's saying stop depriving each other of each other. Physically? Sure, but that's not the primary way. much more. Stop depriving each other emotionally of entering in and opening up. Stop depriving each other spiritually of entering into each other's lives and opening up. Stop building and living behind your walls of protection. Stop walking away from each other. Stop hiding your heart from each other. Stop depriving each other of each other. Press past your fear and begin to enter in. Dare to open up emotionally and spiritually where you might together experience one of the most exhilarating, fulfilling, joy-filled experiences known to human beings, intimacy. But as I say all that, can you tell that that word that Paul is giving is not just for married people? It's for single people. It's for young people. It's for old people. It's for God's people. It's for people. And here's the word, people. Here's the word, community. Here's the word, church of the open door, as we anticipate going where we're going. Stop depriving each other from each other. Begin to be more and more a people who, by the grace of God, have the courage to enter in and open up. See, that's where all this winds up for me and becomes the word as we prepare ourselves for where it is we're going. I do believe that God is calling us to be a people, to be a people in this world, to be a people in the community to which we are about to go, who have the courage and the grace to open up, to enter in, sometimes by that being hurt, sometimes by that being scared, but sometimes experiencing in that the ultimate human experience, intimacy with God and man. and just imagine what it would feel like to be someone from the outside who was able to watch and then experience a people who with each other were not depriving each other of each other, who were opening up, who were entering in. It would be the closest taste they ever had to the very life of God, to the design of God for human beings. so stop depriving each other of each other final note as I close and I don't normally close this way I'm closing with this I hope you come back next week now I always hope you come back next week I don't normally close by saying that here's why I'm saying it because the fact is this that for some of you to authentically walk in the kinds of things I have spoken of this morning emotionally entering in and opening up and even sexually entering in and opening up. For you to do that would require for you some significant healing. For emotionally, you've been damaged. And when someone tries to enter into your life, you have such a wall. And it's not because you're this mean, nasty person, though, that's kind of what you show sometimes. It's because you're scared to death. You've been hurt before. And even in your marriage, there could be some sexual tension that makes it very hard for you to open up or enter in. And you just seem like such a cold person, and it's not that at all. It's far more that you're scared to death because you've been hurt and wounded there. The reason I want you to come back next week is we're going to do some things that will profoundly illustrate that healing really is possible for emotional damage, for sexual damage, that it really, really is possible. It can happen, and it can happen for you. Let's stand as we're dismissed. Father, I don't normally think of talks that at least began focusing on the issue of sexuality as being the gospel, but this is I stopped talking here. It just washed over me that this is the gospel. This is good news. that you are concerned with every aspect of our humanity. You have made us and you have formed us. Many of us in these arenas of our emotions and our spirituality and our sexuality have been damaged and are afraid. So I pray, Father, even in anticipation of next week and even things that you can do now, that there would be just this balm of healing that would come upon us. That it wouldn't have to wait until next week, that it would be happening even now. So that, Father, we would become more and more a people who, by the grace of God, are having more and more courage to enter in to the lives of other men and women and open up to the lives of other men and women, reflecting more and more the very character of God, the very life of God, the very gospel, the very good news about a liberating God that we preach. I pray these things be true among us and in abundance in Jesus name Amen Amen.
