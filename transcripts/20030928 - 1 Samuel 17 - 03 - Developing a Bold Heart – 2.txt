That clip is, as most of you know from the movie The Legend of Bagger Vance, which is a story about a man who lost his heart. Randolph Juneau was expected, when he was younger, to become the greatest golfer of all time. He had an amazing gift. He was a phenomenal golfer. Until he went to war where he saw and did things that wounded his heart, not knowing how to face his wound. Most of us don't. Not knowing how to find his heart. Most of us don't. He resigned himself to a life of avoidance, the kind of avoidance we spoke of last week in 1 Samuel 17 where we saw King Saul and the armies of the living God recognizing the presence of Goliath. They weren't in denial. They just hoped he would stay over there. Maybe we avoided. He resigned himself, did Juna, to a life of avoidance, to a mere existence symbolized in the drinking, the playing cards, the laughing with the boys, until the call. Amazingly, in this film clip, the call coming from a 10-year-old boy who still saw in this man something that he couldn't see in himself of original glory. A few weeks ago, we talked about how we are preoccupied with and we know well about original sin, but God created us with original glory. The whole story of the gospel is how the God of heaven sent his only son to recover the original glory with which he designed us. To recover our heart. This little boy came and spoke to him, calling out of him by reminding him of who he really was. Of reminding him of his heart. today we enter the third week of what we have been calling these days a journey of the heart using the life of David in 1st and 2nd Samuel as our guide the first stop in this journey last week was found in 1st Samuel 17 the story of David and Goliath where we began to discover and examine what it looks like to have a bold and courageous heart a bold and courageous heart as embodied in David, whose response to the Goliath presence in his life was a kind of defiant indignation. Verse 26, who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God? Who do you think you are? Goliath was his response. But we also began to discover and examine what it looks like to have lost heart as embodied in the war-weary soldiers of 1 Samuel. 17, whose response to the Goliath presence in their lives was to live in fear, was to cower and run, avoid the issue, hope it would just stay over there. So let's just not upset Goliath. Let's tippy-toe around Goliath. And every time they did that, and according to 1 Samuel 17, 16, They did that every day, several times a day, cowered in fear, recognized the problem, ran away from the problem. Every time they did that, they got a little smaller, they got a little weaker, and they felt a little more like cowards than they did the day before until they had what we call last week a Goliath-dominated imagination resulting in a Goliath sickness of the soul, the cure for which, at least in part, and this is not a magic wand, it's just the beginning, it's just the first step in recovering your heart, it's this, to remember your heart. To remember your deep heart. To remember your redeemed, washed, clean, alive to God, brave heart. To remember the things that some of you knew when you were David, when you were young. about giving yourself to something bigger than you, about believing God no matter what, about recognizing that, yes, Goliath is big, but God's just bigger. And when you begin to remember, you begin to recover your heart. But, as important as that is, in the process of developing a bold heart, of recovering a lost heart, it's not enough to remember. Today's talk's a little tougher. Because somewhere along the line, if you hope to recover your heart, if you hope to develop a bold heart, somewhere along the line, you have to act. You have to move. You have to go toward your Goliath. You have to face down your Goliath. But often, our ability to face down the Goliaths of our life begins with lions and bears. And sometimes Vikings and Packers and... Sorry. You know, that joke didn't work in any surface. I just don't. I'm going towards this Goliath. Anyway. Where's the lions and bears things come in? Verse 31. Let me set up verse 31 by reminding you. Verse 26, David expresses his indignation. Who is this uncircumcised Philistine? In verse 28, Eliab, David's brother, questions his heart. And we talked about Eliab last week and the evil of his heart. In verse 29, David does what you have to do with the Eliabs of your life. Turn from him. Ignore him. And after he turns from him, verse 29, it says that David said it again. What he said again was this. Who is this uncircumcised Philistine who defies the armies of the living God? Verse 31 now reads this way. when the words which David spoke were heard, they told them to Saul, and he sent for David. David said to Saul, let no man's heart fail, because their hearts had failed. They had lost heart. Let no man's heart be lost on account of this giant. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine. Then Saul said to David, you are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for you are but a youth while he has been a warrior from his youth. But David said to Saul, your servant was tending his father's sheep. And when a lion or a bear would come and take a lamb from the flock, which, by the way, happened quite commonly, I went out after him and attacked him and rescued it from his mouth. And when he rose up against me, I seized him by his beard and struck him and killed him. Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear. And this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them since he has taunted the armies of the living God. Here's the principle. This is a life principle bigger than that. a kingdom principle. It's this, bold hearts, the kinds that aren't intimidated by the Goliaths of life, the kinds of bold, the kind of bold hearts that even if they are intimidated by the Goliaths of their lives, instinctively move toward the Goliaths of their lives, are things of everyday life, often when no one is looking, and no one would know if you did it or not. Let me say it a different way. You will instinctively know how to deal with the Goliaths of your life if you've been dealing with the lions and the bears of your life all along the way. David was tending sheep by himself. No one there to see him or watch him. And when a lion or a bear came along, and as I said a moment ago, they did, it didn't matter if it was a lion or a bear. Lions and bears are part of the deal. If you're a shepherd, lions and bears come with the territory. Lions and bears are just part of life as a shepherd. Here's the deal for you and me. All of us have lions and bears. They come with the territory. They're just part of life. And when they came to David, even when he was very young, and that's important because it started when he was very young, he began to develop then a way of handling lions and bears. Verse 35, here's how he handled them. He went after them. He went toward them. He engaged them. And every time he did that, something began to be formed in him even when he was young. Here's what was being formed. His heart grew a little bigger. Every time he went toward it, his heart grew a little bolder, his spirit grew a little bigger, his faith grew a little stronger. So that by the time he came to Goliath, when he faced Goliath, all he did with Goliath was what he had always done. He went after it. It had become the way he did his life. some people would look at David's response to Goliath here and kind of read into it a kind of cockiness and well I'm sure that David had some of that in fact we're going to talk somewhere along the line about a proud heart and how David might have struggled with that I don't think it's just cockiness here that is going after Goliath because David believed that when he was doing the right thing when he was doing the noble thing like defending a sheep that couldn't defend itself And by the way, that's the symbolism of this story. And it really needs to be captured. And in your own mind, you can go to a variety of places. But the picture here is a flock of sheep. Whatever sheep are, they aren't very strong. They aren't very tough. They have no capacity to defend themselves. And the principle is this. When the lion or the bear comes to take something that can't defend itself, that can't protect itself, and you intervene, helping people who can't help themselves, who can't defend themselves, moving toward the poor, moving toward the downtrodden, You need to know something. It's what David knew. God's with you when you do that. When you confront some giant that would enslave the people of God, the armies of God, in the analogy, in the story, the armies of God are God's people. It would be like a church. And when somebody stands up and says, we're going to fight, we're going to go after the lions and the bears that have the potential to enslave the people of God, the people who do that need to know something. When you do that, God's with you. That's why he said in verse 37, the Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from this Goliath as well because God's with me, said David, when I'm doing the right thing, when I'm doing the kingdom thing, when we're fighting for people who can't fight for themselves. So I'm going to throw this stone as hard as I can. but what if he doesn't is i think a good question of this story what if he doesn't do what what if he doesn't deliver me i mean it really is one of the questions it's one of the things we talked about at message team this story is very powerful in its symbolism but the fact is this some of you have thrown stones at the goliaths of your life and they didn't go down in fact you didn't even hit the stupid thing. All you did was make it mad. So what do you do if the Goliath doesn't fall down, if the bear turns around and eats you for lunch instead of the sheep? Well, that question is not answered in this story. It's answered, I think, in terms of spirit, in terms of what you're supposed to do in places like Daniel 3, verse 17. Daniel 3, 17, we meet three people, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who were facing a Goliath of their own, different name, Nebuchadnezzar, a great king, who had forced all of his people to bow down to him as if he were a god. Three wouldn't do it, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He said to them, if you don't bow down to me, you get thrown into the fiery furnace. Their response was this. Our God can deliver us from this fiery furnace. Then they got a little more faith. Not only that, our God will. That sounds like David. The same God who delivered me from the power of the paw of the lion and the bear will deliver me. Our God can deliver us from the furnace. Our God will deliver us from the furnace. But even if he doesn't, said Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, we still ain't bowing down to you. I'm still going after the bear. I'm still going after the lion. I'm still throwing my rock at that giant. Even if he wins, I'm still doing it. And every time you do that, your heart gets a little bolder, your spirit gets a little bigger, and your faith gets a little stronger. Here's the deal. All of us have lions and bears. It comes with the territory. It's part of life. I don't care how old you are. I don't care how young you are. In fact, it's best that you learn how to face your lions and bears when you're young, when you're really, really young. One of the greatest joys of my life and my wife's life right now are the four kids we have. We just love these kids, and we're having probably more fun now than we ever have in our whole lives. But I have these memories in my mind. They play like movies in my mind. Our youngest is now a junior in college, I remember when these four kids went to kindergarten. I remember the first day of kindergarten. I don't want to go. And I would say, you have to go. No, I wouldn't. I would say, you're going to kindergarten. Kindergarten was huge. Kindergarten was scary. I remember when I was helping our, Bonnie and I were helping all four of our kids go to kindergarten that first day. It was like, get them off. They're scared. They're going to be fine. You're going to be fine. Just go. You got to go. And we would walk away, and I would think, boy, I wish kindergarten was the only thing I was facing today. Because I got Goliaths. You know how you learn to do the Goliaths? By doing the kindergartens. You've got to go toward it. Sounds like a dumb illustration. I'm telling you, this is part of everyday life. And there's junior high. It's another Goliath. Except in our case, by the time our kids got to junior high, our kids were someone else's bear. So there's a whole different illustration there. oldest son Caleb is a senior this year and I did this with both Chris and Caleb before the football stuff began I just went out with him alone and talked to him and talked to him about their hearts and how much I was proud of him and call things out of their hearts and when I talked to Caleb one of the things he's a senior this year and so that's a pretty special thing, and I had a lot of memories in my mind of these four years for Caleb and some of the things that he had to face. And I had a memory of something that Caleb and I had done just before his freshman year. He was going into college, but he was going to play football, and we went golfing, just the two of us, just a day or so before he was supposed to report to camp. And off of every tee, I'll never forget, and we still talk about it, off of every tee, he hit the ball, and then he would turn around and walk, and I would go to the tee, and as we passed each other, after every hole, you would say, I'm going to get killed. I'm going to get, nine holes later, nine holes, I'm going to get killed. Like, stop and I'd go, Caleb, you don t have to play. Do you want to play? Yeah, I want play, but I'm going t get killed. You know what? I like football, but I don't care about football. I don t care. It isn t about how well he did, and he does well. It's not about that. You know what I care about? You know what I admire about him? He faces lions. He faces bears. And every time you do that, I'm here to tell you, every single time, whether it's kindergarten, or going to football, or going to school, or doing your assignment, every time you do that, your heart gets a little bolder, your spirit gets a little bigger, your faith gets a little stronger. So when the Goliaths of your life show up, you know what to do. You know what you do? Well, I don't know if I'm going to beat him or not, but here's what you do with Goliath. You go toward him. Because that's how you do life. So what's your lion? What's your bear? I mean, it just could be anything. I hope your mind goes off into directions that would go way beyond what I'm going to do. It could be as simple as a difficult decision you're facing, and you don't want to have to face it, and you don't even want to have to think about it, and you hope it just goes away. Or you can say, I'm going after that pair. It could be a project in school or a project at work, and it's hard and it's difficult and it feels overwhelming, and you just like to ignore it. Or you can say in one way or another, I'm going after that pair. I mean, these things can be simple. It can be like a phone call you don't want to make because you're afraid you're going to get a no. Or you're going to have to say something maybe a little difficult where you maybe disagree with someone. Oh, my. And you can procrastinate, and you can lose three nights sleep, or you can say, I'm going after that bear. And every time you do it, you get a little bigger, and every time you don't, you get a little smaller. Could be bigger than phone calls and projects. Could be a parenting challenge you're facing. Could be that one of your kids right now is going in a direction that you know is hurting him or her. And if not now, it's going to hurt him bad. But it's going to take energy, and it's going to take time for you to confront this. and you're tempted to ignore it and tippy-toe around it. You're tempted to pray and ask God to fix it by remote control. I think a lot of us do that. Or you could say, I'm going after that bear, believing that God will be with me when I do. Think God's with you when you say, I'm going after my kids. Because it's the right thing to do. So you pick up your five stones of your meager parenting skills. One of the things I love about the symbol of David's stones is that these stones really were incompetent. They were not what you need to beat the giant. It's just all he had. So when you pick up the five stones of what you think are your meager parenting skills, where you walk away after you deal with your kid and you go, I didn't see it right, I didn't see it well, you take your stones and you throw them as hard as you can. I don't mean throw stones at your kids. That's a whole different thing. This is metaphor here. and every time you wade into that hard thing your heart gets a little bolder, your spirit gets a little bigger, your faith gets a little stronger every time you don't you get a little smaller, you get a little weaker last Sunday morning we were in the prayer room just before the service with the altar team, prayer people, with the worship team and we were affected that weekend by the enormity of what we were trying to do and it's the same thing we're trying to do this week to recover and reclaim people's hearts. And we were talking about it and in some cases we were going to walk out into a service where the aim for some was not just to recover your heart but to resurrect your heart because your hearts are dead and you're lost and you have no knowledge of God whatsoever in your original glory, none at all. So how do you do that? how do you raise people's hearts from the dead how do you recover people's hearts who've lost their hearts well you throw you throw stones at them what are our stones and we talk with the worship team well we got some songs five aren't they aren't they scary and i gotta talk and quite frankly it doesn't feel like much against some of the lostness of your heart the the despair in some of your hearts oh we're gonna fix it today no but here's the deal you know what we're gonna do we're going to go out there believing that recovering people's hearts is something God really cares about. We're going to go out there. I told the worship team. So you go out there and you throw your stones as hard as you can. Just sing them as best as you can. And I'm going to do my talk and whatever the talk is is what the talk is. But I'm going to throw it as hard as I can. And we're just going to see what God takes and does with our stones to recover people's hearts and raise them from the dead. In that service we were praying because on Saturday night we had a bunch of glitches. You've been here when we've had glitches, haven't you? Nah, probably not. yeah last saturday not not last night but a week ago saturday we had a video a short video didn't have sound halfway through halfway through the worship we realized that the organ wasn't working and nobody out here probably even cared or noticed but you know everybody up here is going oh it's ruined it's terrible and i remember telling the worship team i was i i told them you know what in the in the story you know david picked up the stones he threw them as hard as he could god did this miracle by taking a stone that shouldn't do anything but he gave the supernatural energy to bring it down. Do you think David on the way to Goliath fell down at all? Maybe tripped over a rock and fell down before he? Well, we don't know. It's not in a text. You know why it's not in a text? It doesn't matter if the video didn't work, if the organ didn't work. Throw your stone as hard as you can. And if we're fighting for people's hearts, God will bring the giant down and raise up people's hearts. By the way, this is huge. This is kind of revealed to us in the text in verse 42. It says this, when the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained David, for he was but a youth and ruddy and handsome in appearance. And the Philistine said to David, am I a dog that you come to me with sticks? And the Philistine cursed David by his God. This is the trash talk I was talking about last week. And the Philistine also said to David, come to me and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the field. Then David said to the Philistine, you come to me with sword and spear and javelin. And they're very scary. And I have stones. That's not what he said. He did have stones, but here's what he said. I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, who is the God of the armies of Israel. David threw his stones as hard as he could. I'm throwing my stone this morning as hard as I can. Some of you in your parenting need to throw your stone as hard as you can, but my confidence is not in the talk. It's not in the songs. It's not in my saying it perfect to my kids. The confidence is in this, that God is with you when you do the right thing, When you go toward your lion, when you go toward your bear, God is with you, and take the stone you have and throw it as hard as you can. Say amen, somebody. I don't usually do that. I just don't like doing that. Wednesday night we met with and commissioned some of our adult youth leaders. Al Shuck, our youth guy, asked me to come and be part of that and pray for these, I don't know, 40, 50 adults in our church who said we want to work with the high school and junior high kids. And as we were there together and I was hearing Al talk to them and them talk around the circle, one of the things that dawned on me was that they all bring different giftings to what they're doing just because of who they are. But they're all a little bit also intimidated. I mean, working with high school kids can be a scary thing, and it's not that the kids are so scary themselves, though sometimes they are. But it's more about the kids in our church and in our culture right now are in a kind of a scary place. We had a shooting right here in town at McCorry High School this week. And some of our kids in high school are facing things and dealing with levels of despair in themselves and even in some of their friends and levels of rage and other things that are things that you and I, when we were that age, weren't dealing with, weren't afraid of getting shot when we went to school. And some of these volunteers wanting to work with these high school kids are feeling a little bit out of their element, a little bit out of their league, and one of the things that Al said was this. One thing I know about everybody in this circle, one thing I know you have, whatever gift you have or don't have, the one thing I know about everyone here is this. You love these kids. So when I got up and talked to them, I talked about the stones that they had in their hand. And the one stone I knew they had, because Al said it and I believed it, was this. You love these kids. I don't know what else you got. I don't know what else you got in your little satchel. But you take that stone of loving these kids, and you throw it as hard as you can, And I'm here to tell you, when you throw that stone, God's with you. Amen. And every time you do that, even though you're a little scared to come up, this won't do any good, this won't have any effect, every time you're tempted to hear that it won't do any good, and you do it anyway, your heart gets a little bolder, and your spirit gets a little bigger, and your faith gets a little stronger. A little word about Saul's armor and the five smooth stones. Verse 38 and 39. It says this, Then David clothed David with his garments and put a bronze helmet on his head and clothed him with armor. And David girded his sword over his armor, and David tried to walk. He couldn't walk, for he had not tested them. So David said to Saul, I cannot go with these, for I have not tested them. and David took them off, took off Saul's armor. And he took his stick in his hand and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook and put them in the shepherd's bag, which he had even in his pouch and his sling was in his hand and he approached the Philistine that way. Nothing wrong with Saul's armor. It just wasn't David's. It didn't fit him. imagine just for a minute the courage it took to take it off to say i mean yeah i don't know to say no thanks to the king it isn't me when i thought of that scene and tried to make it real what dawned on me is that if you're going to do that you need to know who you are whoa stop right there because to know who you are will for some of you represent the need and speak to the need for a whole other journey that some of you need to begin because some of you have no idea who you are. And you're always looking for somebody else's voice to tell you what to do and what to think. See, to do this, take off Saul's armor and go, it doesn't me, it isn't me, it doesn't fit me. You need to know me. You need to understand your own way. You need to have a knowledge of your own heart. You'd have to accept the gift that God gave you to give and not be in envy of everybody else's gift and just take the gift God gave you to give and give it. Throw it. Just stick with the analogy. Talked to Al Shuck on Wednesday. Al, again, being the pastor of our youth ministry is Wednesday night and he shared with me, we were talking about this story and he shared with me, he says, Dave, you know, years ago when I first came here to open door and began to get involved in the youth ministry and then took over as the head of it, there was a guy in our church who pulled me aside and asked me to come over for prayer, and he told me he had a word for me, and the word was this. It was right out of this verse. Dave, I've never forgotten it. It set the whole ministry that I'm in here in this certain direction. He said, Al, you can't wear Saul's armor. You can't do youth ministry someone else's way. You got to take off the ministry, the armor of our previous youth pastor. You've got to take off the armor of what all the experts tell you youth ministry is supposed to look like. And what you've got to do, Al, is find out what it is that pulses through your heart and do your heart. And do it your way from your heart. And that means a journey. It means you've got to have some work to do. Because that means you've got to find your way. And you have to find your heart. And you have to find your gift. And you have to find your own swing. You know, the truth is, Al is, I'm just using him as an illustration. I don't talk about Al. I don't talk about our staff people. But I was with those kids this week. And Al's got a lot of stones in his little bag. But the biggest stone he's got is he really loves these kids. I remember Al. He was a student at Northwestern College. Came into my office when he was a student with a guy named Tom Graske, who eventually became the head of our elder board. These were college kids, and they were going to fix the world. I just remember it. And they would be embarrassed. But they were just so full of energy. They were Davids. They were just Davids. But the one stone, whatever other stones Al had in his bag, is he loved those kids. And you know what he has been doing for I don't know how many years he's been here, but for every year he's been here, he's been throwing that stone as hard as he can. and our kids are in really good hands. But knowing who you are and knowing your own swing is a real significant issue. And thinking it's somewhere else is a real significant problem. So many of us in the church are trying to be like somebody else or trying to do it like someone else. Even churches do that. Try to figure out, be like some other church. so many of us are trying to find out from someone else what we ought to think and what we ought to do and how we ought to feel I think people come to church sometimes they go to counseling and they expect of the pastor they expect of the counselor someone who will tell them what I ought to think tell me what I ought to think tell me what I ought to do what should I do tell me how I ought to feel here's what I hope I hope when you come here you hear truth and I hope you get some guidance but this is your journey this is your journey and these are your gifts and you need to discover them and you need to throw them and you need to find your own swing the one that's unique to you it's written on your heart just start paying attention to your desires your desires are in your heart but what if you've lost your heart that's why we have to fight for it what if what if you have a wounded heart what if you're like the war weary ones in 1st Samuel 17. Well, here's the deal about that. I really do believe that of all the Goliaths you will ever face in your life, facing the wound of your heart and not avoiding it or embracing it, facing the wound of your heart that caused you to lose heart in the first place, may be the biggest, most frightening Goliath of all. Now, the good news is this. You can do it. You can face that bear. You can move toward that Goliath, and God will help you because he is very, very interested in you recovering your heart. but you're going to have to go toward it you cannot ignore it avoid it or do what some do with their wound embrace it allowing it to become part of their identity you have to come out of the shadows quit hiding quit blaming choose life and throw your stone you're a stone of truth maybe it is a stone of repentance you need to throw that would repent of all the ways you've hidden and blamed maybe it's a stone of forgiveness you need to throw and you need to throw it as hard as you can let me wrap up with this another video clip actually from that same movie that I showed at the beginning the legend of Bagger Vance. This is going to pick up the action near the end. Juna has been facing his wound. He has been finding his swing, which is a symbol of finding his heart. I told you a couple weeks ago, this movie is not about golf. It's about finding your heart. When at the worst possible moment of the tournament, he loses his heart again. By the way, that's how it happens quite often. You kind of begin to, You know, you go to church and you'll feel this thing and it'll be going well for a while. And then at what feels like at the worst possible moment in the tournament in your life, you'll lose it again. He misses a shot, then he misses another shot. It feels like everything is unraveling. And right at that moment, and by the way, this is when this is going to happen too, just when you're not doing well, when you're feeling kind of vulnerable to despair again, right then, June is revisited by his wounds. The wounds that took him out in the first place. The wounds that are still the Goliath of his life. It's one of those crisis moments. I told you the bold hearts are formed at the crisis, the everyday crisis moments of everyday life. And in this scene we're going to show you, it's a crisis moment for Juna where he's going to have to decide, am I going to face this thing? Thus, allowing my heart to get bigger, my spirit to get bolder, my faith to get stronger, or am I going to do what I've done in the past, shrink in fear? Thus, my heart getting smaller, my spirit getting weaker. The good news for Juna in this particular scene is this. In this scene, he's not alone. He has a guide. His name is Bagger Vance. That's the name of the movie, Bagger Vance. But what you need to understand about Bagger Vance, played by Will Smith, is that he is in this movie a symbol of the Holy Spirit. And among the things the Holy Spirit does is this. He comes alongside to help. He comes alongside to help us find our way. He comes alongside to help us find our heart. I want you to bow your heads. I want to speak some things over you while you're in a spirit of prayer. Just you by yourself. I know you're in a big crowd of people. It feels weird to do. You can do it. I just want to speak some things over you start with a question what's your Goliath? I know you have one ain't no soul on God's green earth thank God a burden to carry but you've been carrying this one maybe you've been avoiding this one long enough it's time to lay it down it's time to face it down it's time to come out of the shadows to quit hiding and to go toward this thing and as you do I'm here to tell you something that the Lord the same Lord who delivered David from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver you from this Philistine as well. So pick up your five smooth stones. Give it everything you've got. Throw them as hard as you can, knowing that every time you do that, Even in small ways, your heart will get a little bolder, your spirit will get a little stronger, and your faith will get a little bigger. Father, you know the lions and the bears and the Goliaths that your people, the people in this room, are facing today. and you know well how some of them are maybe capable of nothing right now but a very small step just a very toward a new way of doing life out of the avoiding and the hiding others are ready for more I pray in Jesus name that we in this particular stop that we've been making for these two weeks on this journey of the heart around developing a bold heart and recognizing how some of us have lost heart, that your spirit would be strong in the call. Lord, in that little crazy clip, it was a 10-year-old boy. It's not a 10-year-old boy this time. This is you talking to us, calling us out. to face down our lions and our bears and our Goliaths, knowing that even though all we got is five stones, we don't come in the power of the stones. We come in the name of the Lord God, who delivered us from the law of the lion and the bear, and he will deliver us from this as well. And in faith, we throw our stones. Make us a people marked by that kind of living. I pray it in your name. I pray for courage and I pray for protection as men and women in here obey this word, respond to this word by facing down some things. I pray this week, I pray into this week, I pray into this week for protection, for boldness, for hearts getting bolder, for spirits getting bigger, And for faith getting stronger. I pray it in your name. Amen. Amen.
