Last week, I called it the hardest work that some of you will ever do, the longest journey that some of you will ever take, this coming to a place of ascribing the appropriate weight to our fathers and our mothers and the influence they've had on us, which is at the root of what it actually means to honor your father and your mother, to come to a place where you can ascribe the appropriate weight by pressing through the extremes that all of us tend to, of either idealizing them on one hand or demonizing them on the other, a process of coming to this appropriate weight that is rarely without struggle or pain I called it the hardest work that some of you will ever do, the longest journey that some of you will ever take, requiring, among other things, at some point, the capacity to forgive, to release, in order that you might be free, no longer a slave to how they treated you to what they think of you, be it really good or really bad. Our text last week was Exodus chapter 20, verse 12. The text is familiar. Honor your father and mother that your days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord your God has given you. Paul called it the first commandment with a promise, and the promise is basically this, that if you figure out what it means to ascribe appropriate weight, which is what it means to honor your father and mother, and you do the work involved in that, the hardest work you'll ever do, the longest journey you'll ever take, it is entirely for your benefit that you do that work. And it's why today, as we've come to the table, I want to talk about forgiveness, particularly in the face of things hard to forgive because until we do, at least begin the journey, what I called it last week, is the journey of forgiveness toward forgiveness. It's not a magic wand. It's almost always a process. But until we at least begin that journey, we will continually be a slave. Brennan Manning, in his wonderful book we've referenced many times over the years, entitled Abba's Child, says it this way, that the summons to live as forgiven and forgiving people is a radically inclusive summons. It is addressed not only to the wife whose husband forgot their anniversary, but also to parents whose child was killed by a drunk driver, to the victims of slanderous lies, and to the mother in El Salvador whose daughter's body is returned to her horribly butchered, to elderly couples who lost all their savings because their bankers were thieves, to the woman whose alcoholic husband squandered their inheritance, to the sexually molested and to spouses shamed by the unfaithfulness of their partner. The demands of forgiveness, he says, are so daunting that they seem humanly impossible. But I submit that as difficult, seemingly impossible at times, that true forgiveness is. Indeed, it's the hardest work you will ever do, the longest journey you will ever take. There is something more difficult and more painful than learning to forgive. It's not forgiving. Let me tell you the story of Daisy, a story that's told by Philip Yancey in his book, What's So Amazing About Grace? Daisy was born in 1898 to a working-class family in Chicago. She was the eighth of ten children. The father barely earned enough money to feed them all, and after he took up drinking, there was even less money for the family to live on. Her father was a mean drunk. Daisy used to cower in the corner, sobbing as he kicked her baby brother and sister across the linoleum floor. Daisy hated her father with all her heart. All her siblings dropped out of school early, and then one by one, they moved away to other towns. They got married, started families of their own, and tried to put their past behind them as best they could. Her father vanished. She didn't know where he went. She didn't care where he went. Years later, however, to everyone's surprise, their father resurfaced. He had guttered out, he said. Bottom was the term. Drunk and cold, one day he had wandered into a Salvation Army rescue mission. He wanted a hot meal. In order to get the hot meal, he had to attend a worship service. Talk of Jesus' love, even for him, was the topic of the day. He prayed a prayer. He doesn't remember the words. But something in him began to shift. The demons inside began to quiet. Eventually, he actually sobered up. He began studying the Bible and praying, and for the first time in his life, he felt something he'd never felt before, loved and love. Acceptance and accepting. He felt clean. He was redeemed, brought out with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm in no less miraculous fashion than the people of God were in Exodus chapter 20. But now, having come to life, he was looking for his children, one by one, to ask for what he knew he didn't deserve, and they may not be able to give forgiveness. He couldn't defend anything he did, so he didn't try. He couldn't make it right, but he was sorry, more sorry than any of them could imagine. The children, now middle-aged with families of their own, were initially skeptical, and understandably so. He's not sincere, they thought. He'll start drinking again. He just wants money. That's why he's really here. But none of that was true, and none of that happened. And in time, he actually did begin to win his children back. All that is except for Daisy. He can't undo all that he's done just by saying, I'm sorry, she said. A vow that she made long ago to never speak to that man again, she kept until the day he died. All her life, Daisy determined to be unlike her father. And indeed, she was unlike her father in some respects. She never touched a drop of alcohol. She never threw her children across the linoleum floor. But she ruled her family with a milder form of tyranny than she had grown up under. She would lie on a couch with a rubber ice pack on her head and scream at them. Shut up, she would say. Why did I ever have you stupid kids in the first place? You've ruined my life hard as steel. Daisy never apologized, and she never forgave anything, anyone. Her daughter, Margaret, remembers as a child coming in tears to apologize for something she had done. Her mother's response was a kind of parental catch-22. You can't possibly be sorry, Daisy said to her daughter, Margaret. If you were really sorry, you wouldn't have done it in the first place. Okay. All her life, Margaret determines to be different from her mother, and indeed, in many ways, she was. Margaret never laid on the couch with an ice pack on her head, screaming at her children, shut up. But as her children entered their teenage years, she started losing control. Michael especially was difficult to handle. She kicked him out of the house at 16 years of age, threatened and scolded him, reported him to a judge, wrote him out of his will, and finally, in a fit of rage, said, this, I never want to see you again as long as I live. She never did. Margaret was a devout Christian who studied the Bible every day. When asked if she regretted anything she had said or done to her son, with her son, toward her son, if she'd like to take anything back, she turned in a hot flash of rage as if speaking to Michael himself. I don't know why God didn't take him a long time ago for all the pain he's given me. Do you mean you wish your son dead? She was asked. She didn't answer. All his life, Michael was determined to be different from his mother. But the cycle of ungrace was unbroken. See, there's one thing more difficult and more painful than this journey of forgiveness. It's unforgiveness. It's not forgiving. Gabriel Marquee in his book Love in the Time of Cholera portrays a marriage that disintegrates over a bar of soap. You know, you get the feeling there's some underlying issues here as well, and certainly they are. But that was the issue. That was the catalytic thing. It was the wife's job to keep the house in order, including provisions like towels, toilet paper, and soap. One day she forgot the soap, an oversight her husband mentioned in an exaggerated way, and that she vigorously denied, although she had forgotten the soap. Her pride was at stake, however. And she could not back down, would not back down for seven months. for seven months. They slept in separate bedrooms. They said not a word to each other. They ate in silence. Even when they were old, they couldn't bring the bar of soap thing up, for the barely healed wounds could begin to bleed again as if inflicted yesterday. See, there's one thing more difficult and painful than forgiving. It's not. Forgiving, you'll be a slave your whole life. Mary Carr in her book Liars Club tells of a Texas man who remained married to his wife, which is great, but didn't speak to her for 40 years. Didn't speak to her for 40 years after a fight over how much money she spent on a bag of sugar. Each one was waiting for the other to approach. Neither one approached. The cycle never broke. Both of them remained in prison. Both of them slaves. Nobody won. Nobody can. You see, you see, there's one thing more difficult and painful than this journey toward forgiveness. It's not forgiving. you'll be a slave your whole life. Forgiveness, among other things, offers a way out. Sometimes it's the only way out. Forgiveness, you need to know, does not settle every question of blame or fairness. And if you're looking for that, you'll never enter into this. But it does allow a relationship to start over. It allows a prisoner to be set free. But the prisoner is you. Lewis Smedes says, of that, this. Not to forgive imprisons me in the past and locks out all potential for change or growth in a variety of areas in my life, not just with that one person I'm not forgiving. I thus yield control in ways I don't know to another person, to my enemy, actually, and doom myself to suffer the consequences of their wrong. We forgive not merely to fulfill some higher law of morality we do it in some sense for ourselves. The first and often the only person to be healed by forgiveness is the person who does the forgiveness. Paul said it this way when he spoke of this being the first commandment with a promise. He said that it may be well with you. When we genuinely forgive, Smedes says, we set a prisoner free and then discovered that the prisoner we set free was us. All of which raises, however, a pretty significant question. It's this, how do we find the courage? And where do we find the strength to do this kind of liberating work? Well, let me bring you back to Brennan Manning's quote, where he says that the demands of forgiveness are so daunting that they seem humanly impossible. The reality, he says, of forgiveness is simply beyond the capacity of ungraced human will. Only reckless confidence, reckless confidence in a source greater than ourselves can empower us to forgive the wounds of others. So in boundary moments such as these, as these, like right here and right now, there is only one place, Calvary, the cross. In your minds, if it helps you to close your eyes and do this, do it. But in your minds, come with me to the cross. Now, stay there and watch. Look, as Abba's only begotten son dies utterly alone and in bloody disgrace, you know the scene, you've probably played it out in your own mind, but now keep watching, keep watching and watch as he breathes forgiveness on his torturers at the moment of their greatest cruelty. On that lonely hill, outside the city wall of old Jerusalem, you will experience the healing power of the dying Lord. Quite a promise. You will experience the healing power of the dying Lord, but that healing power will not come by simply admiring that he died this way, that he forgave this way. It will not come by even being grateful that he died this way, that he forgave this way. For the power and wisdom of God is released. We talk about this here all the time. The transforming power of God is released. Not just when we thank him, it's when we follow. him. A rabbi has been saying it this way, come follow me into this way of being and living into, come follow me into this way of forgiving. It's the hardest work you will ever do. It's the longest journey you will ever take. But here's what's weird about the whole deal as the invitation is again today to follow him into this kind of forgiving. Because it just keeps spinning. Because to authentically follow him anywhere, particularly here, to follow him, you need him. I mean, think about it this way. Someone you really admire, maybe an older brother, sister, father or mother. or maybe even in your career, there's somebody in your career who you just admire and want to in some way be like. But in practical terms, they're so far ahead of you, and they seem to have so many tools that you don't have. It just couldn't happen unless maybe they came to be with you and to show you and to encourage you and to empower you in some way. The only way to follow him, if you are going to, is to have him. You need him, so come. if you're interested in following our rabbi to this place on this journey come to the table to the cross and as you do remember it will help you to remember first of all that you had a debt you couldn't pay and you see the forgiveness of a rabbi toward us and you receive it. Remember, first of all, as you come to the cross, as you come to the table, you had a debt you couldn't pay. And then receive grace that you need for you, but grace also, not just for your forgiveness, but receive also grace, the kind of grace that from our rabbi gives strength to follow a rabbi even into this way of being and living and forgiving. It's the hardest work some of you will ever do. It's the longest journey some of you will ever take. But see, there is actually one thing harder and more painful than forgiving. It's not. forgiving. Let's go to the table that is the Lord's. As Brennan Manning said, the demands of forgiveness are daunting. Beyond the capacity of ungraced human will to actually do. And so this morning we get to come to the table of grace. This morning we get to see our rabbi, the night that he was betrayed, pick up the bread of the Passover, that bread that the children of Israel were instructed to eat. It was the first meal on this journey from slavery into freedom.
