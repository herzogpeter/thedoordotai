Last week, in our dealing with the Eighth Commandment in the Law, if you're here, you're aware that we were dealing with that, and had been for some time, dealing with the Ten Commandments last week, the Eighth Commandment in the Law was this, you shall not lie. In the context of that, we talked about the fact that at the root of at least some of our lying is this instinct that every single one of us have to hide, To cover and conceal what we don't want people to see about ourselves, about our sin. And with that comes our shame, not wanting people to see our shame. Sometimes it's not some deep shameful sin thing. Sometimes I just don't want you to see my weakness. Because oddly with that comes shame or my fear. And so we lie in a variety of ways for a variety of reasons. and often not bold-faced lies. We've become quite skilled at shifting shadows kind of lies. And we do that with half-truths, insincere smiles, flattering speech, inflated stories, religious God talk. One of our favorites is Christians. All designed, not to hurt anybody else, though lies sometimes do that. And we talked at length about that last week. But sometimes, simply to protect ourselves, we hide. We cover and conceal. And if we do that long enough, learn literally to live that way, we can get really good at this hiding thing. Indeed, we can learn to live in the dark. The problem with that, we discovered last week, is among other things this, that God, this God that we say we love and are wanting to follow, indeed are wanting to become like, particularly as it relates to following Jesus, who we think is God, who is also our Abba, who is inviting us to follow Him and become like Him is light. 1 John 1, 5. In fact, that was the text we dealt with and I'm going to resurrect it a little bit here this morning. God is light. And in Him, in God, there is no darkness, no hiding at all. Indeed, no variation with Him, no shifting shadows because whatever light does is that it reveals. Lights, when it's bright with no shifting shadows, makes visible what's actually there, what's really there, what's true about my life and my heart and what I'm trying to hide. The light reveals that. So if on one hand we are trying to convince people and even ourselves that we're walking with God, 1 John 1, 6, if we say we have fellowship with God, but are walking in darkness, in other words, if the manner of our life, if our walk, our way of life, is to consistently hide everything in the dark, we lie. Particularly, we lie about having fellowship with God, because God is all about light, about being in the light, of what is actually true, of what is actually there. God is all about turning on the light. But this is very important if you can enter into this. God is all about turning on the light, not in order to embarrass and humiliate us. Because that is, I think, the fear most of us have. It's why we hide. because if the light was shown this morning on what was really going on in my heart or my life or whatever, I would be humiliated because it would reveal things I don't want you to see. The invitation into the light, and the reason God wants to turn on the light is not for that. He wants to turn it on not to humiliate us, but to cleanse us, to cleanse us and to restore us. Indeed, in verse 7 of 1 John 1, it's as if John is saying, I promise, you guys, I promise, because he knows how scary this is for all of us to actually do. I promise that if you begin to walk a different way, and the analogy of walking is important because it may be one step at a time, incremental steps. If you begin to bring out into the light the things that all of us, let's just confess that now together, that all of us tend to hide in the dark. At least two things will happen. I promise the first thing will happen is this. You will begin to have fellowship with one another. You'll begin to experience real relationship, maybe for the first time. And again, we went into this last week. So there's many reasons why this fellowship thing happens when you bring out into the light what you're hiding in the dark. One of the reasons that I didn't go into last week was this, because if you've been hiding your whole life who you really are, then nobody's been having an actual relationship with you. They've been having a relationship with this image you project to them. And it's not the real you. And if you begin to have the courage to come out in to the light and say, this is who I am, you have the potential to have fellowship for the first time based on who you really are. So the invitation is come out into the light that God is, because you can have fellowship. But there's another reason, and it's this, and it's even better than the fellowship thing. It's this, because if you come into the light, the blood of His Son, Jesus, will not just accept you, He will cleanse you. See, one of the things about coming into the light with your stuff isn't so you can go, here's my stuff, and I just want you to accept it. No, no, no. I want to be cleansed. I want to be rid of this stuff. You come into the light. If you walk in the light, you'll have fellowship with one another because we have a real relationship with each other now based on who we really are, but also God will cleanse all that stuff you've and hiding and forgive all that stuff because he's not calling us into the light to humiliate us and embarrass us and certainly not to condemn us, but so he can cleanse us and forgive us and restore us. Indeed, verse 9 of 1 John 1, it's almost as if John's saying, here's the deal. Let me kind of boil it down to this. You do your part and God will do his part. Your part, begin to walk a different way. Begin to move a different direction against every instinct of survival you have been practicing from day one of your life. Begin to bring out into the light what you've been hiding in the dark. That's your part. Reveal it. Confess it so God can do his part. Cleanse it, forgive it, and not just it, but you. Cleanse you. Because if we confess our sin, verse 9, we bring out into the light what we're hiding in the dark, I promise that God is faithful to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us of all unrighteousness. And that is the gospel of amazing grace that we preach. It's the basis of our hope and living a different way. Now, if you've been here at Open Door for a while, you're probably aware that this living in the light theme that I'm talking about this morning is a major theme here in our church. It's part of our DNA. One of the primary values of our church is this thing of authenticity. has been for a long time. Some of you may remember our be statements. I haven't talked about them for a while. Be filled. Be called. Become. Be weird. I just added that because I think that is a value. But the first value, talk about this, be real. You can't do the gospel. You can't experience the kingdom of God without being authentic, real. This is who I really am. Be for God. It's a major theme here at our church. It's also part of my story. You've heard me talk about this more than once because I grew up in a religious culture, much like the religious culture many of you grew up in, where the unwritten rule was this, that how things look on the outside is what matters most. So we could and we would, in fact, go to church with big smiles on our faces, praise the Lord's on our tongues, But inside, behind the smiles and the praise the Lord God talk, often was fear and pain and anger and pride and lust and a marriage about to fall apart. But hi, how are you? And you can get mad about that or you could get really sad about that. Because here's the deal. How things look is what matters most among the people of God. well among anybody actually, but my concern is among us. If how things look is what matters most, then how things really are in our lives, in our marriages, in our hearts, will never get dealt with, won't even get talked about, won't even be spoken. So before you know it, even in a community of faith, it actually becomes more important to us and to you, to me, that people think I'm spiritual and doing really well and have no sin and are walking with God, then that you're actually walking with God. Because for some of us, the first step to actually walking with God is to first say, I have no idea what that means. And you bring that out into the light, and then you begin this journey of, instead of pretending that you are, you get it, you do get it. See, what we were doing, almost entirely without knowing, when we were hiding everything, was we were learning how to lie. We were learning how to live in the dark, carefully hiding everything that we didn't want people to see, behind the mask of religious words, broad smiles, mindless chatter, even though the truth was anger, lust, pride, gossip, behind the scenes, and often behind the scenes, in the quietest places of our hearts, we would find a profound unhappiness and wondering, is this all there is to the Christian life? I'm sure every now and then in that environment, someone would bring out into the light something that they'd been hiding in the dark, like the time someone boldly shared that they hadn't read the Bible for three whole days. Wow, wow, what heinous sin, which actually, those kinds of confessions were just another way to hide, were just another way to sound more spiritual than you really were. Wow, he's convicted about not reading the Bible for three days. Truth is, he's having an affair with his secretary, Minor detail. All of which raises this question. What is it, generally, that gives people who've learned to live this way, and let's just say again, we've all learned to live this way, the courage to stop? Well, sometimes it has nothing to do with courage. Because sometimes what gets us to bring things out into the light is that the light just kind of comes to us. The light shines on that thing that we've been trying to hide. It gets exposed. And we get found out. And that's where all the humiliation and the embarrassment comes in. And that's what we're trying to avoid like the plague. So sometimes the light just comes in and some circumstance happens where what we're trying to hide gets exposed. But the law does this as well. The law that we have been studying over the last several weeks, Ten Commandments, Torah, like God who is light, the law of God is like a light as well. And over the last several weeks, if you've been with us, you've been experiencing it without maybe using this terminology, but the light of God's word has been shining on our adultery. Thou shalt not commit adultery, no foreign element in your marriage. And those of us who felt like, well, that's a really good word and I'm really glad I don't do that, the light got even brighter and it went not just to our adultery but to our lust. Let's look at that. You ready to put that into the light? It puts a pretty bright light on it. We talked about murder and not just murder but the light got brighter and moved to our anger and our contempt for people. But even then, what's weird is, and you know it's true, even then when the light of the law or whatever gets turned on, we still have the capacity to hide, to, in a variety of ways, turn the light off. So the question rises again for me, how do we become the kind of people who when the light goes on, we leave the light on and don't turn it off? Well, at the risk of oversimplifying, I think the courage comes when we have faith to believe that if we really do do our part, that God will do His part. In other words, if we do confess our sin, bring out into the light what we've been hiding in the dark, that God really is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us. But what's weird about that is that many of us do believe God would forgive and cleanse. We're just not sure about each other. Which means that if we are going to become or continue to be a people who are desiring to live in the light, that this, it just has to be a community that when people confess, we forgive. A community where grace is in place. Because if I don't think, if I'm pretty sure there's going to come condemnation from you, not just from God, I will never tell you. And I will continue to hide, thus producing this frightening kind of isolation. Dietrich Bonhoeffer speaks of this when he says this. He was alone with his sin, as most people are, quite frankly, is utterly alone. It may be that Christians, notwithstanding corporate worship, common prayer, and common service, are in many respects still left in their aloneness. The final breakthrough to authentic fellowship never comes because although they do have fellowship as believers, as devout people, they don't have fellowship as sinners. The pious fellowship permits no one to be a sinner, so everyone who is must conceal their sin from themselves and from the fellowship. And so we must decide, says Bonhoeffer, and I agree, are we going to be a fellowship of pretenders living in darkness and denial, horrified when a real sinner shows up? Or will we walk as children of light who with humility and authenticity as the normal course of life bring into the light what is hidden in the dark so God can heal it, grace it, forgive it, transform it in the context of a community full of grace. word about the table this morning among the many things the table says to us today it is saying something very specific and it's this you don't have to live in the dark anymore you don't have to hide anymore indeed hebrews 10 19 says it this way that because of the blood that jesus shed for us, the blood symbolized at the table in the cup. We therefore have confidence to enter, to step into the holy place, the light, if you will, by a new and living way which He inaugurated through the veil. The veil is symbolic language for His flesh, which is symbolized at the table in the bread. Therefore, verse 22, let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope that he who promised is faithful. That he who promised is faithful to do what? To cleanse and forgive if we confess, if we bring into the lights what we're hiding in the dark right here, right now. So the Spirit and the Bride say, come, come to the table, to the light. As we go now to the table, there's going to be a few things going on. Those of you who are at Open Door a lot know kind of the rhythm. And so those of you who may be visiting, we just want to invite you into it and kind of prepare you for it. And we're doing one thing a little different too. in just a few moments we're going to stand and enter into worship so we will corporately worship at the same time we're doing that there will be stations across the auditorium and in the balcony as well where you can move to receive the bread and the cup communion and also off to the side of the stage we're going to have not a large group but a few people from the prayer team specifically this morning to hear confession to hear confession to stir a talk like this up and not give this kind of outlet I just think is wrong. And so it won't be your whole story, but to hear your confession. And they, in the name of Jesus, will say he is faithful and just to forgive you. Some of you really need that. Some of you need to go to the table first and then to prayer, and some of you need to go to prayer and then to the table, and then not telling you what to do. There's one other thing that's going to happen. We've kind of grown used to moving around a lot in the context of communion, and we've had the cross over here, and often people will just come and be at the cross, The power of that symbol is amazing. I don't even have to fill it out for you. But today, in just a few moments, we're going to move it to the center. And the auditorium is going to grow a little darker, and a very bright light is going to be on this cross. It's going to make kind of a circle of bright lights. And as you feel any kind of prompting at all, the symbolism of that is an invitation into the very bright light. Into the very bright light. To be a people who are learning to live in the light. And the invitation would be to come. and be in the light and feel even how awkward it feels. Because if you come into the bright light and everything's dark, people are going to see you. You will be seen. We're not going to see all your stuff. We don't want to. We don't need to. But just what that feels like, to be seen. And coming into the light would be like saying, I want to be a known person. I want to be the kind of person who is living in the light. And as you stand in the light and it exposes the lint on your sweater that we couldn't see in the dark, I'm telling you, let it speak to you. Let it speak to you about amazing grace that cleanses and forgives. Let's prepare our hearts. Let's just get quiet for coming to the table and living in the light. As we prepare to go to the table, we're going to have some time to go through some corporate confessions. And what you'll notice is that the time will be bookended at the beginning and the end with the 1 John passage that Dave has been using the past couple weeks. In between the confessions are going to be some spaces. I would encourage you to use those times. to internalize what we are saying and just to give pause to where you are at in your journey into the light. Let's begin. This is the message that we have heard. God is light and in him is no darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice in the truth. But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not in us. Let's continue. Merciful God, for the things we have done that we regret, forgive us. For the things we have failed to do that we regret, forgive us. For all the times we have acted without love, forgive us. For all the times we have reacted without thought, forgive us. for all the times we have withdrawn care, forgive us. For all the times we have failed to forgive, forgive us. For hurtful words said and helpful words unsaid, for unfinished tasks and unfulfilled hopes, for of all time, forgive us and help us to lay down our burden of regret. Let's speak these words together. O Prince of Peace, from peace that is no peace, from the grip of all that is evil, from a violent righteousness, we say, deliver us. From paralysis of will, from lies and misnaming, from terror of truth, deliver us. From hardness of heart, from trading in slaughter, from the worship of death, deliver us. By the folly of your gospel, by your choosing our flesh, by your nakedness and pain, heal us. By your weeping over the city, by your refusal of the sword, by your facing of horror, heal us. By your bursting from the tomb, by your coming in judgment, by your everlasting grace, forgive us, heal us, grant us peace. Amen. Amen. Now let us speak this confession together. Lord, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Let us read for a second time. This is the message that we have heard. God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with Him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice in the truth. But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. Today we
