Last weekend, we talked about how the biggest discover thing we do around here each week is our weekend service. We come together to discover more of God, to know Him better, to taste His goodness, to experience His presence. And every weekend, we come together seeking to know ourselves better. In relationship with others and God, we seek to become who we've been created to be. Together we pursue the struggle of becoming fully alive in God, and you are invited. We come to discover through worship and the Word. Well, over the next two weekends, starting today, we're going to be looking at discovering some answers to two very important questions. This week, Pastor Dave will lead us as we're looking at the question of who is God. And next week, Pastor Vicki Degner will be looking at the question of who am I. Following these two weekends, we're going to take an extended time looking at the question of who are we as the church? Together, who are we? It's going to be an awesome adventure. One that I hope you're prepared for and ready to receive all that God has for you. And we pray that you come with open hearts, ready to receive. But to do that, for you and I to come and to do that and to enter into this, we're going to need the Spirit of God to open our eyes, to open our minds, to open our hearts to the truth of who he really is and who we really are, individually and as a church. And so I ask that together right now at this time, we would join in prayer, asking for that very thing. Let's pray. There is no other name. There's no other name, Jesus, than yours. And we long to know you. and to be like you, and to have you fill us in a way that only your spirit can do. And so, God, we ask that your manifest presence among us would bring life, would bring light, and would bring love. Give us eyes to see. Give us open hearts. Give us minds that can think clearly and receive the truth. God, we pray that over the course of these next weeks that you would be unleashed among us in a way that we would have to stand back and go clearly, Emmanuel, God is with us. Holy Spirit, come. For yours is not a kingdom of words, but it's a kingdom of power, and we ask God that you would bring your power. Even now, this morning, as you have been high and lifted up, we pray you'd fill, Pastor Dave. As you've done so many times before, I just know you delight in him and the words that he has to share for us this day are your words. And so give us hearts to receive. Anoint him for what he has to say. We pray all of this for your glory. Amen. Today's scripture reading is from the book of Colossians chapter 1. Christ is the exact likeness of God who can't be seen. He is first and he is over all creation. All things were created by him. He created everything in heaven and on earth. He created everything that can be seen and everything that can't be seen. He created kings, powers, rulers, and authorities. Everything was created by him and for him. Before anything was created, he was already there. He holds everything together. and he is the head of the body, which is the church. He is the beginning. He is the first to be raised from the dead. That happened so that he would be far above everything. God was pleased to have his whole nature living in Christ. God was pleased to bring all things back to himself because of what Christ had done. This is the word of the Lord. Thank you, Al So who is God? Is the question of the day What kind of God is God is another way to ask it So how would you answer that? Where would you start to answer that? Would you begin with the character of God? or maybe the heart of God? Would you talk about the love and grace of God or would you begin to deal with the wrath of God, even the judgment of God because you can't afford to have a soft view of God? Would you talk about the existence of God? Because you probably should decide if you believe in God that God is or is not before you start talking about God. But if you do, in fact, believe in God, What kind of God is it that you believe in? It stirs up and reveals, I think, all of our perceptions of God. And with our perceptions of God come all of our distortions of God, which come to us from a variety of fascinating places. The fact is, even the Bible itself can be quite confusing with what sometimes seems to be contradictory expressions of God and who he is and what he's like. And sometimes our perceptions of God comes from people who claim to know God. In fact, they're the experts about God. But if God is really like that, if God is really like them, I don't want anything to do with that God. So you reject God, but what you rejected was a distortion of God, not God. So who is God? It's kind of a big question. And it's the question of the day. What kind of God is God is another way to ask it. But how would you answer it? Where would you start? Well, we believe, and by that I mean we, here at Open Door. We believe that the best and most reliable place to go, when you're trying to figure out what kind of God God is, is to go to the person of Jesus. Because according to the Apostle Paul in Colossians 1, the text that Al just read. He, that is Jesus, is the exact and visible representation. He is the exact image of the invisible God. He is the firstborn of all creation, for by him all things were created, both in the heavens and on the earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities. All things were created by him and created for him. And he, says the writer of the book of Hebrews is the radiance of God's glory, the exact representation of his nature. Indeed, Jesus himself said it this way, that if you've seen me, you have seen the Father. And if you've heard me, you have heard the Father, because I and the Father are one. And all of that is at least part of why, when I thought of this question earlier in the week, what kind of God is God, first thing I thought of was Jesus, who in the 15th chapter of the Gospel of Luke, is actually answering this very question, what kind of God is God, to a group of people who thought they knew who God is, what kind of God God is, and he did it, answer this question, with a story, interestingly enough. Actually, there were three stories in Luke 15, all woven together, and they're simple stories, the kind of child could understand. And for you and I, they've become familiar stories, actually. We call them parables about a wandering sheep, about a rebellious son, about a coin that got lost when it fell through the cracks, which means, among other things, this. And it's interesting that he uses these simple stories because what it means is this, that according to Jesus, God maybe isn't really all that complicated and hard to understand like we so often make our understanding of God because as it turns out, according to Jesus, God is a lot like a shepherd who just lost his sheep. In fact, he's a lot like a father who just lost his son. And sometimes God acts like a crazy woman sweeping the house, turning it upside down in search of one single coin that simply rolled away and somehow fell through the cracks, but it's not coins or sheep that God cares about. It's people he cares about. So the obvious point of these three stories in Luke chapter 15 is that God is the kind of God, regardless of what you think of him, he is the kind of God who would move heaven and earth to find lost things. But he doesn't care about things. He would move heaven and earth to find lost people and then rejoice greatly when that which is lost is finally found. For this sheep of mine was lost, Luke 15, 6. But now it's been found. This son of mine was dead, verse 24. But now he is alive. This coin of mine that rolled away fell through the cracks has been recovered, Luke 15, verse 9. three simple stories is all the kind you might tell your children when you tuck them into bed at night. But as it turns out, there's more going on here in this story than a bedtime story for little children, though you could certainly use these stories for that purpose. Because in Luke 15, behind the scenes a storm is brewing. Tensions are growing. Suspicions are rising about Jesus actually and it was in fact these suspicions that people had of him that were in fact the catalyst. They were in fact the real reason that Jesus launches into these stories so they aren't here just to provide a bedtime story for children. Luke 15 verse 1 sets the stage. You can see it on the screen. It reveals the problem. And the problem was this, that all of the tax gatherers and sinners were coming near to him, that is to Jesus, to listen to him. And that bothered the Pharisees and scribes. So they began to grumble about that, saying this man receives sinners and he eats with them as well, which is a really big deal, this whole thing of table fellowship. We've talked about this before and that he would draw near. He would let them draw near to him because in Jesus' day, one of the ways you would show how holy you actually were would be measured by how far you actually stayed from sinners, from people that you would consider to be unclean. But the problem in Luke 15 is people like that, unclean sinners, were in fact drawing near. You prove how holy you are by how far they were drawing near to Jesus, and Jesus was letting them come near. It says in verse 2, indeed, he receives them. He seems to like them is what's in that word, receive. He lets them in. Even eats with them was their complaint. So he did what you do when you're faced with that kind of thing. He starts telling stories. Actually, I mean, I know the text, and you know, I'm kind of used to the Bible, and so are you, and so it doesn't seem weird. But if you just read the story, they're after Jesus. They don't like him at all. They're looking for ways to trick him and to trap him. So he goes telling a story. It's really kind of random and weird, I think. Except he knows what he's doing. He knew exactly what he was doing because what he was actually doing was in these stories, bedtime stories, he's turning the tables on these guys because what he's really doing is confronting these guys by explaining to these guys why it is he does what he does. And what he does is receive sinners and eat with them is, well, but here's the kicker and here's the confrontation in these bedtime stories. Because everything Jesus does is actually designed to reveal the face of God. The kind of God God really is. And as it turns out, God is actually the kind of God who receives sinners. Which is a bizarre thought. It would be heresy to these Pharisees and scribes to hear him kind of say it that very way. Jesus is saying God is the kind of God who does that very thing. eats with them as, well, indeed, he's the kind of God who actually cares about and would relentlessly pursue a lost sheep and a lost coin. He's the kind of God who would patiently wait for a lost son. And if that's true, that God really is the kind of God who receives sinners and cares about lost sheep, lost coins, lost kids, the question implicit in these parables to these grumblers would be this. If God's doing that, why don't you receive sinners? And eat with them as, well, he's turning the tables on these guys. See, I understand, says Jesus, in these stories of Luke 15, that you're confused and angry too that I do what I do, that I receive sinners and eat with them as well. but I'm confused and a little angry too that you don't receive sinners care about any of them at all. And he does all that with these stories. The kind of child could understand they begin with a question, but listen in the question for the trap, for the turning of the tables, for actually the sarcasm in the questions when he asks the first question, In verse 4, first story, what man among you, he's speaking to the Pharisees, if he had a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not take leave of the 99 and leave them in the open pasture to go after the one until he finds it. Who among you wouldn't do that? Of course you would do that. He's being sarcastic. Let me explain how we know that. First of all, he's talking to Pharisees and scribes who were among the aristocracy in Israel at that time, and they were that, and they also saw themselves that way. They wanted people to see themselves that way. You just need to know that shepherds were not among the aristocracy. Indeed, shepherds were seen as common and coarse in Jesus' day among the category of people that we've referred to in the past as the emha'arats. Remember that? The people of the land is what that means. So they're common people. Their idea of art is velvet Elvis pictures. And their idea of health food is diet beer. And kind of like you. And yeah, whatever. Kenneth Bailey in his book, very helpful in this regard. It's entitled Through Peasant Eyes. Says plainly that shepherds were despised. Now, you have places like Psalm 24 where it says, the Lord is my shepherd. And in the scriptures, there's places where there's a romanticizing of the shepherd. But in real life, in Jesus' day, shepherds were despised, particularly among the well-born. It was menial work, the kind you would give to a hireling, maybe to a servant, well beneath the dignity or social standing of an accomplished person, like a Pharisee or a scribe. Indeed, this parable, this reference to shepherds and a sheep that's wandered off is designed intentionally to create a picture that's actually kind of funny, but not funny. It's more awkward and embarrassing, funny that way. And the picture is of some dignified person like these Pharisees or scribes who in their royal robes would chase after a sheep in a field full of mud and sheep things, you know, and pull up their robes and people, traipsing through that. That's a ridiculous picture. Who among you wouldn't do that, Jesus is saying. He's being sarcastic because the picture would be of this dignified person picking up their royal robes and going through the field to go after a sheep as if the sheep mattered because it wouldn't to these people who are grumbling. And it's a picture and a point that is accentuated actually, Even in Jesus' reference to 100 sheep. It's very intentional because 100 sheep would mean that the person in the story is rich. You wouldn't have 100 sheep unless you had significant wealth. And if you were a person of significant wealth, you just need to know. There's no way you'd be watching the sheep, let alone go chasing after one who got lost. What you'd do if you had a hundred sheep, which means you're wealthy, is you'd hire some loser to watch the sheep. Some common person from among the Imharats to do the dirty work. So when Jesus says in verse 4, what man among you wouldn't go looking for the one, the answer. Really? The answer. And they all know it's the answer. They all know they're getting pinned here. Is none of them would. In fact, I think that as they're listening to this story, they well might be muttering, what a stupid story this is. Who does he think we are anyway? Like, who does he think we are? Lowly shepherds? You gotta be kidding me. And then verse five, the picture here expands because in the story when the shepherd finds this sheep that's wandered off, he lays the sheep on his shoulders rejoicing. I want you to visually picture a shepherd who lays a sheep. It's kind of like this. You kind of be like this, holding the sheep, rejoicing that I found the sheep. So there's rejoicing when he finds the sheep. But in the story, there's also very important, there's also rejoicing in the very work it required to find the sheep and bring it home. And as I put all that together, I wonder, can you hear an echo? Can you hear something reverberating? There's kind of a foreshadowing here, and we hear it echo in places like Hebrews 12, verse 2, where it says it was for joy. Rejoicing, it was for joy, for the joy set before him. This is Jesus now. It was for the joy set before him. He laid us on his shoulders. Enduring the cross Despising the shame Despising the shame What does that mean? It means a lot of things But if you connect it To this parable It means he's not ashamed To do the dirty work He's not ashamed To do the dirty work That these Pharisees would never do He's not ashamed to go stomping Through the mud to remove his royal robes, to bring you home, the wandering one home, and he brings him home rejoicing, even in what it took to get that done. So what kind of God is God is the answer, is the question being posed. Well, Jesus says he's that kind of God. And so is his son, Jesus. Indeed, his son, Jesus, is the image of the invisible God. He's the radiance of God's glory, the exact representation of his nature, who though he existed in the form of God, Philippians 2 verse 6 says, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but our God emptied himself, taking on the form of a bondservant, being made in the likeness of human beings, connected to the parable, being made in the likeness of a lowly shepherd, who by his willingness to be made in the likeness of a lowly shepherd, was saying, yes, yes. Yes, I'll do the dirty work. No, it's not beneath me to do the dirty work. And yes, I'll receive sinners and eat with them as well, and I'll do all that rejoicing. And I know that it confuses some of you, is Jesus saying in this parable to the Pharisees and scribes, and I know that it bothers and angers you when I talk like this, and when I do all that, like receive sinners and eat with them as well, but what confuses me and bothers me and, yeah, angers me, is that you don't receive sinners or eat with them at all, that you don't care about them at all. But it doesn't stop there with the story about a sheep. He just keeps on going because God is not just like a shepherd who's willing to do the dirty work of finding a lost sheep. He's also like a crazy woman. He's stretching it here, you guys. He's always like this crazy woman who, when she loses a silver coin, just won't stop searching until she finds the coin. She won't stop searching until she finds this thing. But once again, well, this is a story I could tell my children. There's a confrontation here. And there's sarcasm here that, like the last story, is revealed in his opening question. Because in verse 8 he says this, or what woman? There's your question. And what woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin, doesn't light a lamp and sweep the whole house and search carefully, not stopping until she finds it? I mean, seriously, who wouldn't do that? And then when she finds it, it says in verse 9, she does what every woman would do. What woman wouldn't do this? When you find a coin, what woman wouldn't call together all her friends and neighbors and gather them together saying, I got you good news, everybody. You can all just relax now Because that coin I lost I found it Get all happy with me Rejoice with me For I have found the coin That rolled away and fell through the cracks Aren't you thrilled? He's being He's being sarcastic What woman wouldn't Effective a lot of women wouldn't do this. But some would. A peasant woman would or might do this. Because though a drachma, and that's what the coin was, it was a drachma, might not be worth much to someone who was wealthy, so they'd be disposable. To someone of poverty, a drachma would have some value. So I wouldn't have many to spare if you're a peasant. Indeed, there was some speculation, and Kenneth Bailey was again helpful here, based on the history, that this coin could well have been part of a necklace for this woman in this story. And the necklace would have been possibly part of her dowry that she wore around her neck, ten drachmas, strung together around her neck, revealing to the world, if they were part of a dowry, They are revealing to the world what her husband paid for her, which means it reveals to the world what she's worth. But what it reveals, if that's true, is that she wasn't worth much. Because she's poor. Peasant woman, so it's, I mean, it's actually kind of embarrassing that that's what I'm worth, 10 drachmas. And one rolled away and I went crazy. And then she does make it worse when she finds the coin and she calls her friends and neighbors to declare to them the wonderful news that she found a coin that to her neighbors, if you're in the story, this coin she found means nothing. It means nothing to them. I mean, they're on the phone. I'm not, whatever. And their face is going, why is she telling me this? I don't care if she found that stupid coin. In fact, if you're trying to find the equivalent energy for the delight that is being expressed by Jesus in the story of the woman who finds the coin, you almost have to imagine a woman or a parent losing a child. Where the kid in the mall wanders away and you go, oh, yes, this frantic, find that kid. And you find your kid and you call your friends, I get that, I would get that. But now in giving you that, I'm giving you a little bit more of the story because Jesus is painting a picture here of a woman who finds this worthless coin and her response of joy is the same as if it was a child. She's acting like this coin has value, like infinite value, which is crazy. So what kind of God is God? is the question of the day. Well, as it turns out, he's like a lowly shepherd who doesn't mind taking off his royal robes to go stomping through the mud after a stupid sheep that's lost his way. That work is not beneath this kind of God and he's kind of like a crazy woman who would move heaven and earth to find something, to find someone that most people would find of very little value. I mean, why would you bother with that coin, with that person, with those people? Now step back and be Jesus because what's going on in his mind is he's telling this story. It's as if he's saying, and I'm just telling you this story because this is why I receive sinners. I'm answering your question. I'm moving into your grumbling. This is why I receive sinners and eat with them as well because that's the heart of God. And I know it bothers you, is Jesus saying to these Pharisees in this parable. And I know it confuses you, even angers you when I do that because you're grumbling. But you know what bothers me? It confuses me, even angers me. It's that you don't receive sinners or eat with them that you don't see the value of lost sheep or coins that rolled away and fell through the cracks and you don't rejoice at all when they're found. You couldn't care less if they're found or if they're lost, you don't care. So don't tell me you know God. They were the experts. No, they weren't. None who God was because I, Jesus is saying in these parables, have come to reveal the face of God, and he looks nothing like you guys. A little side note here about lost sheep and lost coins. Because when a lost sheep or a lost coin gets lost, think on this, it's important. It's not because they got rebellious, okay? You know, a sheep is all, I hate you, shepherd. The lost sheep, the lost coin, didn't leave because they're angry. they're defiant, they're not hateful. The son in the third parable is kind of fitting that category. He's kind of blown off his dad. I don't care about you anymore. Give me my inheritance now. In other words, I wish you were dead. And he just walks away kind of hateful, flipping his father off. And the father, by the way, in that story acts differently than the shepherd who goes after the sheep and goes after the coin. Here the father lets him go. That's an interesting, I don't have time to develop that a lot But when, yeah, God, I get Okay, okay, I love you, son, I'll let you go I'll wait for you And when you turn, I'll be there But I will let you go But a sheep Gets lost because they wander A sheep gets lost because they get distracted As they pick up The scent of this or that I think you know what this is like. I think you can feel it because you're a sheep and so am I because we wander away when we smell something and it smelled good. It didn't smell evil, just smelled well, that's good. You just start following it. You're not going, I hate you, sheep. I just like that too. And as you're getting lost, you don't even know that you're getting lost. You don't even know, you're not even aware, the sheep is not, that you're going the wrong direction. Not aware of that. And in the wrong direction, you're getting further and further and further from home. And we get lost that way. I get lost that way. So do you, and some of you are lost that way. right now. This moment and this moment some of you are wondering how did I get here? I didn't care about this. I don't love this. I don't hate the shepherd. How can I come home? Leave that for a second. Consider now the coin. Because what's fascinating about the coin like the sheep the coin is not angry at the shepherd or the housekeeper like the son is. The coin however is different than the sheep in that the coin is an inanimate object. So in it's getting lost there's no volition on the coin's part at all. I know I'm weird that I think of things this weird. It had nothing to do with the fact that it got lost. It just fell through the cracks, like an inanimate object would fall through the cracks. And if someone doesn't start looking for this coin, if someone doesn't start sweeping the floor, it will never be found. Because a lost coin, I mean, picture a coin under the floorboards of the house or, you know, stuck in the cushion of a couch. The coin can't go, hello, you know, come like a sheep. A sheep in the field could be hidden from the shepherd and the shepherd's looking around and the sheep could at least go, oh, there you are. And you know what that feels like. God, help me. God, help me. So I see the coin in my mind and would have it come to life in yours as well as the least of the least among us. The coin is the least of the least in the world. Think of that picture in your mind. They are the most lost of the lost. They are disposable people. It's hard to even say those words. They are disposable people who have fallen through the cracks. They were the sick and the lame in Jesus' day. They were the lepers in Jesus' day who you couldn't go near. Jesus touched the lepers. Very symbolic action. But these disposable people that you have in your mind right now, The least of the least in the entire world Are not angry or rebellious at God I hate They're just lost And they didn't choose to be lost I mean one category of people you might have in your mind Are little kids who are mentally challenged Incapable or adults who are incapable They can't think enough of things That you are able to put together and even follow the reasoning of a talk like this. They can't do that. And they're lost. There is a way for them to know God, but not the way you and I do. They're incapable, though, of... And when I think of this category of people, I don't know about you, but it kind of makes me want to pick up a broom. Start sweeping. Where are they? Pre-service prayer, Jane McLean, here last night, heard the story and was feeling like, I'm not good with words. I don't know how to talk to people about Jesus. And then I told the story, she dawned on her, her job is to be on a van and a bus kind of all day long with special needs kids who can't communicate, who don't understand. I just love on them. That's who they are. And all of that is why, says Jesus, in these parables, that is why I receive sinners and eat with them as well. And it's why I touch lepers too, because I'm like this crazy woman. I am like the crazy woman who's sweeping the floor, looking for this coin. No one seems to value. And key part of the story, I will not stop looking for this coin until I find it. Several years ago, a friend of mine gave me a CD. It actually was a tape. It's how long it was. It was a very old message from a guy named Clarence Jordan. Some of you may recognize that name. He wrote a series of books called The Cotton Patch Gospels. And he was a preacher in the Deep South in the 60s and the 70s when there's tremendous racial turmoil down there. And he was trying to speak the grace of God and the power of the kingdom of God into this kind of Baptist, churchy, racially tense environment. And the tape I got was on this parable. And he went off in the tape on this parable, particularly the part of the sweeping woman who kept on sweeping. And I'll never forget it. I don't think I can do it exactly the way he did it. But he kind of said something like this. So how long does she sweep the floor? That's kind of how he said it. does she wear out her broom no does she sweep until the batteries run out on her flashlight no is kind of how he said it it says he said that she sweeps the floor until she finds it how long is that as long as necessary is what he said. But then he pushed it a little bit, and I was doing what you want. I love this guy. Then he pushed that thing across a line theologically because he suggested that God keeps on sweeping until he finds it, that God keeps on sweeping even after death. He's just crazy. He keeps on sweeping. And before I could kind of push that away, because it doesn't fit, you know, my theology, before I could do that, push it away, I got a picture. I got a picture. It was right in my face of lost little ones, of lost coins. What I pictured were these pictures I've seen in my life, and you've seen them too. you can see them this afternoon if you want to, of starving children in Sudan with flies going up their nose and had this vacant stare and no capacity. Never gonna hear about Jesus. And if they did, they wouldn't. What, what, what? Okay? They are lost coins. But what if? I don't know. I can't even. What if when they die, what if the first thing they see is this crazy woman sweeping the floor, looking for them. And when this crazy woman sees them, she shouts, she shouts, there you are. I've been looking for you. And she calls all her friends, everybody. She's home. He's home. Look what I found. Okay, craziness. Six years ago, I think it was, I was in Ireland with Bonnie in a Baptist church there. We were doing a series of meetings and I was preaching the parables, a lot of them anyway, and I came to this one and I preached this on a Sunday morning, places packed and pretty conservative place. And I came to this part where I kind of suggested this possibility that maybe you never know. And after the service, I really didn't know how it landed And one of the elders said There's a woman who would really want to talk to you And she's a missionary Who's home on leave right now And I went oh boy I'm in trouble And as I was brought to her He explained a little bit about You're going to meet her and you just need to know She's home on leave And she's dealing with post-traumatic stress syndrome Because she was a missionary in Afghanistan And it's kind of all I got when I come to her And she's weeping when I meet her and she tells me her story and the story was that I was missionary for several years in Afghanistan and where I worked was in prisons where young girls were sent and many of them were sent there not because they broke the law but because they were themselves raped and dare to say something out loud which brought disgrace and the family blah blah blah and they are in prison but and she said just had all sorts of pain and dealing with that and fear being in Afghanistan. But she's weeping now and she says, but I couldn't, I loved them. And I couldn't tell them about Jesus. I couldn't because if I did and they even received, they would be killed. And if I told them I could be killed or sent home for sure and part of her being home and the post-traumatic stuff was that they're doomed. And then she starts to weep and then she said, But what if God really is like what you said? What if he's like a crazy woman who won't stop sweeping until he, there you are. Now, I don't know. It's going to be like that. It's a child story we're telling this morning. but if it did let me ask you a question if it was like that would you rejoice? oh God or would you grumble that's wrong theology would you do? because your response to that tells you something it's fascinating we talk all the time here at Open Door about being in the story where are we in the story because that response to that story tells you where you're in the story so where are you in the story let me close with this because some of you this morning I've already talked to you are the lost sheep that's who we are today wandered far from home you don't hate God you're pretty sure he hates you I'm here to tell you he doesn't I'm here to tell you he's looking for you there you are, you're lost, you wandered away you smelled something that smelled good and you got there and it isn't what you wanted and you don't know how to get back I have some advice for you, if you want to get back, make a little noise honestly, there's going to be prayer people up here and when you come to them today, you don't have to say anything about what you need, just go, bah don't know what to do yep yep and while some of you may in fact be like the Pharisees and scribes in this story grumbling and complaining though I think not many here like that but if there are to you I say this you don't have to be that way come join us we need you but pick up a broom pick up a broom and start sweeping start looking, start receiving send us a knee with them as well come join us still others I think may be feeling this joy and maybe not knowing why, here's why I know why if you're feeling joy and you don't know why I know why you're feeling joy because we have a God who, like a lowly shepherd, doesn't mind doing the dirty work. And he doesn't mind casting off his royal robes to go traipsing through the mud to bring us home. That work is not beneath him because we have a God who is like a crazy woman. A crazy woman who just won't stop sweeping. She just won't give up. Looking and searching and it makes you kind of want to pick up a broom, doesn't it? Some of you have picked up brooms. It's what you do with your whole life. You're just kind of sweeping all the time. You don't even know you're doing it when you're doing it. That's the kingdom of God right there too. And all of this actually makes me think of our purpose as a church that we've been talking about over the last couple of weeks because a purpose, among other things, is this, to become a community of faith with a radical commitment to spiritual transformation for the glory of God, for the abundance of our own lives, and for the sake of lost coins and lost sheep and for the sake of the world. And all of that is why, says Jesus, in these parables, I receive sinners and eat with them as well. And I know it bothers you that I do. But you know what bothers me? That you don't. What kind of God is God? Turns out he's good. Who knew? Turns out he's this kind of God. Let's pray as we close. Would you stand with me? You have revealed yourself to us, Father, through your Son, through many different ways, but through your Son most clearly you have revealed yourself to us, and we are grateful. help us to see more God in fact one thing I'm grateful for is whatever it is we see of you there's more dial into that whatever we understand of God it's bigger so we thank you God for what we do know of you and that there's more of you and how big you are we see it but we don't see it, it's bigger and it's better and for that we say thank you and all these things we pray in Jesus' name who has revealed to us the face of God and all God's people said Amen God bless you as you leave, you're dismissed Thank you.
