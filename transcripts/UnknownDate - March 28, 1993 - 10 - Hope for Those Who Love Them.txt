Good morning. Well, Dave's not here, and the reason that you know that is because I'm here. But the reason that I know that is because if he was here, he'd be giving me a really hard time about this suit. But I have a little secret to tell you, and that is that the first time I wore this suit, Dave and I were out of town doing a seminar, and he told me that he was thinking that maybe he was losing it because I was starting to wear clothes that he'd like to wear. Anyway, for the past few weeks, Dave has been talking about the pain of porneia, most recently about people who are struggling with a sense of out-of-control sexuality and out-of-control sexual behavior. And since 1977, I've been working in the area of counseling And have noticed in the people that I work with, in the lives of the people that I've worked with, that there are many other people who are struggling because they care in a deep way about the struggling person that Dave has been talking about, whether it's about porne or not. Anybody who's got an issue in their life that they're bleeding about, that they're stuck with, there are people who care about that person. And they've tried to help, and the help hasn't helped, or the help has actually seemed to complicate things, and they're confused and sad about that. I've seen people in this category now, this other group of people, who have become as unhealthy or more unhealthy in their efforts to help the unhealthy person, and most of whom at the beginning of their process are unaware of their own issues. They don't know what's going on with themselves because this other person over here that they love and care about is acting out, is negative, is trapped, is stuck, and it just gives them a convenient way to look over here. I mean, it gives them opportunities all over the place just to keep looking over here but not at their own stuff. A couple weeks ago, I was having lunch with Dave, and he was telling me about what would now be last week's sermon and also the schedule of messages that would be coming up now in the next few weeks. And I said to him, well, what about the four to five other people who care about that person that Dave has been talking about? And they don't know what to do or they've tried to do and it hasn't helped. Tried to help and it hasn't helped. And they're in incredible pain themselves. What about the spouse who thinks that somehow their spouse's behavior is their responsibility and they've caused it and it's their job to prevent it? Where does help for them fit in? And Dave said, you want to preach next week? and I said sure so here I am but I want to say that as I was preparing this and thinking about this I was thinking to talk about recovery to talk about issues like addiction or codependency or enabling or dysfunction those kind of words that maybe for some of you are real familiar and others have come to become a trite thing or whatever to talk about that, that's not new here We've been talking about that for a long time. I've been saying things like that. You can see me on video on a Wednesday night talk about this stuff, and maybe this isn't worth talking about. Maybe I shouldn't do this. And then I thought back about the fact that I think the last time that I said this kind of material about codependency and enabling and dysfunction, those kind of things, from the pulpit, from up here, was when we were in the Crystal Building, which was in 1985. was the last time we met there, so I think probably some of you weren't there when we had that talk. So I decided that this was a worthwhile thing to talk about, and if you've heard this, bear with me. First thing I want to do today is I want to tell you about family relationships as systems, family and church relationships as systems, so you can understand what I mean when I say family systems, because I think that it's important to understand not just the person's issue, but the issues that are present in the system, because this is not about identifying a person who happens sometimes to be very easy to identify and then fixing them and putting them back in a system where no impact has been made, because what we've seen now in the field is that people get sick again. I also want to explain why perhaps your help hasn't helped, even though you've tried and you've tried and tried, it hasn't helped. And the last thing I want to do is talk about the need for everybody to be in their own healing and recovery process versus putting our health on hold, waiting for somebody else's life to straighten out or waiting for somebody else's problems to get better so that when they're better, then we're better. Everybody needs to be in their own process. Now, this is a big task, and I've run out of time twice so far this weekend on this. And the first time I really wasn't okay with that, and the last time I really was because I have decided that I'm just going to give as much as I can give, and then when time's up, we're going to go home. so I'd like to pray though that God would edit this Lord thank you for this time and you know the needs of the people here and I don't I just have so much stuff and I just think it's so important and I know that you do too but I also know that you can make this time custom made for the people who are here and I pray that you would do that and that you would set me free from being distracted about the length of this or the time and that we would hear today what you want us to hear and leave the rest out. In Jesus' name, amen. Okay, let me briefly tell you about family systems. When I say that families and churches are systems, I'm talking about systems of relationships. And my definition for a system is that a system is simply a group of interrelated, interdependent parts, which means that there's not one part of the system that isn't affected by or that doesn't affect all the other parts. People are not isolated in their families. They're not just individuals. They are individuals, but they're also connected up with everybody else. Their system, same thing in the church. And when one part is affected, all the parts are affected. We have school system, that's a good word, school systems, where we have teachers and parents and students and bus drivers and cooks and taxpayers. And when one part of the system is affected, the rest of the parts are affected. So tomorrow morning, if the cooks decide to stay home from school, you parents are going to be affected because you're going to have to be home and make little lunches for your kids and send them. And if the bus drivers decide not to show up, you're going to have to get in the car and take your kids to school. And if a referendum comes up to raise some money for activities at the school and the taxpayers decide that that's too much to pay and they vote it down, then people at the school, students, teachers, are going to be affected. And if they decide that's a worthwhile thing and vote yes, then people are going to be affected as well. That's the nature of systems. The human body is a system, actually, made up of different systems. So we have a skeletal and muscular and respiratory and circulatory system, and all of those systems make up a body which is a system. And when part of the body is affected, all the parts are affected. The whole body is affected. A friend of mine went to Belize, where we're going to be going on Tuesday, and came back with an intestinal kind of amoeba or something, you know. And it wasn't just his stomach that was sick. This guy was sick. He lost weight all over his body. Do you understand? Not just in his stomach. Because all of him was sick. I was pounding a board together a couple years ago, two 2x4s. I was trying to pound them together in the form of a T, like just nail one on the end of the other. And what I've learned since then, and probably because of then, actually, is that you're supposed to put them down on the ground and then just put that board there and nail it like this. But, of course, I was holding it straight up and balancing the second 2x4 on top of the board and holding the nail at the same time. And I hit it and missed the nail and hit my finger. And when I did that, my knees buckled automatically, and tears came out of my eyes, and words came out of my mouth. And all of that happened right now because it wasn't just my finger that was affected. That's the point. I did not say, oh, my finger hurts. How shall I, the rational, Jeff, Okay, respond to this. All of me was affected because the human body is a system, and all the parts are affected when one member is affected. Now, there's a scripture that talks about systems, several of them. They don't use the word system, but they do communicate the concept. And one of the places is in 1 Corinthians 12, when it talks about the body of Christ, which is made up of many members but one body, and when one member suffers, all suffer with it. It does not say when one of the members suffers, all should suffer, all might suffer, or all could suffer. It says when one suffers, all suffer. It's just a statement. And if someone over here in the body of Christ is being affected somehow and they're wounded or they're stuck or whatever, those of you over here are going to be affected even if you never know about that person, even if it's just about the energy level that people have to contribute to the body of Christ, even if it's just that. One of the passages that talks about systems thinking is in Galatians 5, when Paul says, don't you know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? And he's talking about legalism that has permeated the churches in the region of Galatia. And when he says a little leaven leavens the whole lump, once again he doesn't say a little leaven could leaven the lump, it should leaven the lump, it might leaven the lump. He says leaven leavens, period. It just does. And what they used to do with bread is they used to put together dough that didn't have leaven in it, and they'd put a little piece of leavened dough into that un-leavened dough, and it would leaven the whole lump. And then before they baked it, they'd break off a little piece of leavened dough and save it over here, bake the bread, then they'd make some more un-leavened dough later on, take this little piece of dough that was leavened, stuff it in the un-leavened dough, it would leaven the whole lump, they'd break off a piece, save a piece, bake the leavened lump and so on. And all it took to leaven the whole lump was just a little bitty piece of leavened dough, that's all. It didn't take mostly leaven. Another place that leaven is talked about is in 1 Corinthians 5, which is about pornea. And in the church at Corinth, Paul says it's actually reported that immorality exists among you in such a kind that doesn't even exist among the Gentiles that someone has his father's wife, which now I would say that would be incest. That would be my word for that, incest. Someone's being incestuous. And, of course, the Corinthians were so forgiving and they were so understanding and they were just so spiritual that they didn't even deal with this or see it. They just were just letting this go. And Paul says, don't you know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? Now, one of the ways when I was a kid growing up that I was taught that leaven leaven was we were supposed to stay away from everybody who didn't look or act or dress or talk like we did, which was pretty much everybody, okay? Because what happened is that this stuff would rub off on you. If you hang around this person, you might end up doing what they do. Like we don't have choices, almost. But that's not, I don't think that's the kind of leaven that Paul's talking about at Corinth. It's not like, here's this family being incestuous, and so we're over here and we go, well, you know, if that's okay, then it's okay for all of us. And pretty soon the whole church is being incestuous. I don't think that's the kind of leaven Paul's talking about in this case, although there is that kind of leaven. The kind of leaven I'm talking about in this case is that I think that the energy and the emotions and the effort it takes to not deal with stuff in families and in churches is more energy and effort than it would take to just deal with stuff. So you're using up all kinds of energy that would be better used to deal with it if you're not dealing with it. And actually, my bias is it takes more energy to not deal with stuff because when you don't deal with it, you get to have it tomorrow and then you get to have it the next day. You get to deal with it every day over and over and over again. And so even though you won't end up doing the same behavior, the fact that you're having to use up energy and emotions and brain cells not seeing stuff, you've been leavened anyway. You've still been leavened. But these are just statements. It's just the idea of how systems work. What are dynamics within systems? I want to show you some pictures of some systems here. The first system is what I call the ultimate healthy family system. This is a five-member system. All the members have relationships with everybody else. Everybody talks to everybody. else. Everybody shares with everybody. If you have a problem, you share it with everybody. Everybody gives them help. Emotions are going in all directions. Needing help is doing in all directions. And giving help is going in all directions. And there's no such family as this family. There's no such family as this family. My family does not look like this family. My family does not look look like this family there are no families here that look like this family. My family looks like this family sometimes sometimes but most of the time it doesn't look like this and the reason is is because a little leaven leavens the whole lump and so this little person here with the arrow that's a person who for some reason malfunctions in this system means that for some reason in their life they're not as efficient or as productive as they were before which brings the level of activity in the family down uh two and a half years ago i had a disc rupture which meant that i had to lay down for two months. Doctor said, lay down. So I laid down. Had the surgery in December. Laid down for January and most of February. I became the Midwest Headquarters for Information on the Gulf War. Seriously. I sat and watched CNN all day long. Watched CNN. Beverly Hillbillies once in a while. But CNN most of the time. And this is true. People would call me when they got home from work and they'd say, what happened today? And then I would tell them. I did not feel like reading my Bible and praying all day long. Like people said, I was, oh, what a great opportunity this is going to be for you to really get. I was ticked at God. I didn't get it. But I knew about the Gulf War. The point is that now I'm a less efficient, less productive member of my system. And if my family is going to function as productively and efficient as efficiently as it did before I hurt my back, somebody's going to have to adjust and do more to accommodate the fact that I'm doing less. So I call that a functional adjustment. And what that looks like is that I kind of take the center place of my family and my family revolves around me for a while and caters to me and accommodates me and picks up my job. So if it's my job to do the garbage, somebody else does the garbage. If my job is to do the shopping, somebody else does the shopping. So all the jobs still get done, even though I'm not producing. This is normal. You know why? A little 11-11 is a whole lump. It's going to happen. When one member suffers, I'll suffer with it. It's going to happen. After six weeks, seven weeks, my back gets better. I get up off the sofa, start taking back my jobs again, and the system goes back to looking like this. It readjusts until the next thing happens. Now, the next thing could be that our oldest daughter went on a short-term mission trip to Haiti for two weeks. Now, physically, geographically, she's not even in the picture anymore. She's removed someplace else, but even though physically she was not in the picture, she still was a big topic of conversation in our family because we had a bunch of people doing jobs that weren't their jobs. If these jobs are going to get accomplished, somebody else is going to have to do them because she's not there to do them. It's normal. So we adjust it. She comes back, takes back her jobs, family readjusts. Now, Tuesday we're going to Belize. Everybody in my family is going to Belize, except the daughter who went to Haiti, which means that now all those jobs, All the jobs. Every job is going to be her job. And she's going to have to adjust to accommodate our absence. I mean, we still have garbage. We still have cleaning. We still have cooking. We still have laundry. We have a black lab. We have a mother cat and two seven-month-old kittens. We have four-week-old kittens. By the way, if anybody wants a kitten, we got them. They're great. They're great. Because if all those jobs are going to be finished, accomplished, somebody's going to have to do them because we're not doing them. And then when we come back from Belize, maybe we'll take back our jobs. Maybe we won't. That's just normal stuff, you see. And so the point I want to make here is that my definition of health, a healthy family, is a family that can adjust and readjust. That's all. A healthy church is a church that can adjust to accommodate and deal with and compensate for struggles and wounds and then readjust. Health is not problemless. Health is not no struggles. There is no such thing as a family without problems. There is no such church that is a problemless church. There are no families in churches that don't have struggles. A healthy family and church is a church that can adjust to accommodate and deal with the problems and the struggles that are normal, that are going to be there. If there weren't problems in the church, Paul wouldn't have had to write most of the things he wrote. And then when it's dealt with, it can readjust until the next thing comes up. But let's say that this person here now with the arrow on them, now we're not talking about a malfunction like a back or somebody's being absent like going to Haiti. Now we're talking about somebody who's addicted or who is irresponsible chronically or stuck or living in sin habitually or whatever. And what's going to happen is as that person pursues this other way, people in the family system are going to notice a distance and a disconnection. And that person's not going to be such a good contributor to the family. And they're not going to be pouring their energy into this system. They're going to be chasing this stuff over here. People are going to notice. But if the jobs are going to get done, somebody's going to have to do them. because the efficiency is going down, and so to accommodate that, people do more. Even with alcoholism, even with sin, even with people who just choose not to do what their job is. I mean, I suppose that after six weeks, I could have said to myself, you know, I kind of like laying around here on the sofa, so I'm going to just pretend to be sick, even though I'm not anymore, because this is kind of a good deal. And you know what? If people would have kept the jobs and not tried to give them back to me, they'd still be doing them today. They would. There's another adjustment that takes place, though, and I call that a psycho-emotional adjustment. And a psycho-emotional adjustment simply means that in this system, you see, it's not okay to notice things because if you notice things, you become the problem. So people pretend not to feel what they feel and not to think what they think and not to see what they see Because if they see it and think it and feel it, they're the issue, so they shut up. And they might even be in touch with what the issues are, and they may even be over here with this group of people, telling them very clearly all the stuff that's happening over here, but they can't do it over here because if they do, they're in trouble. So they shut down, they adjust. They act like what matters doesn't matter, and they don't notice what they do notice. And it's conceivable and very common, actually, for families and people and families to get so good at doing the jobs of the other person that the other person doesn't get to get their jobs back. There's a difference between a ruptured disc and alcoholism or workaholism or any other issue, sexual addiction, or a person who just is being irresponsible. And the difference is that when you leave a ruptured disc alone, it gets better. When you leave those issues alone, they get worse. I have seen people who have gone to treatment for their issues and they come back and their family members have gotten so good at doing the jobs that they even want the jobs back and can't get them back they want to be involved in the finances they want to be involved in the parenting and the decisions but these people have gotten so good at it that there's a tug of war now when a system adjusts to accommodate the behavior of this person the person doesn't have to change or get better. I think that it's impossible for a person, any person, I think it's impossible for a person to live in a destructive or irresponsible way to continue to do that unless somebody else around them, a person or a group of people, are bailing them out from the consequences that they should be getting for living that way. Let me say that again. It's impossible for a person to continue to live in a harmful, irresponsible, destructive way, to continue to live that way, unless they have someone in their life or a group of people rescuing them from the consequences that they should be getting for acting that way. Now, this brings me to a recovery word. It's the word enabling. Now, some of you know that word, and those of you who know that word know that's the evil E word, and if you're in recovery and you're in family systems, you don't want to be this, an enabler. You know, that's the, ooh. But, see, I think enabling has gotten a bad rap, actually, because in a generic sense, all enabling means is equipping or helping. If you enable someone, you just equip them or help them. In this sense I'm talking about today, though, where it has a negative connotation, enabling means, my definition is, unhelpful or harmful help with good intentions. unhelpful or harmful help good intentions unhelpful help means help that doesn't help so a person's given all kinds of help but it doesn't help harmful help means not only does the help they're giving not help but it actually helps the situation continue or even get worse harmful help with good intentions means these aren't people who are thinking to themselves how can i do the worst thing for my loved one these are people who are thinking how can i do the best thing. How can I meet this person's need? How can I help? They care, but it doesn't help or it hurts. When parents blame their teenager's peer group for the behavior of their teenager, that's enabling. It's unhelpful help. It's unhelpful thinking. It's always baffling to me that how big parents react to when their teenager blames their friends or their peer group. You know, well, why did you do that? Well, all my friends are doing it. They let him do this, or they let her do this, all my friends. And then the parents say, well, we don't want to hear about your friends. It's not their fault. You're responsible. That's what parents say. And then when the parents go to church and their friends say, well, I heard your son or daughter was kind of having some trouble here. What's going on? And the parents say, well, you know, they're hanging around this group of friends over here. So it's okay for the parents to put it on the peers, but it's not okay for the teenager to put it on the peers. But the issue is it's not the peers. It's the teenager. When a pastor talks or shames a battered wife into returning to the domestic abuser, it's enabling. It's unhelpful, harmful help to both people in that scenario. When a teenager pours their parents' alcohol down the drain in an effort to try to control their parents' drinking or waters it down to make it so that they don't drink quite so much or when you get in a car with somebody who's been drinking instead of saying, I won't ride with you because you've been drinking. It's enabling. When a lawyer gets someone out of a drunk driving charge and they were drunk driving, that's enabling. In my family system where I grew up, we did not have an alcoholic in the middle or a sex addict or a religious fanatic or a workaholic. We just had a dad that was very grumpy and easily offended. And our family tiptoed around him because it was our responsibility to make sure that he didn't have a temper tantrum. So his anger was not his responsibility. It was ours. It was our job to make sure he didn't go in the bedroom angry and leave us. You know, it was our job. And then my mom would run messages between my dad and me, and she'd nice them up. So he'd say mean stuff, and then she'd nice them up and run it to me, and then I'd say mean stuff back again, and then she'd nice them up and go tell him. And you know what? She did that with good intentions. The reason why she did that was because it was important to her. It broke her heart that her husband and her son weren't having a relationship. But do you want to know the irony of this? When she did that, all she did was make sure that we never had to have a relationship. Unhelpful, harmful help with good intentions. I had a woman come to me from another church, and the problem that she came, why are you here? She said, I'm here to get you to help me, get Jeff to help her, to get her husband to go to church more. Because he wasn't wanting to go, and she's been trying to get him to go for 10 years, and she's running out of gas, and he's getting bigger about refusing, and now she wants me to come and help her get him to go. I said, well, why don't you just let him stay home? How about an hour or 45 minutes before you leave, whenever there's still time for him to get ready, just say, I'm leaving in 45 minutes. Would you like to go? If he says yes, go. If he says no, leave him home. Well, what would that look like? What would people think? Well, they'd think the truth. Well, what's the truth? She said that. What's the truth? And you know what? For some people, it's been a lot of time has gone by since they really looked inside and said, wait a minute, what's the truth? What is the truth? Well, the truth is that this guy cares about watching cartoons on Sunday morning instead of going to church, and that's what they'd think. Well, what if they ask me where he is? Tell the truth. Well, what would I tell him? Say, my husband isn't here because he likes professional wrestling better than he likes church. Well, what'd they think? That's what they'd think. Well, you know, I'm going to this Friday night Bible study, and I've been dragging him there, and he doesn't want to go there either, and as a matter of fact, he can't even stand the people that are there. What should I do about that? Go without him. Well, what if they ask where he is? Say he doesn't want to come anymore, and he's never like you anyway, and he decided to stay home. Well, what would they think? They'd think the truth. Well, that would look awful. It is awful. You know what? I bet he'd go. I bet if she said, sweetie, I'm going tonight, and if they ask me why you're not there, I'm telling them the truth. You don't like them. I bet he'd go. And you know what, though? He'd go for the wrong reason. Right? He'd go to cover his tracks. But you know what? Him covering his tracks is better than her covering his tracks. It is. I have an article I want to read you. It's about a guy named Walter Hudson. This was in People Magazine. Walter Hudson. Strange as it may sound, Walter Hudson never thought he had a weight problem before that terrible morning a few weeks back when he slipped and fell on the way to the bathroom and could not get up. His sister Barbara phoned for help. The police, firefighters, and assorted emergency personnel who converged on the little red brick house found Hudson, 42, sprawled on his gargantuan belly in the doorway to his bedroom. It took him almost three hours to cut away the door frame and ease him onto wooden planks. Eight people were needed to hoist him back in bed. Guy weighs 1,200 pounds. Just died recently. Fact is, Hudson is always pretty calm. Though he hasn't left the house for 27 years, he's been happy, quote-unquote, happy as a shut-in, first in his parents' house in Brooklyn, and since 1970 in the Hempstead bungalow he shares with his brother George, 47, and Barbara, 45, and Barbara's child and grandchild. Comforted by the Bible, I'm thrilled to death that that's in there. I mean, comforted by the Bible, which he reads every day, and so steadily supplied with food from the family. You know what? How do you stay in the house for 27 years and never get out of bed unless someone's helping you do that? And do you think that the people in this person's life didn't think that he had a weight problem? Really? They didn't notice this. he's content to while away the days on his queen-sized bed but the accident gave Hudson an unpleasant insight into his own mortality I thought to myself if there would have been a fire that'd be it he says there's no way I could have gotten out of that house so I decided right then and there I'm going on a diet well dozens of experts from Richard Simmons to Overeaters Anonymous called to offer help Hudson settled on Dick Gregory Now, does anybody remember Dick Gregory? Who remembers Dick Gregory? Dick Gregory was a 1960s and 70s black activist war protester comic. I mean, this is a guy who had his face printed on dollar bills and got busted for counterfeiting. Hudson settled on Dick Gregory, the ex-comic who now runs a nutrition clinic in the Bahamas. this man needs help said Gregory even I was shocked when I first walked through the door and saw him laying there first step was to find out how much weight there was to lose a squad of weightlifters helped Hudson onto a special thousand pound scale when it trembled and broke Gregory judged him to be in the 1,200 pound range, the fattest man in the world, according to the Guinness Book of Records, weighed 1,400 pounds. Hudson takes every blame for every ounce. Well, those of you who diet know how helpful that is. When you're beating yourself up for how much you weigh, it doesn't help you lose weight, it helps you eat. It was overeating, pure and simple, he admits. Then he recites the menu for an average day. Breakfast, two boxes of sausage, one pound of bacon, one dozen eggs, and a loaf of bread. Lunch, four Big Macs, four double cheeseburgers, eight large fries. Dinner, three large ham steaks, two chickens, four baked potatoes, four sweet potatoes, four heads of broccoli. Well, at least he gets his greens. Typically, Hudson washes down each for past with six quart-sized bottles of soda and follows it with the better part of a large cake. He also snacks, it says. Walter is addicted to food, says Gregory. Now, there's two things that he said that have really been... What was the first thing? He needs help. He's prescribed an 1,800-calorie-a-day regimen of protein supplements and fruit juices. Six trained aides will be supervising Hudson, but the key to the diet's success, Gregory says, is to find out what made this happen. What caused Walter to be satisfied to be locked away for so long? It had to be something pretty traumatic. Hudson, the youngest of nine kids, doesn't remember his childhood as unhappy, though his parents did separate at some point. Now, there are people here who, when you were children, your parents separated. Do you remember that as unhappy? I mean, like, could we categorize that as traumatic to a person? Yes, this guy doesn't remember that. That was okay. No biggie. He already weighed 300 pounds when at age 13 a fall laid him up for several months. That may have got me thinking, quote, that it was easier to just stay in bed. he says. Walter is such a happy person and he enjoys food so much, I guess we didn't realize how much it was hurting him, says George, his brother. Sister Barbara, a nurse, a nurse, says I was aware, of course, that Walter needed to lose some weight, but I was also aware that a proper diet would require intense medical supervision and we could never afford it. Well, let me ask you a question. How much does two boxes of sausage, one pound of bacon, one dozen eggs, four. I didn't do this. I wish I would have taken time to do this, to go to the grocery store, the calculator, and just figure out what this costs to feed this person each day, every day. And I'll bet that you could afford a really, really expensive therapist for that amount of money. They couldn't afford to get him help, but they could afford to keep feeding him. Now Dick Gregory will be picking up most of Hudson's bills. Getting even close to his target weight of 190 pounds will take years, but Hudson is determined to get back into the world as an example to, quote, all the people out there who have been hiding who are bigger than me. Well, there's only one. A Chicago tailor has made him a special pair of 103-inch waist trousers who hasn't worn clothes in 17 years. This is a tragedy. It's hilarious, too. But it's a tragedy. It is. This is wrong. And this person was surrounded with people who cared about him and who helped him with good intentions and the help hurt. That's enabling. On a serious note, more serious note, I have heard story after story from women who believed and had been told by pastors and counselors, etc., that the reason why their husband was acting out sexually with or without somebody else was because they themselves weren't performing well enough sexually. Women who have lost weight or gained weight or bought new wardrobes or read offensive sexual books or watching offensive, degrading videotapes with their husbands, trying to keep them from being inappropriate. This is enabling. You know, you may have some issues that you need to look at and work on, you yourself, but you need to understand that your spouse's sexual behavior or any other kind of behavior is absolutely their responsibility, not yours. there is no good enough reason for someone to be unfaithful to their spouse. Even if that person won't be sexual, there's no good enough reason. People are responsible for their own behaviors. Why do people enable? Well, one reason is because we just don't know what we're dealing with. Sometimes we look at an issue and we just don't even know what it is. We don't know how to help. Another reason is because we've bought the lie that we are powerful enough to control the behaviors of another human being and worse than that, it's even our job too. It's our job. Another reason is because we're so embarrassed and ashamed by the behavior of our loved one that it would be too painful to let other people find out about it or see it so we just cover it up. And actually, funneling all of our emotions and our energy toward our loved one provides a way for us to not look at our own stuff. so you see it only takes about three ingredients in a person's life to become profoundly affected by the behaviors of your loved one one is that you have to care all you have to do is care if you don't care you won't be affected probably but if you care you probably will because you care second ingredient is that you have to not know what you're dealing with you have to be ill-informed or uninformed about what it is exactly that you're dealing with because if you care but you don't know what you're dealing with, you'll be affected even more, and chances are you'll try to help because you do care, and then the help will miss the problem because you don't know what it is. And the third is shame, or in this case, a sense that the other person's problem or the other person's behavior has the power to say something negative about you. If you care about a person, you're not exactly sure what it is you're looking at here, and you have a sense that that person's behavior has the power to say something negative about you, you're going to be profoundly affected by that problem. I need to make a clarification at this point. I do not want to communicate that this four to five other people I'm talking about here are in their condition because of the identified person, just like I don't want to say that the identified person is in their condition because of these other four or five people. Everybody is responsible for their choices, for their condition, and for their recovery. In an alcoholic family system, we call the non-recovering dependent person dependent because they're dependent on the chemical for their high, so when they have the chemical, they're high, and when they don't, they're low. They're the dependent person. A workaholic person is dependent, we call them dependent, because they're dependent on their job for their high, so when they're working, they're high, and when they're not, they're low. Which means that if I'm having a struggle here and pain here and questions here, I'll just go to work. You get stroked like crazy and get a bunch of money that says I'm okay? the word we use to describe the non-recovering family members of this person or loved ones is codependent it's unfortunate that that word has gotten so hooked up with the thinking about alcoholism and chemical dependency because it's much bigger than that and actually the word codependent kind of sounds like it's a second class problem not really an official thing we call the person codependent because they're dependent upon the dependent person for their high they're dependent on the behavior or the performance of their loved one for their high so when their loved one is looking good and being great and doing swell and trying hard and making promises and buckling down see then the codependent person is high and when that person falls short and tells another lie and doesn't follow through and gets back into the old behavior, then the codependent person is low. So their highs are based on the behavior of the other person. Codependency is dependency. It's dependency. What it is is it's relationship-dependent. It's people addiction. It's being addicted to impression management. You know people who are addicted to impression management? They get their highs from making everybody think things are a certain way. And if they can't, they're low. And I'm here to say that regardless of what you call it, it can be, and for a lot of families is, the overpowering dynamic of the family system, even without the presence of a chemical user. I know churches and families that elevate codependency to a virtue. This is the way to be. And people spend their whole lives trying to be this. Addicted to over-responsible pretending in the name of Jesus. What a coup. What a coup Satan has pulled. Now we've talked a lot about in the last weeks the person with the problem, particularly sexual. In the last little piece I have left, I want to offer some suggestions to the four or five now, the other people who care and want to help and don't know how. First, you don't have to rescue, bail out, or explain your loved one. You don't have to do that. You can choose to do that, but you don't have to do that. They don't determine your value. Jesus does, but that's so hard because, you know what, you can't see Jesus and you can see your loved one and you can see everybody's faces and hear everybody's opinions regarding that, and now we're supposed to get our sense of value and acceptance from a place we can't see. Yes, but that's hard. We need help. We need support in doing that. find people who remind you that you don't have to fix or bail out your loved one in the story of the prodigal son in Luke 15 it says and when he came to his senses he went home the verse right before that and when he came to his senses the verse says and no one was giving him anything and when he came to his senses he went home see I think that for a lot of Christians we've been taught that the virtuous, really good thing is to stand in the middle of people getting their consequences so that they don't. You know, be good Samaritans. Pick them up and carry them the extra mile and pay the bill. Well, there's a difference between getting beat up by the road by burglars and being addicted or chronically irresponsible, and that is that the person who gets beat up by the road knows he has a problem and wants help. But isn't the good Samaritan the hero? Yeah, the good Samaritan in that story is the hero in Luke 10. But addicted, irresponsible, living in sin, habitually, chronically sinful people need a whole bunch of good Samaritans around them to pick up the bills and explain things and carry them the extra mile because then they get to do what they're doing. Next, realize that you're powerless to fix the other person. You are incapable of fixing anybody else. If you don't believe that, then you just have to go try that some more until you figure that out. There's nothing I'm going to say that's going to convince you. go try but let me ask you a question do you think that God can fix your loved one even without your help? really? really? and I have people come to my office and they say you know, I'm just trusting God with my husband or wife I'm just trusting God and I'm letting God do it all and I'm not doing anything and at the same time that they're just trusting God for their loved one and letting God do all the work they're doing all the work they're making all the calls, they're making all the explanations they're the person's defense attorney they're making sure nobody gets the wrong idea, which would probably be the right idea anyway. So here's the question. If you're just trusting God to do all the work and you're doing all the work, who is God? Find and lean on some graceful, honest people who will remind you that the cross is where your value in life is from, not this other person. Once again, here's this person that's such a convenient place to look because they're just bleeding all over the place. They're struggling like crazy. But that's not where we're to look. We're to look here. You're going to need people who will give you permission to let out on the outside the sadness and grief and anger that hasn't been safe to let out before. You're going to need people who remind you when you're acting more powerful than you are. Like, take a break. It's okay. You don't have to. It's okay. People who will truthfully and gracefully confront your dishonest, delusional, codependent thinking. I have found that people who struggle with codependency are easily as wrapped up in denial and delusion in their thinking as any addicted person I ever met. You know why? Because codependency is dependency. I'm going to close with a couple of stories. A couple comes in my office. What's going on? He's the problem. If he changed, if he changed, if he changed, I'd be okay. If she's the problem, if she'd change, I'd be okay. My question is, how are you going to be a healthy person even if the other person doesn't change? Now, this happens over and over again in my office. And what also happens is that when I ask that question, how are you going to be healthy even if they don't change? They may never change. You know, they have a choice in this. They may decide not to get better or not to deal with this. How are you going to be okay? And people go, what? Like it never occurred to them that their health is not this other person's issue. What? How are you going to be a healthy mom or dad or parent to your other kids or friend to your friends or Christian man or woman even if this person doesn't get fixed? Is that possible? Parents drag their teenager in and throw him in a chair. Fix the teenager. What's sad about that is that when the teenager is depressed or sad or lonely or angry or something, we don't bring them in. But as soon as they do something on the outside that's bad PR for the family, You know, you get a haircut that looks like this or get caught smoking dope. Something that reflects badly or hooks has the power to say something negative about us. You see, then the kid's in the chair and then we say, fix the kid. And I say, well, how are you going to be healthy parents even if this person doesn't change? I mean, they have a choice in this. They may decide not to cooperate with this. How are you going to be a healthy husband and wife to each other? And healthy parents to your other kids? And healthy people in the church? How are you going to be healthy if this person never changes? And they go, what? It never occurred to them that their health was their responsibility, not the responsibility of their teenager. And, of course, when this is happening, the teenager is kind of perking up, you know, because he's thinking he's off the hook. He's going, yeah, get off my case. Jeff said so. But if these parents hear what I'm talking about in a little bit of time here, this person is going to be more on the hook than they were when they started because their problem is going to end up being their problem. Right now it's their parents. How are you going to have a good night's sleep even if they choose not to come home? Wow. Is that possible? Can you be a healthy dad, mom, son, daughter, spouse, friend, honest, emotionally, and spiritually, even before your loved one changes or even if they never do? I am not saying let's just all be so healthy that we don't care or we're not affected by the pain of those around us. That is not possible. You can't not care about someone you care about. As a matter of fact, caring so much is what gets us hooked in this way in the first place. I'm just saying that your health has to come off a hold and be your responsibility instead of the other person's. What if they never get well? Can you be well? Yes. Yeah, the answer is yes. We have a Heavenly Father who is full of grace and truth. We have a Holy Spirit who is here to lead us into all truth. We have a Savior that hung on the cross that says that we're valid and acceptable even if this process starts to look pretty messy, which if you start to deal with stuff, it's going to, and we need people to remind us of that. And we have resources in the body of Christ, in this body of Christ, in the community. And if you're stuck with this and you can't just say, oh, Jeff said this, I'm going to go change. You know, some people can. I've given this talk or said this in a counseling session, and people go, oh, I didn't know I was doing that. Okay, and they change. But if you can't do that, then find a group of people that can support you in this because this is going to be really hard. And if you're still stuck, find a counselor. So that when you do come to help this person, you're helping out of fullness instead of helping to get full. You can't give away what you don't have. Let's pray. Lord, I just pray that you'd give all of us courage to look into our own hearts and our own lives and see what issues are there and then pursue whatever help we need to untangle that and to get on to our own process. And remind us when we have the stance that Peter had in John 21 where he says, Lord, what about John? What are you going to do with John? And Jesus says, you follow me. I'll take care of John. Help us remember that, that our spirituality and our health is our job and to look to you for that instead of looking to people around us. Give us courage to pursue this. In Jesus' name, amen. Thank you.
