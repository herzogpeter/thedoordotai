Now, we're going to talk about the concept of enabling now. And when I use that word enabling, generically speaking, just generally speaking, if you looked up enabling in the dictionary, it would be more of a positive term. It would be equipping or helping something happen, supporting something. But in the field of counseling, in the field of family systems theory, enabling is the E word. It's not a good word. And what I mean when I say enabling is that enabling is unhelpful or harmful help. Unhelpful or harmful help. And then this would be the little kicker on the end. With good intentions. Unhelpful or harmful help with good intentions. Now, what this means is that we're not talking about people here who are trying to do bad stuff. We're talking about people here who really believe that they're doing the best thing and that what they're doing will actually help. But it doesn't help, and even more so, not only does it not help, but sometimes it even helps the problem continue or makes it worse. So that's what enabling is. I want to read an article to you that some of you maybe have heard me read before, but it's an example of enabling, I think. It's an article out of People magazine, and it's about this guy who weighed 1,200 pounds. His name is Walter Hudson. And it says, the article, the little caption above it says, Trouble. After 27 years in his bedroom, 1,200-pound Walter Hudson decides to take a load off. And actually, this guy just died about six months ago. Strange as it may sound, Walter Hudson never thought he had a weight problem before that terrible morning a few weeks back when he slipped and fell in the way from the bathroom and couldn't get up. His sister Barbara phoned for help. the police, firefighters, and assorted emergency room personnel who converged on a little red brick house in Hempstead, Long Island, found Hudson, age 42, sprawled on his belly in the doorway to his bedroom. It took them almost three hours to cut away the doorframe and ease them onto wooden planks. Eight people were needed to hoist him back into bed. The thing that amazed me about this whole ordeal, says Hempstead Fire Chief Robert Grams, is that he stayed so calm. The fact is, Hudson is always calm, with the look of Buddha-like serenity gracing his features. Though he hasn't left his house for 27 years. Now, remember what the definition of enabling is. It's unhelpful or harmful help with good intentions. Now, I want to ask you a question. How do you not leave your house for 27 years unless someone's helping you do that? Understand? So somebody's helping him do this. And probably, when they weren't with him, they were probably all over here talking about how worried they were about him not leaving the house for 27 years. He's been happy as a shut-in, first in his parents' house in Brooklyn and since 1970 in his bungalow. He shares with his brother, George, age 47, and Barbara, 45, and Barbara's children and grandchild. Comforted by the Bible, which he reads every day, and steadily supplied with food by the family. There it is. Hudson was content to while away the days in his queen-sized bed, but the accident gave Hudson an unpleasant insight in his own mortality. I thought to myself, if there had been a fire, that would have been it, he says. There's no way I could have gotten out of that house, so I decided right then and there I'm going on a diet. Dozens of experts from Richard Simmons to Overeaters Anonymous called to offer help. Hudson settled on Dick Gregory, 55, the ex-comic. Anybody remember Dick Gregory? This is a guy who in his 60s had his face printed on dollar bills and got in trouble for counterfeiting as a prank. Dick Gregory, the ex-comic who now runs a nutrition clinic in the Bahamas. From the start, I like Dick's outlook, Hudson explains. He didn't try to be high and mighty with me. High and mighty hell, laughs Gregory. This man doesn't need words. He needs help. Even I was shocked when I first walked through the door and saw him lying there. But Gregory was also impressed by Hudson's gentle spirit. I really grew to respect him, says Gregory, so I decided the least I could do was help him lose weight. The first step was to find out just how much there was to lose. A squad of weightlifters helped Hudson onto a special 1,000-pound scale. When it trembled and broke, Gregory judged him to be in the 1,200-pound range. Parentheses. The fattest man in the world, according to the Guinness Book of World Records, weighed in at 1,400 pounds. Hudson takes the blame for every ounce. Well, see, that doesn't tend to help people who struggle with their weight because one of the things they do with food is they mood alter, and so if you're taking the blame for every ounce, it just gives you an opportunity to mood alter out of some blame. Understand that? Short talk on eating issues. It was overeating, pure and simple, he admits. Then he recites the menu for an average day. Breakfast, two boxes of sausages, one pound of bacon, one dozen eggs, a loaf of bread. Lunch, four Big Macs, four double cheeseburgers, eight large fries. dinner. Three large ham steaks, two chickens, four baked potatoes, four sweet potatoes, four heads of broccoli. Typically, Hudson washes down each repast with six quart-sized bottles of soda and follows it with the better part of a large cake. He also snacks. Walter's addicted to food, says Gregory, the big expert from the Bahamas. who was prescribed an 1,800-calorie-a-day regimen of protein supplements and fruit juices. Six trained aides will be supervising Hudson, but the key to the diet's success, Gregory, is to find out what made this happen. What has caused Walter to be satisfied, to be locked away for so long? It had to be something pretty traumatic. Hudson, the youngest of nine kids, doesn't remember his childhood as unhappy, though his parents did separate at some point. Now you see, any of you have that, a memory in your life of your parents separating as not being unhappy? See, he remembers that his parents separated, but he's not unhappy about it. So there's something else going on here too. He already weighed 300 pounds when at age 13 a fall laid him up for several months. That may have got me thinking that it was easier just to stay in bed, he says. Walter is such a happy person and he enjoys food so much, I guess we didn't realize how much it was hurting him, says George, a security guard. Sister Barbara, a nurse, now says, I was aware, of course, that Walter needed to lose some weight, but I was also aware that a proper diet would require intense medical supervision and we could never afford it. Well, now Barbara, how much do you think two boxes of sausage, one pound of bacon, one dozen eggs, a loaf of bread, four Big Macs, four double cheeseburgers, eight large fries, three large hamsteaks, two chickens, four baked potatoes, four sweet potatoes, four heads of broccoli, six bottles of pop, a cake, and snacks cost a day. You could buy a pretty good psychiatrist for that price. Do you understand? Easy and have change. Now Dick Gregory will be picking up most of the bills. Getting even close to his target weight of 190 pounds will take years, but Hudson is determined to get back into the world. As an example, to all the, quote, people out there who are bigger than me, well, there's only one. Chicago Taylor has made a special pair of 103-inch waist trousers for Hudson, who hasn't worn clothes in 17 years. He hasn't worn clothes in 17 years. Someone's helping this guy not wear clothes, not get out of bed, not leave the house, you understand? And everybody who's helping this happen probably hates that it's happening. That's enabling. unhelpful or harmful help with good intentions. When I lose weight, says Walter, he says, I'm going to get me a double-breasted suit. End of article. That probably is one of the most graphic, I think, examples of unhelpful or harmful help with good intentions that I've ever run across. People who are doing what they're doing because they believe it will help. They have good intentions, but it actually doesn't help, or not only does it help, but it even helps the problem continue to get worse. That's enabling. Let me show you a couple of scriptural examples, a couple of pictures in scripture. One is in Luke 10, verse 29. And this is the story of the Good Samaritan. Who is my neighbor? He asked Jesus. And Jesus replied and said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers, and they stripped him and beat him and went off leaving him half dead. And by chance a certain priest was going down on that road and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a Levite also when he came to the place saw him and passed on the other side. But a certain Samaritan who was on a journey came upon him and when he saw him he felt compassion. He came to him, bandaged up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them and he put them on his own beast, brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and he said, take care of him and whatever more you spend when I return, I will repay you. Now, when it comes time to help someone, especially someone that you care about very deeply, you see, it's not easy to be objective about it. It's not easy to kind of separate yourself from the situation and decide what's the best rational choice to make in terms of how to help. Because you're so hooked in, you care, maybe you don't know exactly what it is you're dealing with, and plus it feels like this person's behavior somehow is an indictment on you. So it's hard to step back and know what to do. So what I want to give you are two questions that I think are helpful to ask as you approach helping opportunity. And this applies to people with addiction. It just applies to anybody that you're dealing with that needs help and that you feel like you want to help because you care about them. First question is does the person know that they need help? Does the person know they need help? So now you have this person who needs help. You know they need help. But does the person know they need help? Because, frankly, if you have a person that you care about who needs help but they don't know they need help and you help, the help isn't going to help. you can't be a helper unless you have a helpee if you don't have a helpee then you can give all kinds of help and the help is going to bounce off they're going to push it away if someone says to you that they know that they're in trouble and they need help if someone tells you that they know they need help but they don't go and get help, they're lying they're just giving the right answer understand that? yes I need help, oh yes it's terrible I'm really in trouble, I need help but then they don't go and get help or take help then they're just blowing you off they're just giving you the right answer they're telling you what you want to hear does the person know they need help? now, in this story we have a guy who was going down to Jerusalem and he fell among robbers and they stripped him and they beat him and he went off leaving him half dead does the person know he needs help? Sure he does. This guy's dying. So the priest comes along the road and he looks at him and goes, well, that's an issue for social services. And then the Levite also, when he came to the place, said that's not the church's issue either, you know, that's somebody else. And then the Samaritan who was on a journey came upon him and when he saw him he felt compassion, came to him, bandaged up the wounds, poured oil and wine on them, put them on his own beast, brought them to the inn, took care of him. And the next day he gave the innkeeper some money and said, I'm going to leave. When I come back, I'll pay whatever I owe. Does the person know he needs help? Yes. Did the help help? That's the second question. Does the help help? If you get a no to either one of these two questions, you have to change your plan. If you're trying to help someone that doesn't know they need help, the help's not going to help. Or, if you're giving the person help and the help isn't helping, maybe you need to do something else. I mean, some people think that if they do the same behavior long enough, finally it's going to help. I mean, some people define mental illness that way. They say mental illness, mentally ill, is doing the same behavior over and over again and expecting a different outcome, you know, but continuing to get the same one. That's crazy. But some people, you know, for five years, they've done the same thing with their addict. Five years, you know, they've preached at them for five years. If you've been preaching at somebody for five years and they haven't changed yet, change tactics. If you've been blaming and shaming and hollering and screaming for five years and they're not different yet, maybe it's because that's not going to help them and you should do something else. Number one, does the person know they need help? Number two, is it help help? Did the help help here? Yes. You want to know something? The hero of this story is the Good Samaritan. they're the example do you understand Jesus is holding up the Samaritan and saying here's the example right the good Samaritan is the one we're supposed to be that's the point you know when we're taught this in church we're taught here's how you're supposed to be the problem is that chemically dependent people addicted people who don't know they're addicted or don't think they need help are looking for good Samaritans what they need to do is they need to surround themselves with a bunch of good Samaritans who will pay the bill and pick them up and carry them here and bandage them up and bail them out and take care of their stuff and cover for them and all that kind of stuff because then they can continue in the process of being addicted. So when you're a good Samaritan with somebody who doesn't know they need help, it doesn't help. When you're a good Samaritan with someone who knows they need help, it helps all over the place. It's great. And it feels like it's wonderful and it's easy or maybe not easy but it's simple. Let me show you a different story. Luke 15. This is the story of the prodigal son. Actually, the father of the prodigal son, but I'm going to tell you the part about the son. A certain man had two sons, and the younger of them said to the father, Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to me, and divide his wealth between them. Does the son know he needs help? No. He thinks he's in control. Actually, in order for him to really get what he had coming to him, the father had to die. The father would have had to die. Then he gets his estate. So the father gave him, and so he divided the wealth between them. And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey into a distant country. And there he squandered his estate with loose living, whatever that means. Does he know he needs help? No. And when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began to be in need. And he went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country. And he sent him into the fields to feed the swine. And he was longing to fill his stomach with the pods that the swine were eating. And no one was giving anything to him. And when he came to his senses, he went home. Does he know he needs help? Yes. Now, before he came to his senses, he didn't know he needed help. So he still thought he could make it work and he'll just get a job feeding the pigs. He ends up fighting with the pigs over the food. Nobody bails him out, and he hits the wall. Yuck! I hate this! This is awful! This isn't working. I don't want to do this anymore. He goes home. Now, do you think that the father, at the beginning of the story, didn't know that this son was a yokel? I mean, do you think that he didn't know that this guy didn't know how to live? I mean, he knew. This is his son. You know, the father didn't, you know, the father... Do you think that the fact that the father didn't bail him out meant the father didn't care? No. I mean, the picture I get is every time a group of travelers came through the area where the father lived, he probably ran out on the street and flagged him down and said, you know, have you seen my son? Little short Jewish kid, curly hair, looks like Bob Dylan. I mean, see, if the father would have paid for the bounced checks, which would have been good intentions, okay, Or if he would have phoned ahead to his buddy who lives in the other country and said, look, get my son this nice, easy job, you know, so he doesn't have to struggle, which would have been good intentions, it would have been unhelpful help with good intentions. You wouldn't have ended up with a healthier son that way. You wouldn't have ended up with a person more in tune with their needs or with their inability to live correctly that way. But no one was giving him anything, and when he came to his senses, he went home. So there's a point in this story when the son didn't know he needed help, in which case if the father would have done the kind of help that a lot of us parents do our kids, and bail them out and all that kind of stuff, it wouldn't have helped. And the problem would have continued and we keep getting it back again next week and next week and next week and can't figure out why it doesn't change and it's because we're helping it continue even though we wish it wouldn't. There's a connection between shame and enabling. Shame is at the root, I think, of a lot of enabling behavior that people do. One of the reasons I cover for you and make excuses for you is because I'm worried about what you folks are going to think about me if they see you. Well, that's not helping you. That's just covering up my shame. That's protecting myself and my reputation and your opinion. It's not helpful behavior. It's enabling behavior. One of the ways that I have seen people in the church enable, pastors, pastoral counselors, and not just in the church, but this is where we are right now, is that we tend to diagnose people's problems as something that we've been trained to deal with. We're not very good diagnosticians in terms of the broad spectrum of issues, so everything tends to be a sin. We want to call everything a sin because that's where I went to seminary to deal with, see? So if you end up in my office, it doesn't matter what you have. You're going to have what I've been trained to deal with. And what that does is it enables you to have whatever it is you have without getting the real help that you need. When I was working at this treatment center, we had to do a presentation down at the Leamington Hotel when I was still there. And it was a professional conference, and we had a display table, and I told about the treatment center and all this, and there were lawyers there and doctors there and nurses and psychiatrists and judges and chemical dependency counselors and all this kind of stuff. And what I noticed was, clergy people, what I noticed was that everybody looked at the client as if it was what they were trained to deal with. So the psychiatrists tended to see everybody with psychiatric issues, and the doctors thought everything was a medical issue, and the chemical dependency people thought everybody was chemically dependent, and the social workers thought everybody was a potential case, a member of their caseload. and all this kind of stuff, because whoever gets the client gets the bucks. So you've got to get the client. And the way you get the client is call them something that you deal with. What it does is it enables them to not get the kind of real help they need for whatever it is they really have. Maybe some of you have seen this in terms of demonization. Where people have a grid that everything is a demon, and so when you go to them you might not have demons, but you have them when you leave, because they see it as a demon. So you go in there without one, and then they say that you have one, and you go, oh, okay. And then they try to cast it out, but of course it doesn't come out because it isn't there in the first place. So you walk out with an uncast out demon that you didn't walk in with, you see. And what that does, though, is it enables them to not get help for their chemical addiction, or whatever it is that they're really dealing with. Now, I don't want to say that there isn't such a thing as demonization, because there is. but not everybody's demonized and not everybody's chemically dependent and not everybody's got marital problems and so we have to be better diagnosticians and be willing to give up the client even if somebody else gets the box if we really care about the person, you see. Some people have this sense that they need to save people. Like they're the only one that can really help. Well, if I'm the only one who can really help then you are in trouble because that's a very puny support base for you, do you understand? And so I'm not going to let you go off to somebody else because they're not going to help you, and then chances are a lot of people aren't going to get the help they really need. There's almost a spiritual paranoia I noticed in seminary that had an automatic distrust for the secular social service system. You know, like we don't want to send people out there because we're the only ones that can help, and we need to save people, and we know what the real issues are. and the extreme abuse of that kind of thinking is when you have a child in a family that's getting beat up by their parents and the pastor won't send them to social services or report them to child protection because of the evil secular social service system who's going to rip off the kid and besides that the county doesn't understand about God's grace. Well you know who doesn't understand about God's grace is a parent that's beating up their kid. But what the county does know about is how to intervene on behalf of weak people who can't intervene for themselves, and they do know how to hold perpetrators of abuse accountable. And God has implemented, instituted authorities to hold accountable people who are doing evil things. And it's okay for people in the church to take advantage of those authorities. But when we don't, sometimes we enable. I think that it's easier for a lot of people to continue investing their energy in helping a certain way than to admit that they don't know what they're doing and that what they did didn't help. I think that one of the most liberating things that happened in my ministry for me was realizing at some point, contrary to what I was taught in seminary, that it really was okay to refer to somebody else and you really don't need to know how to help everybody. It really is okay for you to look at a client and say, I don't know how to help you. but I have to tell you that that's very hard to say because it goes against all the messages that we get we're supposed to know how to help so we continue to invest more energy helping even though it's not helping rather than losing all the equity we've invested in helping and saying out loud that didn't help I think that clients, patients, counselees get in equity rescuing relationships with helpers too instead of saying to their therapist, excuse me, this isn't working, goodbye, you're fired, because you know what? You're the employer, they're the employee. It almost feels like you're the employee and they're the employer, and you end up spending thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours trying to make this therapy turn out okay that hasn't turned out okay so far, rather than just saying this is wasted. Goodbye. That's equity rescuing, but that's about shame. Here are some examples of enabling. Going along with things on the outside that we don't agree with on the inside. That's a very simple kind of way, grid, in terms of thinking about enabling. Supporting on the outside what you hate on the inside. That enables the thing that you hate to continue. When I was working in treatment, I had this 15-year-old kid one time get up out of group, and he stormed out of the room and said, this place stinks, I hate this, I'm out of here. and he went downstairs to the pay phone to call his parents. So he called his parents and said, come get me out of here, come pick me up from treatment. They hate me here, it's mean here. So the parents call my secretary, who comes in the group, and I get on my other phone, and I'm talking to the parents, and so they put Rufus on hold down on the pay phone, and now they're talking to me on the other phone, and they're saying Rufus thinks that we should come and pick him up. He's asked us to come and pick him up. Do you think we should come and pick him up? and I said well do you think that he needs to be there with you or here with us and they said well we think he needs to be there with you I said well if you think he needs to be here with us why would you come and pick him up and they went oh see like it never occurred to them that they didn't have to help happen the thing that they didn't think should happen understand this it's okay for you to not help happen the thing that you shouldn't that you think shouldn't happen. If you've got somebody in your house that smokes and you wish they wouldn't smoke, don't pick up their cigarettes at the store when they ask you to, when they put it on the list. Carton of cigarettes, don't buy their cigarettes. If they want to buy their cigarettes, they can buy their own cigarettes. Don't you buy them and then lecture them about how they shouldn't smoke. I'm not even talking about the rightness and wrongness of cigarette smoking here, you understand? I'm just talking about integrity. I'm just talking about supporting on the outside which you support on the inside and not supporting on the outside which you don't support on the inside. That's all. If you don't think someone should drink, don't go buy their beer. If you wish your daughter or son would quit telling you about your spouse and talk to them instead, quit running messages for them to your spouse. Quit helping happen the thing that you wish would stop happening. That's enabling. I did a seminar up in Fernie, British Columbia, which is pretty far up north, you know, west. they got signs there on the highways that say beware the mountain goat crossing, like that, so it's a pretty secluded place and the seminar was in a ski chalet in the summer with a big ski area, so it was all green hills and stuff like that and they almost cancelled the seminar because they weren't sure that alcohol was really a problem in their little town there, but about three weeks before the seminar two of their teenagers got killed in a drunk driving accident down at the bottom of the road that led to the ski area, so they decided that it really was an issue after all. So we had this seminar, and this was a pretty beautiful place, pretty rugged place, wild, things like that. So during the course of being there and talking to these parents and teachers and school people, about 100 of them, 10 of us consultants, we find out that every year around graduation time, the high school students have keggers, you know. But see, here, if you're going to have a kegger, you just go have it in a cornfield or something like that or wherever you're going to have it. But there, they have it out in the mountains, out in the bush, you know. And, I mean, like one day when we were eating lunch in the ski shillay, we look up on the ski slope, and there's a grizzly bear, you know, up there grazing on the thing. One day I was jogging down this path, and I looked in the brush, and there's a timber wolf running next to me in the thing. So they're a little bit worried about these kids getting loaded out in the brush. So what they do is that to try to combat this, the parents sponsored the drunks. So they open up their house. They say, as long as you're going to get drunk anyway and have this kegger, just have it at our house, and then we can keep an eye on you. At which point, who is responsible for the teenager's drinking behavior? Teenagers? No, the parents are taking responsibility for it. So I said to them, how many of you think that your teenagers should drink. That's okay that your teenagers are drinking. And the crowd looked just like you, just sitting there looking at me. Well, how many of you think that they shouldn't drink? You wish that your teenagers wouldn't drink. Everybody raised their hand. I said, well, if you think that your teenagers shouldn't drink and you wish they didn't, why are you helping them drink? And they went, oh. Like, see, it once again never occurred to them that they didn't have to help happen the thing that they wish wouldn't happen. I said, that would be like a burglar coming into Fernie, British Columbia, and we know that what this burglar does is he breaks into stores and shoots the clerk and takes the stuff. So what we do is we just open the doors and leave the stores, and then he can go in and take it without shooting anybody. Well, how many thinks that it's okay for the burglar to rob the stores? Nobody. Well, how come you're letting them rob the stores? If your teenager came up to you and said, I'm going to rob a bank, would you drive the getaway car? Would you give them a lecture about how evil it is to rob banks and then drive the car? No. Well, it's the same thing with a lot of this stuff. You see, you don't have to support on the outside what you disagree with on the inside. That's enabling. Once again, not dealing with the right need. I already talked about that. But in a bigger picture sense, you see, addiction, addictive processes tend to go like this. Spiritual, they tend to be a spiritual issue And what addiction is, is it's the result of getting good enough at getting your life from something false. It's the end result of idolatry. Addiction is the end of the process of turning to a false god to meet your needs. If you get good enough at turning to a false god to meet your needs, you could get addicted to that. So it's a spiritual issue, even if the person doesn't think of it that way. It's trying to fill emptiness from something that isn't God. So that's a spiritual issue. It's an emotional issue, and I already told you about that. That's that big box of pain that we were talking about. It's a psychological or a mental issue, and that's all the dishonest thinking that a person develops to try to justify and make this okay. And last of all, it becomes a physical issue. Now, there's lots of, you know, people die, for one thing, because of addictions, but, you know, when I was in high school, I was out for basketball, and I was out at conference, and actually I was the same height as I am now and I weighed 155 pounds when I was in high school. I was just like this string bean kind of guy. Well, I went to college and started using and instead of eating poached eggs on toast because I was in training in orange juice and stuff like that, I started eating Oreos and loaves of bread made into French toast and pitchers of beer and things like that and I gained a lot of weight. So it affected me physically. Do you understand? That's just a mundane kind of example. but it affects people physically. When I sobered up and went to the dentist for the first time in years, I had 27 cavities in my teeth because I just, you know, didn't brush my teeth. I mean, I was too busy doing something else. I mean, I don't know. I didn't think about it. So it affected me physically. But here's the issue. See, people tend to be more aware of things lower on the list. In other words, even though it's a spiritual issue, they may be feeling pain in a physical way or in a psychological way, a crisis in their thinking, that someone confronts them about something and they hear it for the first time maybe. It gets in, and it causes them a crisis. And these tend to be layers so that the spiritual issue maybe is covered over by the emotional issue, and the emotional issue is covered over by the psychological or the mental issue, and that's covered over by the physical issue And what happens is that a lot of times, especially we in the church, when we look at this person, we kind of just blow off these bottom three issues and keep going after this issue instead of meeting the need at the area where the person feels the need. Because if we can do that, if we can meet the need at the level where the person feels the need, we might get permission to go to the next level, you see, and meet that need as well. Let me show you a couple passages that that's about. Matthew 9, verse 1. And getting into the boat, he crossed over and came to his own city. And behold, they were bringing to him a paralytic lying on the bed. And Jesus, seeing their face, said to the paralytic, Take courage, my son, your sins are forgiven. That's this need right here. Your sins are forgiven. And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, This fellow blasphemes. And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why are you thinking evil in your hearts? For which is easier for me to say? Your sins are forgiven or rise and walk. Which is easier? Your sins are forgiven or rise and walk? Your sins are forgiven. That's easier. You know why? Because if it doesn't happen, nobody knows. If you say rise and walk and the guy doesn't get up, then they know. You're not relevant there. So I'm going to pronounce some big spiritual thing, and if nothing happens, then who could tell? But in order that you might know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, so that you know that I'm relevant here, rise and walk. See, I think that if we had that kind of approach to people in church, there'd be a lot of ministry happening right to the level of people's needs. And so our work is more looking at this and at a person's life and saying, where is this person feeling pain and how can we go toward that? because it might give us permission then or a context in which to go to the next level once this area gets restored. I saw a film one time about this mom who found a bunch of pot and vodka under her daughter's mattress and she was so upset about it and knew that the dad would be upset if he found out about this that she flushed it. That's enabling. Don't flush the evidence. Don't hide the evidence. That's enabling. Preaching at people. You know, people who are irresponsible will listen to a sermon if they don't have to change. If people are out of control, they'll listen to a little nagging and bugging if they don't really have to do anything differently. It's no big deal. Blaming somebody else, that's enabling. Professional enabling is when a judge sends a chemically dependent person to the workhouse instead of the treatment. It's when a lawyer gets an alcoholic out of a DWI ticket that they're guilty of. That drives me nuts. Drives me nuts. I had one client who was guilty of a DWI, and instead of just paying the fine and taking the ticket, he hired a lawyer. This is while he was in treatment. He hired a lawyer, spent $1,100 to get this lawyer, to get him off the DWI ticket, and every day he'd come into a group and gripe about how much this lawyer was sucking him dry. I said, well, did you do it? He said, yeah. well you don't need a lawyer you did it you understand? lawyers are if you didn't do it and you're being charged with it then you need a lawyer if you're guilty just pay the fine but this lawyer helped them not get out to get out of the DWI you know when I was using I got stopped three times while I was drunk and never got a drunk driving ticket got disturbing the peace you know reckless conduct tickets. I mean, one time I was so drunk that the policeman said to me, you're too drunk to drive. I think you're too drunk to drive, the policeman said. And I said, yeah, I think I am too. And my buddy who was sitting next to me said, I'll drive. Of course, he was drunk too. So we get out of the car to switch places and run into each other, like this, like this. And then we do this little dance trying to get around each other, you know, and finally we switch places and I get a disturbing the peace ticket. That's enabling. Do you understand? That's not helpful. The guy thought he was being nice to me. He wasn't being nice to me. He was helping my problem last longer. That's all. Maybe he wasn't. But the point is, it wasn't helpful help. Maybe I would have used just his lung anyway, and it wouldn't have mattered. Maybe not, though. Maybe if I would have gotten some consequences that I should have gotten for acting that way, I'd have woke up sooner. Who knows? So the question is, has the help helped? If the help has helped, keep helping. If the person knows, give them help. If the answer is no, I'm going to give you a couple verses that describe the process if the answer is no. If the person doesn't know they need help. They need help, but they don't know they need help. 1 Corinthians 5. 1 Corinthians 5 is about a person who is having behaviors in the church at Corinth, and they don't know they need help, and they don't want help, and they're affecting other people. And what Paul says to them is, it's actually reported that there's an immorality among you, an immorality of such a kind as doesn't exist even among the Gentiles, that someone has his father's wife, and you've become arrogant, have not mourned instead, nor that the one who had done this might be removed from your midst. For I, on my part, though absent body, but present spirit, have already judged him who has so committed this, as though I were present, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. When you are assembled, and I with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. That sounds like pretty harsh treatment. But you see, the purpose of this is not to get rid of everybody who doesn't look good or everybody who's having a problem. The purpose of this is to help them realize that this isn't working and that they have a problem. And if you read 2 Corinthians 2, what you see there is that the guy figured it out because what Paul writes in 2 Corinthians 2 is he gets it, let him back in. But he gets it. His behavior became his problem, and he gets it. Romans 1. Romans 1 is a passage that talks about God giving up on people. God giving them up. Verse 24. Therefore God gave them over in the lust of their hearts to impurity, that their bodies might be dishonored among them. Verse 26. For this reason God gave them over to the grating passions. Verse 28. Just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to the depraved mind. And so, you know, there's this list of things, being filled with unrighteousness, wicked greed, malice, full of envy, murder, strife. So don't do that. This is what I was taught. Don't do that, because if you do that, God's going to give you up. And if God gives you up, you're giving up. Understand? That's not why God gives people up. God doesn't let go of people so that they're let go of. I'll show you why he does. Isaiah 5, and I'll close with this. Isaiah 5, verse 1. Let me sing now for my well-beloved a song of my beloved concerning his vineyard. My well-beloved had a vineyard on a fertile hill, and he dug it all around, and he moved its stones, he planted it with the choicest vine, he built a tower in the middle of it, he hewed out a wine vat in it, then he expected it to produce good grapes, but it produced only worthless ones. So here's the deal. Guy buys a vineyard, best soil, puts a tower in the middle of it to chase away the burglars and the foxes and stuff like that, puts a wine vat in the middle of it so that in order to make wine, they don't have to load the grapes on a wagon and take it to market and get them all bruised up and bumped up. They can squeeze them right away so it's good, fresh wine. Takes all the stones out of it. And then he expects it to produce good grapes, but it produces only worthless ones. And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard. Now we're talking about God. God is the owner. We're the vineyard. Judah is the vineyard. What more was there for me to do for my vineyard that I haven't done? What's the answer? Nothing. But that's a question. Haven't you ever had that as a parent? The question, well, what more is there for me to do that I haven't done? I have parents come to my office and they lament about the fact that they're teenagers using drugs or they're acting sexual or whatever they're doing, and they're feeling totally to blame for that. They must have not done something. And the question that I have to ask you is this. Is your teenager doing what you taught them to do or what you taught them not to do? Did you instruct them to use drugs when they turned 13? No. Well, then they're doing what they decided to do. You taught them not to, right? Yes. Well, then they're responsible for their behavior, not you. Why, when I expected it to produce good grapes, did it produce worthless ones? What's the answer? I don't know. I don't get it. I mean, this is God going, I don't get it. So, let me tell you now what I'm going to do to my vineyard. I will remove its hedge. It will be consumed. I'll break down its wall. It will become trampled ground. I will lay it waste. It won't be pruned or whole. Briars and thorns will come up, and I'll tell the clouds not to rain on it anymore. So fine, you want to do that? Great. but I'm going to remove all the hedges. I'm not going to help this happen at all. Bad news. Bad news. Bad news. Turn the page. Bad news. Turn the page. Bad news. Chapter 7. Verse 14. Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will be with a child and bear a son, and she will call his name Emmanuel. Good news. But you see, the good news really, really sounds good. when you know how bad the bad is. And sometimes people can't hear the good news until they hear the bad. Next time your alcoholic friend or family member goes out, don't pray that the cops won't catch them. Pray that the cops will catch them. Pray that they get swallowed by a whale. Pray that these people in your life, that you've been spending all your energy trying to buffer and excuse and save and rescue, get swallowed by a whale. That the next time they turn over onto 694, there's a great big whale there and it just clamps down on them right now. Because you know what? When people are spit out on the beach, all bleached out after three days, they listen really good. And sometimes you don't know how the good news is until you know how bad the bad is. So it's okay for you to stop doing the stuff on the outside that you don't agree with on the inside. And with that, I'll end this session. Any questions? Maureen. Yeah. How do you fight against that? You know, you could say no, but... Yeah, is the question what happens if you have somebody who really wants to recover, but they're hanging out with a group of people that really are supporting them in the other direction? And what can you do about that? Is that the question? Yeah. There's much you can do about that except point it out to them and give them genuine support. And actually, you see, peer pressure, which that would be, isn't just as simple as, you know, peer pressure is that if five of us are getting loaded and I get sober, then it looks like the other four of you are getting loaded. So you need me to get loaded so all five of us kind of look okay. Understand? So there's more at stake than just putting pressure on a person. and it's more about a statement that a person's health or recovery makes about the dysfunction or unhealth of someone else. So people have a lot at stake to get people to be inappropriate because then they can look appropriate. But all you can do is offer positive support and point out what you see if you see it. But if you try to take control or get big and try to get that person to not be there, it's not going to work. It's not the same as them seeing it and making a healthy choice for themselves. Very frustrating to watch that happen, though. Anybody else? Yes. yeah well workaholism is a more socially acceptable way to neglect your family than alcoholism you understand it's like the consequences aren't as immediate you don't get a DWI but nevertheless in any kind of addictive behavior a person cannot continue to live in an addictive way or live in an irresponsible way unless somebody in their system is rescuing them from the consequences that they or buffering them or preventing them from getting the consequences that they should be getting for acting that way neglecting your family has along with it its own set of natural consequences which is a disconnected family who aren't in relationship with each other and then you end up with more of an arrangement but if the person who wishes that the other person wasn't a workaholic still makes excuses for them and still makes everything look good and still carries the ball and does double parenting because one of the parents is gone and all that kind of stuff then they're really helping happen they're not to blame for what the other person's doing, because the other person is responsible for their own behavior, but they are responsible for helping something happen that they wish wouldn't happen. And so whatever support that that person could get to discontinue doing the things that they're doing that are really helping the process continue, even though they wish it would discontinue, that's the kind of support that they need. And when they start saying no, or they stop covering for the person, of course that person's going to hate it, and they're going to get punished and take a lot of flack for that, but that's why they need some support. It's impossible for a person to live in an irresponsible way, to continue to live in an irresponsible way, unless somebody's rescuing them from the consequences that they should be getting for living that way. As a helper, when I see a family system where somebody's continuing to live in an irresponsible way, I'm thinking to myself, I'm kind of scanning the system trying to see where this person's getting bailed out, because somewhere they're getting bailed out. And if everybody takes their hands off the person and stops bailing them out, the chances of them seeing their own addictive behavior go up, because their problem becomes theirs then. Yes? Yeah, yes. well the scripture passage that talks about comfort one another or bear one another's burdens I've been involved in small groups stuff for 16 years and when you're in a small group situation, a support group situation, and someone comforts someone else, you can tell they've been comforted. You can tell that they come with this burden that they're carrying by themselves and they say it and people help them carry it. They pick it up and support them and encourage them. That would be more on the psychological emotional kind of level. But see, if you come here and want to talk about your emotional pain, and I keep trying to get demons out of you, you're going to get out of here. Yes. Yes. Yes. Now the question is, the question is, is a person who doesn't believe that there is any help, is that the same as them not knowing they need help? Is that what you're asking? No. It's not the same. But you see, it might be the same. It might be that they're not honest enough to say, I don't need help, get off my case. And so they say, yeah, I need help, but there's nothing that would help me. But on the other hand, some people, when they say there's not any help that would help me, it isn't because they don't think they need help. It's because they are so shamed and so beaten up and so stuck or they've tried so many places that they don't believe anymore that they're kind of beyond hope. And that's not true. Nobody is beyond hope. Yes? they're beyond hope okay so you felt sorry for him and then you helped harder yeah and then that hooked you trying harder to help them or to prove that there really was some help and it was you or something yeah us addicts are pretty sneaky yes what does I know is everyone addicted to something if there isn't someone that's not a person what do they look like yeah well the question is is everybody addicted to something or somewhere and if there is somebody who isn't what do they look like I don't think everybody's addicted to something but I do think that everybody is provided with copious quantities of things to be addicted to and that everybody can get addicted and probably people have maybe I'll say everybody but that's a pretty big statement but maybe everybody has struggled with some kind of addictive thing at some point in their life just in a loss of control going overboard on something and then going oh wow and waking up and, you know, but I don't think everybody's addicted to something. I think that, this is really interesting, but I think that some people don't lose control. For instance, my wife, I remember when we were first married, we'd go to a restaurant for anniversary or something, she ordered a glass of wine, okay, with a meal. Now, I'm abstinent. I've been abstinent since 1977. So I would order a glass of wine. So she orders this wine and we're eating the meal and she's drinking the wine. And then she'll get like two-thirds of the waste of the glass of wine and push it away. And I'll say, well, what are you doing? And she'd say, well, I'm starting to feel the effects. And I'd go, well, that's the point. You know, it's like... You understand? It's like, I don't get it. I don't get it. She actually drank because she liked the taste of the wine with the spaghetti or whatever, with the pasta. She liked that, you know, red wine or whatever. And I couldn't relate to that. I hated the taste of alcohol. I drank to get the effects. I had to get past the taste to get what I really wanted, which was the buzz. As soon as she starts feeling a buzz, she stops doing it. I cannot relate to that concept. Do you understand? If I want to eat 10 M&M's, I've got to buy 10 M&M's. If I buy a bag of M&M's, a pound of M&M's, I'm going to eat a pound of M&M's. So instead of buying a pound of M&M's and then gritting my teeth and trying to exercise self-control every time I go buy them, I exercise self-control on the front end by not buying a pound. It's just a different way of doing it, you see. But not my wife. She doesn't, she wouldn't, she'd never eat a pound of M&M's, you know. When I was a kid, I really liked Rice Krispie Treats. I love Rice Krispie Treats. I remember when I was a kid, my mom would make a pan of Rice Krispie Treats, and one time I stayed home from school on purpose, sick. I wasn't sick. I wasn't sick. But I stayed home from school pretending to be sick, and there was like this 9 by 13 pan of Rice Krispie Treats with one line of them out of it. So I ate the whole pan, made another pan, and ate the line that was gone from the first one. My wife would never do that. She would never do that. You understand? But she would struggle with me doing that. She'd be watching to make sure I didn't eat too many Rice Krispie treats, like that. So, I mean, because she's from an alcoholic family where everybody is revolving around one person trying to figure out how to do it just right so that person is appropriate. So she brings that skill into our relationship. So I don't know. I mean, I think everybody struggles with different things, but I don't think everybody's addicted. Some people, as soon as they get in a little bit of trouble with it, they quit doing it. It's great, but that hasn't tended to be me. So recovery has to be a more aggressive thing for me. And some people just kind of coast and don't, you know, they're on automatic pilot and they don't deal with all this stuff. Last question. The question is, where does suicide fall in all this? And see, are you asking me in terms of the enabling talk, in terms of the addiction process talk? Well, cocaine addiction is suicide. It's just a slower, more methodical, more expensive plan. And alcohol addiction is suicide and all that kind of stuff. And people, you know, it's a way for somebody who doesn't like themselves to act like they don't like themselves over a long period of time. Suicide where somebody just blows their brains out, that's just the... Suicide is the ultimate form of disappearing. And so when a person's self-esteem, their sense of self shrinks and shrinks and shrinks and shrinks, one day it disappears, then they disappear too, and then everybody wonders where they went because they were president of the National Honor Society. But suicide is just about the ultimate shame fix. Understand what I just said there? It's the ultimate way that a person tries to eradicate their shame. They just get rid of themselves. and you know I will apply the enabling talk to suicide if you have someone in your life who keeps telling you they're suicidal you need to tell them next time that they tell you that that you're going to believe them and call 911 and quit trying to lecture them and plead with them and all this kind of stuff if you call me and you're telling me you're suicidal it's not my job to figure out if you're telling the truth it's your job to figure out if you're telling the truth and so if you tell me I'm going to believe you and we're going to call 911 and you can tell the people in the psych ward that you were just kidding, okay, because I'm not letting you put that on me. I remember one time I had a 15-year-old teenage girl in treatment and that's what she did to her parents. That's how she punched her parents' buttons. You know, I'm going to kill myself and then they'd back off. You know, they'd try to put a discipline on her and she'd threaten them and they'd back off or they'd try to hold her accountable and she'd threaten and they'd back off. And so now we're in a counseling session, and, you know, of course I'm confronting her about some stuff, and she gets up and says, forget that, I'm just going to go kill myself, and she starts walking to the door. And I said, if you go through the door, I'm calling the psych ward. And she stopped like this. And she just stood there like... I said, because I'm not going to figure out if you're telling the truth. You need to figure that out. So if you're serious, that's okay, but then we're not the ones to deal with you. North Memorial wants to deal with you. If you're not serious, then quit saying that and sit down and say where you really are. And she went... And she sat down. Because it's not our job to be responsible for somebody else's suicide. It's their job. They're responsible for that. We're responsible for giving helpful help. Thank you.
