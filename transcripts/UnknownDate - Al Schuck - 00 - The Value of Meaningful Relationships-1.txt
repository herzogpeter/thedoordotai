Good morning. I suppose every time that I do this, there is that sense of, even though I have something to share, if the power of God isn't here and speaking to you, I don't have anything to share. And as we talk about relationships this morning, it's one of those times where it kind of goes to a different level, and you realize it even more. So I want to just pray as we start. Spirit of God, I would ask that you would come and have your way with our hearts this morning. I pray it would go way beyond anything I would have to share that you've given me, but instead, God, it would be very personal, and I can't make it that way. That has to be you, so we trust you for that this morning. We have ears to hear, and I ask your protection over this. in your name. Amen. Last week we had the privilege of hearing from Steve Weins. Steve did a great job of helping us see that if we are to think correctly about God, we have to realize that before anything else ever existed, there was in the Trinity relationship. Right from the opening verses of the Bible, we see that relationship between the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is a huge key to this whole thing. It's what it's about. It's the Trinitarian community was the phrase he used. A relationship of selfless love and mutual submission that was characterized by Jesus in the garden when he said, not my will, but yours be done. All through scripture, we see this theme of how important and valuable it is to be in relationship. Relationships are not optional. They're critical. Just like our physical bodies have to have food and water to sustain itself, so our spirits need relationship. As church people, it's easy to run right away to, we need a relationship with God, which is true. It is the most important relationship. But we tend to separate out this relationship with God and relationships with other people. And I don't think scripture does that. Jesus sure didn't. Look at Matthew chapter 22. Jesus, in response to the question, what's the greatest commandment, said this, Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it. Love your neighbor as yourself. Jesus doesn't separate out the two like we sometimes do. This is a book. The Bible is a book that clearly speaks to the importance and value of meaningful relationships with God and with others. And it doesn't separate those two out all that often. Let's pick up the story where Steve left off. If you have your Bibles, you can turn to Genesis chapter 1. I love stories, and the Old Testament is filled with them right from the start. Genesis chapter 1. You may know that there is a phrase that gets repeated over and over and over again in Genesis chapter 1. Every time God creates something, we see a phrase, and he saw that it was good. Seven times it says God created something and then God saw that it was good. Now, after reading that seven times, we may say, yeah, yeah, yeah, we get the point. You don't have to keep repeating yourself. But really, we don't get the point because we're not even to the point yet. The point is found in Genesis 2, verse 18. So skip ahead, Genesis 2, 18. If you're like me, you might have to turn the page in your Bible. Genesis 2, 18 says this. The Lord God said, it is not good for man to be alone. Now we're getting to the point. Seven times it says, and God saw that it was good. Why? So that all of a sudden, along in chapter two, it says, and God said, it is not good. Seven times he says that in hopes that when it changes, we'd go, huh, I wonder why that is. Then maybe we'd stop for a minute and just wonder about that. Why is it not good for Adam to be alone? Why didn't he say it was good again? Why isn't it good? Is he alone? He has God. Isn't God enough? Why would he need someone else? Why is this even important to God? Hopefully we can enter in and wonder about those questions. There's a lot more. But wonder about why isn't it good? Whatever you wonder about, know this. From God's perspective, there is something in Adam that he sees, and he says, it's not good for Adam to be alone. So what's the Lord do? Look what happens next. Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them, and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. So the man gave names to the livestock, the birds of the air and the beasts of the field. Now, we don't know exactly how this went down, so we need to have some fun with it, all right? God decides, Adam, it's not good for him to be alone, so picture this. Here's Adam. God says it's not good for you to be alone, and he makes the world's longest, history's longest parade of animals, and he runs them by Adam. And the coolest thing is he lets Adam name them. I think that's amazing. In all of his creativity, God invites Adam into what he's doing. And he says, Adam, come with me. Help me with this. Let's do this together. Isn't that awesome? That God would call you and me, humans, into his creativity, into what he's doing. And say, bring your creativity along. I think it's a wonderful gift God gives to us. Can you hear the conversation between God and Adam? Okay, Adam, here's the next one. What are you going to name it? Baboon? You know? I mean, can you imagine the chuckles they must have gotten on Adam's answers? Hippopotamus. You know? And of course you've probably heard the old question Is a hippopotamus really a hippopotamus Or just a really cool Apotamus Those are the deep questions that I wrestle With folks right there They go through the animals and then it said Verse 20 But for Adam no suitable Helper was found Nice animals God Really I'm serious wonderful animals But a relationship Intimacy and knowing each other see Adam's stuck in between he has a relationship with God but his capacities don't measure up to God he can't relate to all of God he's not God he's a human and he has a relationship with the animals but the animals capacities can't measure up to Adam they're not human Adam's stuck in between so what's God do he creates Eve why well for one thing without God creating a woman there would have been no children. And if you don't understand that or get that there's a little book out back called When Kids Ask and we can help you out about that. But seriously, the fact is that the reason God created Adam in the first place was for loving relationship. He didn't need to, but he wanted to. You see, God is filled with everlasting goodness and love and he wants to share that with others. So he created us. And he invites us to be a part of a Trinitarian community of love. I feel the need to point out that while it is necessary for there to be a man and a woman in order for them to be fruitful and multiply, as it says, and yes, we believe that sexual relations is reserved for a man and a woman within a marriage relationship, we do not believe that sexual relationships are necessary for deep, intimate, and meaningful relationships. nor do we believe that in order for Adam to be fulfilled relationally he needed to have a wife. To have sexual relations, yes, he would need a wife. To be fruitful and multiply, yes, he would need a wife. But to have Trinitarian community, a spouse is not necessary but relationships are. As we continue into Genesis chapter 2, understand that while what I'm saying has impact on marriage relationships, The focus is simply on relationships. What we are going to see goes way beyond a male-female issue. It's about a human being issue. Scripture clearly teaches that we're created for relationships with God and with others. We're made for meaningful relationship. And to live an isolated life, to be alone, is not a good thing. And God would come to you and to me just like he did with Adam. And he would say, he'd look you in the eyes and he'd say, it's not good for you to be alone. the medical community gets this one of the books that i really enjoyed and i give credit to for helping me with my thoughts is a book by john ortberg called everybody's normal till you get to know them love that title in this book he points out two medical studies done by respected medical people and reported in the journal of american medical association the first one is this The first one tells of a study where they tracked the lives of 7,000 people over a nine-year period. They found that the most isolated people were three times more likely to die than those with strong relational connections. People who had bad health habits, like smoking and obesity, but had strong social ties, lived significantly longer than people who had really good health habits but were isolated. Ortberg concludes that it's better to eat Twinkies with friends than to eat broccoli alone. The study concluded that if you belong to no groups but decide to join one, you cut your risk of dying over the next year in half. In the next study, they took 276 volunteers. They volunteered to be infected with a virus that produces the common cold. I don't know where they get these people. Sign me up. It's craziness. But they took these people and infected them with the virus, and the study found that those with strong emotional connections, strong relationships with others, did four times better fighting off illness than those who were more isolated. These people were less susceptible to colds, had less viruses, and produced significantly less mucus than those who were relationally isolated. They're not making this up. They produced less mucus. Which proves that unfriendly people are indeed snotty-er than friendly people. Even our day-timer people, the people that make our day-timers, right? There's a little one, a little phrase. They know this stuff. Here's one of the quotes from in the little margin there. Call it a clan, call it a tribe, call it a network, call it a family. Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. You and I are wired to be in relationships with others. Right from the beginning, God spotted it and said it's not good. Adam was created for community, and so are you and I. To be in community with others, who with them, together, we're enjoying being a part of the community that exists between the Father and the Son and the Spirit, a community of love and joy and peace and fullness and creativity and submission and encouragement and care and everything that is good. That's what God intends for you and for me. But it seems like, from my perspective in my life, that my relationships seem so far from that. Instead, I think most of us live lives Where our biggest problems Our biggest place of pain and sorrow And stress and anger is in relationships I would bet that most of the real problems That you and I have are relational problems Our minds might run to things like I need to make more money Or I need a different job Or my car needs to get fixed Or there just isn't enough time in a day But my bet is if you were to have to write down, nail down, the three biggest problems that you've had or currently have that have caused you the most pain, you're going to trace it back to relationships. You see, here's the difficult thing. While God, on one hand, has designed us to be absolutely essential for us to be in these meaningful relationships, these relationships are the hardest thing we do. It's a tough thing. While I'm convinced that nothing in life can be of greater joy than being in a loving community with others, I'm also convinced there's probably nothing more difficult. My personal experience, just Al the guy, has been that relationships for me are indeed absolutely essential. I can't live without them. But relationships are incredibly difficult for me. Relationships for me have been a place of great joy, wonderful things. But they've also been a place of tremendous pain. For me, relationships have been a place where finally somebody understands me. And there's probably never been a place where I've felt more misunderstood than in relationships. I've experienced tremendous loyalty in friendships, and I've been betrayed in friendships. I've been in relationships where I've felt wonderfully accepted and I've been in relationships where I feel like I don't measure up. I've been in relationships where I felt incredibly valued and I've been in relationships where I felt like I was a bother. I've been in relationships that mysteriously in some way seem to fill me up and I've been in relationships that in some mysterious way seemingly drain me dry. And my guess is you've been in those kind of relationships too. This really is the challenge that's before us. How do we enter into something so valuable and so important, absolutely essential when it's so painful and so difficult? So I got thinking, why is it? Why is it that this is so hard? Why are relationships so hard? And while the list is probably endless, and I'm sure you could come up with a lot, I'm gonna limit us to just a few today. And while most of them, the rest of them, are going to come straight from the text. The first one is just kind of a simple, basic fact of human life. We may not like to hear it out loud. We may not like to say it. We don't like to even think about it that much. But the first reason relationships are so difficult, it's just a fact. It is what it is. Here's the deal. Number one, first thing, relationships are hard because people are difficult. And sometimes they act really strange. Write it down. People are difficult. It's a true thing. It's true. Moody, critical, angry, selfish, tense, impatient, late, absent-minded. And those are just things that my wife came up with when I asked her about someone she was close to. I want to show you a real short, about four-minute video clip. And I want you to see if you haven't met some difficult people like the people you're about to see in this video. And think about how difficult it is to have relationships with people just because of who they are sometimes. Yeah. Excuse me, sir. What are you doing? I'll tell you what I'm doing. I want to buy eight hot dogs and eight hot dog buns to go with them. But no one sells eight hot dog buns. They only sell 12 hot dog buns. So I end up paying for four buns I don't need. So I am removing the superfluous buns. I'm sorry, sir, but you're going to have to pay for all 12 buns. They're not marked individually. Yeah. You want to know why? Because some big shot over at the Wiener Company got together with some big shot over at the Bun Company and decided to rip off the American public because they think the American public is a bunch of trusting nitwits who'll pay for things they don't need rather than make a stink. Well, they're not ripping off this nitwit anymore because I'm not paying for one more thing I don't need. George Banks is saying no. Who's George Banks? Me! Why don't we just calm down now, sir? I'll tell you why we don't calm down. because you're not excited. It takes two people for a wee to calm down, doesn't it? That I don't know, sir. I'm just the assistant manager of a supermarket. But I'll tell you this. If you don't pipe down and pay for those buns, I'm gonna call the police. Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, right. That's right. Hey, right. Hey, hey, come here. Uh-uh. Come here. Uh-uh. Come here. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. What's your problem? Now, for the floor that you're walking on, I chose this Bolivian Wormwood. I think works well in here. I have the Viking Range here and the Twin Sub-Zs. Yeah, they open up right there. Oh, I like it. Like, hidden. Yeah, kind of blend in. Great. Are you a homeowner, Greg? No, no. I rent. Oh. So, things are going real, real well for you, aren't they, Newburgh? Gosh, things have been going so great lately. Yeah, I got in early on some wireless IPOs, and the stuff just skyrocketed from there. Wow. What about you, Greg? What line of work are you in? I'm in healthcare. Yeah, so you know what I'm talking about. There are a lot of Benjamins being made right now with the biotech stuff. Yeah, I don't have to tell you that. How's your portfolio? I'd say strong. To quite strong. Yeah, yeah. You gotta strike while the iron's hot. Now's the time. Greg's a male nurse. That's right. Thank you, Jack. Wow. That's great. That's great to give something back like that. I'd love to find time to do some volunteer work. Just the other day, I saw this golden retriever that he had like a gimp, and he couldn't really... It just made me feel terrible. I wish there was something I could do. Yeah, well, I get paid, but also it feels, you know, good too, so it's kind of everybody wins. uh look i don't want to be rude but uh i'm not much of a conversationalist and i'd really like to finish this article a friend of mine wrote it so don't let me stand in your way please don't let me stand in your way the last thing i want to be remembered as is an annoying blabbermouth you know nothing grinds my gears worse than some chowder head who doesn't know to keep his big trap shut if you catch me running off with a mouth just give me a poke in the chops Listen. Oh! Oh, that feels good. Oh, God, I'm telling you. My dogs are barking today. Oh! That feels better. We laugh. We laugh. But the fact is, people are difficult. People are hard to be around sometimes. You can picture those people. We've all run into them. Some people who just seemingly are so stuck on themselves that they have to brag about everything. Other people, they're so down on themselves. Some people talk way too much. Other people, you can't get them to say anything. People are difficult. We come in all sizes, shapes, personalities, annoying habits, and mannerisms. Some people have an out-of-control temper, while other people, just once, you'd want to see them get mad so it would prove that they're actually alive. You know, it's just relationships are hard because people are difficult. Now, here's the deal. When I say people are difficult, I'm talking about you. I'm talking about me, too. I know some people are easy to get along with than others, and some people are harder to get along with than others, just the way it is. But a while back, my wife and I, our drying machine, dryer, whatever you call it, quit working. And so my wife said, we have to get a new dryer. And I said, why can't we use the microwave? It has to be smaller loads, but is there really any reason why it wouldn't work? Needless to say, she won the argument, And so I found myself out shopping for a new dryer. If you've done that recently, you know that dryers are expensive. And actually so expensive that for a second I thought about we could just get a bigger microwave. But I knew that wouldn't work. And then I heard that there's this place in St. Louis Park that you can go, and they have, like, new appliances, but you get them at a discount price because there's something little defect with them. There's something wrong with them. And so I ended up at this place in St. Louis Park. looking for an appliance or looking for a dryer. Something's wrong. Maybe there's a scratch. Maybe the door doesn't open the right way. Maybe there's a dent, something like that. And so I ended up there, and I bought one there. But it got me thinking about all of us as people and about how, you know, the cool thing was you walk into the place, some of them, you would never know there's something wrong, and they have to, like, show you the back where there's a scratch or there's a dent or something. Others of them, you look right at it, and you go, there's the problem. There's the dent. And I think that's a lot like us as people. I think some of us maybe do a little better job of like hiding our dent or our scratch but when you really get to know any of us you find out that we all have a flaw of some kind we all have something that makes us difficult so here's what I want us to do I want you to turn to the person that you're sitting next to is an anticipation question and I want you to say to them I sometimes can be difficult go ahead do it go ahead sometimes I can be difficult now now here's what I want you to do I want you to turn to the person who said that to you and say yes sometimes you can be this is group therapy right here folks the first reason relationships are hard is because people are difficult. Let's pick up the story in Genesis chapter 3. But before we do, on our way there, I want us to read the last verse of Genesis chapter 2. Look what it says. The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame. Now that's an interesting statement just to throw in there. I'm trying to figure out why that statement's there. Well, I think there are two reasons that I saw why I think that statement is there. You see, in the next six verses, the first six verses of Genesis 3, we have what's called the fall. That may not be the best name for it. I actually think fall describes something that you do by accident. Maybe the rebellion, the revolt, something like that might have been more accurate because Adam and Eve chose to enter into sin. But we have that in the first six verses. And I think the first reason why it says that, the man and his wife were both naked and they felt no shame, I think the first reason was to show us how radically different life was before the fall. is radically different. Imagine being able to go about your day completely naked and feeling no shame. The simple fact that right now you think I'm a crazy man for bringing this up actually proves my point. This is such a ridiculous concept to us. We can't even imagine this being the way life was. Each morning as I get ready for work, I get ready to step out the door. In my subconscious, I think about four, do I have four things. I think about my watch, my wedding ring, my wallet, and my cell phone. Cell phone. You're thinking Bible. I know, pastor. No, I think about my cell phone. I get out, I drive, and sometimes I go about two blocks and I'm at this stop sign and I realize, ah, forgot my cell phone. Turn around, go back. Ah, forgot my wallet. Have to turn around and go back. Never once have I ever thought consciously, now am I remembering to wear clothes? I've never gotten to that stop sign and stopped and went, ah, I'm naked. I've got to turn around and go back. I've never got to my desk at work and went, oh, shoot, I forgot to wear clothes today. Never has happened. Why? It would never enter my mind. I don't even have to tell myself that. Why? Because I'd be embarrassed. I'd be ashamed. There's no way I want to walk around naked. So life before the fall was radically different. how could they do that? There had to be an innocence and a trust and there had to be some remarkable things that no longer exist. The fall changed everything. Second reason I think it tells us that the man and the woman were both naked and they felt no shame was so we could understand the change that took place in relationships after the fall. First six verses of chapter three. Satan deceives Adam and Eve. Verse 6 is when they ate the fruit. And then what happens immediately after is that they sin. Here's what happens immediately after they sin. Look at verse 7. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked, so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves. Immediately, as soon as sin brought shame, they started to hide from each other. It's a different world. no longer did Adam feel completely safe with Eve or Eve with Adam so they hid parts of themselves from the other person a few weeks back Pastor Dave mentioned that I'm a little crazy about my daughter and he got me pretty good that weekend and I thought the way I'd get him back is because he said I show a picture every time the way I'd get him back is this weekend I wouldn't show a picture and that would be my way of getting him back and then I thought that wouldn't be fair to all of you so here she is well one of the games that my little girl and i like to play is is hide and go seek and i like to play hide and go seek because if uh like most parents i'm guessing of a three-year-old like moms and dads i'm tired they wear you out and so if if we play hide and go seek if i can find a really good hiding spot there's a chance i could get a 10 to 15 minute nap in before she finds me and it's a true story and uh if you've never done that before i'd encourage you to take advantage of that um you get a little nervous the first time you start thinking if i really fall asleep and she can't find me i mean i could like sleep for hours and and you get a little nervous but would that be okay and and uh as one who has experience let me just tell you i've found that if you do fall asleep um eventually uh they're crying will wake you up as they're looking for you. But seriously, we could play this game, okay? We could play this game, and I think I could hide so well that it'd be really hard for my little girl to find me. And while she's just old enough to realize that it only takes me a little bit of time to find her, and it takes her a longer time to find me, what she doesn't realize yet is why that is. What she doesn't know yet is that her dad is a professional hider. You see, I don't think hide-and-go-seek is just a game that little kids play. I think we adults get really good at it. I think we hide too. I've learned how to hide certain parts of myself that I'm ashamed of. I've learned to cover things up that I don't want other people to see. And so have you. Inconsistencies. Pride. Judging people. Arrogance. Insecurities. Fears. Anxieties. Bad habits. Bad attitudes. I can cover that stuff up. Envy. Anger. Manipulation. We all live with these things. They're sin. and there's sin that's in us and they bring shame and one of the options when you feel that shame, one that we're prone to, is to hide. This is the second reason why I think relationships are so hard. Relationships are hard because we're prone to hide and cover things up from each other. We may let others see selective parts of ourselves, but it's really hard not to hide. We cover it up. Where do we learn to do it? Well, where'd Adam and Eve learn to do it? Who taught them? Nobody. Nobody has to teach us how to do that. It's part of being human. They knew how to do it. It's one of the natural things to do when you feel ashamed. Nobody has to teach us how to hide. What we need help learning is how to be found. You see, my little girl has a really hard time not being found. If it takes more than like a minute, I'm going to hear this sweet little voice go, Daddy, I'm in here. She hasn't learned yet how to hide really well. See, she still thinks that it is. She's realized it's more fun to be found by dad than to hide alone. So she wants to come out of hiding. All of a sudden, the words of Jesus start making sense when he says, unless you become like one of these little children, you cannot enter the kingdom of God. You cannot be found. We need help learning how to come out of hiding. Pick it up in verse 8. about you, but I am so glad that God comes looking for us and that he calls out our name. And he says, where are you? By his grace, he comes looking for us. And he says, come on out, where are you? We don't have to answer him, but Adam chose to answer him. And in his answer, I think we find a couple more reasons why relationships are so hard. Look what he says. I heard you in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid. The first thing we see is Adam saying, I was afraid. Fear makes relationships incredibly difficult. Some of you in this room have tried over and over again to establish relationships, but nothing has seemed to work. For one reason or another, it hasn't worked. You've gone way beyond thinking that relationships are difficult. You've come to the conclusion that relationships are impossible. you've been hurt so badly that to try again would mean facing your deepest fear some people have concluded that there just must be something wrong with me because no matter how hard i try i just don't seem to fit in i'm the odd one out you may be sitting here today saying i have a number of friends but if I was honest about it, one of my deepest fears is I don't know for sure if any of them would really be there for me when I needed them. Fear is a major reason why relationships are so difficult. There's another reason. At the end of the verse, look at the end of verse chapter 10, or verse, chapter three, verse 10, Adam says this, I was afraid because I was naked. Is that really why he's afraid? he'd never been afraid before when he was naked is that why he was afraid no this is Adam trying to change his subjects this is Adam not taking responsibility for what the real issue is this is Adam's attempt to lie his way out of it to deceive his way out of it both Adam and Eve do this in the next few verses he blames her, she blames the snake we pass the blame. Relationships are really hard because we tend to avoid taking responsibility for our own actions and we blame others. And that makes relationships really hard because all of a sudden someone's blaming you for something. And we all do it. I want to end with verse 11 because I think it's a wonderful verse that serves as a call to us as a church. Look what God says. who told you you were naked Adam who told you you were naked or who told you that it even matters have you been listening to somebody else who told you Adam who have you been listening to if you catch a tinge of God's anger it isn't directed at Adam it's directed at the one who's been telling Adam a bunch of lies in this question implied with the question of who told you you were naked is God saying because it sure hasn't been me it sure wasn't me that told you this Adam who told you this and I think that's the question for all of us too is who have you been listening to when it comes to relationships who told you that you need to hide who told you that you can't be honest about your sin someone been telling you that if people really knew you they'd reject you someone been telling you that you have something to be afraid of someone been telling you that if you were honest about your sin it would disqualify you who told you that deep meaningful relationships aren't possible who told you that if you try again to enter in it's only going to cause more pain and confusion who's who you've been listening to some have been telling you that this whole thing about relationships meaningful relationships is just too hard you might as well give up God wants to know who have you been listening to because if you've been hearing that kind of stuff you need to hear God say to you real clear this morning because it sure hasn't been me for you to know what God would say to you this morning I gotta take you back to this game of hide and go seek that I play with my daughter you see because there's a phrase that we say in the game when the person who's been seeking and looking for you when they kind of want the game to end what do they say? come out come out wherever you are and when you hear that you know that you're free you know that the game is over you know that you can come out from hiding and there's not a penalty you're not going to get caught that's the heart of God come out, come out wherever you are you don't have to hide anymore you don't have to pretend anymore you don't have to act like you have it all together like I have deep meaningful relationships you can admit that sometimes I've got questions, I've got confusion. Relationships have been hard. I need help. I'm thinking about giving up. I don't know where you find yourself today, but more than anything, I pray you hear the sweet voice of God say, come out. You don't have to hide anymore. But right up there with you hearing the heart of God, say that to you, that it's safe to come out. We want you to hear the heart of this community that you're a part of. We want you to hear the heart of this community say the same thing to you, that we're in this together. The heart of this church is that you don't have to hide here. You don't have to hide. You don't have to pretend. We need to hear each other loud and clear say to one another, I know, you don't have to hide. You don't have to pretend with me. I get it. I'm one of you. As a church, we know how important relationships are. Community is one of our values. And while next week we're gonna look at relationships from the perspective of being a part of this faith community, this week, today, each of you come on a journey with God and baggage with relationships. And we want to create space for that. Ashley's gonna come and lead us in a song. And during the song, if something about relationships and the difficulty of relationships has landed on you today, and you want prayer this morning, we ask that you'd come forward and stand at the foot of the stage. There may be a number of you there. We don't have individual prayer people here. We're gonna join together in prayer. And so just come and stand at the stage. Maybe you've been listening to the wrong voice. Maybe you've been hiding. maybe you aren't hiding but you've given up maybe it's a real subtle thing where you have friends you have friends but you don't feel like you're connected with them maybe you're afraid maybe you've been making excuses whatever it might be if the spirit of God has laid something on your heart today we invite you to come for prayer Thank you.
