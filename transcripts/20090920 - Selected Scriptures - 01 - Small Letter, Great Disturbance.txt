Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Another reason why it's a big deal at Open Doors, we're doing something we only do about once every, I don't know, two or three years here. That is, we're starting a new series. Yeah, it's amazing. And if you're here last week, wasn't last week incredible? I mean, the text up on the screen is so cool. We're starting a new series on the New Testament book of Colossians. And even though it's only four chapters long, if history serves as any guide, you know, we could be here. a while. If you're new here at Open Door, you're thinking, oh my goodness, what have I gotten myself into? Well, the question that should come up in your mind, it certainly does in my mind, is why would we do that? Literally. I mean, why would we spend a couple of years going through a little letter that was written for a bunch of Middle Eastern people about 2,000 years ago. And I think one reason we're doing it, we're doing it in part because our journey of following the rabbi, this rabbi named Jesus, should take us both forward into the future, but also backward. It should take us backward into history so that we can learn from those who have gone before us and who share the unity of following Jesus with us. But there's another reason too. A few days ago, I went out for one of my runs on one of my normal routes, and about a mile into it, I hit this big intersection, and I do it every time I do this route, and normally I take a right, and I circle through some neighborhoods, and then come back around. But I had heard that if I would cross the intersection, the path would pick up again, and where it ended up was really, really beautiful. But one thing you may not know about me, or not guess about me, is I'm actually pretty careful when it comes to that kind of stuff. I'm actually not as adventurous as you might think I would be because I don't like to get lost, especially on runs. It's weird. I just have this thing. I don't like to just go and, oh, wherever I am, I'll find my way back. I have this fear that I'll never get back. You know, Mary will be a widow and my three boys, what will happen to them? But on this, on this day, I crossed the intersection and picked up the trail again. And what I found was extraordinarily beautiful. In the fall, the leaves on the trees are starting to turn, and these meadows. And it was an unexpected, beautiful adventure. And so, as we dive into the book of Colossians, we're expecting the same. And ancient rabbis had this love affair with the scriptures, with the text. They believe that because it was alive, it would speak to each generation in new and unique and undiscovered ways, in ways that were extraordinarily beautiful. They believed that by opening up the text and especially just wandering through it, taking their time with it, there would be beautiful new discoveries about who Jesus is and who God is and what God is doing around us. And so we are going to take our time to wander through this letter to the Colossians. And today is an overview, kind of an introduction to this letter. I want to give you a little bit, some kind of Colossians 101, some facts about Colossae. I'm going to talk about the worldview of the Colossians and also the major themes of Colossians. And then next week we'll take it another step. One of the resources that I used that has been very helpful is a book called Colossians Remixed. It's going to be available in our bookstore, I think, next week. It's not available yet, but I would highly recommend that if you want to take a look at the worldview of the Colossians, and especially how it relates to our worldview today. So Colossians 101. Colossae was a small town on the banks of the Lycus River. I'm sure many of you have fished, and I've heard there's good bass fishing in the Lycus River. Colossae was in Southeast Asia Minor modern day Turkey so it's just to the north of Syria and that little piece of Iraq also west of Iran so right in the middle of a really boring territory both then and now one aha for some of you might be that the first Christians were Middle Eastern they were not Western people so any pictures or images you have in your mind about, you know, Christians walking around in gap clothing. You have to banish. The recipient of this letter was a young church made up of men and women and children, Greeks and Jews, and even slaves, all trying to follow Jesus together in the middle of lots of different religious and cultural perspectives, all that played a very serious role in their understanding of Jesus, and all with the massive and all-pervasive shadow of the Roman Empire looming over everything they did. There's even a little factoid in Colossians, which is interesting. The letter was delivered to Colossae from Paul by a couple of guys named Tychius and Onesimus. Now Onesimus used to be the slave of Philemon. You might recognize that name because it's a book in the New Testament as well. So he was a slave of a Christian that lived in Colossae, who ran away from Philemon. Onesimus broke his chains, ran away from Philemon, went to Paul and told his story. Paul's response was to write a letter, a personal letter to Philemon. Now here's just a little hint. Unless you're the author of said letter, you don't want a letter that will end up as a book of the Bible written about you. It's probably going to be pretty intense. And it was. This letter, if you want to read it, it's very short. It's Paul's plea to Philemon to free Onesimus. So there's even a little weird Jerry Springer right in the middle of Colossians, you know. Christian slave who breaks away from Christian owner and apostle who verbally spanks him. It's amazing. Jerry Springer right here in Colossians. Well, this letter was most likely written between 52 and 55 AD, so just about 20 years after Jesus died and rose again, and most likely by Paul, though there is some debate about that. I'm inclined to believe that Paul did in fact write it, though along with Timothy, this disciple of Paul. They wrote it together. And what's very interesting about this book is When Paul wrote the letter to the Colossians, he wrote it having never met the Colossians. And you see his love. If you read this letter over and over again, you see his love for these people that he had never met. Extraordinary. Extraordinary. We also know that Paul wrote this letter from prison. We find that in Colossians 4, verse 3. Paul writes this. and pray for us too that God may open a door for our message so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ for which I am in chains. Paul was arrested by the Roman Empire. And that leads you to a question, or it should lead you to this question. Why would anyone be put in prison for believing something? Really. Why would anyone be put in prison for believing something as nice and mundane as Judeo-Christian values? well the answer is this you get put in prison when what you believe inspires an entire group of people to live in such a way that starts to subvert the power that currently exists you get put in prison when what you believe starts making people live so differently that it knocks the leg right out from underneath the cultural powers that be. So it leads me to ask myself this question, does what I believe inspire people to live in such a way? That the culture is threatened, not in some weird, odd-for-God kind of way where I'm only going to wear Christian T-shirts or brush my teeth with Christian toothpaste, right? but in a way that disrupts the economy of maybe pornography? What if what we believed inspired people in such an extreme way that the owners of pornographic businesses started losing money? That's ridiculous, right? That would never happen. What happened in Paul's time. It's a great little story in the book of Acts. This happened in the city of Ephesus. But the story starts up in Acts chapter 19. Turn your Bibles there if you want to follow along. Starting in verse 23. And it says, About that time there arose a great disturbance in the way. And the way was what people called these followers of Jesus. It's very interesting. It was not a religion. It was a way. A way of doing life, a way of living. And this word, great disturbance, is translated in the King James as no small stir. The Greek word is tarakos. It's kind of a fun word to say, so you should say it right now. Tarakos. I like that, I like that. Getting into it. It means to stir up or agitate. The picture you should get in your mind is a boiling pot of water that, you know, when you heat up your macaroni and cheese and the bubbles just, they flow over and you rush, it causes a stir, right? Well, in Acts chapter 19, there's this great little story that I just want to read to you. A silversmith named Demetrius, who we've all heard about, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in no little business for the skilled workers there. So what he did, Artemis was kind of a middleman, and he would hire out skilled workers to fulfill the orders that all the people in towns like Ephesus and Colossae had to build these little statues that they could put in their home to Artemis, right? And he called these skilled workers together, verse 25, along with the workers in related trades and said he gave this speech. He said, you know, my friends, that we receive a good income from this business to which everyone would be like, yes, yes. And verse 26, and you see in here how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that gods made by human hands are no gods at all. Boo! Hiss! But they didn't care about the gods. They cared because their pocketbooks were being affected in major ways. But in verse 27, he acts as if what he cares about is the gods. Verse 27, There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, But also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited. Oh no! And the goddess herself who is worshipped throughout the province of Asia and the world will be robbed of her divine majesty. So be very, very afraid. You ever heard this tactic before? Be afraid! Our very worldview is getting rocked. When actually, their very pocketbook was the thing that was getting rocked. Actually, the worldview was getting rocked. Because what Paul believed translated into no small stir, a taracos in the economy. In 2009, when the porn industry starts going down, we'll know that the message of Jesus is getting through. A little bit about Paul, his brilliant and subversive style. We know that Paul was Jewish. We know from our previous studies, and Dave said it last week, that he trained under the great Jewish rabbi Gamaliel. And so we know that Paul was one of the brightest students in terms of Judaism. We read this in Philippians when he says, you know, I am a Hebrew of all Hebrews, etc. His writings also always represented the intersection between three things, of which he was an expert on. Number one, the Hebrew scriptures. Because he was a rabbi, a student of Gamaliel, the rabbi, we know that he probably had the entire Hebrew Scriptures memorized. That's like this much? Memorized. He also probably had the major rabbis' interpretations of the Scriptures memorized. And so everything that he does, the Hebrew Scriptures, is all a part of it. The second intersection that Paul writes about is contemporary culture. He was not a student living in an ivory tower that only knew his field of study. He knew contemporary culture inside and out. And you read about that as he goes into Ephesus and Corinth and other cities and engages the people, not in the synagogues, but on their turf, in the public squares. But the third thing that Paul always writes about, in addition to the Hebrew scriptures and contemporary culture, is the gospel of Jesus Christ, which he feels transforms and fulfills both of the other two. And oftentimes, because Paul was so brilliant, he would be writing about one thing while making strong allusions to another thing with kind of a wink and a nod. And without historical reference, we lose that. So we're going to dive into that in a big way all over Colossians. So I want to give you an example. In Colossians 1, verse 1, open your Bibles if you have them to follow along. We read this, Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to God's holy people in Colossae, the faithful brothers and sisters in Christ, grace and peace to you from God our Father. Grace and peace. Now, if you don't know anything about the culture, that just sounds like a nice greeting. In fact, if you know the scriptures at all, you might reflect on the fact that Paul starts all of his letters like that. Well, karen, this word, this Greek word, was the normal greeting that was used. Paul uses the word charis, which means grace in the Greek. Charis means to rejoice because a favor has been done to you without any expectation of return. Charis means to have joy, pleasure, gratification, favor, acceptance. Spirit Zodiades says this, Charis is this, and I quote, the absolutely free expression of the love of God, finding its only motive in the bounty and benevolence of God. The absolutely free expression of the love of God, finding its only motive in the bounty and benevolence of God. Church at Colossae, church in Ephesus, church in Corinth. The first thing I want to say to you is grace and peace. Now, the illusion or the great wink that Paul has in this is that, we're going to find out about this in just a few minutes, but in the Roman Empire, under which they lived, under which they felt severe oppression. Caesar claimed to bring the gift of prosperity to the whole world through his generous benevolence. But everybody knew that his motive was financial gain and personal power. So right from the start, Paul is making this incredibly subversive statement, contrasting the character of God, and especially Jesus, with the character of Caesar when he says, grace. The first thing I want you to know about this God that I'm going to write about is that the love that God has for you is the absolutely free expression of love, finding its only motive in the bounty and benevolence of God. Grace to you, brothers and sisters, is what he writes. It's amazing. Peace. The Greek word is irene. It comes from the Hebrew word shalom, which was a way of life that immediately when you would say shalom to a Jew, you would know what they meant. It meant harmony, meant the opposite of war. Irene means every kind of good. May you experience in your life every kind of good. And only one time in the whole New Testament is it used as something that is to be experienced in a different life, in the future life, in the eternal life to come. Every other time, it's used as an experience of everyday life. May you experience right now every good thing. Now the thing that you have to remember is this is coming from a person who is in prison writing to people who are under the yoke of the Roman Empire. What makes you lose your peace? Well, if I'm on the phone and I'm on hold for more than 30 seconds or so, my peace is gone. If I encounter a little unexpected traffic, gone. If my little babies, who are the joy of God in my life, cry, cry, cry. Got a little Dave Johnson in me this morning, I guess. He's not here, I can say that, right? My peace is gone. For some of us, if the Vikings were to lose this afternoon, which, we're playing Detroit, so, shouldn't lose, but if the Vikings were to lose this afternoon, your peace would be gone. Paul is in prison writing these words, grace and peace, and either he's completely deluded, or he believes that the message that he is sharing, and the peace that he is proclaiming, is very real. and will cause no small stir in the culture around him. So let's dive into the worldview of these Colossians. The Colossians would have lived under a constant onslaught of propaganda coming their way from the Roman Empire. You've heard about the Pax Romana, the peace of Rome. It was this ideology that Rome was the bringer of lasting peace throughout the whole world. And Rome could guarantee such peace in exchange for the allegiance of its subjects, which was primarily shown by your giving of taxes to Caesar. The Roman Empire conquered city by city and created roads from those cities, all which led back to Rome, so that the resources of these cities, which formerly went to feeding families and giving families income, would be put on wagons and sent off to Rome. This is the worldview under which they lived. if you were to stop a typical citizen of Colossae on the street corner and do a little man-on-the-street interview, and you ask these questions, here would be their responses. Who is our Lord and Savior? Oh, that's easy. That's Caesar. Who forgives your sins? Caesar. Who is the divine Son of God? Caesar. Why are you asking me these questions? Everybody knows that. What is the gospel? I mean, did you crawl out from under a rock this morning? The gospel is an announcement from Rome when they've made a new military exploit. It's the good news that Rome is spreading peace and prosperity throughout the whole world by taking over cities and making them subject to her. How will peace and prosperity be spread? Well, this is where it gets a little tough because I have to start giving a lot, a big percentage of my earnings from my farm to Rome through taxes. I have to pledge my allegiance to the Roman Emperor Caesar. I have to say that Caesar is my Lord and Savior, and Caesar forgave my sins, and Caesar is the divine Son of God, if I want to share in the peace of Caesar. The image of Caesar was everywhere. If you went into the marketplace to buy some food or goods, you would see Caesar's face everywhere. The coins with which you bought things had Caesar's face on it, and it said, Caesar is Lord. right on the coins. The worldview of the people of Colossae was littered with propaganda that Caesar was the bringer of peace and Caesar was your savior. From a religious point of view, there was a plurality of views that would have influenced the little church at Colossae. And some were Jewish, who were used to practicing the Sabbath and following the law. Others were Greeks, who were used to praying to different gods for every different need under the sun. So getting on the same page about what it means to follow Jesus for this little town in Colossae would be no small thing. If we think we have problems because some of us want hymns to be sung and some of us want other songs to be sung and some of us don't want any songs at all and some of us want more songs to be sung. Can you imagine sitting in a prayer meeting in Colossae and you were a Jew, for example, and you might recite the Shema, Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one and we should love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength. And when you got done praying, your Greek now brother in Christ starts praying to the goddess of fertility. You'd be like, excuse me. So the major themes of Colossians, it's important to dive into because Paul's letter to the Colossians can be broken down into really two basic themes. And the first is an engagement of and criticism of both the cultural and religious philosophies that I just talked about. That seek to bring peace, but fail in actually doing so. We read about this directly in Colossians 2 verse 8. Colossians 2 verse 8. Paul writes this, See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world, rather than on Christ. The imagery there is incredible. Hollow and deceptive. Hollow means empty or devoid of the spirit and devoid of power. But deceptive means that it carries the appearance of power. Anyone ever encountered anything that carried the appearance of power and spiritual force but was empty? Anyone? Or was it just in Colossae? and this image to take you captive, it doesn't really mean much for us because we've never been taken captive. Most of us haven't, but the imagery is that would immediately come to mind of this little town in Colossae was, Paul is saying, don't be the spoils of war for someone else. Don't be carried away like an army would carry away booty from a city that they've just conquered. Don't be led away by those who look like the real deal, but who are only seeking destruction. Because Paul is saying it exists in your culture, and it also exists in the religion of your time. So Paul writes this explosive letter to the Colossians, which exposes the hollow and deceptive nature of the cultural and religious philosophies that were big in the time of Colossae. And here's what is revolutionary. His letter to the Colossians is an announcement of a different kind of gospel proclaimed by a different Lord and Savior. Grace and peace, not from Caesar, but from God our Father through the Lord Jesus Christ. Brought about not by conquest, oppression, and taxation, but by a person who laid down his life for his subjects. the one who is above all things, who in him all things were created, came to serve the people that he created. It is an amazing announcement. A subversive, counter-cultural gospel that would have flew right in the face of the cultural and religious perspectives of their time. People would be whispering things like this in little corners of their homes. The way of Caesar is the way of oppression and power. But there's a different way. The way of Jesus is the way of compassion and humility. The way of Caesar is the way of conquest and war. But this new announcement, the way of Jesus, is the way of compassion or of forgiveness. and peace. The way of Caesar is the way of exploitation and greed, but the way of Jesus is the way of redemption and gratitude. So maybe there's a different way to go here. Maybe there is an alternative to our cultural and religious philosophies. The powerful way of Jesus, Paul writes, radically exposes and subverts the hollow and deceptive way of Caesar and of the religious philosophies of their times, but it doesn't do so in a vacuum. It's not just that someone proclaims Jesus is Lord. It only does so when a group of followers decides to incarnate the way of Jesus. It's very interesting that when all was said and done, the most beautiful way that God made himself known to humanity was by becoming a person. and embodying his way by putting on display, God put on display God's character through this man named Jesus. And when Jesus died and rose again and sent his spirit to the church, here is what Jesus says to us through Paul and through others. Just like I embodied and put on display the character of God, you as the body of Christ are to put on display my character and my way to the world. More on that later. Paul also confronts a kind of religious philosophy which set up a power system of its own. And we find this in Colossians 2, starting in verse 18. Where Paul writes this, Don't let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you. such people such people also go into great detail about what they have seen and their unspiritual minds puff them up with idle notions they've lost connection with the head from whom the whole body supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews grows as god causes it to grow see apparently there were some believers in the church of colossae who claimed that to be really spiritual you had to have ecstatic experiences like seeing angels and even talking to angels rather than simply living out your faith by small acts of compassion and forgiveness and apparently it caused no small stir in this church that's part of why paul wrote this letter to confront that i can just imagine the email forwards back at colossae so and so said that you didn't have to see angels oh my goodness but i think you really do we should throw that guy out of the church well good thing that never happens anymore right man good thing that stopped that colossi there's a kind of doctrine war that's happening right now in evangelical christianity and maybe you know about it maybe you don't but on one side is people that are terribly afraid that the fundamentals of christianity are in danger of being lost because this other side is so eager to redefine and rediscover the fundamentals of Christianity, which in their words apparently have been covered up by the other side. So back and forth and blogs and emails and fear and fighting. Now I think it's important to have rigorous intellectual debate. I really do, because there are some things where you need to say, no, the buck really does stop here. But a question comes into my mind while we fight our wars with each other. The question that comes up is this. What kind of picture of Jesus are we lifting up to the world when all we can do is fight with each other and be motivated by fear and talk radio? It sounds more like a reflection of our culture of divisiveness and fear. It's easy to fight, isn't it? It's really easy to fight. It's hard to be compassionate, to offer forgiveness. So I think most of us are kind of saying, okay, I don't want to be about fear and fighting. I don't want to lose my faith. So what's the alternative picture of a way to live? How can I put on display the character of Christ when I've never seen that on display. Well, that's why we need to look backwards to a little community of people that did not get it perfectly, but from whom we can learn about what it would mean to put on display the character of Jesus. So the second major theme in Colossians is that Paul attempts to paint a picture of this alternative community modeled on the kingdom of God, which Jesus proclaimed, inaugurated, and made possible through his life and death and resurrection. Because the letter to the Colossians is a new kind of evangelion, which means gospel. Paul brilliantly co-opts this word from Rome. It's an announcement that is meant to encourage a whole group of people that they are part of a movement that is spreading throughout the whole world. A movement of people that are deciding to put on display the character of Jesus. we read this in Colossians 1 verse 6 in the same way the gospel the evangelium this new way is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood God's grace this gospel that is spreading throughout the whole world is the announcement that there are people who have decided to follow in this way. To live by an opposing set of values to that which the Roman Empire not only espoused, but relied upon. Its subjects living out in order to be sustained. So when its subjects started living a different way, the legs fell out from underneath this colossal empire. Paul writes about these values that are to be lived out in Colossians 3, starting in verse 12. therefore which is usually preceded by a whole list of ramblings by paul which is really important but it's usually run-on sentences and all this kind of stuff and then it gets to a therefore which means now here's what to do therefore verse 12 it's god's chosen people holy and dearly loved clothe yourselves which means do it every day think about it as something as you have to do every day. Clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. Who can argue with those things? I'm going to write a blog about someone who's too patient. Right? They're too humble. Man, they're too kind. Verse 13, bear with each other and forgive one another if, this is Paul's kind of little sarcasm here. Hey, if there's any grievance that any one of you have for one another, just in case there is, forgive as the Lord forgave you. Verse 14, over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. And verse 15, let the peace of Christ, the arena of Christ, the shalom of Christ, rule in your hearts, which means that it's going to have to do battle among other things. Let peace rule, not worry or anxiety or hatred. Let peace rule. Since as members of one body, you are called to peace and be thankful. Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. And in verse 17 of Colossians 3 comes the sort of magnum opus of the whole letter to Colossians. And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. Do it all. Whatever you do, do it all in the name of Jesus. And so they would do things like celebrate the Lord's Supper together, which was breaking bread and drinking wine together. But that looked differently than it looks here, I think, because what it primarily meant was that if you were hungry, you could come at night and get a meal. Every time you would gather, you would remember, oh yeah, let the peace of Christ rule in my heart because right now there's hatred for my brother. It has to be about peace. In Acts 3, there's a wonderful little story of Peter and John walking into the temple. They still worshiped in the synagogue and they went by this beggar, which sat in front of the temple. It's interesting that that's where he sat while all these religious people would pass by him. And he couldn't walk, and so apparently he asked for money. And then Peter and John's response was this. I don't have any silver or gold, which, like to us, we have $5 in our pocket and we get asked for money. I don't have any money. They really didn't have any money because we read in Acts 2 that they kept a common purse. So they couldn't have given money even if they wanted to because their money was owned by their community. But they say, what I do have I offer you, something that is neither hollow nor deceptive. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I want you to get up and walk. And this guy did this crazy thing because he had nothing else to lose and because no one else was on his side. He was the definition of the poor in spirit, the tokos that Jesus talked about way back in the Sermon on the Mount. Blessed are you when you are at the end of your rope because when no one else is on your side, God is on your side. And God has a power that will enable you to stand up and walk. And so he did. Man. Write an email about that. Write a blog about that. It's amazing. When a little group of people decides to do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, which I don't think I need to explain that. You know, that doesn't mean every time you do something, you say, Oh, oh, oh, forgot to say Jesus. Sometimes you're going to need to say that. But when a little group of people decides to do it all in the name of Jesus, it causes no small stir in whatever power structure is in place, whether it be cultural or religious. In fact, Church of the Open Door in 1980, a 27-year-old guy named Dave Johnson comes in and starts preaching through Galatians. It exposed a kind of legalism that was existing in Church of the Open Door almost 30 years ago that was hollow and deceptive. And the words of Jesus came through the words of Paul in Galatians and brought freedom. Because here's the deal. The way of Jesus is the most real, nitty-gritty, real life, and powerful thing that you can experience. Compassion is more powerful than oppression. Forgiveness is stronger than conquest, and gratitude defeats greed. And you can take those things to the bank. But it has to start with a group of people deciding to incarnate the way of Jesus in their world. Because when subjects of a power start living differently, the legs fall out from underneath that power structure. And when the gospel spreads, Caesar is rendered impotent because the true ruler that has brought real grace and peace is being put on display by those who follow him. And this true ruler, we sang about it, Joel sang about it during the offering, but it's written about in Colossians 1 starting in verse 15. It's this beautiful song. Colossians 1.15, the Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. That means that He is the source. For in Him all things were created. Wait a minute, I thought it was God. Jesus was there too? Things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities, all things have been created through Him and for Him. he is before all things and in him all things hold together and he is the head of the body of the church he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead so that in everything he might have the supremacy so when you go to the street corner and said who is your lord and savior the answer whether you know it or not is jesus christ for god verse 19 was pleased to have all of his fullness dwell in him and through him to reconcile to himself what? All things. Whether things on earth or things in heaven by making peace through his blood shed on the cross because this ruler announces this gospel. I have laid my life down for you. We're going to find out in Colossians 2 what that means. Verses 14 and 15. Our written code that was against us being nailed up on the cross. Christ is amazing. So whatever we do, whether in word or deed, we do it all in the name of Jesus, the one in whom all things hold together, the one for whom all things were created, and the one in whom all things are being reconciled. So question, Church of the Open Door in 2009. How would we know if we were actually doing all in the name of Jesus? How would we know? Well, I don't think it would be when someone finally wins the doctrine war. It's important. I just don't think that would be the manifestation of doing it all in the name of Jesus. I think when the porn industry starts shutting down, which would be a good thing, amen? When little kids stop being abused. When divorce lawyers start lining up at the unemployment lines, then it might be said of a little community of Jesus followers that we actually were doing all in the name of Jesus. And that is something that I think this church cares a lot about. So, buckle up, Church of the Open Door. this little ride through the book of Colossians is going to be wild let's pray together Jesus here's the thing I think we really do want to put on display your character because we are your body before that to happen we need to be connected to the head we need to have such a clear vision of who you are and what you care about and how you talked and how you breathed and lived and made friends that we would not be in danger of being separated from the head. So Jesus, as we kind of consecrate this new series, we pray, number one, that we would be connected to the head, to you. And that we would be connected to one another through acts of kindness and patience and compassion and forgiveness. that we would look to each other and see you. That we would look at each other and do what you would do. In your name, Jesus, the one in whom all things hold together, the one who is reconciling all things to himself, in your strong name, which represents the true gospel, which sets people free, we pray. Amen.
