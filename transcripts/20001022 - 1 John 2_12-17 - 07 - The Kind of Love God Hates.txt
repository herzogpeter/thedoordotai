I'd like you to open your Bibles with me to the book of 1 John, the second chapter. We're picking our study up today in a section that begins in verse 12. We'll go through verse 17 today. It is a section that I have entitled, The Kind of Love God Hates. Now admittedly, that's a strange title, especially when you consider that one of the primary themes of 1 John we've been studying is love. God is love. and those who are born of him are to walk in love. 1 John 4, 7. Last week in 1 John 2, 10, John made it very clear that the one who loves his brother is the one who walks in the light. The one who hates is in the darkness for the darkness of his hatred has blinded his eyes. The point is this, that all through this epistle of 1 John we are called to love, never to hate. It would seem never to hate. Yet right in the middle of this epistle, in fact right in the middle of this section from 12 to 17 in verse 15 are three strange words that clearly exhort the opposite of love in fact it says this these three words start verse 15 do not love this is strange it struck me as strange in the middle of this thing about love that those three words would be there in any context now as we read on through the text it's going to become clear that what we're told not to love is the world this world's system and the reason we will soon discover as we study this this morning is because number one it opposes the purposes of god number two it serves as a rival to god and number three most importantly it damages the people of god and because that's what the world does that is why verse 12 i am writing to you little children because your sins are forgiven for his name's sake because the world system does damage to people that is why i am writing to you fathers because you know him who was from the beginning. And I'm writing to you young men. Let me stop right there. This is kind of a male thing here. And this is not to be limited to the fathers. It's the adults, fathers and mothers, not just young men, young men and young women of that age, because you've overcome the evil one. I've written to you children because you know the father. I have written to you fathers because you know him who has been from the beginning. I've written to you young men and women because you are strong and the word of God abides in you and you are using your youthful strength to overcome the evil one. I am writing to all of you, children, young people and adults, do not love the world, nor the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life is not from the Father, but is from the world. The world is passing away and also its lusts. But the one who does the will of God abides forever. Did you know that God, who is identified, again, all through this epistle as being love and calls us all through this epistle to walk in love himself, does not love everything. And neither should we. Indeed, there are certain things the Bible says that this God of love hates. it's a strong word there are many places I could take you in scripture to illustrate that fact the clearest maybe the best is probably Proverbs 6 verse 16 because it's kind of all together it says this there are six things that God hates indeed seven are an abomination to him a proud look is the first lofty eyes arrogant people who can't be taught who already know who see themselves as a cut above all through scripture God says this kind of thing about that God opposes stands against the proud. A lying tongue he hates, hands that shed innocent blood. Picture there is that of a murderous, cruel disposition that kills or crushes rather than be denied or frustrated in getting what they want when they wanted. God hates that. A heart that devises wicked schemes and feet that are swift in running to sin. Scripture often speaks of sin, especially when it's involving his people as a stumbling. We stumble into sin. It speaks of sin as being something we fall into. In Galatians 6, it speaks of people who are caught in a trespass. And the word caught there brings with it the nuance of being caught unaware. They weren't intending to get into this mess, but now they're in the mess, and you're actually wondering if you can get out at all of this mess. You don't like what you just did. But hearts that devise evil schemes and feet that are swift in running to evil speak to intentionality and eagerness to sin, and God hates that. A false witness that fabricates lies, and he who sows discord among brethren with gossip and slander, which would be the equivalent of shedding innocent blood with words. God hates all that stuff. And the primary reason he does matters, the primary reason is because every single one of those things do great damage to the object of his love. And the object of his love is people. I mean, just imagine. And the sad thing is, for many of you, you will not have to ignite your imagination at great depths because you will live in systems like this. But imagine growing up in a family system, for instance. Or imagine going to work or going to a school every day or being on a team or living in a society that is made up of people with lofty eyes, lying tongues, cruel intentions, evil schemes, blistering tongues of slander and gossip and mouths. Picture being around people like that all day, in your family, at work, on a team. Not a happy place. In contexts like that, systems like that, children, one of the focuses of the text who he's writing to, little children in systems like that are deeply damaged children, normally able to naturally receive and dispense the love of God, naturally able to let in forgiveness of the Father in systems where the people around them have lofty eyes, lying tongues, cruel intentions, evil schemes, and blistering tongues. The souls of little children cover up and shrivel up just to survive. Imagine young people in a system like this, young men and women, normally so full of youthful strength, normally with a capacity to conquer and to endure. And systems like this stumble and fall, lose their way, and instead of being able to use their youthful energy and strength that God gave them that they need to put into play at this season in their life to overcome and to endure and to conquer kingdoms, as it were, they end up using their youthful energy to protect themselves and attack those who they see as a threat with a rebellious kind of rage. In systems like this, where you're surrounded with lofty eyes, lying tongues, cruel intentions, evil schemes, and blistering tongues, the fathers and the mothers, the adults, as it were, are diminished, having nothing to give, being damaged themselves, the prospect of modeling and mentoring, leading and nurturing. he's just shot and it is because of that that John is saying in this text I am writing to you little children I'm writing specifically to the little children who have either not been damaged yet or have experienced some healing you know your sins are forgiven and you know the love of the Father I am writing to you young people who are using your youthful strength to abide in the truth to overcome evil and to endure and I am writing to you fathers and mothers who have stuck around and have not been yet so damaged that you really do, at this stage of your life, have something to give and you've known the love of God from the beginning. Here is what I'm writing to all of you children, young people, fathers and mothers, while there is still hope, do not love the world. Do not be seduced by, do not be drawn into. I'm speaking to those of you who may not have already been entirely sucked into this whole thing. This world system, do not go there into this system that creates the kind of pain I just described and does the kind of damage I just delineated. See, here's the deal in this epistle that you can, we speak so much of love, now there's this thing about not loving. Here's the deal about that. Here's the way to reconcile that tension. Authentic love brings with it a corresponding hatred for whatever might violate the object of that love. Indeed, here's the way it kind of shakes down. The more you love, the more you will oppose that which threatens or damage that love. You have never seen anything more hostile than a mother whose child is being threatened or wounded. I mean, if you're a mother, you know what I'm talking about. If you've ever seen a mother whose little kid is about to get run over by somebody or hurt by somebody, 110 pounds, I can take that. Get out of the way. I mean, I am convinced that a 110-pound mother of a child would take on a train if that train was bearing down on the object of her love. Now, this mother I'm hypothetically giving to you here does not have a particularly negative attitude toward trains. Doesn't have a problem. Doesn't need any psychological help. Doesn't normally see trains and go, I hate those trains, I hate those. Doesn't do that. Unless this train is bearing down one day on the object of her love. Then this train becomes the mortal sworn enemy for life of this woman. This woman hates this train. What are you getting at? This is what I'm getting at. If you love someone or something by virtue of that love, if you respond to the love that is being called for in 1 John, by virtue of that love, you become the natural enemy of anything that threatens or violates that love. So the love that God hates is the love that would embrace the natural enemy of God. The natural enemy of God, according to John, is this world's system. And the reason this world's system is the natural enemy of God is because it threatens and damages the object of his love, and the object of his love is people. It's you and it's me, particularly little children, young men and women, fathers and mothers. I want you to just think about this as I kind of put all this thing together with this text. if you can damage, diminish, and dismantle those three segments of a society, if we could damage our children, if we could hinder our young men and women from doing what young men and women normally do, just in a healthy context, they conquer, they run, they endure, they have strength. If we can diminish the value of our fathers and our mothers, Well, you, in doing that, have pretty much destroyed that society's capacity to provide a safe and sane existence for anybody. And I'm here to tell you, God hates that. And that is why John says, do not love the system that does that. Why don't you just think about that as I kind of take this in another direction and look at this whole thing from a different angle. I grew up in church. Most of you know that. My dad was a pastor and said that several times. What that means is this. I've heard this verse all my life. Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. And I am pretty sure that when I heard it and it was being taught to me, I probably heard it taught correctly. It doesn't matter what they were saying to me, however, because my understanding, picture me 12, 15 years old, somewhere in there. My understanding of this verse, how it kind of went through my 15-year-old grid was this. Telling me not to love the world, neither the things that are in the world. Well, my perception of the world was this. That it is full of delightful, exciting, thrilling things. Really fun things. But God isn't much into fun. In fact, he's kind of crabby. Pretty uptight. Really boring. Kind of like my Sunday school teacher. You know, kind of like the deacon board. Boy, there's a happy group. Kind of like church. But if you really love God and you want to go to heaven, you're just going to say no to all that fun stuff that the world has. And you'll actually come to enjoy really dull things. It's a sign of maturity. and if you ever feel like complaining Dave because you feel like you're missing out on all the fun just remember you get to go to heaven but again the message was it doesn't start till then you got into okay life is terrible it's so boring but I get heaven and all these people out there who are enjoying themselves are going to burn in hell so take great confidence in that nobody ever said this to me but my impression of this whole thing if I was going to do the kingdom life and if I was going to do this verse love not the world and the good things in the world that basically what I was going to have to do was just say no to life because life was out there that's where the fun was well to that false perception all of heaven weeps and if God could be here in the flesh and maybe he is somehow through me by the spirit through this word he would say I believe these words to that false perception I don't know how to make it any more clear but I have come that you might have life and that you might have it to the full my kingdom that I have brought that you can taste and touch and feel is not come so that it can steal your joy and spoil your fun but I have come and brought my kingdom for you to experience in order to make your joy complete. In fact, the truth is this, you have been lied to and many of you have been believing the lie and may be believing it right now. It is the world and the things in the world that steals and kills and destroys your joy and your ability to fully experience life as you were wired by God to experience it. What I want to do over the next couple of weeks is, as best I can, dismantle and give us pictures of ways that we have bought into that lie. We need to examine some of these perceptions as closely as we can. The best way, I believe, to get to that is to just start asking some questions. Most basic question is this. What does John mean by the world? What is he referring to? So that when I call you away from the world, and that when we pull away from it and see it as something we need to see as a threat, that we're pulling away from the right thing, not some goofy 15-year-old perception like what I had. Why is it so important not to love it? I want to answer that question somehow. What does this world system promise and does it deliver? What does this world system that looks sometimes so attractive, actually produce? That would be good information for me to have as I try to decide whether I'm going to buy into the system or say no to the system, not love the system. Well, let's start with what John means by the world. It comes from the Greek word cosmos. There are several usages of that word in the word of God. Sometimes that word cosmos is making reference to the physical world, the creation, mountain streams. Obviously, he's not using it that way here. Sometimes that word cosmos is making reference to the human world in John 3, 6, and he says, for God so loved the cosmos. Well, he's not referring there to creation. He's not referring to mountains and streams. God so loved that what? World, meaning what? People. Well, he doesn't mean we shouldn't love people, and we shouldn't love creation. What he's speaking of here, when he uses the word world or cosmos, he's speaking with reference to a system. A system of thoughts, ideas, and activities, specifically that is dominated by Satan. Let me just say a word about systems, because you know more about this than maybe you think you do. The world. You know, you might be watching the news tonight or CNN or something like that, and at some point, the newscast person might say something like this, well, now to the world of politics. Well, when he says the world of politics, you know he doesn't mean there's going to be a big globe coming down, and there's this, now to the world of finance. It's not a globe, it's a system. It's a way of thought, and if I want to have sex, Okay, okay, okay, okay. You know what? This is like one of the worst. I was trying to say success, okay? Can you see how it happened? Okay, okay. What's he thinking about up there anyway? I mean, Bruce, you're not helping me. He's going like, you know, I'm telling you, this is the equivalent of a fire alarm going right off in the middle of the thing. I mean, I've lost you all. You're all gone. I mean, I had you right here, didn't I? Where in the world was I? Okay. If I want to have success in the world of finance, I need to understand how it works. I need to know what drives it, and I'm not going to be able to tap the resources of it unless I do. Same with politics. The kingdom of God, beloved, is a system, and there are ways it works. In fact, I've been talking about the system of the kingdom of God the last several weeks. If you want to experience, if you want to know, if you want to tap into the resources of the kingdom, one of the things you need to do, according to 1 John 1, is you need to start bringing into the light what you hide in the dark. That's how the system works. when John talks here about cosmos, the world he's talking about a different kind of system a system as I've already said dominated by Satan it is a system of thoughts ideas and activities that offers a version of reality that is upside down it is a version of reality that looks to be true but it is false that presents itself as life but it is death it offers what looks like joy but it gives you sorrow deep sorrow is a system that appears to be lasting and substantial. I mean, it's everywhere we look, and everybody seems to have bought into it, but it is passing away. This system, we need to know about the system. We need to know what drives it, what it is that calls us. It is a system that is driven by, fueled and characterized by three things. They're in verse 16. The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the boastful pride of life. Operating in those three arenas is how this system works. Just a quick definition of all three. Lust of the flesh is the satisfaction of the appetites now. Whatever you want to taste, you can taste. Whatever you want to do, you can do. Whatever you want to feel, you can feel, and you can feel it now. The operative word around the lust of the flesh that will indicate to you, if you're trying to do a self-inventory, that this is what will reveal to you that you indeed are operating according to this particular principle, the operative word is insatiable. Because once you begin to buy into this way of life and you begin to live this way, it will never be enough. There will never be enough sex, power, money, possessions, or pleasure. There's nothing wrong with any of those things. But if you are a person driven by the lust of the flesh, those things will begin to be those things you look to to satisfy all of your appetites. And the problem is, no matter how much of those things you get, You will never be satisfied. The way you will know that you are operating according to that principle, that principle that makes the system of the world work, the way it works, is that you'll never be satisfied. Lest of the eyes is, bottom line, greed. Whatever you see, you must possess. Now, what you see and need to possess might be a possession. But it's not just limited to that. It might be a position. It might be a person. People who are driven by the lust of the eyes, by greed, by their need to possess, are incapable of loving anybody. Why? Because they use people. Why do they use people? Well, the reason I'm in a relationship with you is because I'm going to use you to meet some need in me. I'm pretty convinced that when David, King David, was looking over the balcony and saw Bathsheba, that clearly what was driving his behavior was the lust of the flesh. There was a sexual thing going on there for sure. But I think more than a sexual thing going on there, I think there was the lust of the eyes that got him and the lust that is always, we're always thinking about sexuality when we think of that word. But the lust of the eyes, I think, was a desire to possess. A desire to possess her. And I can just kind of add her, this little trophy case of people that I am able to own and use for me. Listen, listen. Again, picture David looking at Bathsheba. Do you think what went through his mind, and you know what? This kind of thing can go through someone's mind. A kingdom person might look at someone else and wonder, I wonder, what kind of interaction could I possibly have with that woman that would build her and lift her and encourage her and strengthen her and send her on her way in a way that's better when she leaves than when she first met me? What would that look like? That is not what David was thinking. David was operating out of the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes, and all he wondered about was, what could I do to possess her? And it ended up killing her husband, destroying the family, and it was all because he just thought he could own someone. Pride of life is much the same. It's simply the arrogance that says, I am the center of the universe, and pretty much what I want is what I'm going to want. And I'm going to do what I want to do, when I want to do it, where I want to do it, to whomever I want to do it. I'm a God unto myself. If you think that's a cool way to live, and if you think that that's kind of a neat way for you to live, just picture being married to somebody like that, who thinks they're the center of the universe. Some of you are married to somebody like that. It's not a happy way to live. Verse 15 says this, Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. Well, those three things, lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and the pride of life are what's in the world. Remember, I told you when I was 15, I used to think what was in the world was all this wonderful stuff, and we were kind of being told we couldn't have it. No, no, no, no. You need to understand. When I'm calling you away from this, I'm not calling you away from one wonderful, fun stuff. God has wonderful, fun stuff for you and for me. Life. What he's calling you away from are these three things that drive the system. Lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, pride of life. those three things are how the system works and just like you need to know how the world of politics work if you're going to be successful there and just like you need to know how the world of finance works if you're going to be successful there and just like you need to know how the kingdom of God works if you're going to experience the kingdom of God in your life you also need to know how the world system works and not be naive to it these three things are what drive it these three things are what fuel it Let me talk to you a little bit about that word lust. It is the Greek word epithumia. It means simply this, strong desire. Let me tell you something about that. There is nothing wrong with strong desire. God gave you strong desire. If you were here several weeks ago, the very first sermon out of 1 John, I invited you to desire. I called you to stir up your desire for the life and light and love of God. But the world system, dominated by Satan, approaches your strong desire, the strong desire being a good thing, but it makes to your strong desire for life a promise. The promise it makes is this. I can give you what you want. I can satisfy your needs. I can quench your thirst. Here's how. Indulge your flesh. Just say yes to every urge you feel. Indulge your eyes. Indulge your pride, your ego centrality. You really are the center. You really are entitled. Here's the deal. On the front end, without a doubt, that message sounds like a sweet deal. I don't know about you, but the truth about me is I like that word indulge. Somebody comes to me and says, Dave, indulge. I go, okay, you're my friend. I mean, it sounds a lot like freedom, doesn't it? If you can indulge and do whatever you want, whenever you want, to whoever you want, I must be what? I must be free. This must be, let's define freedom that way, our culture has. See, I like being told. I love being told. I'll hang around people who will tell me, whatever you want. You can do whatever you want. You can do it whenever you want. In fact, Dave, not only can you do this, this is your right. This is your right. You have a right to whatever you want, whenever you want it. Because you're pretty much God. Nobody says that, but that is exactly what they're saying. Now, while on the front end, this does, oh, that calls me. I'm telling you, that calls me. While on the front end, it does. Let me put, again, this spin on it, hopefully to give you some pause. Imagine now being in a family system, church system, school, work, or being on a team where everyone in it, not just you, but everybody, is driven by the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life. Imagine being in a marriage where the person you're married to is driven by the lust of their flesh, the lust of their eyes, and they are living as if they are the absolute center of the universe. Everything has to revolve around her. Everything has to revolve around him. I am describing for you, not the greatest life, I am describing for you hell on earth. In a system like this, be it a family, a workplace, a school, a church, a team that you're on, in this system, you know what? You know how it works. You know how this, here's how this system works. It's every person for themselves. You are entirely on your own. You will never know if you're really loved. Why? Because the only reason people are doing anything for you is because they want to use you because they're operating out of what satisfies them entirely. So how do you ever know if you're loved? You don't. So your job is just to make sure everybody's happy around you. You can't ever be confident that people will stay. Why? Because as soon as they get a better offer, something that, you know, makes them feel a little better, they're gone. Why would they be gone? Because it's my needs and my wants and I am the center of the universe. There's nothing else that governs what I do. You are entangled in this world that destroys people. So here's the deal. While on the front end, this invitation to indulge your flesh, indulge your eyes and indulge your pride. Sounds like a sweet deal. The fact is this, that this world's system cannot deliver to you what it promises. What it promises is this, that if you indulge your flesh, your eyes, and your pride, you will be fulfilled. No, you won't. It does not work. It cannot satisfy, it cannot fulfill, and it will not produce joy. What it will give you is the wonderful taste of chocolate on your tongue for about 10 minutes. It will taste good. The pleasure of sin for a season, it's a very short season. Which is precisely why as often as the Bible calls sin evil and points out the damage that it does, the Bible also calls sin folly because it doesn't work. Cornelius Planting on this book I've been referencing lately called Not the Way It's Supposed to Be, says it this way. Sin is both wrong and dumb. Kind of straight to the point there. Here's why. It's the wrong recipe for good health. It's the wrong gasoline for the engine. It's the wrong road if you're trying to get home. In other words, sin is not just evil, it's futile. He goes on, listen to this. Human desire, deep and restless, is seemingly unfillable. Keeps stuffing itself with finite goods, but these cannot satisfy. If we try to fill our human hearts with anything besides the God of the universe, we will find in short order that we are overfed but undernourished. And we find that day by day, week by week, month by month, we are thinning down to a mere outline of a human being. Sad to say, this goes on all the time. People hungry for love will often open up to a sequence of shallow, self-seeking relationships with other shallow, self-seeking people. only to find that at the end of the day they are emptier than when they began. I thought this would fill me. No, it's going to empty you. I thought this would taste good. It did for 10 minutes. The whole project, he goes on to say, has been as idle and dehumanizing as the conversation on those date and mate TV programs that explore the sump level of instability. Beneath all the surface liveliness, the sadness of these programs is that they reduce their participants to mere leering silhouettes of the human being. End quote. Beloved, the world's system that John is entreating us to pull away from, to not be seduced by, indeed to hate, not the people in it, but the system that drives it is not dangerous only because it's evil. It's dangerous also because it's futile. It does not work. It can't deliver what it promises. Frederick Buechner, in his book, The Two Loves, puts this spin on it. The Bible is not, first of all, a book of moral truth, he says. I would call it instead a book of truth about the way life actually works. Those strange old scriptures present life to us as having been ordered in a certain way. with certain laws as inextricably built into it as the law of gravity is built into the physical universe. When Jesus says, for example, that whoever would save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake shall surely find it, he is not making a statement about how morally speaking life ought to be. Rather, he is making a statement about how life really is. This is how it works, says Christ. Satan, therefore, says Buechner, with all of his enticements and promises for this good life, has involved himself in truth in a hopeless program of swimming against the current of the universe. For while moral evil is destructive and sometimes infuriating, it is also in some ways ludicrous. It just doesn't work. C.S. Lewis, in his book, The Preface to Paradise Lost, pointedly sums it up this way, saying, Mere Christianity commits us to believe that the devil in the long run is an ass. Sorry, that was C.S. Lewis who said that. Well, let me give you some more of Lewis on this. Given this whole running down this line of sin and the world system that looks so attractive but doesn't work. He says this, sin is a form of self-abuse. Self-abuse. What do you mean? Well, think about it. Promiscuous people coarsen themselves. I mean, it feels so good on the front end. It looks so good. It tastes like chocolate for 10 minutes. But here's the deal in promiscuity. You end up disqualifying yourself from the deepest forms of intimacy, the ones that are bonded by things like trust. And you condemn yourself to social superficiality from one relationship to another to another. And isn't, doesn't it look, and the world says, this is just the best. Well, that's the best they can do. And it's going to leave you empty like a shell. Liars and cheats forfeit their neighbor's trust. Well, that's a good deal. It imprisons you behind a wall of enmity and suspicion, thus cutting you off from other fellows. Envy. Well, there's a wonderful way to live. what it does is traps and torments the envy or turning their life into a hell of resentment. Pride, the pride of life. The way the system runs is on the pride of life. Well, all that does is render a fool unteachable. They know it all. You can't tell them anything. They are wise in their own eyes, a sure sign of folly. So John says this. Love not this world system, neither the things that drive this world system. Why? Because it damages and diminishes people. Because it doesn't work. And finally, because it doesn't last. Verse 17. The world is passing away. The world is passing away. It will finally be judged. It will fully be destroyed. The end of that 17th verse says, The one who does the will of God abides forever. That sounds very much like Psalm 1, verses 1 through 3. How blessed is the person who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers. But this person's delight is in the truth of God. And in his truth, he meditates day and night. This is the kind of person who will be like a tree. I mean, just get a taste of this. If you're struggling with what the world offers, I mean, just get a taste of this on your tongue. To be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, which yields its fruit in its season, and in whatever this person does, they will, the word says prosper. Another way to say that is this person will bring forth life. What kind of life? We'll get a vision of this. It'll bring forth the kind of life that can allow children to flourish. Imagine being a kingdom people, which is who we are. Imagine being a kingdom people who are walking in the light and saying no to the system and learning the ways in which we're... Creating an environment where children can do what children naturally do. You know what children naturally do? They love the Father. And they know they're forgiven. They just live in the security of that. And they don't have to spend 30 years of their life trying to get to the place where they know God loves them. What a dream. Wouldn't it be a dream? Can you get the dream of being a people where the children just know that stuff? It's the kind of life where young men and young women can do what young men and young women do. You know what young men and young women do? They run. They just got this energy. It drives me nuts. I wish I had the energy. Don't you? Don't you love watching young men and young women have energy to conquer in the world? Young men and young women who are living in an environment of purity and people who stick around and people who press through their issues and people who love God from their heart. It creates this environment where young men and women can endure and overcome the evil one. Young men and women can overcome the evil one. You do not have to buy into this system. just imagine an environment where people are living like this so fathers and mothers are no longer diminished but the fact that they have walked with God for years and years and years and they don't have as much energy anymore but they can look at the young men and women who are running and saying I'm telling you what the race you're running it's worth it it's worth it because I know the love of God and I can it's real I'm here to tell you it's real so keep on running young man keep on running young woman you can overcome the evil one and the children can turn around and just delight the hearts of the fathers and the mothers and the young people can encourage and the fathers and mothers and oh my goodness, I'm starting to talk about the kingdom of God. This is the kingdom of God that Jesus says is within your reach. The kind of love that God hates is the kind of love that loves what diminishes people. The kind of love that God hates is the kind of love that loves what doesn't work, what will not last. And so what I do this morning is I invite you to what I've been inviting you into ever since we began 1 John. I invite you into life, into an eternal kind of life. I invite you into light. I invite you into the kind of love that makes people whole. But for some of you to come into that light and life and love, you're going to need to turn around. Jesus said it this way repent for the kingdom of heaven a whole different system is within your reach but you're going to have to turn around the image I've had in my mind since last night around this world system that calls to us is that we get entangled in it I have a very vivid picture that word entanglement works and there's just things all around us and some of you are feeling yourself profoundly entangled if you're honest about yourself that the truth is that what drives just about everything you do is the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, that you're the center of the universe. And hopefully, in fact, if you haven't tasted the downside of that at all, there's no appeal in the sermon to you at all. But hopefully, you've already begun to taste some of the death that that way of life offers. But there can come such an entanglement that you could be hearing these words, even thinking they're right, even desiring a different way, but so entangled are you, you just think, There's just no way. I'm just so tied up in this. I wouldn't even know where to begin. Here's where you begin. Could I just give you a place to begin? Number one, notice you're entangled. Notice. And number two, just ask God to help you get entangled. You can't. If you're really entangled, you'll make a promise. Ah, ah. You're not. Oh, God. Call God right now this day before you leave. Oh, God, help me. I am so entangled. I have ruined my marriage. I have ruined my job. People run from me. I am in bondage to what people think. I'm a user. And it's spelling death to people I'm with, and it's spelling death to me. And Jesus says, come to the kingdom. Come into the kingdom. Repent. Turn around. For the kingdom of heaven, the real life and light and love of God is available to you right now. Let's pray. Just bow your head and be quiet. I've kind of done this the last few weeks. Just listen to God. And wonder with God about the ways that you're entangled. Just let him speak to you. Father, a couple of weeks ago when we were inviting people into the light, the word that came to my mind that would resist that word was fear, that we're afraid to come into the light. The word isn't fear this time, it's despair. That's the word I've got right now, that if people are entangled in this system, there is a despair that they can ever be free. And I pray in Jesus' name that your amazing grace, that your amazing love, that your powerful sword-like truth would cut through the cords of that lie of despair, that it would lose all its power, and that, Father, as we bring to you our entanglements, that we would find a life and light and love of God that sets us free to live a different way so we can taste the fullness of your kingdom where children can do what children do. Young men and women can run with strength and fathers and mothers can model and mentor and speak the love of God because we've known it from the beginning. I pray these things on us, moving through us, growing in us. In Jesus' name, amen.
