Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Let's pray as we go to the ministry of the Word. Lord, I do thank you for the work of your Spirit among us already in the context of worship as we now break the word. I pray for that same spirit to be active. I pray that you, by your spirit, would give life to these words, bring dead things to life. I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. We'll open your Bibles, if you have them, to the book of Colossians, second chapter of Colossians, as we continue our study of this incredible book from the Apostle Paul to the people living in Colossae, where for the last several weeks we've been dealing with this theme of Jesus plus nothing, beginning, as most of you know if you've been with us these weeks, in the sixth verse of the second chapter of Colossians, where the Apostle Paul is talking about and trying to make clear what it means to be in Christ, to what it means to be in him. So therefore, he says in verse six, as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, having been firmly rooted and now being built up in him and established in your faith, faith which is also in him, see to it that no one knocks you off of that centeredness in him, is my paraphrase of verse 8, for in him, verse 9, all the fullness of deity dwells in a bodily form, and in him you've been made complete. In other words, it's Jesus plus nothing, because in him you've been made complete, you have everything you need. Indeed, in verses 11 to 15, Paul kind of gives us even more when he kind of piles on this in him dynamic because in him you have been circumcised with a circumcision made without hands which means nothing to you and I in our context unless you know that in Colossae one of the things that some of the Jesus plus people were saying was that it was Jesus plus circumcision the physical sign of circumcision that meant you were a good Jew and now you're a good Christian and Paul is saying you need to understand that when you are in Christ, you get a different kind of circumcision. It's not physical, it's spiritual, it's not external, it's internal, it's not symbolic, it's real, it's not a shadow of something, it's the substance of something. A whole new thing on the inside is happening, and in him, verse 12, this theme continues throughout this whole chapter, you've been baptized into the death of Christ, but raised to newness of life. In him you've been forgiven of all your sins, and in him you have had canceled out the certificate of debt against you. It's all been wiped away, nailed to the cross, therefore, verse 16, because all of that is true, that it really is Jesus plus nothing. He gets to the real point of chapter 2, let no one act as your judge. In regard to food or drink, or in regard to festivals, or to a new moon, or to a Sabbath day, let no one keep defrauding you, which means to disqualify you to, like an umpire, call you out by delighting in self-abasement. Verse 23 kind of elaborates on that, calling it severe treatment of the body, which is weird, but it was something that the people and some of the people in Colossae had begun to use. They felt that by the self-abasement, by this extreme fasting that they would go on, this asceticism, it had become a means to them of a higher level of spirituality than other more common Christians, worshiping even with angels. The text says the worship of angels. It kind of made that clear a couple weeks ago that this was actually, their claim was that they were kind of communing with angels. They had ascended to this really high level of supernatural experience and taking their stand on visions they had seen, though often inflated without cause by their fleshly minds, which means they were simply reporting their supernatural experience as maybe being a little better than it actually was. Bottom line of all of that is this. There were some in Colossae, and you know this if you've been with us, who were saying in a variety of ways, the way we do today, in a variety of ways, that loving Jesus, that just being in him and being with him is just, it's nice, and it's good. It's a good start, But it's just not enough, because now it's Jesus plus just any number of things. And we have been talking about how we've done that, but in Colossae, it was Jesus plus eating certain food and drinking certain drink, and celebrating certain festivals in a certain way on a certain day, and even Jesus plus supernatural experiences like seeing visions and ecstatic worship, ascending even to angels, and those are the things that make you okay, And those are the things that really confirm that you're in. And after we talked about the lure of that a couple weeks ago, kind of wondering, what is the draw of this? Why did people in Colossae and Galatia, and why do we still today get drawn into this, sometimes without knowing that we're doing it? And quite frankly, it wasn't that complicated, because we do it primarily because it gives us a way to feel superior, gives us a way to feel secure. I do something that you don't do. I have something that you don't have, whether it be a knowledge of something or an experience of something. And it just kind of gives me a cut above. After that, we began a cut last week to talk about the look of these things. What is the danger of these things? And how do you spot these things when they begin to happen? Because part of the problem of this is that they're subtle and they kind of get in there before we really see them. And what I suggested last week is that among the first ways you can spot these things is that you just kind of notice that really good things end up getting spoiled. Because there's nothing wrong with supernatural experiences. A supernatural experience would be a very good thing. There's nothing wrong with seeing visions. That's not what Paul's confronting. There's nothing wrong with ecstatic worship where you experience with God in the context of community a wonderful thing. There's nothing wrong with that. and there's nothing wrong with celebrating certain festivals in a certain way on a certain day. In fact, last week we kind of talked about the reason some Jews were coming into faith in Christ. What they came with was some background, and these festivals were wonderful ways for them to remember the workings of God among them. Nothing wrong with celebrating those things at all, unless you begin to believe that that's what qualifies you, that that's what marks and establishes you as an authentic child of God, because if you begin to believe that, it's no longer just Jesus who saves you or qualifies you or redeems you. It's Jesus plus. Whatever it is you've added, and what is added is almost always a good thing, but when you use it this way, it goes bad. Now it's Jesus plus whatever it is you've added. It's now become your source of security and your source of identity, but it's a false source of security and identity. Inevitably then, and this is where it becomes dangerous, giving birth to a false kind of spirituality, which is the second danger of this thing. Because wherever, wherever, this Jesus plus thing begins to take root, in whatever form it takes, in a family, when it takes root, in a church, in a system of any kind, it invariably brings with it what I called last week a religious spirit. And I really believe it's a spirit. It is demonically empowered, I think, religious spirit where image is everything and how things look all of a sudden didn't start this way but all of a sudden the way we're operating in our whole church and the way we interact with each other is how things look is what matters most and here's the problem if how things look is what matters most suddenly how things really are on the inside no longer get talked about, no longer get dealt with no longer get brought out into the light because how things look is what matters most and before you know it nobody wanted this nobody desired this it didn't start this way but before you know it when these things begin to subtly move we become just like the pharisees in matthew 23 who spend all of their energy polishing the outside of the cup and of the bowl so you look really good but inwardly you're full of robbery and self-indulgence which is a really scary thing for a number of reasons, but one is this. If you're all shiny and clean, I might think you're safe. But if the truth is it's just a mask for the fact that inside of you are some things that are going to hurt me because there's shiny stuff on the outside, I might go towards you and get devoured. That's why Jesus called these kind of people a brood of vipers. And when Jesus said those kinds of things about people who look so good, everyone got a find out, well, they're the most spiritual people I know. You don't get it, says Jesus. These guys are poison. They spend all of their energy on this outside kind of thing. And all of this is inevitable when this religious spirit, this Jesus plus spirit, comes in. And before you know it, you're straining it next, and you're swallowing camels, which means your values are inverted. Talked about this last week, too. And when values get inverted, people get destroyed. Because there you are, again, like the Pharisees in Matthew 23, tithing dill and mint and cumin, which sounds bizarre to some of you. Dill and mint and cumin were little seeds. There were three tithes that good Jews in Jesus and Paul's day would have participated in, and there was this obscure little tithe in Leviticus 27 that talked about the tithing of all your seeds, and these guys were so spiritual that right down to their seeds, if they had 10, they would give one. If they had 20, they would give two. And when they tithed their little seeds, they felt quite superior. It's what a Jesus plus mentality does, because nobody else is this careful and this picky like us. But here's the problem with that. You remember this? That while they were doing this really picky little thing that didn't matter much but felt far superior because they did it at the same time, they were neglecting some things that really did matter. You tie the element and human, but neglect the weightier matters of the law, like justice, mercy, and faithfulness. Everything here is upside down, and the real danger of that, clearly, is that when things like justice, mercy, and faithfulness get ignored, when there's no justice, people get destroyed. I don't care if you tie the limit in cumin. And all of that, all of that, is at least part of why Paul says all that he says in Colossians chapter 2, Because in any religious system where it becomes Jesus plus, invariably, number one, good things go bad. You can't help it. Image becomes everything. Values get inverted. People get destroyed. Which finally brings us to the question that I closed with last week and we're going to dive into this morning. The question is this. Is there an antidote to this? Is there a cure? Something that could break the back of this? Something that can break the cycle of this? Because when we get into this kind of thing, again, I don't think we do it intentionally. We get into this cycle, and also we don't know how to get out of this. Something that can help us see what we can't see when we're involved in this. So is there something? Well, I think there is. I actually thought of three things, and all of them involve remembering. Remember first. This, I think, would help. It's not all by itself. It might not do it. but I think it helps to start here to remember, first of all, who Jesus is. It's the whole point of Colossians chapter 1 and chapter 2. With all the months we've been in it, it's all about this, to remember that in him all the fullness of deity dwells in a bodily form, and that in him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge about life and how to do it, and he is the image of God, the firstborn of all creation. So it does, and it does help to remember who he is and to remember who you are in him, because in him you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, verse 11. In other words, you were made new on the inside. It was spiritual, not physical. It was internal, not external. It was substance, not shadow. And in him you were baptized into his death, but raised to newness of life, verse 12, forgiven of all your sins, verse 13, having canceled out the certificate of debt against you, verse 14, and in him you've been made complete. you have everything you need it's Jesus plus nothing but what if remembering all that what if you can't remembering all that or what if knowing all that doesn't really help you much because even though you know everything I just said in him is this and in him is that even though you know all of that you're still just as tied up in this Jesus plus thing as you ever were, you're just as legalistic, maybe not as the Pharisees of Matthew 23, but it's still a monumental problem for you, then it might help you to remember something else that I haven't talked about, quite frankly, for a very long time here at Open Door, but I think it fits here. It might help to remember the purpose of the law. And you might even need to feel the sting of it a bit, because sometimes it's the sting of the law, actually, that is what it takes to break the back of this Jesus plus thing. Last week, you may recall that at the end of my talk, I told you that when Jesus dealt with legalists, when he dealt with this kind of person, a Jesus plus kind of person, he didn't give them grace. And I don't know if that kind of caught your attention, but it's kind of a startling. What do you mean? Jesus was full of grace, and that's all he did. He's all about grace. No, Jesus, when he dealt with this kind of person, didn't give them grace because they wouldn't have received grace. Jesus plus kinds of people aren't looking for grace. So instead, he gave them something that might hopefully lead them to grace, that might even force them to grace, at least make them aware and help them see their need for grace, so what he gave them wasn't grace. Indeed, what Jesus gave, Jesus plus kinds of people, was actually more to do. People who were looking for plus, for more, he kind of looked at them and wisely discerned what he really needs is not grace, he needs more to do. And he would do that, and I'm gonna explain how he did that in a number of ways this morning, but he would give them more hoops to jump through, more rules to keep, more pluses to add to their Jesus plus way of thinking, which is a fascinating strategy, actually, quite counterintuitive, I think, designed, however, to specifically break the back of this Jesus plus mentality, to break the cycle of it if you're in it. So he didn't give them grace. He gave them law. And when they thought that they could handle what he gave them, and when they thought that they could do the law he gave them, he would give them more to do. Not grace. He'd give them law with this intent. That in the overload of more, you just got to do more. You just got to try harder. The ultimate intent of that was to literally wear them out. So they'd finally say two magic words that actually open up the kingdom to you. I can't do this anymore. which ironically actually does make you ready to receive, even maybe make you desperate for amazing grace, Jesus plus nothing. And all of that is why in the time I have left, I want to talk about how Jesus did that. I want to talk about why Jesus did that, and I want to talk about how and why Paul did the same. We're going to get some help from him today because it's critical in my mind to the breaking of this cycle of Jesus plus nothing. Let me start kind of unpacking this with a story that illustrates some of the stuff I just said. Matthew chapter 19, a story that many of you are probably familiar with, at least at some level. A young man approaches Jesus and asks Jesus a question. It's a very good question. In fact, it's a question that I have a fantasy. Someday I will have someone ask me. I grew up in church and I've heard these evangelists come and they always have a story like this where they're sitting on a plane, and someone says, they ask him this deep, wonderful question, and they lead him to the Lord right on the plane. And I do have a fantasy like that, because sometimes I'm on a plane, and out of the blue, someone asks me this question, saying, teacher, just like this guy says to Jesus, teacher. They wouldn't say teacher to me. They would go, holy man, I can tell you, are I holy man? Just by your look, you got in the chair. No, you're a holy man. Tell me, how might I obtain eternal life? I would love to, and then, and then, and then, you know, you would recognize this right out of the blue. He's just asking this question. Why is he asking this question? It's a prime time, ready to sign on a dotted line. Guy, Evangelism 101, anybody in that course would know what to do. But the way I ask that question is not exactly the way in the text the guy asked the question. And it matters how he asked the question. Because how he asked, the question he actually asked was this, Matthew 19, 16. Look at it carefully and see if you can kind of find the fly in the ointment here. Matthew 19, 16, he says, teacher or rabbi, what good thing must I do? Because whatever it is, I'll do it. To obtain for myself eternal life. To which Jesus responds, and just on the surface of things, it's kind of like, why? He sounds kind of testy here, why? But I think it reveals that maybe Jesus did spot the fly in the ointment here. Jesus says, verse 17, why are you asking me about what is good? What are you talking to me? Almost like that, a De Niro thing. there is only one who is good he says and it isn't you there only there's only one who is good who is that that's god uh is the implication so what jesus is saying here between the lines and kind of kind of i wouldn't say he's quite punching him in the face but he's pushing on him a little bit because what he's saying here is is you're looking for what good you must do or how good you must be the standard kid is God, okay? But that's a bit unrealistic. So he kind of pulls away right away and says, let's start with this, keep the commandments, end of verse 17. First he gets that testy question and he says, here's how you enter into or obtain for yourself eternal life, keep the commandments, to which the young man says, verse 18, which ones? So this guy's eager and more than willing to do whatever he has to do to obtain eternal life. And so Jesus says, I think kind of like this, okay, you want to do all, let's start with some easy ones. Here you go. Start with this. You should not commit murder. You should not commit adultery. Don't steal. Don't lie. Honor your parents. Love your neighbor, which is only six. There's ten, so he gets a discount. Whatever. But then the young man says this right off to bed, verse 20, all these things I've kept. I've done all that stuff. In fact, in Luke 18 and Mark chapter 10, it adds, from my youth. From my youth. Since I was a kid, I have kept all these commandments. No murder, adultery, no stealing, no lying. I honor my parents. I love my neighbor. What do I still lack? Well, before we get to that question, what do I still lack? Just get a picture on this kid. Because when I get the profile and I put all that together, it's like I know this kid. This kid grew up in church. From my youth, I went to synagogue. From my youth. I knew the Torah, kept the law. He got straight A's. This kid lettered in three sports. He did it right after college. He went right to seminary. If he was a Baptist, he's got a Sunday school attendance, perfect attendance pin. If he was a Catholic, he was an altar boy. If he was your son, you would be proud. You would be. If he was your neighbor, you'd be glad because he'd mow your lawn when you're gone. If he was in our church, we'd be thrilled. He'd be on a board, some youth board of some sort. So when he says in verse 20, all these things I have kept from my youth, and then he asks, what am I still lacking? I halfway expect Jesus to say, are you kidding? Nothing. Dude, you're in. You are like the cowardly lion and the tin man and the straw man who just need to realize you already have what you're looking for. You already have it. I mean, if anybody has obtained for themselves eternal life, you have because you have kept all these things from your youth, but he doesn't say that, because he hadn't obtained it. But neither does Jesus beat him up, though I think it kind of would have been easy. I mean, I don't know if you can picture this, but like Jesus, kind of a wise rabbi, a person of some substance and stature, this kid comes up to him and says, yes, I've kept all the law since my youth. I've done it all. You know, you want to grab him by this way you little do you have any idea what you're saying but jesus doesn't do that what he actually does though he does confront the bejeebers out of him here because apparently he was full of bejeebers and and he was about to confront those out of him but he does it in this very subtle way instead of confronting him and yelling at him he simply gives him more to do what do i do to obtain eternal life what good thing must i do to obtain eternal life keep the commandments. Which ones? Six of ten. Done them since I was a kid. Okay, let me give you more to do. So you want to be complete, verse 21. Go sell everything you have and give it to the poor. Which raises a question. And then you know, you probably know the rest of the story. He didn't do that. He walked away sad because he had a lot of money and he didn't want to do that. But it raises this question. At least it does for me. What if he had gone and sold everything he had and gave it to the poor and then came back to Jesus with proof. In other words, with proof that he had given everything away, which means he came back to Jesus with nothing because he gave it all away. What would Jesus have said then? I don't know. Maybe you say, whoa, you did. You sold it and you gave it to the poor. You make it. You have finally done enough really good things to obtain for yourself eternal life. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. You make it. You're in. no I don't think he would I mean speculating here because we don't that it didn't happen that way but I think what Jesus would have said and what I think Jesus would have done would have been given him more to do why because when Jesus dealt with legalists even when they were really nice ones like this guy here he didn't give him grace they weren't looking this guy's not looking for grace he's looking so Jesus gave them more to do Jesus did the same thing in fact when you start seeing this pattern you can see it in other places as well that this is at least part of what he's doing in Matthew 5 he does the same thing in Matthew 5 after the Beatitudes he's at the beginning of the Beatitudes he says blessed are those who blessed are the broken in other words blessed are those who recognize they can't save themselves okay and then he's dealing with Pharisees later in the same chapter who think they can't save themselves. They are full of their own righteousness. That's called self-righteousness. And in Matthew 5, 21, Jesus to these people says this. You've heard it said, the ancients were told, you shall not commit murder, and whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court. And all of the Pharisees who were full of their own sense of righteousness and how much they had done to justify themselves by their keeping of the law said, I agree with that. Murderers are horrible, and I feel very superior to murderers because I haven't murdered anybody. But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court, which means the same punishment as murder. And if you say raca to a brother, you shall be guilty before the Supreme Court. And if you call someone a fool, you're going to hell. What's he doing to them? A number of things. Among the things he's doing there is giving these people who think they are obtaining for themselves eternal life by keeping the law, he's giving them more to do. You say adultery, you don't commit adultery, good for you. Let's talk about your lust. It's the same as adultery. It is. I mean, this kid comes back, sells everything he has, gives it to the poor. What would Jesus have said? Maybe something like this. I thought I told you to sell everything. Why you got clothes on? Why do you still have a place to live? Why do you still have food to eat? I told you to sell everything. When I said everything, I meant everything. Or he might have said this. Okay, now that you've given every possession you have away, go take care of your aging parents with the money you no longer have because the law says, or you're a parent. So how are you going to do that now? Because when Jesus dealt with legalists, even nice ones like this guy here, he didn't give them grace. They're not looking for grace. He gave them more to do. He gave them law. The Apostle Paul explains this. He kind of teaches this. Jesus kind of set the pattern here, but Paul in 1 Timothy 1.8 refers to the strategy of Jesus that's clearly utilized by Jesus as what Paul refers to as the lawful use of the law. 1 Timothy 1.6. Paul says this, and I'll break this down for you so you can understand it. And basically what I see Paul doing here is kind of teaching and trying to explain to people what Jesus did. Jesus didn't teach it, he just did it. Paul's teaching, and he says this in 1 Timothy 1.6. There are some people who, straying from the truth, have turned aside to fruitless discussion, wanting to be teachers of the law, they think they're the experts, even though they do not understand the law, either what they are saying or manners about which they make confident assertions. So it's kind of ticked there. But we know, verse 8, that the law is good. The problem isn't the law. The law is good if one uses it lawfully or appropriately, properly, rightly, which raises this obvious question. What is the lawful use or the appropriate use of the law? A question that Paul answers in a number of places, most notably places like Romans 7, Galatians 3, because there's actually three purposes of the law that constitute the lawful use of the law, and all of them are central in my mind to answering this question that we're dealing with today. What is the antidote to this Jesus plus thing? Is there a cure, something that can break the back of this, something that can break the cycle of this because the three purposes of the law that constitute the lawful use of the law are these. Number one, first purpose of the law. The law was not given for you to try to keep the law to justify yourself. Opposite that, the law was given, first of all, to reveal to you your sin. Second of all, to produce brokenness in you about your sin. In other words, there's nothing you can do about your sin. And third, to drive you to Christ, who is your only hope for authentically and deeply dealing with your sin, all of which means that the law brings you to Jesus plus nothing. Let me unpack that a bit for you. First purpose of the law, says Paul, is to reveal sin. Romans 7 is one of the places he unpacks this. And let's just read the text, and then I'll explain what it means. Paul is talking here about how the Spirit gives life and the law kills, but then he kind of corrects himself here and kind of, wait, don't go too far. What shall I say is the law of sin? I'm not saying the law is bad. May it never be. The law is good. On the contrary, I would not have come to know sin except through the law. For I would not have known about coveting if the law had not said, you shall not covet. Okay, I follow that. But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me coveting of every kind. For apart from the law, sin is dead. okay you're starting to lose me here and I was once alive apart from the law but when the commandment came sin became alive and I died now it's getting weird and this commandment which was to result in life proved to result in death for me for sin taking opportunity through the commandment deceived me and through it killed me okay whatever let me unpack that for you I want to give you a paraphrase of this because I think it can be understood What shall we say then? This is my paraphrase. Is the law bad on the contrary, Paul says? It saved my life. It actually did me a favor, for it made me aware I had a problem. And I wasn't aware of that before. It broke through my delusion. In fact, I would have never come to see the sin in me except through the law. For I could never have known about coveting, for instance, if the law had not said, thou shalt not covet. But that revelation was not a pleasant experience for me. In fact, it killed me. My paraphrase of verse 9. I used to feel great about my life, he says. Apart from the law, I was alive. Apart from the law, I felt great. I mean, sleeping with my girlfriend before we were married, not a big deal. Before the law, it didn't bother me at all. Having a little action on the side, even though I was married, a little bit of a deal, not a big deal. I slept like a baby. Cheating on my taxes, gossiping about my friends, no problem. Again, slept like a baby. But when the law came, it made sin alive in me, meaning I didn't start to sin when the law came. The law made me aware that I had. And it wasn't just a bad choice, it was sin. I became aware of it, I became alive to it as being sin, and when that happened, I died. I felt conviction for the very first time, and if you've ever felt conviction, it feels like dying. that then however set up this strange paradox Paul says I'm still giving you my paraphrase of this here's the paradox verse 10 this commandment which eventually was to result in life in me at the beginning proved to feel like death to me it killed me verse 11 because it revealed to me it brought life it brought to life deadly sin that up to that point I didn't even see as sin I didn't even recognize as sin this by the way what I just described to you is exactly what Jesus is doing in Matthew 9 to the rich young ruler and it's exactly what Jesus is doing in Matthew 5 that already described already described to the self-righteous Pharisees he is using the law on the rich young ruler and on the Pharisees in Matthew 5 to reveal the sin to people who didn't think they had any Matthew 5 again you say you don't commit murder let's talk about your anger you say you haven't committed adultery let's talk about your lust Romans 7 verse 9 Paul is kind of putting it in his words I felt great about my lack of adultery in fact it made me feel superior to most of you who commit adultery but when this word came about lust ruined everything sin then came alive in me and I became aware of my sin and my delusion that I was okay was destroyed I used to feel superior I don't anymore this undoing is the first step actually of your salvation because it's going to make you real thirsty for grace that you didn't want until you saw your sin that little run there it's just last couple weeks I've been telling you a lot of my story and what it was like for me growing up in church and in a church where there was a lot of Jesus plus stuff but this thing applies to you know this rich young ruler guy who grew up in church I remember when I first dialed into him I kind of said that I think that's me I grew up in church high school as president of the youth group when I was in Iwana I memorized all the verses and I didn't have any life. And I remember when we would have these Sunday evening services, every once in a while, someone would come. This is a fairly routine thing. And they would, my dad wouldn't just preach, but we'd have somebody in the congregation give their testimony. And a lot of times, there would be these really dramatic words of kind of being saved from death almost. And they would talk about, I was an alcoholic, and I was all involved in this, and our marriage was about to fall apart, and I was a real cruddy guy. And then they would begin to talk about the grace of God, and they couldn't hardly stop crying. They would start to cry. They would weep when they'd talk about grace. And as a 16-year-old, I'd go, I don't feel that grateful for grace. And I began to think, well, maybe you've got to ruin your life. And if you ruin your life, and you almost lose your marriage, or you lose your marriage, then you come up going, oh, I really need this grace, I need this grace, I need this grace. Because I just knew I wasn't grateful. Because I was like this smug, rich young ruler. I have done all these things since my youth. I've done it all. You're so full of baloney. Because the thing that finally made me hungry for grace was when the law, and I didn't use this kind of terminology then. It's when the law started shining on me. Dave, you're so wonderful. You don't commit adultery. You're 16, but you don't commit adultery. Can we talk about your lust? Because that's where your adultery lives. And if you let yourself see that, you'll come up really hungry for grace. You never commit murder. I would never commit murder. I know. You want to talk about your anger, you're so full of anger. If you're willing to look at it, you'll come up hungry for grace. It's the purpose of the law, to reveal your sin. Second purpose is to produce brokenness. In other words, it's a job to convince you not only that there is sin, make you aware of it, but there's nothing you can do to fix it by yourself. Explain it this way. The law is like a powerful penetrating beam of light. Picture it that way. And when it goes on, it exposes, it reveals all sorts of garbage, all sorts of sin, adultery, murder, covetousness, lie. And again, getting back to the Matthew 5 thing, oh, I've never committed adultery. I never would. The law loves it when you say that because it will just shine on your lusts. I'll never commit murder? I never will. And the law loves it when you say that because it'll just shine on your anger. Matthew 19, the rich young ruler, I have kept a law from my youth. What do I lack? Lack. God, Jesus gave him more. You lack a sense of your sin. That's one thing you lack. Now when this happens, the law shines on your stuff and reveals it. There's a number of responses you can take. One is to turn the light off. So some, a lot of people do when sin is exposed, you just go, nah, disregard it completely. There are no moral absolutes. Who's to say what's right and wrong? Effectively live in denial. It's the spirit of the age. Another thing you can do is to try to clean it up yourself. This is what religious people do. Work really hard, do the best you can, convince yourself that doing the best you can is really all God expects. Compare yourself to others who actually have more dirt than you. Well, I may not have done this, but I've never done that. I picture it like this. You're in your room. The light of the law goes on, reveals a pile of slimy, smelly, goopy junk, just rotten stuff. So one thing is to just turn the light off and just ignore it, walk away. A lot of people do that. The other is to go, however, and try to clean it up. And as you do, it runs through your fingers. Just picture that. You're picking it up. It's all gooey. It gets on your hands, covers your clothes. You start to smell really bad, but you're working really hard to clean it all up, and you kind of feel good about that. I'm really quite a guy. Most people wouldn't even do this work. Problem is, you look a little silly, because while you get it all off the floor, now it's all over you, and it's in your hair, and just as you're ready to go take a shower, the spotlight of the law moves, as if to say, missed the spot. No murder? Anger. No lust? No adultery? Lust. And then it goes to the corner, and then it goes to the ceiling, and then it goes to the windowsill, and then it's back to the floor, because the floor got dirty again, and after a while you just go, I can't do this! When you say those words of desperation, it's almost like heaven starts to sing, because coming to that place where you recognize you can't clean this up is the second purpose of the law. to convince you that not only you have sinned, but by yourself you can't do what's fully necessary to cleanse you of it, which brings you to the third purpose of the law, and that is to drive you to Christ as your only hope for life. Jesus plus nothing. Galatians 3, 23 and 24, Paul says it this way. Before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed. Therefore, he calls the law a tutor whose job it is to lead us to Christ that we may be justified by faith. That word tutor, many of you to open door know this because we've taught on this years ago. The word there is paedagogos. And a paedagogos was literally a servant or a slave of a master whose job it was, among other jobs, to bring the kids of this landowner to school, to literally drive them to school. And I don't mean in a car, I mean like cattle, to drive them to school to make sure they got, because they would wander off, and with a switch in hand, he would kind of whack-a-whack-a, make sure those cattle just kept going to school. The law, the purpose of the law, according to Paul, is to act like that paedagogas, that tutor whose job it is to cut off every avenue you think you have to justify yourself other than Christ and to drive you right to him. Like with a switch in hand, thou shalt not thou shalt not thou shalt not, you already have, you already have, you already have. Ah, ah, ah, ah, driving you. to Christ convincing you your only hope is Jesus plus nothing driving you there in order that, verse 24, we may be justified by faith. Faith in what? Faith in this. That only Christ, Jesus plus nothing, available to me, alive in me, whole theme of Colossians, Christ in me is able to redeem me, qualify me, establish and secure me, to heal me, to internally circumcise me, transform me, recreate me. Therefore, 2 Corinthians 5, 17, if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature, a new creature with a new heart, circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, and with a new heart comes a new desire. And you know what the new desire is? To obey him and follow him. A new desire born of a new heart. Oh, how I love your law. And this, says Hebrews 10, 16. And this is the covenant I will make with them. After those days, says the Lord, I will put my laws on their hearts. And upon their minds, I will write them. And that, beloved, is the antidote, is the cure, is what can break the back of this Jesus plus thing. So remember who Jesus is. For in him all the fullness of deity dwells in a bodily form, and in him you've been made complete, Jesus plus nothing. And in him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge about life and how to live it. And in him you have been circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands. And in him you've been baptized into death but raised to newness of life. And in him you've been forgiven of all your sins. And in him the certificate of debt held against you has been wiped away and nailed to the cross. Because all that is true, we love him. And serve him. And follow him. And sometimes people who catch this life do the craziest things because sometimes they sell everything they have. They give everything they have to follow him. Desire to be just like him. And that's the transformed life. Jesus plus nothing. Amen? Amen. Stand as we close in prayer. Father I just want to pray I just want to ask at the end of this talk what I ask at the beginning of this talk that by the power of your spirit these words spoken here today would generate life in us make us aware Jesus of the ways we've made a Jesus plus that in our arrogance we've added to it and tried to feel superior even from others and even built for ourselves in that kind of prison that we need to break out of. Holy Spirit, come and set us free and enter into this place inside of us where you, without physical hands, want to circumcise our hearts and cut away the things that need to be cut away and every time it happens it just makes us aware again of our desperate need for you and thankful for your grace. And we are thankful, and we tell you that in Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
