Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Let's pray as we dive in. Jesus I prayed this last week and it's our prayer again this week that if we really saw you if we really could see you we would drop everything and follow you but we need help in seeing you so this morning and this week help us to see you. Amen? Amen. Well, last week I talked about my struggle with a very large bag of Costco cheese. Remember that? Yes. I talked about some other things too, but probably the cheese is what you remember the most. So let me ask you this question. Anybody had any cheese moments this last week where something really small almost took you out because your resources were totally depleted. And maybe in that moment, that cheese moment, you found out that you weren't as selfless as you thought you were. Maybe in that moment, you realized that you had been living with a drive-through mentality where what you want, when you want it, and how you want it is the most important thing to you. And maybe in that moment, that terrible cheese moment, you found out that you needed saving. And maybe you found out that God is tirelessly at work saving you. Not just from hell when you die, but from your selfishness right here, right now. And maybe in that moment, in your day of disaster, when all is dark and was closing in around you, maybe God brought you up and out into a spacious place where you could breathe. Maybe he bumped you right out of the drive-thru lane. And maybe now you're waiting and seeing if the work that God is doing in you will change you so that maybe next time the bag of cheese doesn't win. I also talked about actually bypassing the drive-thru mentality of life. When you notice something that actually makes you stop, For Jesus, it was two blind men sitting by the side of the road, people who were invisible to everybody else. For my friend in the Middle East, it was finding out that boys were getting raped in a juvenile detention center. And for my friend right here at Open Door, it was finding out that orphans all around the world spent the first few years of their lives laying on their backs in cribs unattended. So a question. Did anything make you stop this week? Did any of you notice some overlooked area of the kingdom of God that has sprouted up around you and maybe was ripe to be harvested? If so, maybe right now you're waiting and seeing what God will do. Well, it was a parable that sparked this conversation last week in the first place, so I'd like to read it again to you. It comes out of Mark chapter 4. I want to invite you to turn your Bibles to Mark 4 starting in verse 26. He, that is Jesus, also said, we read, this is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground and night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he doesn't know how. And all by itself, the soil produces grain. First the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. And as soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it because the harvest has come. And the question we left wondering about last week is what's on tap this week. And here it is. What kind of person do I have to become in order to have the wisdom to see what's actually growing around me? and in me, not just what I want, when I want it, and how I want it, but how would I have the character and the wisdom to see it, what God is doing in me and around me? And then, how might I have the patience to wait until the seed is ready to harvest? Well, if you want to become a person like that, to have that kind of character, I think, first of all, you'd have to really examine what you actually believe, not just what you say you believe, but what you actually believe about where God scatters seed. Because your answer to that question really, really matters. So turning your Bibles to Genesis chapter 2, all the way back, starting in verse 5, and I want to read to you about the beginning of humanity in order to answer this question. We read this, Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth, and no plant had yet sprung up. For the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth, and there was no one to work the ground. Interesting language when you think about the parable. But streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground. Then the Lord formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a human being, a living being. Now human beings were not created because a random collection of molecules found each other. We began our existence when God breathed life into us, not just Adam, but each of us. Ruach is the Hebrew word for breath and for life itself. And ruach is also one of the names for God. It's the name, it's the word that's used here for breath, but it's one of the names for God. Ruach Elohim is the Hebrew name for the Spirit of God. And when applied to God, ruach indicates not just life and breath, but creative activity. and active power. Now I want you to think about a time, if you can, where the creative activity of someone else literally took your breath away. Might have been after reading a really good book that you missed when it was over. Might have been after hearing a piece of music that left you in stunned silence. might even be watching a movie that makes you weep. Might be a piece of art that you can't stop staring at, or watching an athlete accomplish something that made you jump out of your seat with applause, because something she did seemed super human. I remember the first time I saw Les Miserables. It's a fantastic musical. It's fantastic because it's the story of the gospel. Redemption and love and forgiveness and dying so that others might live. And it's all wrapped up in this story that at some points makes you laugh and at some points makes you weep. And this music score that accompanies it just soars. And at the end of this production at the Orpheum, 2,000 people did the exact same thing, instinctual and simultaneously. We inhaled deeply, and then we exhaled, and then we stood to our feet and roared in applause. It was our natural response to someone else's ruach, their creative activity and active power, connecting with the ruach inside of us. And it made us, even those of us who don't have any language for this, it made us long for the creator who breathed ruach into us in the first place. That's what creative activity does. Now imagine that creativity multiplied exponentially in terms of capability and imagination, and you haven't even scratched the surface of how creatively imaginative that God is. And the feeling I get every time one of my boys smiles at me is all the proof I need that that is true. The prophet Isaiah asks this question in Isaiah 40 verse 13. Who can fathom the ruach, the creative activity and active power of the Lord? Who can instruct the Lord as his counselor, meaning the Lord is completely peerless when it comes to creative activity and active power? It's beyond even our imagining the creativity that God uses when breathing life into us. So what kind of person would I need to become? What kind of character would I need to have to have the wisdom to see the seed that had been scattered by God actually growing around me and in me? Well, I think I'd need to believe that the creative activity of God is much bigger and much more fascinating than I ever thought possible. Because just underneath the surface of every single person that I lock eyes with, if I dig, I would find the seed of God. Even in people and places that would really, really surprise me. But if I didn't believe that God scatters seed everywhere With a kind of creative activity that is peerless I would miss a lot A couple years ago, 2007 A cold January morning in Washington, D.C. A man sat outside a metro station and started to play the violin And it was rush hour, so in the 45 minutes that he played, he played six Bach pieces, and it's estimated that about 2,000 people passed by. Now three minutes went by before the first person kind of slowed down. It was a middle-aged man, and he slowed down, noticed it, and then hurried right back up and went to catch his train. In fact, in 45 minutes, only six people stopped and stayed for a while. The violinist collected $32, and when he finished, no one noticed it. No one applauded, and there was no recognition. But what's fascinating about this story is that the violinist was Joshua Bell, one of the best musicians in the world. The violin that he was playing on was worth $3.5 million. Two days before this impromptu concert at the metro station, he sold out a theater in Boston at an average price of about $100 a seat. Now, this little experiment was set up and recorded by the Washington Post as a way of asking this question. If we don't have a moment to stop and listen to one of the best musicians in the world playing the best music ever written, then what else are we missing? If we don't have eyes to see the creative activity that God is doing all around us, imagine how much that we might miss. One of the first, or one of the only people who paid the most attention was this little three-year-old boy, Washington Post records. His mom kept trying to hurry him along. You know what she was probably thinking. But he kept trying to stop and look at Joshua Bell. And finally, the mom pushed hard enough, and the child continued to walk. But he was turning his head the whole time, listening and watching. This action was repeated by several other children. And all the parents, without exception, force them to move on. Because there's something in us as we grow up, tragically, that loses the ability to notice. So, what kind of person would I have to become? What kind of character would I have to have to have the wisdom to see what's growing all around me? I'd have to believe that the seed of God was being spread and scattered everywhere. And to do that, I might just have to act a little more like a child from time to time. Stephan told me this story at Message Team this last week about his one-year-old son named Will. Now, if you've ever been around Will, he has this enormous smile, a little toothy little grin that could disarm anyone. And one day, Stephan was strolling Will down the street, and they passed by this homeless man. And when they passed him, Will smiled at him and just kept looking at him. And when Stephan strolled him past, Will craned his neck to keep looking at him all the while having this stupid little grin on his face. And Stephan noticed something in that moment about how Will saw this man. You see, Stephan noticed a homeless man, but Will noticed a man, a human being. And his reaction was not to pull away or rush past, but simply to smile. In a one-year-old, you have to wonder, what made him smile? Maybe in his one-year-old mind, the creative activity was in him just fresh enough and just strong enough so that he noticed the creative activity of God in someone else. And Stephan just had to smile and shake his head and say, my one-year-old son just taught me about the kingdom of God. C.S. Lewis wrote this, There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations, these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat, insignificant. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and exploit. immortal horrors or everlasting splendors. Next to the blessed sacrament itself, your neighbor is the holiest object presented to your senses. A one-year-old gets that. Do you? Who can fathom the creative activity or active power of God? God is a God who gleefully works through one-year-olds and bags of cheese. Wouldn't it be amazing to sit around the brainstorming table of God in a given morning? We would be shocked, I think, in this weird metaphorical picture about the laughter and excitement when someone came up with a new idea about how to creatively scatter the seed of God into people. But in order to have the wisdom to see what's growing around us, we'd have to actually believe that God, with wonderful creative activity, is scattering seed everywhere, in every way imaginable, even in the darkest corner of the world, and even in the darkest corner of your heart, that place that you hide away from everybody else, hoping that no one would see it, into that area, God gleefully scatters seed so that something might grow. And if that's true about you, then it's true about everyone. Now here's kind of a meddling question. You gotta meddle a little bit. Does this idea bother you? Or does it kind of thrill you? Please understand, I am not saying that there are plants growing everywhere. People do have the freedom to accept or reject the seed of God that has been scattered inside of them. I'm not saying that everyone everywhere actually responds to the creative activity of God that has been scattered inside of their lives. But wouldn't it be wonderful if God was working in creative ways all around us, in ways that would shock us? Wouldn't it be wonderful if people were actually responding to God's creative work in ways that we couldn't immediately recognize because it didn't fit inside of our paradigms? Now, if that was happening, if people were responding to God's creative activity in their lives in ways that we would go, whoa, whoa, does God work that way? Would that be a bad thing? Or would that be just another way of saying, oh my goodness, our God is so creatively active that God can even work there. How fascinating. In Matthew 25, Jesus paints a kind of a troubling picture for the end of the world. See, everyone is gathered around him, and he separates the people. We read, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He calls one group of people righteous, but not because of what they claim to believe, but because they fed him when he was hungry. And they invited him in when he was a stranger, and they clothed him. When he was naked, they tended to him when he was sick and in prison. But their response is one of shock. They can't believe he's calling them righteous because they don't remember doing a thing to him. Jesus, we would have remembered if it was you. So when were you hungry? We read in Matthew 25, 37. And when did we feed you? When were you thirsty and we gave you something to drink? When were you a stranger and we had you over to our house? When did you need clothes and we clothed you? And when were you in prison and we visited you? And so he tells them in Matthew 25, 40, Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me. It's not like doing it for me. it's you did for me. In a recent message, Rob Bell pointed out that it's easy to see Jesus in someone that's doing something really generous or self-sacrificial. We say that all the time. Oh, I saw Jesus in you. And we should say that. But when Jesus says that something separates the righteous from others in these verses anyway, it's the ability to see Jesus in the least likely. person, in the least likely person. Instead of rushing away or drawing conclusions, to simply smile at that person, to genuinely believe that you have never met a mere mortal. Question, what would be the worst thing that could happen if we treated everyone as if we were interacting with Jesus. You might get taken advantage of every once in a while, but what would be the worst thing that could happen if you treated everyone that you came across as if they were Jesus? And what might that cause in them to grow? So for some of us, in order to do that though, we would need Jesus to heal our eyes. Because we're broken and we need healing. So how does that happen? Well, I think it starts with a request for the two blind men that we read about last week. They simply asked Jesus to heal their eyes. Very straightforwardly. And you and I can do the same. So when I come across someone that believes differently than I do, and my first reaction is to rush by or debate them, I need God to open my eyes so that I can see a person in whom God has scattered seed. Not an opportunity for debate. And when I come across someone that acts differently than I do, instead of raising an eyebrow in judgment, I need God to open my eyes so that I can see a person in whom God has scattered seed instead of an opportunity to feel better about myself. And when I come across the opportunity to see myself as totally incapable of changing, when I've made the same mistake that I've made every day of my life for 38 years, I need God to open my eyes so that I can see an opportunity for God's seed to sprout again in me because God's creative activity in my life is limitless, even though I am limited. But you see, you'd have to want those things. You'd have to want Jesus to heal your eyes. And to want those things, you'd have to really believe that God actually does scatter seed everywhere into every single person you come across, including yourself. And you'd have to give up your right to indulge in the terribly destructive decision to write someone else off or yourself off. You'd have to admit that you really are blind, that you don't see perfectly. And that's where most of us have trouble. We like to write others off because it makes us feel better about ourselves somehow. So we read this amazing result of God's creative activity in Ephesians 5, verses 13 and 14. But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, and everything that is illuminated becomes a light. And this is why it said, wake up sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you. This is a hopeful verse to those of us who are blind, because it means that when our eyes are open, not only are we able to see, we ourselves become light that illuminates others and our being light transforms others into being light. This is a fascinating reality about God's creative activity, and it's really good news for blind people like me. So the final question that we raised in the beginning and last week as well is, how do I cultivate the patience to wait for the seed to sprout? Well, I know of no other answer to this question other than getting around some people who've lived all the seasons of life. Someone who knows what it's like to stare at a field that's dry and fallow and nothing has grown there for a while. but also someone that has learned what it looks like when the harvest is ready to break out the sickle. We each need someone in our lives who can tell us, not yet, you better wait on that for a little while, or go for that right now. It's ready. It's ready to harvest. Now, from up here, I joke about Dave a lot. But the truth is, Dave is one of the people in my life that helps me to know when it's time to harvest and when it's time to wait. Much more than just helping me in terms of preaching. He helps me in terms of living. So the picture I have is that he's walking the fields with me and he's helping me to cultivate what God is growing in me and around me. And it's the greatest gift that he could give me. So, a word to the younger ones among us. get around someone or ask God for someone who can help you walk your fields to see what's ready to harvest and to see what still needs to wait ask them about what they've learned in their lifetime that will help you know what to do in your lifetime ask them to help you walk your fields because you need them. You need them. And a word to the older ones among us. We need you. We need you desperately. I think there's kind of this perception at Open Door, at least I've heard it in the little chatter here and there, that Open Door is somehow intentionally becoming younger, as if we need to be more hip to attract the culture. Well, let me say this as clearly and as straightly as possible to all of us, but to especially those of you who are older. We need you desperately. We need you to help us walk our fields and see what we don't see. We need you to help us know what time it is. And if you're not there for us, we are finished. So, please, please, please, to the older ones among us, help us walk our fields. We have to do this together because it doesn't work any other way. Our strategy is not getting younger. it's walking the fields together amen final word to church of the open door in general and in our history i think we've had years of huge harvest where we couldn't find enough sickles if you think about some of those years if you were here in the gym or in the crystal building it's like there wasn't enough sickles in the barn to harvest all that god was growing but now I think we're sort of finding ourselves staring at a field not knowing what's growing and so our call out to you is let's walk the fields together and let's notice what's sprouting up in us and around us let's believe together that the creative activity of the God of the universe is still dreaming up ways in us and around us to scatter seed into the darkest corners of the world, of Maple Grove, and of your heart. So church of the open door, do not worry because God is still with a kind of pesky grin on his face, gleefully dreaming up ways to scatter seed all around us. That's who God is, and that's what God does. So open your eyes, Church of the Open Door, and ask God to help us to have the wisdom to see what's sprouting up around us. And help us to have the courage to walk together, young and old, in these fields. Help us to have the patience to wait for the harvest. So young and old, with wide-eyed wonder, and using the phrase, how fascinating, all the time, let's wait and see what sprouts into life around us. Is anyone with me? Well, let's pray that that would be so. So Jesus, we prayed in the beginning if we could see you. If we could just get a glimpse of the gleeful, creative activity that you're doing around us and in us, we would drop everything to follow you. So give us eyes to see you. And give us the courage to submit to you and have our character formed into your ways so that we can walk young and old together these fields believing that you are not done with us yet. Let it be so. Amen? Amen. Have a great weekend, everybody. Don't forget about Keith's reception. That's in the window room. We'll see you next week. Thank you.
