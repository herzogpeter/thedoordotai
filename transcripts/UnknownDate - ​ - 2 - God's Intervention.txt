Anybody see the movie The Jerk with Steve Martin in it? See that movie? Couldn't you see a picture of Steve Martin dancing to that last song we did? Just like what he did at the end of that movie. I had all these weird thoughts going through my mind, you know, when I was sitting over there. Not real spiritual kind of thoughts, you know. I was thinking, you know, if you could get Joe Cocker saved and put him on some medication, he'd kind of look like Mark Johnson. So I have a riddle for you. The riddle is, what's this wide and this long and black, white, gray, and striped? Yeah, it's my new kittens if you line them all up in a straight line like this. I tried to figure out how to throw that in there in a subliminal kind of way, but I couldn't figure it out, so I thought I'd just say it. So, hint. James 1.18 is the passage this morning. Let me read it for you. James 1.18, In the exercise of his will he brought us forth by the word of truth so that we might be, as it were, the firstfruits among his creatures. Let's pray. Lord thank you for this morning when we can meet together I pray that your spirit would be here as you have been at the other services that you would paint a picture of your good news and your love for us that's not limited by my ability to explain it and I ask you this in Jesus name, amen for four weeks Dave has been talking about the sin cycle and about how our blaming feeds it and fuels it and keeps us locked in it. Two weeks ago, I talked more about blame and more specifically raised the issues of why people blame. This week, I want to deal with the two whys that I mentioned a couple weeks ago and how God's intervention into this whole process solves those issues. We're going to revisit Genesis 3 to see where it all starts. So if you have a Bible and you want to turn there, turn to Genesis 3, verse 1. and it goes like this. Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said to the woman indeed has God said you shall not eat from any tree of the garden and the woman said to the serpent from the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden God has said you shall not eat from it or touch it lest you die and the serpent said to the woman you shall not surely die for God knows that in the day you eat from it, your eyes will be open, and you will be like God, knowing good from evil. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and it was the delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate and gave also to her husband with her, and he ate. And then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings. And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. Then the Lord God called to the man and said to him, Where are you? And he said, I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid myself. And he said, Who told you you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree which I commanded you not to eat? And the man said, The woman that you gave me, she gave me from the tree, and I ate. So basically, I'm not responsible for my behaviors. It's the woman's fault, and actually it's really your fault, because if you hadn't given me her and she wouldn't have given me the apple, I'd be okay, so I'm kind of a victim in this whole deal. And he said to the woman, what have you done? And she said, well, it's not me. I'm not responsible for my behaviors. It's really the serpent that is responsible here. So what we see here are Adam and Eve hiding from God, and actually they're hiding in two ways. One way they're actually physically hiding, it says. They're hiding. They hid behind a tree or some brush in the garden. Also, they're hiding behind, emotionally and psychologically, spiritually, they're hiding behind the behaviors of someone else. They're placing themselves behind someone else's behaviors and saying, this is what's responsible. I'm not responsible. Now, why did they do that? Well, first they were afraid of God. They had a twisted picture of God. And where that comes from is this, that the serpent basically, verses 3 to 5, comes to them and kind of insinuates, plants this idea in them that God really doesn't have their best interest in mind. He really is trying to cramp their style. He really doesn't want them to have all of what is for them. And so they've got a distorted picture of God. The serpent twists his words in verse 1. The other reason they're hiding is because they're ashamed. They're afraid of God and they're ashamed. In verse 25 of chapter 2, it says, The man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed. Now they're naked and ashamed. And one of the things that people do when they're ashamed is that they hide. Now, some of you have been to seminars I've done where we've talked about shame for hours and hours and hours. And I'm not going to do that today. I'm going to do a minute and a half talk on shame so you understand what I mean when I say it. Just the difference between that and guilt. guilt is an emotional response to behavior guilt the way i see it like most emotions is that guilt is like a flare that explodes and puts light down here on our behavior so we can see it more clearly guilt is an emotion about our behavior it says we've crossed the line we've made a sinful choice we've crossed we've gone against our values we've trespassed someplace and guilt just shines a light on that so that we can see what we did and do something differently about it. Shame, on the other hand, is not so much of an emotion as it is a mindset, a way of thinking about, an assessment of, a view of, a picture that we have of us. Shame is about you. Guilt is about behavior. Shame is about you, which is why we say shame on you. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Guilt is a behavior issue. Shame is a people issue. Shame is a sense of being defective, worthless, unloved, inadequate, incapable, less than, something's wrong with, you're bad, those kinds of things. That's what shame is. Guilt says what I did was wrong. Shame says something's wrong with me. Guilt says I did a bad thing. Shame says I'm a bad person. That's the difference. Now, when we experience shame, when we feel shame, the natural response that we have to that is to hide. And that's what they did. How many of you, when you were a little kid, you know, and you did something you weren't supposed to do, you're told not to do it, you did it anyway, then your parents come and they confront you about it, you know, try to hold you accountable. How many of you ever went like this? See, that's hiding. That's just like a little kid way of hiding. Did you do it? You know, they come and say, did you do it? I mean, most of the time they knew you did it. So then you feel trapped and stupid and little, even more so. It's kind of like God showing up in the garden and saying, where are you? I mean, the guy had x-ray vision. I mean, he could see through trees. Where are you? Did you eat from the tree? which I told you not to eat. I mean, and so they hit. How many of you ever got a speeding ticket? Raise your hand. Keep your hands up. Put them up. Keep them up. Okay, now raise as many fingers as the amount of tickets you got. Okay. Now, here's what that looks like to me. I'm looking at this. Here's what it looks like to me. How many of you got speed tickets? People raise their hand, you know, and then they put them down. I say, put them up. Then they go. Now raise as many fingers as the tickets you have. People with one ticket go like this. They go, well, I might be defective, but I'm not as defective as this guy right here. And people with two or three tickets, they're not sure, see, so they kind of go like this. Their hand goes. And people with five tickets and ten tickets, you see, they go like this. Because they want to prove that this doesn't bother them. See, and I got news for you. The things that don't bother you, you don't have to prove don't bother you. They just don't bother you. You understand that? I mean, if you've got to prove that something doesn't bother you, it's because what? It bothers you. Well, the reason that's a tough exercise to do is because when you get a speeding ticket, speeding tickets are about driving behavior. I made a poor choice. I wasn't paying attention. I was in a hurry. I didn't plan well enough. Those kinds of things. But when you get a speeding ticket, it doesn't feel like it's about behavior. It feels like it's about you. Which is why when you get a speeding ticket, people slide down. You ever notice this? People slide down in their seats just a little bit. They want to slide down without looking like they're sliding down. So they slide down like this, you see. And if they've got a hat here in the seat next to them, they put the hat on, you know. And when cars are going by, every time they see a car coming like this, every time the car goes by, they go like this. Because they don't want the person to see who it is sitting in the car. Worse than that, the guy comes up to you, or the woman, police person, comes up to you with a piece of paper and a red stripe on it, hands it to you, which is like getting a sad face in kindergarten. You're sitting in a glass room, okay, that anybody who wants to can look in and see you sitting in there, and they know what you did. And you think that everybody who drives by is looking in there and thinking things about you. Whether they are or not, we don't know. On top of that, there's a car behind you with red lights on, drawing the attention of everybody who drives by to you sitting in the glass room where they can see if they wanted to. On top of that, the cop asks you questions that either don't have answers, so you feel stupid and trapped and little and dumb, or he asks you questions that if you gave the true answer, he wouldn't like the answer. Like, for instance, where's the fire? I can only think of a smart aleck answer to that so you just go no or he says why are you going so fast didn't see you he'd hate he'd hate that answer see when we experience shame we hide we want to hide if if shame is being seen less than being seen in a diminished way then when you have shame you want to not be seen now look at James 1 18 again in the exercise of his will he brought us forth by the word of truth so that we might be, as it were, the first fruits among his creatures. Two parts to this verse I want to talk about this week and then expand on the first part next week. The first part is the will of God. One thing about the will of God that I'm going to talk about next week is that a lot of people I know, a lot of people I have experienced in the Christian life, don't think of the will of God as very user-friendly. The will of God is kind of like this hard thing, and it's even kind of a mysterious thing that you have to figure out and do. So it's kind of like this divine list of things to do that you have to figure out so you can do it. Because if you don't, you're in trouble. You don't want to miss the will of God. You don't want to do the permissive will of God. You want to be in the what? Perfect will of God. You don't want to be over in a permissive place. And so we don't think of God's will sometimes as a friendly kind of thing, but more like a weight. And I'm going to talk more about that next week. But this week I'll talk a little bit about the will of God and that it really is user-friendly and that because of God's will some things have happened. The second part is that it says in this verse, because of his will, what he brought forth in his will is us. And we are called the first fruits of his creatures. So here's the deal. God, our source of love, the meter of all of our needs, the one who's anxious to forgive, the one who Romans 5 talks about. Let me read you that. Kind of a powerful passage, I think. Romans 5, verse 6. While we were still helpless at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. For one would hardly die for a righteous man, though perhaps for a good man, someone would dare even to die. But God demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. When we were in our most despicable, worst possible, least able to do anything about it, condition, God came toward us. Understand that? When we were in our worst possible condition that we couldn't do anything about, God came toward us. This God shows up in the garden after Adam and Eve sinned. This God, who's full of love, who's eager to forgive, who has no problem coming toward people when they're in their worst condition, this God shows up and they run. why is that well because they had a wrong view of this god which is why a lot of us hide from god too we have a we have a wrong view of god see james 1 18 talks about the god who rescues us from the sin cycle by an act of his will he brought us forth that word brought forth is childbirth that's the word it means he bore us as in born as in gave birth to Do you know that when you're born, a person who's born has nothing to do or say about the fact that they were born? It's totally up to the parents that they were born? Look at Ephesians 1, 5 ones. Ephesians 1, 5 says this. He predestined us to adoption as sons and daughters through Jesus Christ to himself according to the kind intention of his will. The kind intention of his will. I mean it was a long time in my Christian life where I thought that his will wasn't that kind that it wasn't user friendly that it was a weight on me this says his will is kindly intended toward us talk more about that next week here's what's interesting those of us who are Christians decided that God was kind enough forgiving enough and safe enough to come toward in the beginning, before we were Christians, when we were at least able to do anything about our most despicable condition, we decided God was safe enough, forgiving enough, and loving enough to go toward. We went toward Him. We became Christians. But a lot of people, after the fact, have a hard time seeing Him that way now. When we sin, when we mess up, when we look bad, when we fall short, you see. Now that we're Christians, a lot of people have a hard time coming toward that same God that when they were in a much worse condition, they went toward. Why is that? Well, let me paint some pictures of God, the God who is still safe and forgiving, still eager to forgive, after the fact, after we become Christians, after we become Christians and sin. John 8 John 8 is the story of the woman taken in adultery let me tell you the story Jesus went to the Mount of Olives and early in the morning he came into the temple and all the people were coming to him and he sat down and began to teach them and the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery and having set her in their midst they said to him teacher this woman has been caught in adultery in the very act this isn't a woman who there's a rumor this is somebody walked in a room she's committing adultery now in the law of moses were commanded to stone such a woman what do you say they were saying this testing him in order that they might have grounds for accusing him because of course if he said well go ahead and stone her then he'd be accused of not being merciful and not being loving and if they said um don't stone her then he'd be accused of not caring about the law of moses but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground. I don't know if he was stalling. You know, I just wonder what he's doing there. What is he writing? You know. Get milk. I don't know. Trying to think of an answer. When they persisted in asking him, he straightened up and said to them, Who is without sin among you? Let him be the first to throw a stone at her. Whoever is without sin, throw the first stone. And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. And when they heard it, they began to go out one by one, beginning with the older ones, and he was left alone. And the woman where she had been in the midst, and straightening up, Jesus said to her, Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you? And she said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn you. You know, if there ever was a day for condemnation, this was the day. In this story, which I've known all my Christian life, it's always easy, it's been easier for me to have compassion for the woman than for the Pharisees who drag her out in front of Jesus. The Pharisees, you know, I don't have a lot of patience for. I'm kind of ticked off at them because of the hurt that they cause people. And so it's always been, you know, easier to have compassion, kind of want to give the woman the benefit of the doubt. If there ever was a day for condemnation, this was the day because this woman hadn't just sinned. She did one of the big ten. So this was really a bad sin, plus there were witnesses. And the law said, kill her. And what Jesus did is he said, I don't condemn you. The law said, you're condemned. But Jesus said, I don't condemn you. What Jesus did that day was he placed himself over the law. He put himself over the law and didn't condemn her. here's the point i want to make wherever jesus is there is no condemnation wherever jesus is there is no condemnation wherever jesus is there is no condemnation there IS no condemnation you know maybe you've been In a family your whole life or in a church in the past someplace where you always felt condemned you know maybe you can relate to that go to a church feeling condemned the whole time you're there wherever jesus is there is no condemnation. You're in a church where all there is is condemnation. Jesus isn't there. You know why? Wherever Jesus is, there is no condemnation. If there ever was a day for condemnation, this was the day. You know what else? If there ever was a day for redemption, this was the day too. Because you know what? When he said, whoever was without sin cast the first stone by virtue of not throwing stones they were admitting to being in sin understand so they were sinners she was a sinner anybody could have got redeemed that day anyone could have come to god that day you know my picture is he said go and sin no more he said that by the way after he said i don't condemn you not before i won't condemn you if you sin no more he didn't say that my picture is that the Pharisees, when they went away, they probably didn't go that far away. They probably just went far enough away so Jesus couldn't see them to watch this deal, you see. And probably after she left Jesus, they're following him around, trying to see if she went back to commit adultery and stuff, so they could condemn her. But wherever Jesus is, when Jesus is there, there is no condemnation. Luke 15, 3. Luke 15, the whole chapter is a picture of the Father. It's a picture of our Father in heaven. Verse 3, he told them a parable saying, what man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, doesn't leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost until he finds it. When he's found it, he lays it on his shoulders rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors saying to them, rejoice with me for I have found the sheep which is lost. I tell you there's more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance. See, this, I'm going to tell you the story of the prodigal son here in a minute. The prodigal son, the rebellious son, which is later in this thing. This is not a rebellious sheep. You understand this? This is just a regular sheep. Just a sheep. Okay? So, the sheep is just going along with the other sheep, and then something happens. They notice something. They get distracted. Butterfly, whatever, flies by, and they go over here, follow the butterfly, and then when they turn around, they're lost, and the other sheep are gone, and they don't know where they went, and they don't know how to find them again. They're a lost sheep, you see? And maybe their wool is stuck in some picker bush now, called addiction, which is another place they didn't plan on being in, but there they are. And what this story says is that when that happens, the shepherd leaves the other ones and looks and looks and looks until he finds this sheep, and when he finds the sheep, the sheep doesn't even have to get back to the other sheep under its own power. he picks up the sheep and carries it back. You see, some people need to know this because there are people who think they've wandered too far away from God for him to be able to find them. And it's not true. You can't wander too far away from God for him to be able to find you. And he's looking. Verse 8, What woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin, doesn't light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully till she finds it. And when she's found it, she calls together a friend's neighbor saying, Rejoice with me for I have found the coin which is lost. In the same way, I tell you there's joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents. Now this is a lost coin, just like the lost sheep. It's lost. But unlike the lost sheep, a coin cannot get lost under its own power. Understand this? Sheep can wander off under their own power, but a coin can't get lost under its own power. is just sitting here on the dresser with a bunch of other coins. Someone walks by and knocks it off. And not only that, it's worse lost than the lost sheep because it's in a dark underneath place, which is why she has to light a lamp and search carefully for it. See, the shepherd doesn't even have to search that carefully for the sheep. The sheep just has to make a bunch of sheep noises. Bah, bah, bah. Okay, then the shepherd pays attention to where the noises are coming and follows the noises to the sheep. See, coins can't do that. What else that says, though, about the sheep, if you're someone who's wandered off wondering if God can find you, what you need to do, if you're over here, is just start screaming like a sheep. You understand this? This coin is more like a sexual abuse victim or a spiritual abuse victim who's in a dark underneath place feeling lost because they got knocked off. They didn't wander off, they got knocked off. And unless God lights a lamp and searches carefully for them, they're lost. But the text says he does, and they're found. Some people need to know that about God, too. Here's the story of the prodigal son. Up on top of my Bible right here, it says prodigal son. But you know what? Prodigal's not in the text. That word's not in the text. And Actually, the word prodigal means extravagant. See, this is not the story of the prodigal son. This is the story of the rebellious son and the prodigal father. Understand this? There's a story about the extravagant dad. Let me tell you the story. A certain man, this is a story about a man with two sons. A certain man had two sons, and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to me. and he divided his wealth between them. And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together, went on a journey into a distant country, and there he squandered his estate with loose living. And when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began to be in need. And he went out and attached himself. Good word. What do we call things that attach themselves to things? Leeches. To one of the citizens of that country, and he sent them into the fields to feed the pigs. And he was longing to fill his stomach with the pods the pigs were eating, and no one was giving anything to him. This is the rebellious son. Now, there's another son in this story later on in the chapter, and this is the son that did it right, and he's kind of sad that the younger son is getting some kind of party here because he did it right his whole life and never got a party. This guy really screwed up, and now he's getting a party. I have to tell you that I have more compassion and more grace for the younger son who's really screwed up than for the older son who's over here whining and being snotty and self-righteous. Do you understand? I have more grace for the younger son. This is a person. I have all kinds of grace for this person. You know, they took off out the door. They rebelled. They hit the wall. Woke up with the pigs. Said, I don't like this. This ain't working. Went home. They're going to a 12-step meeting. I like this person a lot. This person, you know, I spend my life, we spend our life as a church, going behind this person, picking up the pieces of all the damage they cause. But you know what? The younger son was a puke. He was a selfish, evil puke of a son. He went to his dad and said, give me what I should only have coming if you were dead. In other words, drop dead. In other words, make it look the same as if you were dead. That's how much I care about you. So he got the stuff, he took off, and he wasted it all. You know, there's God's grace even in the very front end of this story. Because God is so anxious for us to have a relationship with him that he gives us the resources to be able to not to. So that if we do, we do it by choice. You see, this son, before the father gave him the resources, could only stay. Now he could stay or leave. And the father wants us to stay so much, he gives us everything we need to stay or leave, so that if we stay, it's because we love him. So, it says when he came to his senses, when he came to his senses. Now, that sounds kind of like repentance. He said to himself, how many of my father's hired men have more than enough bread, but I'm dying here with hunger? Oh, see, repentance would have been this. What I did was really wrong. But that's not what he said. What he said was, you know, he's over here in the pig pen having a tug of war with a cob of corn with the pigs, you know, and he goes, this isn't working, I hate this, I hate this. wait a minute my father's slaves have it better than me I'm going home see what he was saying here is it's a better financial decision for me to go home than it is to stay here so we don't even have that good of a repentance here just a kind of a one I'll get up and go to my father and say to him father I've sinned against heaven and in your sight I'm no longer worthy to be called your son see I used to think oh he's he's finally realized that he's just making up a speech. He went home because it was a better deal. I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired men. And he got up and came to his father. Here's what I want you to notice. It doesn't say he got up, took a bath, changed clothes, combed his hair, went home. It says he got up and went home. So the guy has pig crud all over himself. He's been in the pig pen with the pigs. He smells. He's dirty. While he was still a long way off, his father saw him. So what does that tell you about the father? The father's been watching for him. He loves him. He misses him. He's concerned about him. He's been looking for him, you see. And one day he looks, and down in the driveway comes this son, and he's a mess. And it says the father felt compassion for him. It doesn't say, and the father looked at his son, who was the mess, and said, boy, he got what he deserved, and when he gets here, he's going to get it worse. He said he had compassion for him. And then it says he ran to him. Greek word there isn't ran, it's raised. Running is different. Facing means running as fast as you can. The father ran as fast as he could, which is a trick for a Jewish guy because they're wearing these deals, see? So you could run in them, but you couldn't run as fast as you could because you can only take little steps. So to take big steps and run as fast as you could, he'd have to hike it up like this to run down the driveway, which would have been humiliating. It would have been unspiritual. You have to understand that there is a rule about Jewish guys exposing themselves to people. but you know what that's a stupid rule when it comes to sons who are lost that are now coming home see remember that rule we had about that kind of deal okay that's a stupid rule we're not doing that rule anymore something more important's happening here i mean if you want to see a picture of this another picture is when jesus heals the guy's hand on the sabbath and the pharisees freak out and they say we don't do that on the Sabbath. And basically by doing that, Jesus says, remember that rule? That's a stupid rule. We're not doing that anymore. There are more important things happening here. When it comes to redemption, when it comes to forgiveness, when it comes to lost people coming back, when it comes to reconciliation, when it comes to healing, all those rules we've been worried about, we're not worried about them anymore. This is more important. You want to see a picture of the Father? This is Jesus breaking the father's rules for the sake of redemption. And he embraced him, hugged. Actually, in the Greek it says began embracing. Hugged and hugged and hugged and hugged. Whenever you see began doing something, it means started and kept doing it. Hugged and hugged and hugged. But now remember, this kid was full of pig crud. How do Jewish people feel about pigs? Anybody know? Unclean, unkosher, filthy. Don't go buy them. Don't eat them. Stay away from them. I'm clean. Well, you know, remember that rule? That's a stupid rule. We're not doing that rule either. And the father went and threw his arms around this kid. It was full of pig crud, and now he's got it on himself too. And then it says, he kissed him, began kissing, kissed and kissed and kissed. He kissed him. And the son says to the father, here's the speech. Father, I've sinned against heaven and in your sight. I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. Now the rest of the speech is about living like a servant instead of a son. But the father interrupts the speech. And as a matter of fact, he's not even listening to the speech. Because it says, but the father said to his slaves, let's have a party. So at the same time that the son is over here groveling, you know, spilling his guts about this whole thing. Trying to make it right. with a speech prepared to offer the way he was going to pay for what he did, the father's plan on the party. And the father says, you know, I think the reason the father interrupted the son is because the son said, I'm no longer worthy to be the son. The son was never the son because he was worthy to be the son. He was the son because the father was the father. You see, he had a twisted picture of the father. He thought the father was someone he had to be worthy around in order to be a son. so when I come back you don't have to let me be a son anymore I'll just be a slave slaves and sons live different than each other slaves, hired people live over here away from the family and when they get up in the morning they hope they do it well enough that day to keep out of trouble so they can keep their job that's not how sons and daughters live lots and lots and lots of Christians live that way though here's what the father says, quickly bring out the best robe, now you have to understand something about these robes, in the weave of the robe, it was woven in such a way, that if you were looking at it, you could tell what family this guy was from, so what he's doing is he's saying this, put the robe on this son, this puke of a son, who didn't even have that good of a repentance here, put the best robe on the son, Because I want everybody to know that this is my son. Amen. Son, it doesn't say the son got in recovery. It doesn't say that the son learned how to live. Put the ring on his finger. See, this ring they're talking about here is the ring that people could use to close deals. They could buy stuff with this. It was a signet ring. It was like a signature. put the best robe on this person so that anybody who looks at him can tell he's my son and give him the Visa Gold card too there's nowhere in the text where it says this son knows how to handle money I mean the only mention of the way he handled his resources was that he wasted them all this guy doesn't know how to live talk about God's grace he got all the resources and then there's this older son see this older son he's over here he's typical first child dysfunctional family family hero guy and they began to make merry now his older son was in the field what's he doing? he's working that's what he does he works he's in the field and he came back he heard all the partying and he got angry. He got sad. He felt left out. He's whining and crying and saying, I don't get it. You didn't throw me a party. You know, it's interesting. I told you, I don't like this guy. What the story says is that the father left the party and went looking for this guy. See, what I would do is say, hit the bricks, you know. I'm glad you're not here. You're a pain. the father left the party he went to this son and basically said to this son you know what our family is having a party and it's not the same without you here and see there is no condemnation where Jesus is John 5 45 Jesus is talking to this older son he's talking directly to the older son here's what he says don't even think that I will accuse you before the father don't even think that I came to condemn you don't even think I came to accuse you. He's talking to the older son. You know why? Wherever Jesus is, there is no condemnation. I don't get it. I just don't get it. I get grace to broken people. Well, that's who God is. Well, you know, like it's a little bit of who God is. The God who we don't have to hide from, the God who we can go toward even after we've screwed up, even after we've sinned. But what about the shame issue? What about us? Romans 8.1. There's therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. If I were to put scriptural words on guilt and shame, guilt would be like conviction for what you did. Shame would be condemnation for you. This verse says, there is no condemnation for those. Can you hear this as a people verse? This is a people verse. There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. You know why? there is no condemnation where Jesus is. There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. This doesn't mean God likes everything we do. God hates some of the things we do. But even in the middle of hating something we do, there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. There is therefore now no condemnation. When is there no condemnation? Now. Well, when is it now? Well, it's now now. Well, it's still now. Well, it's now again. It's always now. Whenever it's now, which is always, there never is any condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. Which is to say, there never is a time when there's condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. You know why? They're in Christ Jesus. And wherever Jesus is, there is no condemnation. Romans 8.31 says this. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who's against us? What's the answer? If God is for us, who's against us? Anyone? if God is for us no one's against us but see that doesn't feel real to me because it sometimes feels like somebody's against us doesn't it I mean I experience that so let me do it this way then if God is for us no one's against us but if God is for us and someone is against us it's just the same as if no one is against us if God is for us he who did not spare his own son but delivered him up for us all how will he not also with him freely give us all things who will bring a charge against god's elect who nobody but now see that doesn't feel real either because it feels like sometimes someone brings a charge against us which is to say no one will bring a charge against god's elect except if it if they do it's as it's as if they didn't god is the one who justifies who condemns who if god is the one who justifies who is the one who condemns? Anybody? Nobody. But sometimes it feels like there is somebody. So in that case, even though there is someone condemning, because God is the one who justifies, it's as if nobody condemns. Who can condemn what God justified? Christ Jesus is the one who died, rather was raised up, who at the right hand of the Father sits and intercedes for us. What shall separate us from the love of Christ? Anything? Shall tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, sword, and all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through him who loved us. I'm convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus. So what can separate us from the love of God? What can? Nothing can. What if we screw up? Nothing can. but now okay God sees us in a non-condemning way the way he looks at us is a non-condemning way is it that he looks at us in this non-condemning way because he's kind of pretending about us in other words really we're really these kind of despicable creatures and he just sees us because of Jesus in a non-condemning way or is it that when he looks at us he says what he actually does see which is someone who's okay. James 1.18 calls us the first fruits. What are the first fruits? Exodus 23.9 says this, You shall bring the choice first fruits of your soil into the house of God. The word first fruits, that phrase in English, happens 25 times in the Bible. In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word that's translated sometimes first fruits happens 38 times. first fruits were the best of the crop do you understand this they were the cream of the crop the absolute choicest part of the harvest that was the first fruits that's us Leviticus this is me preaching from the Old Testament folks take a picture because this doesn't happen very often Leviticus 23.10 speak to the sons of Israel and say to them when you enter the land which I'm going to give to you and reap its harvest then you shall bring in the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest. See not only were the first fruits the part of the harvest that was the choicest best part but a first fruits kind of thing was the kind of thing you did when there was something really to celebrate. When you finally get to the land that I have set aside for you and enter in we're going to do a first fruits thing because we've got time for a big celebration now. That's who we are. We're his first fruits. He gave birth to us as first fruits. He did it. Psalm 17, David's kind of crying out to God again. See how he's doing in Psalms. Verse 6, I've called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God. Incline thine ear to me, hear my speech. Wondrously show thy loving kindness. O Savior of those who take refuge at thy right hand. From those who rise up against them. Listen. Keep me as the apple of your eye. Keep me as the apple of your eye. You know God I just want to be the apple of your eye. You know I never was the apple of anybody's eye. In my family. Felt like I was in the way. I was kind of a bother. I would sure like to feel that. God, keep me as the apple of your eye. Zechariah 2.8 For thus says the Lord of hosts, After glory he has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you touches the apple of my eye. See, we are the apple of God's eye. Actually, the word there is a different word for apple than David's word for apple. This word for apple means pupil. And that means, you ever look in somebody's eyes and see you? Right in the middle, you can kind of see a little picture, a little reflection of you. See, when God looks in his eye, our eye, he sees himself. What else it says is, whoever touches you touches the apple of God's eye. That's like saying, whoever messes with you guys is poking God in the eye. Don't do it. See, we can go toward God when we've sinned because when he sees us coming, listen, when he sees us coming, he sees someone coming that he really likes. But that's not all. we can go toward God when we've sinned because Jesus has gotten there first. We can go toward God when we've sinned because Jesus got there first. 1 John 2, verse 1 says this. My little children, I'm writing these things to you that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. I'm writing you this to help you not sin. I'm writing this as kind of a way to help you not sin. But if you do sin, which we're going to do, but if you do sin, you need to know Jesus got there first, and he's advocating for us even before we get there. Got a good lawyer. Really good lawyer. Hebrews 7.25 says, He is able to save completely those who draw near to God through Him, for He always lives to make intercession for us. He always lives to make intercession for us. You ever hear that phrase, somebody lives for something? You know, like they live for the weekend, they live for their grandkids, they live for their husband, they live for their wife, whatever. This says He lives to make intercession for us. He lives for that. Jesus lives to make intercession for us. Dave Johnson lives for the Cubs. He's a Cubs fan. He loves the Cubs. He's nuts about the Cubs. He's got little Cub-stuffed animals, Cub uniforms on. He's got a picture of Wrigley Field in his office where the Cubs play. Got cable so he can watch Cubs games. When the Cubs are winning, he thinks it's because he's sitting in a certain chair. If they lose, he thinks it's because he didn't change his socks soon enough that day. I mean, you know, all this kind of stuff. He lives for the Cubs. Day before the season, he cuts out the standings, National League East. Guess who's in first? Cubs. Everybody's got a 0-0 record. Cubs are in first. He goes, ah, Cubs are in first. It's the last day they're in first. He lives for the Cubs. But he doesn't always live for the Cubs. I've seen it. He doesn't always live for the Cubs. End of April, the Cubs go in the toilet like they always do every year, play barely 500 ball after that every year. He goes, Cubs stink. I hate the Cubs. I'm not watching the Cubs anymore. Then he watches them because he's a Cubs fan. Got to understand he's a Cubs fan. Once you're a Cubs fan, you always got to be a Cubs fan. You can never not be a Cubs fan because you have so much equity invested in the Cubs that you can't leave the Cubs because if you left them, they'd probably win the World Series without you. So you got to keep... All you got to do is trade somebody he doesn't think they should be trading, you know. Cubs stink. You know, I'm not supporting this anymore. I'm not watching this. Then he watches it. He lives for the Cubs, but he doesn't always live for the Cubs. Okay, that's kind of a goofy illustration. Here's a different one. I live for Jesus. I live for Jesus. But I don't always live for Jesus. I want to always live for Jesus. I try to always live for Jesus. I wish I always lived for Jesus. But I don't always live for Jesus. But even though I don't always live for him, he always lives for me. He lives to make intercession for us. He's in the presence of the Father, and he's pleading our case. He says, you know, see this person right here? They're okay. They're accepted. And the Father says, okay. And then Jesus says, no, see, you don't get it. They're really accepted. And the Father says, okay, I heard you the first time. And then Jesus says, okay. Well, yeah, but I've ever told you, I mean, like, when's the last time I told you that this person is really okay? And the father says, you know, you've been telling me this for 10,000 years. You don't have to keep telling me this anymore. I get it. Knock it off. And Jesus says, okay, okay, okay. But now, could I just tell you one more time how okay this person is? When Jesus gets up in the morning, which, you know, I don't know if he gets up. But I'm telling the story, so I get to decide. when he gets up in the morning he thinks to himself how can i make intercession for this person today when he goes to bed at night he thinks to himself how can i make intercession for her tomorrow he lives to make intercession for us why do we need to know that because the father forgets like one day jesus is going to show up with the father and say you know she's really okay and the father's going to go oh you know it's really lucky that you reminded me of that because I didn't know. I forgot all about that. No, it's not because the Father forgets. It's because we forget. We forget. And because he got there first, 1 John 1, 9, if we confess our sins, he's faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us for all in righteousness. What's interesting is that word confess is in the present. Like every time there is a sin when we confess it like this. He's faithful and just to forgive. That's a one point in time complete action. We confess as they come up. He forgives once for all. And cleanses once for all. See, God intervenes in the sin cycle by being the God we don't need to hide from. But it's better than that. 1 John 2 1 says, I'm telling you these things that you may not sin. I'm giving you this to hopefully prevent you from sinning in the first place. So, next week. Next week we're going to see how by and through God's own will, He intervened on the sin cycle ahead of time. Creating, recreating, and empowering us to be able to avoid it in the first place. That's next week. Let's pray. Lord I just want to thank you for how much you love us for how much you've given us I pray that you would sink that deep into the soil of our hearts so we don't feel like we need to hide from you so we can know that you are safe and anxious to forgive and we can run toward you when we're in trouble in Jesus name, amen
