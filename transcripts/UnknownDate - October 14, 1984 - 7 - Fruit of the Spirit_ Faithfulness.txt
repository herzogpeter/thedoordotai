Discussing this doctrine of freedom to the believer, the problem is this. People are getting afraid when they hear freedom, especially the Jew. To the Jew, the only thing that restrained sin was the law. He saw it like a dam that was holding back the waters of sin. And if you take the law away, which was exactly what Paul was doing, you're just going to have sin run amok. Paul says when he's hearing that argument, wait a minute, you don't understand. Verse 13, you were called to freedom, brethren. You were called to liberty. I will not back off of that. But listen, do not use your freedom or do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh. But through love serve one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word. In this statement, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. And then we got into the sermon that we're in right now. Did you know that? Did you know that for the last six or seven weeks, we're really only in the third point of a sermon that started six or seven weeks ago? The first point was this. Remember? The command. The command was verse 16. Here's what you do, freedom. Here's what you do, Christian, who is struggling with his freedom. I say this, command, walk by the Spirit. If you walk by the Spirit, here's the promise. You will not run amok. You will not carry out the desire of the flesh. You are no longer being controlled by external rules and external codes. If you have the Spirit of God in you, you are a Christian. If you are a Christian, then you have an internal power that is not dependent on external controls. You walk by the Spirit, you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh. But we also understand this, that not only is there a command to walk by the Spirit, thus resulting in a holy life, but there is also a conflict. The conflict is found in verse 17. The flesh sets its desire against the Spirit. Don't be naive in your Christian life. The flesh is going to lie to you The flesh is going to tell you certain things like this The flesh is going To come to you and say you can do it on your own You can live a holy life on your own By gritting your teeth and trying hard The flesh is going to tell you this It's going to come to you and lie to you and say this You can get life from something other than Christ You can get life and you can get meaning And you can find some sort of identity In what you have in what you see In what you taste in what you can possess For yourself and even believers who have the indwelling spirit sometimes go for that and start living for things. Start living for people. Start living for possessions, status, all sorts of other things. For the believer, he has the indwelling Christ, but there is this conflict between being controlled by the flesh or being controlled by the spirit. Then we got into the contrast. The contrast was simply this. He contrasted walking by the spirit with walking by the flesh. We have been very carefully noting this fact that when we talk about the fruit of the spirit and when we talk about the fruit of the flesh we have been indicating that they are symptoms of something that's going on inside of me when someone is involved in drunkenness and carousing and strife and jealousy and outbursts of anger and disputes and dissensions it is not enough to look at them and say you really shouldn't do that you should really stop doing that what i really need to do is get to the core of what it is that's causing that the deeds of the flesh are evident if you are living for if you are living according to that which is natural it will be obvious in your life the symptoms will be immorality impurity sensuality idolatry but if you're walking according to the spirit that will be obvious too they are symptoms the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace don't kid yourself it's as if this text is saying don't kid yourself if there is no love in your spirit if there is no joy if there is no peace if there is no patience if there is no kindness dwelling in you you are not walking according to the spirit i don't care what you say i don't care what you think you know about theology what you think you know about god if those qualities are not in you and increasing you are not walking by the spirit these are symptoms and they they are little gifts to me telling me whether or not my focus is where it ought to be. The problem is this, we do kid ourselves. And that's where the counterfeit comes. We have been very careful as we've gone into the fruit of the Spirit to indicate that there are counterfeits of the fruit of the Spirit. You see, I look at love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and on and on and on, and I look at them and I go, aha, those are virtues that I aspire to. I want to be a loving person. In all my life I've grown up in the church, and it's real important to be loving. And so I think, well, I ought to just try to do that and be joyful. But they can be counterfeited. See, sometimes my love is full of strings. And the reason I give and the reason I care and the reason I'm nice to you, the real reason is that I absolutely expect something in return. The only reason I give, the only reason I'm nice to you, is because I want you to do something for me. That isn't a fruit of the Spirit. That's an absolute fruit of the flesh. A deed of the flesh. And the way it becomes evident to me is this. When you don't do what I want you to do because I was so nice to you, you know what rises up in me? Love. No. No. Anger, disputes, factions. What are those? Deeds of the flesh. And when that rises up in me, I am able to identify the kind of love I have. It is of the flesh. Same thing with joy. Fruit of the Spirit, joy. Instead of having an inner, abiding joy, I come to church and put on a happy face. Hello, everyone. and we call it the fruit of the spirit it could be as phony as the day is long peace we call that the fruit of the spirit that is peace is an inner settledness in the midst of unsettling external situations inner settledness in the midst of external unsettledness the counterfeit of that was very clear very often as Christians in an effort knowing that peace is a virtue peace is the thing we want to have in our church Peace is the thing we want to have in our family. In order to maintain an external peace, we forfeit real internal peace by having certain things you never talk about. Some families have a no-talk rule. Do you know that? Everybody knows it. It's never stated. Everybody knows that there's just certain things you can't talk about. There's this internal strife. There's this internal turning inside of me because I'm not free to deal with this thing. But you never talk about it, and then we call it peace. That isn't peace. That's a counterfeit. That is a deed of the flesh. The fruit of the Spirit that is peace is an inner settledness. And I am so settled and so at peace that there isn't anything I can't confront. There isn't anything I can't confront. So I have the same thing in patience. Patience was a misleading term. We saw that when it was just in the text. Patience is not just being able to wait for a train. Patience is being slow to anger. Being slow to anger. The counterfeit is obvious. What was it? Christians knowing that they should be slow to anger what they do is they repress their anger they pretend it isn't there they deny it and they call that a work of the spirit that is a work of the flesh and it leads to disease and destruction every time it's been interesting hasn't it to see that very often I have counterfeited the fruit of the spirit and it has resulted in my family and in my life and in our church some very serious disease fruit of the spirit is always different it's always supernatural and it's always healthy come now to the fruit of the Spirit the aspect of the fruit of the Spirit that is faithfulness I'm going to break it down into three parts if you're taking notes the first part is this the definition of faithfulness second part is this the foundation of faithfulness and third the proving of faithfulness let's get right to it the definition faithfulness okay let's just throw the word out I wish this was the kind of thing we do on Wednesday night where we just kind of talk about it back and forth what do you think of when you think of faithfulness roll it around in your mind what comes to mind faithfulness is Faithfulness is Faithfulness is reliability Right? Does that come? Faithfulness is dependability Faithfulness is regularity Faithfulness is trustworthiness Right? Okay? You got that? If I give you that as a definition of faithfulness There are some things that might come to mind I can think of faithful things I can think of faithful friends I have faithful friends You have faithful friends? There are faithful dogs. Some of you have a faithful dog. A little hound dog. And it's too stupid to go on its own way. It just is always faithful. It means what? It means it's regular. It means it's reliable. It means it's dependable. It's wonderful. Some of us have faithful husbands and faithful wives. Faithful cars that stir all the time. Most of us don't have one of those. Some of you do. Yellowstone Park has a faithful geyser. It's wonderful. We think of reliable, dependable in church context. In the issue of church things, we think of faithful people. In fact, with a sermon like this, the pastor should be coming to us and exhorting us to be what? Faithful people. Which means what? Reliable, dependable, trustworthy. Good virtues. I could get even more specific. We would extol the virtues. Telling people to be faithful people, we would extol the virtues of faithful giving. Ever heard a sermon on faithful giving? Absolutely. What does it mean? Give all the time. Give regularly. Give consistently. Also, faithful attenders. Important concept. Are you a faithful attender? Are you a faithful servant? Are you a faithful leader? And what we mean when we say that is regular, dependable, consistent, trustworthy. Now, I want you to know something. Generally, you can tell when I got my tongue in my cheek, and you're kind of snickering here and there, And you're all sitting here going, aha, he's got something on his sleeve, I can tell. You need to know something. Quite clearly, in the Word of God, the Word of God indicates that trustworthiness, reliability, dependability is an absolute sign of maturity. It is a sign of usefulness. People who are undependable, who are untrustworthy, who are unreliable, are not useful. Proverbs 25, 19. I'm having a love affair with the book of Proverbs right now. You'll have to forgive me for that. We're in Proverbs. And it is incredibly confrontive. Listen to this. Like a bad tooth and an unsteady foot is confidence in a faithless man in time of trouble. Think on that. It always paints pictures. Okay? Like a bad tooth and an unsteady foot is confidence in a faithless man in time of trouble. That's great. What it means is basically this. Inconsistent, unreliable people are worthless when the going gets rough. Inconsistent people are worthless when the going gets rough And guess what? As a church, as we begin to step out and grow And as we begin to move into a state A position that is consistently believing God for more I guarantee you it will get tough It will get tough And trustworthy people, reliable people Will make themselves known untrustworthy people unreliable people will get in the way you know scripture calls the spirit life a war and if we're moving and if we're growing the war will come and if you're not faithful you're like a bad tooth you ever have a toothache? everything in your whole life stops to take care of that ache it gums up the works it gets in the way you want to pull it out 1 Corinthians 4.2 says this It is required of a steward, first of all, to be found what? Gifted. That would be nice. Ingenious. That would be great. It is required, first of all, that he be energetic. That would be great. Creative. Wonderful. No. Those things are wonderful, and we look for people like that all the time. But it is required, first of all, to be dependable. Trustworthy. Faithful. That applies to many of us right now. As we continue to grow as a church and as the work begins to expand more and more, it is important that we have faithful people. But wait a minute. Now I'll give you what's up my sleeve. Something is missing in this. Something is missing in this. And I'll tell you why it's missing. I'll tell you why it's stuck in my craw. One of the things we've been doing all through this study of the fruit of the Spirit is we have been identifying counterfeits. And as I'm going through this and defining faithfulness as regularity and consistency and always being there, all of a sudden one of the things that begins to rise up in my mind is the very real possibility of a counterfeit. And it becomes real obvious when I just take the same concepts I gave you. Think of a faithful giver. What is a faithful giver? If what we mean by a faithful giver is one who gives regularly, who gives consistently, immediately my cynical mind begins to think of all the ways that can be counterfeited. And I'll tell you why. Because it dawns on me, and maybe on you, that it is absolutely, entirely possible for someone to give regularly and never exercise faith. Faithful. Oh yeah, faith is in there, isn't it? That word in there is faith, isn't it? Let me say it this way. David, how do you give? well, I give faithfully what does that mean? well, that means I give regularly and I give consistently the sermon thrust is this I should lean out over the pulpit at the end of the sermon and say are you a faithful giver? and you will respond this way I missed last week and maybe the response this morning if we just leave it right here would be this we'll leave this morning thinking oh, you know He really made some good points about faithfulness and dependability. And I'll tell you, I'm going to give more consistently. I missed a couple of weeks. If you leave feeling like that's what you need to do, then you have missed the point of what the fruit of the spirit of faithfulness is. You see, I could give regularly, and I could give consistently. I could give my money like clockwork, call that faithful, when in fact, for me, it might have absolutely nothing to do with faith. And believing God, trusting God as my resource, sensing the Spirit of God in me as He directs me to give, never even came into the picture. Picture. I hate that. Give me five years, I'll be okay. Never even came into the picture. didn't even enter my mind that I would pray about and seek God's direction and trust him fully as I give liberally and I give consistently. Oh yes, faithful people give consistently. Consistency is not the focus though. A faithful giver, faithful giving is more than regular. it is full of faith it is full of faith people who give and just do it because you know a lot of people give like this they give because they're supposed to give they give because it's a duty they give because it's a law it's a law it's a rule I mean listen Dave I pay my taxes I pay my bills I pay my tithe it's kind of in the same thing I just do it listen you call that regular giving okay call that don't you dare call that faithful giving faithful giving is faithful giving i wrote that in my notes like this faith dash full f-u-l-l full of faith giving you see the difference a faithful giver is more than regular he gives full of faith that god will supply his need that god will meet his need that god is his source you know what that means a faithful giver one who is full of faith in his giving looks at god as his source, trust the Holy Spirit to direct him where to give that money, and says, Spirit, as you're prompting me to give, I'm going to give. You know, an irony of people who are full of faith in their giving, the irony of faithful givers is that they do it regularly. They do it regularly. Even when they don't have the money, they say, Lord, you have said in your word to give the first fruits, and I'm going to give the first fruits, and I'm going to believe you for the rest. They give regularly, and they give consistently, and they give liberally. You know why? Because they believe God, that's why. Faithful givers are givers who give full of faith. Fruit of the Spirit is faithfulness. It goes way beyond being regular and on time. Think of faithful attenders. We talk, is he a faithful attender? Oh, yes, he's a faithful attender. What does that mean? It means he's here every Sunday morning, every Sunday evening, every Wednesday night, and everything in between. But I think you already know, as I've just developed this a little bit, that it is entirely possible to be here Sunday morning, Sunday evening, Wednesday night, everything in between, all your life, and never, ever exercise spirit-induced faith in God. To move, to work, to energize you, because what is flowing from their life is faithfulness. No, what is flowing from their life, even though they're regular, is fearfulness. bitterness, anger, smallness. You ever around a small person? Just petty. They're here every Sunday. Call them faithful. Don't ever call them faithful again. Don't ever call that faithful. Call it regular. Call it regular. Don't call it faithful. 2 Timothy 2.2, Paul said this, the things you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, I want you to do this. I want you to entrust them to faithful men who will then be able to teach others also. You know when I see that word faithful in there teach it to faithful men I begin to get the idea that Paul is speaking of something more than somebody who's always there sitting like a bump on a log. Tell you what you find a guy who's just always there sitting like a bump on a log and you pour your life into him. No those people are regular. Those people are there. That doesn't mean they're faithful. It doesn't mean they're full of faith. Regular people, consistent people who just do it because it's clockwork are a dime a dozen. Full of faith people are different. Paul said, I want you to find a person who is full of faith and you pour your life into him and he will reproduce other people who are full of faith. And he will enter into the war with you and he will storm the gates of hell with you. You don't just find a regular person. You find a full of faith person. You pour your life into him, and he'll storm the gates of hell with you. In fact, that is what I just said, is right in context with the passage in 2 Timothy 2.2. Because right after he tells Timothy to pour his life into people who are full of faith, he says this, now you get ready to endure hardship like a good soldier, and you get ready to fight the fight of faith. And what I want you to do is have people who are full of faith with you. Don't waste your time on anybody else. that's real confrontive stuff Matthew 25 14 through 30 Jesus is speaking of a parable of three servants they were all given talents you remember that one was given one one was given two one was given five the one who was given one took it and looked at it and says oh I'm going to be a faithful servant I'm going to be a faithful servant I'm going to protect this thing and I'm going to guard this thing and I'm going to just make sure nothing happens to this thing so he took it and he buried it in the ground and everybody goes oh, that's good. You are a faithful servant. No. You know what he was? He was consistent. He was regular. He protected it. He hoarded it. You know what God called him? Faithful. No. He called him wicked and lazy. You know what the faithful servants did? The faithful servants took what God had given them and they used it and they spent it and they went out on a limb believing God would increase it. And God came back to them and said, thou art what? Faithful. Regular? No. Full of faith. Full of faith. Big difference. Okay, that's the definition. It's really my whole sermon. I don't have anything else to say, but I've got to have an outline here today. Go through. I'm just kidding. First of all, the definition. Second of all, the foundation. The question I have to ask is this. You know, you sound like a big, you sound like the halftime pep talk thing you talk about all the time. You're just jacking us all up to really get us going to have faith. Go, go, go. I have to have a foundation for that. I have to have something to base. Why is it that I'm willing to go out on a limb? Why is it that I'm willing to really believe God for big things, really believe God for my giving, in my giving, in my coming, in my serving? The basis of my free giving, the reason for my active service, is that I listened to a tape by Norman Vincent Peale and Robert Shuler, and now I'll tell you, I really believe that inch by inch, everything's a cinch. You were supposed to laugh. Sorry. Thank you. positive thinking oh boy oh boy oh boy i think positive thinking is great but there has to be a basis for it right i mean i feel like i'm just grasping at straws of oh he's just a positive guy great about what about what the basis for the positive attitude the basis for confidence in the future for my giving, for my serving, for my coming, for my staying, is this. My faithful activity is based on the faithful character of God. God is faithful. I believe that. Because I believe that, I'm not afraid. God is faithful, and I believe that. And because I believe that, I'm not afraid. You know, the faithful people have fear. When they're called to do something that's beyond them, they have fear. Faithful people, people who are full of faith, do it anyway. They just do it anyway. Faithful people are not always wringing their hands. Faithful people have vision. People who are full of faith have vision. Ever wonder, why does that guy always have so much vision? How come that girl always has so much vision? Always thinking beyond. Always moving forward. Why is that? They're full of faith. That's why. And it's based on the faithfulness of God. Faithful people act. Why? Because they think they're so great. They think they're so great. No, it's because they believe that their God is so big. And they're faithful. They're full of faith. Remember when we were in Hebrews 11 and we talked about the definition of faith? Hebrews 11.1. The faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. Then we tried to work through that exegetically, and we came up with a definition that we could kind of understand. That sounds so poetic, but I really don't know what that means. Faith is, in the vernacular, not something that denies reality. Okay? Remember we talked about that. Very often people who look like they have faith are really irresponsible. They're always wanting to, like Don Quixote, you know, with their little windmills and always big dreams and big ideas, but they're off the wall. Faithful people are not out of touch with reality. They see the problems, they see the obstacles, but faith sees something more, right? Faith sees something else. Sees the problem, sees the obstacle, but it sees something else as well. It sees the faithfulness of God. That's what David did when he went to Goliath. David looked at Goliath and said, I am really tough. I can handle him. He didn't say that at all. He said, Goliath is huge. He is unbeatable. He is bigger than me, but God is bigger than him. The foundation for my faithfulness is the faithfulness of God. Same thing happened with Joshua and Caleb. I love that story. That's why we named our little guy Caleb. I love that story. All the spies went out and they spied out the land and they came back with a report that was accurate, right? It was accurate. What did they see? Huge walls, huge men. You know what? I love the way the Word of God describes it. They saw the land, and you know what happened? Their hearts melted. They had been given vision. They had been given a dream. God had called them to something beyond themselves. They saw an obstacle, and you know what happened? Their hearts melted, and they went back with an accurate report. We look like grasshoppers in their sight. We can't do it. Joshua when Caleb saw exactly the same thing, bring exactly the same report, a different conclusion. Ha! You're right. We do look like grasshoppers in their sight. They are huge. They are big. And our hearts melted too at first. But then I saw something else. I saw something more, and that is the faithfulness of God. And so I'm going to be faithful. I'm going to believe in that. I'm going to believe in him. So we're going. They didn't go. Which is another lesson in itself. You can have faithful people leading the way, and if God's people don't want to come, you won't. People wandered in the wilderness for years. Have you ever been around a faithful person, somebody who's full of faith? I've been around people who deny reality and call it faith. They don't do anything for me. I have been around people who, when they talk of faith, it feels like a weak thing. They go, oh, yes, we're trusting God. It feels weak to me. I can't even put my finger on it, but it doesn't feel full of faith. It doesn't feel confident. It doesn't feel like God's inducing them in something. There are other people that when I'm around them, I feel like I'm in the presence of the Lord, and there is a faithfulness. A person like that for me is a guy named Leanne Gamas. You don't know him. There are many people here who do this for me, but this is something particular. It happened when I had a chance to go home to Chicago for Christmas. guys named Leon Gombas. He's my father's age. And for some reason, way back in college, he took some sort of interest in what God was doing in my life and the ministry was calling me to. So he's always kind of trying to catch up with my life and what's going on. So I'm sharing with him all these kinds of things. What's interesting to me too, he's also an elder in my father's church. So we really know each other real well. What's interesting is this, that our church, Open Door, is really going through some things right now in terms of growth that that church went through years ago stepping out believing God beyond ourselves and he listened to me describe some of the things we're going through and some of the fears I have financial the step with Joyce coming and kind of beyond us and boy boy yeah we're believing God you know kind of tentatively believing God you know maybe we're believing God if it all works out I believe God you know and I remember him listening to me as I was describing this and I try as hard as I can to be real with him. So I'm kind of sharing the pain with him and he starts smiling at me. Okay. If some people started smiling at me, I would feel like, oh boy, here's another guy going to deny reality and give me this big pep talk. But there's something in him that feels like faith. He looked at me, he's put his arm around me and he smiled. He says, David, God is faithful. God is faithful. This small potatoes. You know what happened to me when I got plugged back into the faithfulness of God, I began to get confident again because we're going to make it. No, because God is faithful. God is faithful in his call. We need to be reminded sometime. 1 Corinthians 1.9 says, God is faithful through whom he called me into fellowship with his son, who shall also confirm me in the end to the end. Not only that, but God is faithful to present me blameless before the Lord in the day of the Lord. I believe that. I believe that. You know what that results in me? Confidence. He's faithful in his call. He's faithful in his working. 1 Corinthians, 1 Thessalonians 5, 23, and 24. May the God of peace sanctify you entirely. The God of peace will sanctify you entirely and make your spirit and your soul and your body be preserved complete without blame. Then he says this, faithful is he who calls you and he will bring it to pass. God's faithful. I believe that. That makes a difference in how I live. He's faithful in his protection. Hebrews 13, 5. I will never leave you nor forsake you. You know the result of that? The result of that is this. Therefore, I can confidently say, God is my helper. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? Confidence. In how strong I am. Not at all. John 10, 29. My father gave you to me. Oh, I love this verse. Jesus is saying this. My father gave you to me as a gift, and no one will be able to pluck you out of my hand. You know what that does to me? Confidence. 1 John 4.4 Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. That's the foundation of my faith. In his provision he's faithful. Philippians 4.19 My God shall supply all your need. You believe that? If you do, that's going to be the foundation for your giving. If you really believe that he's your provider, that he's your source, then what in the world would you be holding on to anything for? I can't imagine, unless you don't believe it. and all his promises concerning salvation believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shall be saved in sonship i love this let's just end with this one philippians 4 6 and because you are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into our hearts crying abba father therefore you are no longer a slave but a son do you believe that if you believe that it's going to change how you live sure you believe that everybody believes that every verse i read everybody goes yeah i believe that. And for some of you, the awareness of those promises of God, the faithfulness of God, has produced in you a faithful life. A life that is characterized by fullness of faith. Everything you do is based on faith. Everything you do is laced with faith. And it shows. Because God is faithful, and you have believed that, and it's changed your living. Others of you believe that. You believe all that stuff. In fact, if somebody said, these things are true, God isn't faithful, you'd go, what do you mean God isn't faithful? God is too faithful. And you'd read them all the verses. But you know what? For many people, many Christians, it has never, the believing those things has never produced a life that is full of faith. Why is that? Why is that that some people can confirm those promises and it is the blood pumping through their veins, other people can confirm those promises but it's never really resulted in faithful living. I'll tell you why it happens that way is because some people prove God's faithfulness and some people don't. Point three, proving the faithfulness of God. Some people never ever do prove God faithful. They just believe that He is. But they never go out on a limb and live in any kind of way that would indicate that they need God because they just live in an area where they are totally in control, whether it be in giving, whether it be in serving, they never give themselves fully in any area. They live constantly in the realm of what they are in control of. Call it faith. It isn't faith. It isn't faith. Proving the faithfulness of God. To grasp this, there's four things, four characteristics of faith I want you to grasp real quickly. Faith as an intellectual exercise. As I go through this real quickly, you're going to see the picture develop. Faith as an intellectual exercise. Faith as an intellectual exercise is this. It's believing that certain things are true. Okay? Believing that certain things are true. That's important. It's real important. John 8, 24. If you, Jesus says, if you don't believe that I am the Son of God, you'll die in your sins. It's important that we believe certain things. But a lot of people believe that. A lot of people believe that. James 2, 19 says, you say you believe in God, you say that God is one, good for you. So does Satan. Big deal. there's another kind of faith. Intellectual exercise? Faith as a relational experience. Faith as a relational experience. Let me say it this way. It would be entirely possible for me to, several years ago, have looked at a girl named Bonnie Nichols, who eventually became Bonnie Johnson, my wife, and say this. That girl is the most beautiful, attractive girl in the whole world. Am I getting points? Huh? Okay. This has all sorts of strings. Okay. She is the most beautiful, attractive girl in the whole world. She would be lots of fun to live with. She would be lots of fun to spend my life with. And I believe that she loves me too. And if I made a commitment to her, we would be happy ever after. But all of that belief that those things would happen doesn't make her my wife. Doesn't make her my wife. Not until I say, on the basis of what I say I believe about you, I am willing to commit myself to you and to you alone, has my faith turned into a relational experience. Scripture teaches this deeply. That certain things must be believed. But it also teaches this, that true faith commits itself fully to what it says is true. Faith. As an intellectual exercise, Faith is a relational experience. Faith is a volitional choice. Romans 9.33, quoting the prophet Isaiah, says this. He's speaking of Jesus, and he's speaking of Jesus as the rock. Remember? And it's speaking of some people who will stumble over that rock, and people who will stumble over that rock means this. They will never get it. They will never see him as Savior. It will be an enigma to them. Eventually what will happen, that rock will turn around and crush them, but other people will look at Jesus as the rock, and they'll do something else entirely. They will look at that rock, and they will build their whole life on that rock. But they have a choice. They can either stumble over it, or they can build their life on it. Choose now this day who you will serve. Decide. Faith is believing that certain things are true. Believing in, relationally, believing on. I take my stand here. This is it. It is also a continual exercise. And this is where I wrap it up. Because this is where I believe full of faith people are coming out. This is where the fruit of the Spirit begins to show its face. See, there are a lot of people who believe that God is faithful. Anybody here not believe that God is faithful? Maybe there are. Raise your hand. Lots of people believe that God is faithful. Lots of Christians believe that God provides their needs, God will protect them, God will work in them. Oh yes, I believe that. And in their whole life, they never step out and find out if that's really true or not because they constantly live their lives, as I said before, within the context of, within the realm of just exactly what it is that they think they can handle. They look at their resources, they say, aha, that's as far as I can go, and they constantly live on the basis of their own resources. Call it faith. Again, don't call it faith. proving God faithful you know what you'll never know God is faithful until you put your faith in God in such a way that he has to show himself faithful he will never prove himself faithful to you until you do it until you step out until you are in a position where the only way you're going to deal with that situation is that God does something in you or through you or through someone else or collectively in the body that when we're done, we go, look what I did. No, it was so far beyond us. We say, look what God did. He is faithful. Churches live that way, don't they? Churches go through their entire existence proclaiming Christ, proclaiming faith, proclaiming redemption, thinking we're faithful, constantly living within the realm of just exactly what they can handle and wonder why there is no power. And wonder why they don't grow. But it's safe. You never have any tension. Some people in their giving never prove God faithful. Because they only give within the realm of what makes sense to them. What does God need to be faithful for? You got it all figured out. You've never given a nickel beyond what you just, you're paying your little bill. mentioned before regular giving churches are full of regular givers what makes a church grow what makes a church move is faithful givers full of faith givers full of faith attenders people who are coming regularly people who are coming and when they come they're full of faith that God is working that God will work that God will use them faithful servants same thing faithful servants faithful servant is someone who's there on time yeah sure sure dependable if you're not dependable you're like a sore tooth but it's more than that you know what creates that dependability faith faith that what that what that god will use me that i am a son that i am an heir that i have certain gifts and i'm going to find out where they can be used as a church we are in a position right now where we are real excited i'm real excited because of the the coming of a minister of Christian education, we have been stretched beyond what we think we're capable of in the flesh. Guess what? We are. Wonderful. And you know what we need to make it? Faithful people. Regular? No, not regular. Faithful. Faithful people. People who are full of faith. And I want to tell you something else. You know what? I sometimes think if I was to share with you the vision that I have for where we're going, it would scare the pants off you. but see when I think of where we are right now and where we're going in terms of faith I'm not just thinking of bigness at all, I'm thinking of faith of what kinds of things we're going to have to believe God so God can prove himself faithful to us I see these kinds of steps and these kinds of moves as being a consistent part of life some of you are going, if we get over this one boy, I'll tell you, we're going to have to tame this thing down and when we do, we'll die God is faithful and we need to continually be in a position where we are proving him faithful by believing him for things that are beyond us to do some of you are tired service what's a faithful servant? I mentioned this just a little bit ago some of you are real discouraged in what you're doing some of you elders are exhausted some of you teachers are fed up some of you Awana workers have just had it right up to here with those little kids some of you involved in music and teaching other sorts of things and the message this morning is be faithful and you leave this morning thinking okay I'll hang in there again and I'm gonna I won't give up I'll keep trying hard you'll miss the point if that's what you think faithful servants are people who serve how? full of faith believing what? believing that God will use them when I really believe that God's using me I feel great about what I'm doing sometimes I don't see a lot of stuff neither do you and I'm always oh boy flash of insight you know what that puts me in touch with when I'm doing all sorts of stuff I'm serving the Lord but I don't see a lot of results and I want to quit because of that that immediately put me in touch with the real reason I'm serving you get it the real reason I'm serving is so I get all this stuff coming around me and so I see all these things. There's all sorts of strings on that. That isn't about God in me. Galatians 6, 9, life verse for me, says this, David, don't lose heart in doing good. Why? For in due time you'll reap if you don't grow weary. Full of faith workers are people who faithfully work, believing that they are sons, they are daughters, God's at work in them, and so they give. and they come and they serve and they lead. And it's natural. You know why? Because the fruit of the Spirit is people who are full of faith. Faithfulness. Let's pray. This is exciting, Lord. I thank you so much for your word. I thank you for how clear it is, how practical it is. I pray that you will reveal to us, to me, areas in my life where I am living within the context of just exactly what I can handle. Stretch us, Father, in this area of faithfulness by your Spirit. Give us vision and courage to see a God who is faithful in every dimension of our lives. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
