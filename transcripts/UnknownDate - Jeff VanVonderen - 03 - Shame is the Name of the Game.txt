So this session is about the characteristics of dysfunctional families, of shame-based families. And just to reiterate once again, when I say shame, there's a difference between guilt and shame. Guilt is an emotional response or a signal about our behavior. And shame is more of a sense about ourselves as a person. So there's a difference in that shame cuts a lot deeper. and I really think that it's not a helpful thing. There are some authors who say that there is such a thing as good shame and then bad shame, I suppose, but I don't think that shame is a helpful thing in any case because it really cuts to who we are as a person. Shame is a sense or a way of thinking about ourselves that says we're defective, we're bad, we're lacking, we're worthless, something's wrong with us. And what it does is it is able to get people to act either in negative ways or positive ways. Different kinds of behaviors come out of shame. And a lot of times, you know, we think that underneath the surface of the behaviors, there might be good things when really it might be shame that's motivating that behavior. And I wanted to illustrate that, first of all, as I talk about shame-based systems. In people's lives, there's what I call a soil of shame. And the soil is just the messages that we have about ourselves that say that something's wrong with us. And I don't think that anybody escapes this. I think that people are bombarded with messages of shame and so they have some degree or other of this kind of sense about themselves. And then different things can hook that or find that in people. A lot of times when it seems to us that somebody is shaming us or saying a shaming thing to us, they're not really shaming us. We've just learned to hear things in a shaming way. And really what they said or did more or less found the shame that we already have versus sent us a new message of that. But anyway, what happens with the soil is it grows different kinds of plants. And one of the plants that it grows would be addiction. And I'm not going to get into that a lot today. but addiction would be one of the plants and if you can look at it like this it's a set of behaviors or a course of action that someone takes on the outside to try to medicate or make okay on the inside this painful sense of being defective and so when a person is in an addictive course of action it's like there's this thing that they're pursuing and so they're chasing it and chasing it and as they're pursuing this they invest other areas of their lives and pay prices in other areas of their lives to get this, and as they get closer to it, the investment goes up and the equity that they have invested goes up, which makes it harder to let go of this. And then when they get it, they have so much invested and they've paid so many prices that you come to them and say, quit doing this, and it's hard for them to quit doing it because it would mean that they lose all their investment. Plus there's other things like delusion and denial. But the point is that as they grow this plant that I'll call addiction, As they grow this plant out of this soil, it bears fruit. This plant grows fruit that drops into the lives of people around. So if any of you have grown up in an alcoholic family, for instance, what you'll have noticed is that you get messages about you that are shaming at the same time that this person is chasing this addiction to try to fix their shame. And so the messages that you get are that what you feel doesn't matter and what you think doesn't matter, and you're not important enough for me to be around, you know, because I'm over here chasing this, and if you think there's a problem, you're the problem, so shut up. So not only does this addiction then grow out of the soil of a person's shame, but it kind of splatters shame into the soil of other people's lives. And so it's not just affecting one person. It's a leavening kind of thing like we talked about in the last session. Another plant that grows out of this, it would be, I would call family violence, and I really believe that violence is more about shame than it is about anger, although we kind of talk about people who are violent as being really angry. I think it's more about shame and the rage that you see with a violent person is more about their response to shame than it is about being really, really angry. And so to illustrate this, let's say that I'm a dad that has a rule that says good dads don't have kids that act weird in grocery stores. So I have this rule, good dads don't have kids that act weird in public. And then my kids act weird in public. Well, you see, the truth about their behavior is that they're making a lousy choice in public. It's not okay for them to be doing what they're doing, and it's okay for me to discipline them and teach them about this and give them consequences if necessary because it's their job to learn how to live in public, and it's my job to help them do their job. So they can't be destroying property and all that kind of stuff. So I discipline them. But if good dads don't have kids that act that way in public, then you see, I'm not just disciplining them for their well-being or their benefit. I'm trying to fix them or get them to line up in a nice little straight line of kids so that when my kids are okay, I'm okay. Because I hear their behavior as an indictment on me as a parent, not just as a poor choice of behaviors on their part. Well, for some dads, it's so important to them to get their kids to act a certain way. they will hurt them to get them to act that way, that would be this plant then of violence. For some husbands, it's so important to them that their wives act a certain way that they hurt their wives to try to get them to act that way or to punish them for not acting that way, you see. Then that's this plant called violence. But at the same time then that this plant is growing out of my shame because I hear their behavior as an indictment on me, at the same time that this is growing out of my shame, The message that I'm sending to my wife and my kids is, once again, your feelings don't matter, and your needs don't matter, and what you think doesn't matter, and if you notice this, you're the problem. So shut up, and I can do this to you because I'm bigger, faster, louder, stronger. Male, because the Bible says I'm in charge. You know, whatever ways I use to justify this. But see, if I'm doing behaviors to you because I'm bigger, faster, stronger, louder, then that must mean that you're weaker, slower, you know, less important, those kinds of things. So there's a shaming message that comes here, and you can't do anything about this because I'm in charge. So there's a plant then that comes out of my life that drops some fruit into your life and in the soil of your life. That's why you come out of this family system struggling with shame kinds of issues. Well, these are very negative plants, and so there's another plant that some people grow, and that would be the plant of getting good grades, for instance. Now, I teach a course at college, and one of the things that I've noticed in teaching college students is that some people grow grades on the outside to try to be okay on the inside. They measure their sense of acceptability or value as a person based on the grades. And so when that happens, if you give them a little negative, a little minus sign instead of a plus sign, they freak out because this isn't just about academic behavior to them. Now you see, grades are really just a measure of academic behavior. They're not a measure of value as a person. They just tell a story on the outside of what kind of activity you did during the course. That's all. But for some people, it's a measure of their acceptability or some sense of value as a person. So you give them a minus instead of a plus, and they just go nuts. And then they call me up on the phone, and they plead and beg and bribe and make deals and all this kind of stuff, trying to get me to change this minus into a plus because then they'll be okay. It's just having the tangible, you know, like all it is is a little stupid line of ink on a piece of paper, but it has so much power, you see, to some people, and it has so much power that I even get calls from their parents, you know, in Wichita or Sacramento or something, calling me to beg me to change the grade from a minus to a plus because not only is this a reflection on the value of the student, but the parents even feel like it's a reflection on them. So now we don't just have students getting okay from grades, we have parents getting okay from students' grades. And see, the truth is that this just isn't that powerful, but for some people it is. Another plant that people grow, very, very common in our culture, is their job. Now, you know, I think that jobs are good, and you should have a job, and you can get a career, and you can make a lot of money and get a title and get a promotion and do what you're going to do. But some people grow jobs out here to fix their sense of inadequacy or whatever on the inside. And if you're getting okay from your job, then what will happen is that you might end up chasing and chasing and chasing that job, you know, because when you finally get it, it's not big enough and you have to get a bigger one. And when you get the raise, that's not big enough and you have to get a bigger one. And you end up paying prices in your life just the same as the person who's chasing chemicals over here on the other side. And I have talked to people in my office who report the same kind of, every bit as much of feelings of defectiveness or abandonment or neglect from growing up in families where people have chased jobs to try to fill themselves up, as I have from people who have grown up in alcoholic families, you see. Because what this does is it splatters shame in the lives of the people around and says, you're not important. You know, this is what's important. and so I'm going to do this, and I don't have time for you. But the problem with this is that if you get your life from your job, you see, then what happens is that you have to do, you choose to do things that maybe are dishonest or unethical to try to keep your job or enhance it or things like that. Some people do that. Or if you lose your job, you go off the deep end instead of just finding another job. The highest heart attack rate for men in our country is the six months after retirement, which to me means that when you lose your job, you lose your life. And when you lose your life, you lose your life. Your job disappears, your life disappears like that. So it's not about that jobs are good or bad. It's that are you doing the job for what jobs are for, or are you acting like jobs have power on the outside to make people valuable and acceptable on the inside? But I have to tell you that when you get a job evaluation, and it's about your performance, and there's red marks on it and things like that, it's hard to realize that that's just about job performance. It really does feel like it's about you. And those of you who have ever been fired or laid off, it feels like it's about you, something's wrong with you, not just about job performance or the state of the economy, those kinds of things. In our culture, we're so job-oriented that men, for sure, in our culture, lose their families a lot longer before they lose their jobs in our culture. Jobs are kind of the last to go because this is such a measure of our sense of self that we have to keep this at all costs. And then sometimes the church comes along and says, well, don't grow any of those plants. Teach a Sunday school class and give 10% and get perfect attendance pins and then you'll be okay. Well, Teach a Sunday school class. It's okay. But if you're teaching a Sunday school class on the outside in order to feel like an okay person on the inside, then I want you as far away from my kids as possible because you will not be there for my kids. My kids will be there for you, and they'll have to line up in a nice little straight, spiritual-looking Sunday school class so you can feel like a good teacher. See, teachers are supposed to be there for students, not the other way around. And if you're giving money because you think that you're going to fix what's going on on the inside and gain a sense of approval or okayness on the inside, then that's the wrong reason to give money. The right reason would be that you support on the outside what you support on the inside. So if what's going on in your church is something you agree with and God tells you to support it, support it. It's inconsistent for a believer to support something on the inside and not support it on the outside, so support it. But if you're supporting it on the outside, even though you disagree with it on the inside because you have a sense that you're going to lose points with God or somehow you're going to be less acceptable or whatever. That would be the wrong reason to do the right behavior. You can't fix the soil by fixing the plants. But a lot of people try to do that, but it can't be done. You can't fix the soil by fixing the plants. You fix the plants by fixing the soil. When the soil is different, it grows different plants, you see. And so now what I want to do is I want to show you the way that for some people, for most people that I've dealt with, how the soil actually gets in their lives. Because what relationships do is they kind of take this needy person, you know, little newborn baby needy person, and then they start putting things in their lives. And so for some people, if it's a shame-based relationship, then it puts shame in their lives. And once again, Shame-based, when I say that, what I mean by that is relationships that are based on shame, where shame is the underlying current in the relationship, and it's the glue that holds people together. It's the force that generates the activity, and if it wasn't for shame, people wouldn't do even the right stuff in this family system. The first characteristic of a shame-based system is that it shames people. That seems kind of obvious, I suppose, But what I mean by this is that this is out loud shaming. In other words, there are ten characteristics I'm going to talk about here, but this is the only one out of the ten where it's actually directly out loud. The other nine happen, but they're more subtle. They're more covert kinds of ways of shaming. And this is the only overt way in which people get shamed. So this would be shame on you, for instance, would be an overt way of shaming someone. but name-calling does that. You're stupid, you're an idiot, you knucklehead, things like that. Comparing one person to the other person is an out-loud way of shaming because what it does is it says to the first person, I don't like you, I don't approve of you, but I would if you performed the way this other person performs, if you looked like them. Then, you know, you'd have this. So there's a kind of way of shaming there. So anyway, this is the only one that's out-loud. When this one happens, you can spot it. If you're in a restaurant and you hear a parent do this to a child or a husband do this to the wife or a wife to the husband, you can tell that it happened. It's very obvious, and you can tell it was a comment about them as a person. And a lot of times when the person receives this, you can tell that they received it because they respond a certain way. A lot of times they lower their eyes because it's about them and they've been seen now in a diminished way, so they want to disappear a little bit. The second kind of dynamic in a shame-based system is that shame-based systems tend to be very performance-oriented. And the reason this is is because... Remember in the previous session, I told you that guilt is about behavior and shame is about us as people, but the problem is that those two things get mixed up and we're given messages that not only do behaviors have the power to condemn us or shame us or make statements about us as a person but they also have the power to vindicate us and push away messages of shame in that system. That's incorrect thinking, I believe. I think that really behaviors and people are separate from one another. But in a system where they're mixed up, you see, then performance is given, it's promoted as the way to erase shaming messages or at least prevent them from coming in the first place. So this system tends to be very much about performing and doing it right and living up to a standard and meeting up to someone's expectations and tiptoeing around through your life just right so that somebody else is going to approve of you or at least not disapprove of you too violently. And the focus then is not about affirming people. It's about affirming behaviors if and when you finally do them. So what that promotes then is a sense of parents being able then to get their sense of value from the performance of their kids. It's almost like a chicken and the egg thing. Not only do they push performance because they get their sense of value from their kids, but then when their kids buy into that and start performing, then it allows them to get their sense of value from their kids and actually tells a lie. The kids are telling a lie to the parents because they're actually saying with their performance that I can't perform well enough to make you, Mom and Dad, okay, which I'm not, but it kind of feeds on itself and it's a circular kind of thing. I frankly think that it's really easy to measure ourself by our performance because we can see our performance. That's why there's so many performance-oriented Christian books out there and Christian seminars and things like that is because we're asked as believers to get our sense of value and acceptance in life by faith from someone's performance that you can't see, which is the Lord's on the cross. And it's frankly just easier to make a list of all the things we're supposed to do and then check off the things on the list that we're doing okay. Then we can always tell how we're doing based on us. But the problem with that is that you either end up more shamed because you look at the list and you're not doing so well on the list, or you look at the list and you're doing pretty well on the list and you end up self-righteous, neither of which is God's plan for believers. The third characteristic of shame-based systems is that they have what I call unspoken rules. And this just means that there's all kinds of rules that govern the system, but they're never said out loud because if they were said out loud, they would look as inappropriate or as goofy as they really are. So they're not spoken, but they're there, and they have an incredible amount of power, and a lot of times you don't even know that they're there until you break them. So as long as you're following these rules, you don't even know that there's a rule there. But then you break it, even by accident, because you don't know what the rule is, and so then you find out that there was a rule there all along. The reason they're unspoken is because they sound inappropriate to say them out loud. For instance, in a church setting, when you come to the door and the greeter greets you, you would never hear this. I don't think you'd ever hear this when you went to visit a church. I don't think the greeter would ever come up to you and say, okay, now look, at this church, just make sure that you never disagree with anything that the pastor says because if you do, you'll be blacklisted and you'll never be able to do anything in the ministry and you'll never be asked to do anything, so just keep quiet and don't disagree. See, the greeters would never say that, but I'll bet that there are people here who experience churches like that and you went there for a while where that rule was, not knowing that that rule was there, and then you found out that there was a rule there because you broke the rule. But before you broke it, you didn't even know. And that's because it's unspoken, and when I say it out loud, it sounds as inappropriate as it is. So we can't say these out loud, but they still have a lot of power and they still kind of run the place. The most powerful, I think, and damaging and maybe overriding unspoken rule is what I call a can't-talk rule. And the can't-talk rule basically says don't talk about stuff. It says the problem's not the problem. You're the problem for saying there's a problem, which means shut up. There wasn't any problem here before you showed up and started shooting off your mouth, so shut up. I mean, what is wrong with you? So it kind of insinuates that saying it causes it. Before you said it, we didn't have it, but you said it, and now you've caused it. And there's a whole branch of or a whole group of Christians that not only do that within systems, but in their own life. they believe that if they say something, it makes it happen. And that's really kind of like rubbing rabbit's feet. It's pretty superstitious to think that saying something has the power to make it happen. Only God does that. God's the one who speaks things and they happen. We're the one who notice things. But in this system, if you notice it, you're the problem, so shut up. Actually, there are three reasons why you have to have a can't-talk rule in a shame-based system. And the first rule is three functions, I guess. The first reason is because, now watch this, if my sense of value and acceptance is based on my behavior, see, because I am not perfect and because I don't always perform, even though I wish I did, okay, but I don't, but my sense of value and acceptance is based on my performance, then when I don't perform, which is going to happen, okay, I'm not going to perform all the time, you can't talk about it. Because if you talk about it, then that finds my shame about it. So you can't talk about it. So what it does is it puts a facade around me that keeps up the illusion that I actually can perform well enough to keep my sense of value going because that's what I need to do. So the first reason is it says that you can't talk about it because it finds my shame as the power person in this system. Second reason why you have to have this is because if I can't prevent you from talking about it by having a big enough rule about that, then at least I'll make you the problem for talking about it. So if I can't keep you quiet, then I will make you the problem for not being quiet. So either way, it pushes it away from me, do you understand? The problem isn't that I did this, the problem is that you talked about me doing this. And so you're the problem. You know, if Anna and I are married, and I slug her, and she calls the cops, and I go to jail, why did I go to jail? Because she called the cops. No, because I slugged her, and that's against the law in Minnesota and every other state in the union. But what I'm going to do is I'm going to somehow send her the message and even maybe recruit people around her to tell her that the reason why I went to jail is because she called the cops. Because, you see, she's this disloyal, unsubmissive wife who has ruined my ministry and subjected me to public ridicule. Well, whose behavior ruined my ministry and subjected me to public ridicule? My behavior. But what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell her that she's the problem because, you see, Anna, the problem isn't that I slugged you. The problem is that you noticed. See, if you just wouldn't have noticed... Now, see how ridiculous that is? But that's why this kind of stuff is under the surface. It's unspoken because when you start saying this out loud, then it sounds as ludicrous as it is. The problem isn't that I hit you. The problem is that you noticed. And if Anna buys that, see, then she won't call the cops. and if she doesn't call the cops, then I can keep hitting her. And that's what unspoken rules do, is they protect the shame of the system. Those of you who grew up in dysfunctional systems know how much heat you would have taken if you'd have gone out and talked about it outside the system. You know, and what a disgrace you are and how you've brought shame. And, you know, you didn't bring shame. What you did was you exposed the shame. Shame was already there, and all you did was turn a light on. Turning a light on the problem doesn't make the problem be there. If you're all doing a bunch of nasty things in here and it's pitch black and I come in the back of the room and flip the light switch on, I didn't make it be there. I mean, there you are, but I didn't make that be there. I just showed that it was there. And what you're going to do is mumble and grumble and holler at me and somehow try to make me feel like I'm the problem. And if I buy that, I'll go, okay, turn the light off, and then you can go back to doing nasty stuff. The light doesn't cause the truth to be there. It just exposes the truth that is there. and I think that it would be good for a lot of us for everybody to change that rule to more of a rule that says the truth is never the problem the problem is always the problem the truth is never the problem talking about the problem is not the problem the problem is the problem seems so obvious but when you get shamed shamed for noticing stuff and talking about stuff It's hard to break out of that. These rules have a lot of power. How many of you came from a family system or a church system that had a rule out loud now, not an unspoken rule, but an out loud rule that said, the Bible is the bottom line authority. Anybody had that rule? This is what we care about. We care about the Bible. This is what we rely on. Here's the bottom line. Anybody like that? Okay, now I'm not talking to the rest of you now. I'm just talking to the people who raised your hands. The spoken rule says, Ephesians 4.25, therefore laying aside falsehood, speak truth each one of you with his neighbor, for we are members of one another. So what the written rule says is, don't lie to each other, tell the truth to each other. Laying aside falsehood, speak truth each one of you with his neighbor, for we are members of one another. Don't lie, do tell the truth. That's what the spoken, that's what the written word says. Now, those of you who raised your hand, how many of you also had kind of an unspoken rule in your family that said nice is better than honest? Okay, now those of you who just raised your hand that had both of those rules, how many of you, nice is better than honest, won? That was the more powerful rule. Okay, well, see, I thought that we cared about what the Bible said. See how powerful these things are? See, we do care about what the Bible says, but these unspoken things have so much power that actually we end up passing them on to our next relationships unless we realize we have them and break them on purpose. There are some rules that we live by that we don't even know we're living by because, once again, we get so good at living by them, we don't even know they're there unless we break them. And then we pass them right on to our kids and the people we're around, and we don't even know we're doing that. And part of the recovery with this is realizing what rules you grew up with or that you had in previous relationships and putting them out here and speaking them, putting them out on the table and saying, okay, we had a rule that said this. Do I want that rule? No, it's a goofy rule. See, when you put them out in the air, when you air them out, they look stupid. They look dysfunctional and shaming. Do I want that rule? No. Then I have to make a point to break that rule on purpose in my present relationships so that those rules don't govern through generations of relationships. Another one of these rules, a category of unspoken rules would be a can't win rule. And the can't win rule are two rules that contradict each other rolled up into one rule. Now those of you who are in the ministry here of some form or another, we have a rule in the ministry that says we're here to serve God. So over here is the rule that says serve God. Do what God wants you to do, okay? And then we also have this rule over here that says don't make anybody unhappy. Well, see, you can't do that. You can't if you serve God, somebody's going to be unhappy. And I'm not saying use that as a license so that I'm serving God so that's to you. Who cares what you think? I'm not saying that. Because in my heart I really don't want anybody to be unhappy and I really want to serve God both of those things. But what I found out in the last 17 years is you can't do it. Because if you follow one, you're going to break the other. And if you follow the other one, you're going to break the first one. And now remember, you're in a system where performance has all the power to generate the messages. And so if you're in a system where you have two rules and you can't follow one of them, what's the message that you get if you don't? Shame. Something's wrong with you. How many of you had a rule in your family that said honesty is the best policy? That would be a spoken rule. Honesty is the best policy. Like that. Tell the truth. It's good to tell the truth. And then we have this other rule that says, you know, if so-and-so calls, tell him I'm not here. Well, see, you can't do that. If you follow one, you break the other, and if you follow the other one, you break the first one, and in a system where you're not following the rules, you always end up shamed then. And so that's how this works. You end up shamed either way. Always tell the truth. You know, honesty is the best policy, but when we go over to so-and-so's house, pretend that you like the food even though you don't eat it and shut up, you know. And, you know, one time we had our nephew with us, visiting us for the summer, and this is a guy who eats like I've never seen. I have four daughters, so I just forgot what it's like for having guys, you know. But he just ate like a fiend, you know. He ate like there was no tomorrow, and he didn't gain any weight either. And I even, I remember that part, you know. I don't know if you can relate to this, But when I graduated from high school, I was the same height as I am right now, and I weighed 155 pounds. So I've gained a lot of weight because what happens is that your metabolism changes. But when you're 15 years old and you're running around doing everything you do, you can eat like crazy. And I think that if I had four sons like this instead of four daughters, we'd be in the poorhouse because I can't even relate to it. So we're sitting down at supper one night, And we're having pork chops and mashed potatoes and, you know, asparagus, or I don't remember what it was. And so we're going around the table, and my nephew says, I'm not hungry. And I just never heard that come out of his mouth. I just couldn't even believe it, you know. So I said, really, you're not hungry? He said, no, I'm not hungry. Okay, so we're all eating and stuff like that. And, you know, he's sitting there and kind of looking around. And pretty soon he says, well, you know, come to think of it, I would have some mashed potatoes. So he takes some mashed potatoes, you know, about this many mashed potatoes. Well, I'll have some of those green beans, too, or whatever it was. And so he takes some green beans, you know. And then one of my daughters says to him, you don't like pork chops, do you? And he said, no, I don't. And another daughter said, well, that would have been okay to say that. No thanks, I don't like pork chops. And then Holly said, you know, it's okay for me to cook pork chops and you not to like them. That's okay. It's not about me, it's about your taste buds and where you're at with pork chops and stuff like that. You don't have to... And he said, in my family, I was taught that if I'm ever at somebody else's house and I don't like what they're having, I'm supposed to tell them I'm not hungry. And then my youngest daughter, who was pretty young at the time, said, well, that would be a lie. And it would be a lie, you understand? It would be a lie. But, see, evidently, there's this idea that we have to protect the self-esteem of somebody by eating stuff or else pretending we're not hungry for stuff. We could never just say, I don't like it or no thank you. And so we just said, you know, well, if you want to do that every other place in the whole world, you can do that. But here, you can even do that here. But here, you don't have to do that. You could see, no, thank you, I don'e like it, if you didn't like something. Because the problem is that he didn't like pork chops. You understand? Talking about it is not the problem. You know, mentioning it's not the problem. The issue is not even a problem. It's just the issue. The issue Is that he didn't like pork chops. Admitting it is not the problem. You understand? But he was taught that saying something caused the problem. And so I also know that in his family, they put a very high premium on honesty and telling the truth and being straight and all this kind of stuff, you see. But then there's this other thing that tells you, yeah, but under certain circumstances, you know, lie. Well, see, if we said, okay, kids in our family, we really care about the truth more than anything, except sometimes it's okay to lie, that would sound goofy, right? So we don't say that, but that just is kind of there, and you find out it's there if you ever tell the truth when you weren't supposed to. You break that rule, then you find out. Okay, and then the other kind of unspoken rules, so we have can't talk rules, can't win rules, and then there's all these other kind of rules that fit in this generic kind of category, which I couldn't think of a clever name for, so I just call it generic unspoken rules. And I'm just going to give you a bunch of them, and maybe we'll just do it in the form of a test. So if you ever experienced this rule in a family system or in relationships or church or something like that, Just raise your hand. Just put your hand up quickly and take it down so we get a sense of what's going on here with these kinds of rules. I'm just going to list them. Here's a rule that says what's real doesn't matter. How things look is what matters. Okay? Now, most people raise their hands, you see, but see, did anybody in your family sit down with you and say, okay, kids, family meeting. Now, get this straight. In this family, we don't care about what's real. We just care about how things look. Okay? There. See, if you say it out loud, it looks goofy. Understand? So nobody says it out loud, but it's under the current. It's an undercurrent, and then you kind of run into it once in a while by not looking good or by trying to talk about what's real when somebody else doesn't want you to talk about what's real. What other people think is the most important thing? We have that rule. Okay, now, did they, once again, sit you down and say, look, what other people think is the most important? We serve other people's opinions in this family. okay see that sounds ludicrous so nobody says that but yet it's there in my family we were we served other people's opinions big time you know it's like the worst thing that could happen in our family would be if my brother and i somehow got out of the house without a coat on when the temperature was below 40 or something like that because it's like oh what would the neighbors think you know bad mom okay the kid who doesn't want to wear a coat means bad mom to my mom which it doesn't mean. It's just a kid who doesn't want to wear a coat. You know, they're in a hurry or something. But she heard it about her, and if it's about her, then the neighbors aren't supposed to be able to see it. Understand? Because what they think is really the most important thing. And even as a kid, this baffled me big time, because at the same time that we were doing all this stuff, because we were so worried about what the neighbors thought, whenever we talked about the neighbors, we'd talk about them like they're a bunch of idiots and who cares what they think anyway, you know? You should have their problems, you know. Adults are more important than kids. Let me add that rule. Adults are more important than kids. Now, see, families don't sit down with people and say, you know, kids in this family, adults are more important than kids. But there's an undercurrent there, and you find that out if you try to act like you're important or you try to hold an adult accountable or expect that the adults would follow the same rules that you're expected to follow. In some families, there's a whole different set of rules for adults than there is for kids. Where I grew up, if you didn't eat supper as a kid, you didn't get dessert. But if you didn't eat supper as an adult, you still got dessert. Now, in my family, if kids don't eat supper, they don't get dessert. But if I don't eat supper, I don't get dessert either because what's negotiable is dessert. What's not negotiable are the rules and the messages that we send people and our family. And so I don't care about dessert nearly as much as I care about not telling my kids somehow that they're less important than me or that the things that I expect of them I don't have to live by, you know, things like that. So in my family, the kids, you know, if the kids can't eat dessert or supper on the sofa, I can't eat supper on the sofa, even though I think that probably I could eat supper better on the sofa than they could. Do you understand? Maybe spill a little less or something. Be more careful. If they can't do it for the reason that it might cause a spill, then I can't do it either because adults do spill as well. Do you understand? If I want them to keep the law, then I need to keep the law. If I don't want them to litter, then I've got to not litter. But if they can't litter and then I can litter and then tell them all the reasons why this doesn't really apply to me, then I'm sending them a message about adults and kids that I don't want to send them. People who feel sad are oversensitive. Let me add that rule. See, it's not that you're sad, it's that you overreacted. And it's just a way to discount how people feel. Women are here to do what men want. Let me add that rule. Women are here to do what men want. In my family, there was my father, my mother, my brother, and I. So there was only one woman in our family. And women were so much there to do what men wanted in my family that every once in a while my mother would notice that. And she'd say, she'd throw something or have a little bit of a tantrum, and she'd say, it just feels like women are here to do what men want in this family, which breaks what rule? Can't talk rule. She broke the can't talk rule, see? So then she'd have to get punished for breaking the can't talk rule. But in my family, women were so much there to do what men wanted that my dad didn't even have to do his own punishing. His mother did. Understand? So she'd go, now, shut up, basically. Shut up. Don't notice this. Okay, another one is questions are disrespectful. How many had that rule? Questions are disrespectful. It's never okay to say no to an adult. God helps those who help themselves. That's a contradiction to the gospel. God helps those who can't help themselves who know they can't help themselves and ask him to help. God doesn't need to help those who help themselves. You know why? they can help themselves. Just that simple. Peace at all costs. We had that rule. Peace at all costs. And then my favorite all-time one is when men are upset, they need to be taken seriously. When women are upset, it must be their time of the month. How many have that rule? Well, see, those rules have a lot of power, and not only that, but they send messages to people about themselves, and especially if you end up breaking them. That last rule I told you is a very discounting way to not pay attention to women. It's a shaming message to women. Women couldn't actually have a legitimate angry feeling. It has to be about something else. It's not that we men were acting like jerks or being insensitive or something. It's that they made something up or whatever because they're in their cycle or something like that. So anyway, it just sends shaming messages to people. How many had a rule that said favors aren't optional? That means that if your parent asked you to do them a favor, it didn't really mean do them a favor. Because, see, if someone asked you to do them a favor, you could say yes or no, right? If you say yes, it's a favor. If you say no, it wasn't a favor. If they say do me a favor, what they really mean is do it or else, or else bad things are going to happen. Just do it. And so you find out that favors aren't optional. The next characteristic is that people in shame-based systems code. And the reason why they code, C-O-D-E, code, is because saying it straight gets you in trouble. If you say it straight, you're the problem. So you have to find a way to say it without saying it. And so people code to avoid getting shamed. My dad used to do this thing that I call talking to the air. And what he did was that he would just say things, just plop them out in the air, out here, and then we would have these little code books, you know, and we'd go, oh, you know, it's talking to us, because for some reason he wouldn't talk to us. So he'd say, yeah, sure, it would be nice if someone took out the garbage, like that. And then we'd go, oh, I'm supposed to take out the garbage. But see, because we were normal teenagers, we didn't want to take out the garbage. Who wants to do that? So then we would just ignore the code, right? So he'd say, yeah, sure, it'd be nice if someone took out the garbage, and then we would just look at each other and go, you know, not talking to us. And you know what? He wasn't. Understand? He wasn't. He wasn't talking to us. Now, I don't know exactly why he felt like he, or didn't feel like he could talk to us, but he didn't. And then, of course, because we didn't do the job, because we figured out that the safest thing would be to plead ignorance here and not break the code, then he would put the confrontation in code, too. See, if I said to you, take out the garbage, it's your job, then if you don't do it, I can come to you and say, you didn't do it, okay, you need to do it, or here are the consequences or something. But because he didn't come to you and say, take out the garbage, he just left it out here, then he put the confrontation out here too, and he said, yeah, well, can't even get any lousy bums around here to take out the garbage. Well, see, now you experience what? Shame, okay, and now you're taking out the garbage because you feel shame or to protect yourself from getting that message, which is the wrong reason to take out the garbage. The right reason is because it's full. It's your job. It smells bad. It's garbage day. See, there's lots of right reasons to do right behavior, but in this family system, people end up doing the right behavior sometimes even for the wrong reason, which is to protect yourself from a message that you shouldn't even be getting in the family in the first place. That's what coding is. My in-laws code differently. One time I was bringing my mother and father-in-law to the airport after Christmas. They were here for a couple weeks, and it was January, and it was 20 below, you know, and I was bringing them to the airport, and my mother-in-law says, well, you know, we've been here for two weeks, and you really haven't had any special private time just with Holly and the kids, and so you don't have to come in with us and hang around and wait on the concourse and all that stuff. You can just drop us off at the curb, and we'll get a skycap and take us in, and you can go home and be with your family. I said, okay, that'd be great. So I let them off at the corner and then went home. When I got home, Holly said, you mean you dropped my parents off in 20 below weather or the total stranger in Minneapolis, blah, blah, blah? I said, well, they said it was okay. And she said, well, they didn't mean it. Okay, now, you see, that's just about a different code book. Do you understand? she's got a different code book, and I don't have her code book, and I don't know those codes. She knows them right now. When I do marriage counseling, what I find a lot of times is that people come into a marriage relationship with different code books, but they assume that the other person has the same code book, and then they get really frustrated and angry that the other person's not breaking the codes right, and then they spend all their time trying to educate the other person in the new code. You know, both people do that, and really what you need to do is just chuck those code books and learn to talk straight to each other and have a new relationship skill to match the new relationship. So I said to Holly, okay, let me get this straight because I'm trying to decode this now out here. But when you put it out here, once again, it sounds goofy. Okay, let me get this straight. Your parents want me to go in and wait with them so they pretend they don't. I, on the other hand, don't particularly want to, but I'm supposed to pretend I do and everybody will be okay. She said, yeah. I said, I'm not doing that. I'm not doing that. Okay, now see, the thing is that if my in-laws would have said to me, would you wait with us? You know, our plane's not coming for an hour. Could you wait with us? I'd have said yes and I wouldn't have been pretending. I can do that. If they wouldn't have said anything, I would have said yes and I wouldn't have been pretending. My mother-in-law has a rule, which, by the way, my father also had about the garbage. My mother-in-law has a rule that says, if you have to ask for something, it doesn't count if you get it. Anybody know about that rule? If you have to ask for something, it doesn't count if you get it. The reason that is, is because if you ask for something, and then the person gives it to you, you don't know if they're giving it to you because they really want to give it to you, which is important to you. You don't want people to do stuff because they should. You want to do it from the heart, right? So you don't know if they're giving it to you because they want to or because just to shut you up and get you off their case. And probably that's because you came from relationships where people gave you stuff but there were strings attached to it and you couldn't really trust it. You know, if you ask for someone, if you ask for something from someone, here's kind of a diagnostic little tool. If you ask for something from someone and they give it to you, oh, sure, here, and they give it to you, and then afterwards you end up feeling bad that you asked in the first place, it wasn't really a gift. And there's some other thing, some other thread going on here, and you can sense it. If you end up feeling worse after you asked than before, even though you got the thing. See, if that's what happens in our lives, then when you come and ask somebody to do something and they just do it, you don't know if they're doing it because they want to or because they're trying to shut you up, well then, when they even do it, you discount it, and then they end up feeling like it doesn't even matter what I do because if I don't do it, I'm in trouble, and if I do it, it doesn't count anyway, so why do it? And that's very tiring to live that way. You need to change that rule to say something like if you have to ask for something, it still counts if you get it. So people don't have to be mind readers, and people can learn to stay straight, and they can give you an honest yes or an honest no, and then you can be an adult and deal with it. But, you know, we kind of have this message that says children are here to take care of adults, and now we're still adults, thinking that we're here to take care of other adults. I remember one time I was speaking in another church in town, and then I came to the second service here at our church, and so we had two cars here, and Holly and the kids were all there, and I said, okay, I'm leaving now. Anybody want to go with me? Well, sometimes they all want to go and sometimes none of them want to go and sometimes one or two wants them to go. Well, on this occasion, nobody wanted to go. So I said, okay. So I started walking down The Hall. And actually, it was this hall right here So I'm walking down The Hall. And I almost get to the end of The Hall. And then I hear coming around the corner down The Hall, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, running down The Hall. You know? I turn around, and it's Jesse. And I said. Oh, hi, Jess. And she said, are you okay? And I said, what do you mean? And she said, well, are you sad that nobody wants to ride with you? And I said, well, yeah, I am. You know, because I asked and nobody wanted to and I feel disappointed that I'm riding home alone. But I would feel more sad if you pretended that you wanted to ride with me when you really didn't want to ride with me because you think it's your job to make sure your dad's not sad. Understand? Someone's supposed to be the adult here, right? And hopefully it's the adult. So I will ask the question. I will be an adult about asking the question. You be responsible to give me the honest answer. And even if it's no, I'll be the adult and handle the no. I can handle a no. It's not your job to take care of the dad. But in some families it is. And so nothing is free. Everything has strings all over it. And then you're afraid to ask for something because you're afraid that if they do it, they don't really want to. And everybody's taking care of everybody. Remember the two rules I talked about last night that govern this kind of thing, one of the rules is that you're powerful enough to make sure everybody else is okay, and the other is everybody else is okay, is powerful enough to make sure you're okay, and so everybody ends up taking care of themselves and not, I mean taking care of everybody else and not being responsible for themselves. And it's a very tiring way to live. Number five, shame-based systems are idolatrous, meaning that they teach people to get their sense of value from idols, from false gods, things that can't do it. And so the idols in this family system are people's opinions and how you look and how you talk. And Gene Antonello who does some stuff work in the area of codependency says that people from this kind of family system are opium addicts. And opium, she spells O-P-I-O-O-M. O-P-I-O-O-M. And what that stands for is other people's inferred opinions of me. So other people's opinions are the false gods that people serve. And that's what makes us okay, is if other people think something about us. And how we dress and what we say and all those kinds of things that can't fill us up, but yet we're told to get okay from them. how things look, what people think. One of the... How many of you here ever cleaned your room because company was coming? Okay, keep your hands up. You cleaned your room because company was coming. How many of you did the company ever see your room? So see, it probably wasn't that much about the company. It was more about what the company might think about someone else and your family, you know, like that. So there's a false kind of sense of promising value in the system. Now, I'm going to go for five more minutes. I need to go for five more minutes and just finish this thing. So the next characteristic is that shame-based systems have a hard time with kids. And the reason they have a hard time with kids is because kids are messy, and kids are in the process of finding out about life, And so they're kind of learning by trial and error, and they're learning by making mistakes, and they're learning by, you know, making messes. They don't look good. Kids don't look good. And if you get okay from how things look and what people think, then you're going to have a hard time with kids. So in this family, then the kids have to act like miniature adults. How many of you were ever told to act your age? Raise your hand. Act your age. Now keep your hands up. Okay? How many of you, when you were told to act your age, were acting your age? See, but when you're told to act your age, it doesn't really mean act your age. It means act 15 years older than your age. It means act like me. Act like an adult. And that's because this system doesn't have a lot of room for kids because kids don't do it right yet. They're still in the process of learning and exploring and experimenting, and it's messy. And if you get okay from how things look, you can't have a mess. So you've got to fix the kids and make them look like adults. The next characteristic is that this system is preoccupied with fault and blame. And fault and blame is different than responsibility and accountability. It's okay to hold people accountable for their behavior and give them consequences and all that kind of stuff. But this system is more about fault and blame. When somebody does the behavior, it's okay to want to find out who did it, even if they're not talking, even if they're hiding it, even if there's a conspiracy to hide it, because you want to find out who did it, first of all, so you can give them consequences for doing it and teach them about how to live, but second of all, so you can forgive them, because the fact that they're not talking means that they're feeling what? Guilt, shame, you know? Maybe your kids need, have a little bit of fear that if they said the terrible thing they did, maybe you wouldn't be okay with them, and they need to be able to say it to find out that you would be okay with them. It's a very freeing, liberating, filling up kind of thing. But you can't communicate that you still love them if they won't tell you the thing that they did. So they need to tell you. In the Bible, what's the purpose of confession? It's to get forgiveness. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins. It doesn't say if we confess our sins, he's going to nail us to the wall and make us feel so bad and so humiliated that we won't do it again. But see, that's what happens in this family. We want to know who did it because we want to know who to make feel so bad and so humiliated and so exposed that it'll motivate them to not ever do it again. So we try to control by sending shaming messages. And that's why we're so preoccupied with fault and blame. And people who come out of systems that are preoccupied with fault and blame have a sense of having to pay for their sins. They have a really hard time with grace because it feels like they're getting off too easy. And so they push it away. Shame-based systems are strong on head skills. And all that means is that if you have to push away anything that shames you, then you have to learn how to think really well. You have to learn to be a good debater and how to deny stuff and blame something else. And you have to figure out how to push the blame over to somebody else. And so these people become really good debaters. And now as an adult, maybe you know somebody, or maybe you yourself struggle with just trying to point out something to someone, and they just get so defensive, and they start putting up this big defense, and it's because they've learned that as a skill, because they've heard things as an indictment instead of just as a confrontation about behavior. So people learn to get really good about the way they think in terms of defending themselves. Shame-based systems are always asking questions to which there are no answers. They interrogate people a lot. I just can't understand why you did that. Is your head on backwards? Well, there's no answer to that. Whatever possessed you to say that? Is something wrong with your mouth? Things like that. And you're kind of stuck with this question that you can't answer. Why did you do that? Now, see, I think it's important for people to understand why they did stuff. But in this system, they don't ask the question, why did they do that to understand what's really going on? They say, why did you do that? Because it's a crooked way of saying, I wish you didn't do that. I feel frustrated that you did that. I don't like that you did that. But instead of saying, I don't like that you did that, we say, why did you do that? And then there's no answer the person's going to give that the person who asked the question is going to like. You know, if the kid says, well, you know, I did that because I thought about my options, and if I pick this course of action, I would get this consequence, and if I picked this course of action, I'd get this consequence, and after weighing the two things, I decided plan A. Well, see, then you'd say, well, smart aleck. See, so there's no answer that works here. So the only answer that, or the most common answer that's given is I don't know. Why did you do that? I don't know. Even if the person knows, they say they don't know because that's the safest answer in the system. Number nine is that people, the system is weak on heart skills meaning it's not okay to feel things. And so people learn not to feel things and they get out of touch with their feelings and actually what happens is that they think they're feeling. So if you say how you're feeling, people actually look in their head. And I've seen people do this. They look in their head and they go, hmm, let's see. Because they're looking for the feeling because they don't feel it anymore because they've been taught not to feel it. And so I have heard people tell incredible, horrible stories about stuff that's happened to them. And then I say, well, how did you feel about that? And they go, well, let's see. See, they don't feel sad. They just look to try to think if they feel sad or not. And it's almost like they step out of themselves and look back at themselves and say, okay, how would someone feel that that happened to? Well, they'd probably feel sad. Sad. But they don't say that because they actually feel it. They've kind of more diagnosed it. Because if you feel things, you're the problem. So people learn to pretend not to feel. And then the last characteristic, and this is where the next two sessions will come from, the last characteristic is that these people, because love and acceptance is based on performance, they learn to perform. So on the outside, they look full, but on the inside, because love and acceptance can't be earned, they're still needy or empty on the inside. So shame-based systems are characterized by people who are needy, empty on the inside, but they look full on the outside. They've learned to do the behaviors that they need to do to get by.
