Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Let's pray as we go to the ministry of the word this morning. Lord, I've worked hard to come up with the right words this week as we wade into this issue that has caused a lot of us a lot of pain. But beyond the right words, I pray for the right spirit. Because sometimes even if the words are right and the spirit's wrong, the words end up being wrong. So I pray for the right spirit. And the spirit, I think that would be right, would be the spirit of Jesus. So I pray for the spirit of Jesus to be in me and in us and supernaturally even in this room and over all we're thinking about and moving into here this morning. And I pray that in that name, in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, as most of you know, we've been dealing for quite some time with the Sermon on the Mount as found in Matthew 5, where Jesus has gathered to himself a small group of friends and followers on the side of a mountain to talk, not about religion, which is maybe what you would expect, but to talk about life, just everyday life. Indeed, to talk quite candidly about dimensions of life with which all of us struggle, that are, in fact, quite difficult and messy, painful and disturbing. And it's why, a few weeks ago, we talked about anger and contempt, because that's what he talked about in Matthew 5, verse 21. And it's why, following that, we talked about lust and then about sex, because it's what he talked about in Matthew 5, 27. And it's why today we're going to talk about divorce, because that's what he talks about in Matthew 5, 31. And then again, it comes up in Matthew 19 when the Pharisees come to him. And I don't know if the Pharisees heard what he said in Matthew chapter 5, but they come to Jesus in Matthew 19 to test him and to push him. And Jesus then expands what he is thinking about this issue. So we're going to be in both of those texts. But as it turns out, it's not just about divorce that he is speaking of, because if you dial to the flow of the Sermon on the Mount, he's still talking about lust, actually. But it's not just about lust that he's talking about, because as he begins to talk about divorce, he's still kind of talking about anger and contempt. Indeed, what it's really all about, these words in chapter 5, verse 31 and 32, when you stir it all together and catch the flow of the text, where he's been and where he's going, what it's really all about is how the sons of Adam, men, have treated the daughters of Eve, women, and how the daughters of Eve, women, I've treated the sons of Adam with anger and contempt and with lust. Not always sexual lust, but involving strong desire. Remember, that's what lust means. Strong desire to possess him or possess her in order to fill my empty, needy, hungry places. And then having used them as you would use a thing and found them wanting, be they a man or a woman, incapable of filling those empty places, discarding them, what Jesus is saying here is all about that. And it's about how from the beginning it has not been this way, says Jesus in Matthew 19, verse 8, because from the beginning God had a different design. He had something else in mind, Matthew 19, verse 4, because in the beginning he created the male and female. And he said that for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. Consequently, they are no longer two but one flesh. And what therefore God has joined together to make one flesh, let no one tear apart, separate. And then they, that is the Pharisees, who we'll hear from in a few minutes, were coming to test him. They said to him, well, if what you just said is true, then why did Moses command us to give her a certificate and to divorce her? And Jesus said he never commanded that, but because of your hardness of heart, particularly in Jesus' day, the hardness of heart and the part of the men in that time toward their wives, because of that, says Jesus, Moses permitted you to divorce your wives, mostly, however, to protect your wives from you. He didn't do this to give you license to discard your wives for any cause, which is precisely what they had done with what Moses said about divorce in Deuteronomy 24. And all of that is why Jesus begins his teaching on this in Matthew 5, which is our focus text this morning. In his classic, you have heard it said, but I say a rabbinic rhythm that we've grown so used to in Sermon on the Mountain. What they had heard said, picture again these guys around him on the side of the mountain, listening to him talk about life, and what they'd heard all their lives about marriage and divorce was this, verse 31, that whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of dismissal. Now, where they'd heard that all their lives, what's from? Deuteronomy 24, which is what Jesus is quoting here, which in Matthew 9, Jesus says, Moses permitted because of the hardness of their hearts. Now, to really understand what's kind of going on here, I need to provide for you some background and history so as to clearly see the landscape of the day relative to marriage and divorce so as to better understand not only what Jesus is saying here, but why he's saying it and why what he's talking about here is actually a much bigger issue than marriage and divorce. It's about marriage and divorce, but it's much bigger than that because he still is. Keep this in mind. You've got to hang on to the flow of the text. He is still talking about anger and contempt, about lust and abandonment, and in particular about how the sons of Abraham, The men were treating the daughters of Eve with those very things, anger, contempt, and lust, and doing it in the extreme. Indeed, I wonder if you noticed, as I just began to read the text, and we have some other verses to deal with as well, that every single thing that Jesus said in that text about divorce, both in Matthew 19 and in Matthew 5, was directed entirely to men. Did you notice that? A man divorces his wife. If a man leaves his wife, it's all about the men leaving their wives. And among the reasons for that was because only men did it. Only men could. It was illegal for a woman to do this. If it was legal, they would have, but they couldn't in this system. Only men could do it. And in Jesus' day, men were doing it for any cause at all. Indeed, it's that history that is behind the question of the Pharisees in Matthew 19, 3, who come to Jesus testing him. Matthew 19, 3, it says, They came to Jesus testing him with this question. Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause at all? And the reason it's kind of an edgy question is because the prevailing view in Jesus' day was that you could divorce your wife, discard her for any cause at all. born of the rabbinic interpretation of Deuteronomy 24, where it speaks of a man putting away his wife for some indecency. Interesting turn of phrase. If he sees in her some indecency, he should give her this certificate of divorce. Indeed, the rabbi Hillel, who was a very powerful voice in Jesus' day and one of the most popular rabbis among the Pharisees in particular for reasons that will become apparent when I give you his interpretation. And that is what rabbis did. They were always taking the scripture and interpreting the scripture so people would know how to apply the scripture. His interpretation of Deuteronomy 24 was to define indecency as anything that makes your wife appear unclean in your sights, which could and eventually did mean anything. From burning the bagels to too much salt to spinning in the streets such that people would see your knees to letting down your hair or speaking to a man in public if she's infertile or doesn't produce a son, she is unclean. You can discard her but give her a certificate. Indeed, to be unclean in your sight, according to Hillel, could simply mean that you saw someone prettier than your wife making your wife appear unclean by comparison and all God's people in those days said amen. See, we've got some history here and what the history reveals is that what Jesus is up against here and what he's fighting about here is not just a defiled and diminished view of marriage, though he is fighting that, but he is fighting and involved in and trying to call back a defiled and diminished view of women in that day. Indeed, I think I could go so far as to say it was a hatred of women, a hatred of the feminine, if you will, such that treating the daughters of Eve with anger, contempt, and lust was just fine. To use them as you would use something and just discard it was just okay. In fact, Moses commanded it, according to them in Deuteronomy 24, which is made obvious that that's what they thought. In Matthew 19, verse 7, when they said, why then did Moses commend it? Fact is, in Jesus' day, women were at best subservient, but worse, inferior, a common prayer among Jewish men. I thank you, God. I'm not a Gentile, an ignorant man, or a woman. Man, a Jewish home, the birth of a baby boy was met with joy, the birth of a little girl, often met with disappointment, sometimes even grief, which ought to give us grief. I just had, we just had a little baby girl. granddaughter born and I can't imagine I can't imagine what is wrong what is what how far have we fallen men could have in Jesus day more than one wife and commonly dead and easily divorce it was illegal for women to do either have more than one husband and ever divorce women couldn't be a witness in a court of law rabbis considered it beneath their dignity to speak to a woman in public or even to acknowledge her presence which presses this whole thing past condescending That is contempt. Most young girls in Jesus' day were not permitted to study the Torah, though some rather rebellious and loving fathers would pull their daughters aside and say, I'm going to give you the words of life. You memorize this word, young lady. But most girls were not allowed even into the inner court of the temple where the teaching and the preaching would take place. One rabbi said, better the words of the Torah be burned than entrusted to a woman. And whoever teaches his daughter Torah is like one who teaches lasciviousness. Imagine being a little girl in Jesus' day. A young woman in Jesus' day. Now, to all of that, add now this. That when a man in Jesus' day would divorce his wife for whatever cause, for that woman, it was often tantamount to a death sentence. There was a tremendous amount of fear around this. And even staying in a marriage, a woman, unless they do have a husband, and some were loving. wonderful, but the spirit of the age, the system of the day was that women are walking on eggshells in their marriages and in the culture, quite frankly. Indeed, that is why. That is why Moses commanded, because he did command, but the Pharisees twisted it all around to benefit themselves. Moses did command a certificate of divorce because men were just discarding their wives and throwing them out in the street. So Moses said, if you're going to act that way because of the hardness of your heart, you have to give them a certificate so they have some possibility of re-entering society. Dallas Willard, in his book Divine Conspiracy, explains it this way, that in the Jewish society of Jesus' day, as for most times in places in human history, the consequences of divorce were devastating for the women. Except for some highly unlikely circumstances, her life was simply ruined. No harm was done to the man, by contrast, except from time to time, a small financial loss. And perhaps a bitter relationship with the ex-wife's family. For the women, however, there were only three realistic possibilities. Dial into this. If you were being discarded because you burned the bagels, okay? Three possibilities for you. One was this. you might find a place in the home of a generous relative, but usually it was on grudging terms, and so your life was probably little more than living as a servant, even kind of like a slave in this family, but at least you had a roof over your head and food to eat. Second option, she might find a man who would, in fact, marry her, but always as damaged goods, and often you would be one of several wives. And so, again, you're not much more than something to be used, like a slave or a servant. Third possibility is that women might finally make a place in the community as a prostitute. Think on that. It's just a fascinating thought because it puts a fascinating spin on what we know is Jesus' association. We've talked about it often. It's commonly known. Jesus associated with prostitutes, publicans, sinners. But with this information, it kind of puts this spin on it because quite possibly the prostitutes that Jesus was known to associate with, and this is what really bugged the Pharisees, deeply care for them, became prostitutes, not because they lacked some moral virtue, but because their husbands did. Remember the woman at the well? John chapter 4, who had five husbands. Remember, Jesus even said that to her. You have five husbands, and the man she was living with at the time was not her husband. I've always made assumptions about that and even preached some things and kind of using her as an example of someone who's maybe looking for love in all the wrong places. You know, five husbands living with some other guy now, and I kind of have interpreted that scene in the context of our culture because you could maybe see someone doing something like that. She's going from guy to guy to guy, and if guys could fill your life, the first would have been, you know, it's like that. But have you ever noticed? In fact, we talked about this at Message Team this week, and Stephan kind of brought this up, that Jesus never confronts the woman at the well for that. And he doesn't tell her to leave the man she's with. He doesn't say to her, go and sin no more. Now, we know that phrase where Jesus says, go and sin no more. But he doesn't say that to this woman. Why? Well, one reason might be that that woman in the well in Jesus, they wouldn't have divorced five men. She couldn't have. but those five men could have easily discarded her for any cause at all five times. Get out of here, get out of here, get out of here, get out of here. And the man she's with now don't think it's romance or she just can't get enough. More likely she's desperately trying to survive and living maybe among several other women, like a slave or a servant. It's just the way things were in Jesus' day. It was the order of the day. It was the system into which Jesus came. So when Jesus begins to talk about this in Matthew 5, verse 31, he's bringing up all of this. You know, we can hear, okay, now he's going to talk about divorce. No, you just see, when he brings this up, All of this stuff that I just gave you is stirring, is coming up in these kids who he's talking to on the side of this mountain. And when he does it the way he does it, right on the heels of his teaching on anger, contempt, and lust, it's as if he's saying, okay, guys, we just talked about anger, contempt, and lust. Let me give you exhibit A on our lives. of what anger, contempt, and lust looks like, fleshed out for all to see, for it's revealed right under our noses, and how the sons of Adam, in our day and age, Jesus would be saying to them, have been treating the daughters of Eve with anger, contempt, and lust, because I know, says Jesus, that you have heard it said, Matthew 5, 31, that whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of dismissal. I know you guys, picture him saying this to these guys. I know you've heard that all your life from Deuteronomy 24. And I know that most men think that when they do that, give their wives a certificate of divorce, they're being really good guys. It's true, it's just so weird. I mean, the guys who would give the certificate were the good guys, they were the godly guys, because at least they didn't throw their wife out on the street. Like most men, those bad guys, I'm a noble man who gave her a certificate. Now get out of here. that's what you've heard all your life but i say verse 32 that everyone who divorces his wife discards her this way and puts her in these desperate this desperate situation makes her literally forces her to commit adultery it's interesting i don't want to get lost in this but i've kind of heard that verse all my life and i've even heard men take that verse in our day and make it like jesus is giving you a rule and i i remember meeting oh this is weird i remember meeting with a guy who was physically abusing his wife. And his wife, to survive, was trying to get away and planning to divorce. And he was trying to put pressure on me to read her that verse. Tell her if she leaves me and marries another, she's committing adultery. And I looked at him. You think she's the bad guy? Okay. Okay. You know what he's saying here? What he's saying here, when you discard your wife for any cause, because they were, get out of here. And then she gets in the trouble she's in. Maybe she had to become a prostitute, or she becomes one of five other wives. Her adultery is your fault. That's what he's saying. What he's saying is outrageous in that culture. Don't you dare pick up those stones. As I'm talking like this, did any of you think of that? Woman taking in adultery, where the guys, the men, were all about to stone her and Jesus. Only guy there stands in front and says, don't you dare throw stones at her. we don't know the rest of the story for adultery it could have been her problem but given this culture given this stuff we know Jesus is saying this verse her adultery you should be apologizing to her not stoning her which doesn't make adultery okay see we just gotta know that when Jesus says these things this way in this context, given this culture, that these kids sitting on the side of this mountain listening to this, their heads are spinning because they knew that Jesus wasn't just confronting a low view of marriage and he wasn't even just confronting a low view of women. Indeed, it was much bigger than that and this is where we all enter in because what he is confronting was a system. a structure, a power structure, if you will. Indeed, what he was confronting was the way things were. And the way things were in Jesus' day was that men had all the power and they were using it to control and to crush the daughters of Eve. And aren't you glad it's better now? Because now women have some power and they use it to crush men. It's just glory to God. It's all great. This is all about how the daughters of Eve treat the sons of Adam and how the sons of Adam treat the daughters of Eve. But this power system, who has the power to crush, control? You know, I've done a lot of thinking about this this week. And you know, when I think of women in the culture and in the church, there's part of me that goes, you know, things have gotten better. It's not like this. Although, I mean, you gotta not read the paper or be aware it's going on in the world to know that there are places in the world right now that is exactly like this. And then you've got to be a little naive to not think that there are some marriages and homes in Maple Grove that are an awful lot like this. Or the one who has the power is using it to crush and control and do incredible damage, whether it be the man or the woman. But in fact, and I said a little dull kid, but I wonder if it can be compared and went to racism. Where, you know, in the last few years, it's gotten better. Like, we've passed some laws, and not just laws, but a lot of people's hearts have changed toward other ethnicities and things. But you can change all your laws and make more opportunities, and that's really good and important, and let's fight for that stuff. But an awful lot of hearts haven't changed at all. Think the same thing around women. There's a lot more opportunities, and laws have changed, and that's all good, and we should fight for that. And some people's hearts have changed, but an awful lot of people's hearts haven't changed. Sometimes you hear it in subtle ways, sometimes in how we joke. I'll never forget. This is one of those things you remember. When my oldest daughter was born, Andrea, we were bringing her home from the hospital. I was a coach. I was an assistant coach at Bethel College at the time, coaching football, and just this little assistant thing I was doing. And we were bringing her home from the hospital on a day we had a game. So we picked her up at the hospital. My wife, my parents, we had the little baby, Andrea, with us, and they dropped me off at the school. So I walked into school and into the locker room with all the guys and had my little baby daughter to show them, and they didn't know it was a boy or a girl. They hadn't heard, and so I was, was it a boy or a girl? And it's a girl, and joking, one of the guys, I can see, I know his name, I remember him, said, what a waste. And he was kidding. It was a joke. I know the guy. I still know the guy. He's got daughters. He loves his daughters. But you got to, what was that about? What's underneath that? Why would that be funny? Maybe there's more there than we think. Oh, Dave, it's just a joke. I know. I get jokes. In Jesus' day, this was a power system. And Jesus was coming against it. He did that against all the powers. Remember we talked earlier about the kingdom of God has come to identify and seek to subvert every other kingdom in this world, including this one. I'm going to turn it all upside down, says Jesus. How many of you know that it's dangerous to do that, to confront prevailing power structures, because the people in those structures who have the power want to keep it? It's weird, sometimes you see those people in those structures, and you meet them, and you go, they're not really that bad. Indeed, this might be disillusioning to you, but the disciples themselves were part of the system in Jesus' day. Maybe I'll say it better this way, and this helps me identify with it. They were products of the system, and so am I, and so are you, of our system, whatever it is. Where are you getting this, Dave? Matthew 19, verse 10. After Jesus has done his teaching on marriage and divorce and how we treat each other and how we need to love each other, The response of the disciples to Jesus' teaching was so radical to their ears on marriage and divorce that in Matthew 19, verse 10, they essentially said this, are you kidding? If this relationship of a man with his wife is like you're describing Jesus, it's probably better not to marry. Why would they say that? Because the way you describe it, Jesus, we've just lost our advantage. And if you don't have an advantage, like I'm on top and you're on the bottom and I get to do what I want and use you, why marry? Like maybe because you love someone? Nah! I mean, who's going to do the dishes if we put it this way? Now, enter now the Pharisees. Now, see, all of that drama and tension and power structure stuff, that's what's behind what the Pharisees are doing when they come in Matthew 19, verse 1. They're coming to test him. Verse 3, and the test is to see what side he's on. Do you support the system, or will you seek to subvert it? Is he a friend, or is he a foe? Is he someone we can get along with, or is he someone we need to oppose? So tell us. They say in verse 3, is it lawful for a man to divorce, discard his wife for any cause at all, because clearly they thought it was. It's just the way things are. Indeed, Moses commanded it, so Jesus answers. in his rabbinic, somewhat sarcastic style. Have you not read? I love that. Verse 4. You know, that part at the very beginning of the book. You know, the book that you guys know so well. Have you not read that, like, thing in the very first chapter that he, that is God, created them from the beginning, male and female, with this desire and design, that the two should become one flesh. Verse 5, so that now it is no longer two but one. What God has done with that, don't you dare tear it apart just because somebody burned the bagels. How dare you? Treat the daughters of Eve or treat the sons of Adam. This way their response, verse 7, again, and why did Moses command us to do this? As if we're just doing what we're told. To which Jesus said again, Moses never commanded any of this. You're so full of baloney. That's the original Greek. I can't say the original Greek. It's just... But because of the hardness of your hearts and the evil you have done to the wives of your youth and the daughters of Eve, Moses permitted this. And what was actually a desperate attempt on Moses' part to protect your wives from you, the prophet Malachi. Interesting. and I think this is important to, when Jesus is confronting this system, he wasn't the first one who ever said this kind of stuff and prophets were always calling God's people back to reality and back to truth. Malachi expresses the same sentiment in Malachi 2.14 when he says, again, the system's the same, he's saying this to the men. The Lord has witnessed against you that you have dealt treacherously with the wife of your youth, your companion, your wife by covenant because they, like the men in Jesus, they were discarding their wives like you would discard something you used, which is why he says in the next verse, I hate divorce, says the Lord, the God of Israel, verse 16. But mostly what I hate, it's not just divorce. It's not like, don't have a divorce. No, what I hate is this, men and women, but here it's the men. I hate the treachery with which you have treated the daughters of Eve. Because whether you know it or not, end of that verse says, you have covered your garments with wrong. And you feel so justified in what you've done. But you are, you have, your garments are covered with wrong. There's a fascinating picture there because actually the picture there is that of a warrior in a battle who regardless of how righteous he thinks this war is, once you start swinging that sword you will be covered with blood there will be blood everywhere righteous war great it's a righteous war swing the sword soon as you do blood everywhere it's on you it's on them and in the case of divorce discarding your husband discarding your wife for any cause at all whatever whatever just don't want to do the work anymore whatever you start swinging that sword blood everywhere. Your garment is splattered with, I hear this, it was so clean, it was just so, no, there's no way to do this clean. You can't do this clean. There's blood everywhere. It's on you, it's on your wife, it's on your husband, it's on your kids, and it'll be on your kids' kids, and their kids' kids. So keep just doing what you want. But there's blood everywhere. and then I sense the sadness in Jesus' heart when he says this given how unraveled all this is verse 8, but from the beginning it wasn't this way and I'm here to call you back if I can to the beginning because he is, Jesus is the new Moses this is maybe more theology than you can handle in this thing at the very beginning in the Sermon 9, in the Beatitudes, Jesus went up on the mountain. Very symbolic. Moses went up on the mountain. Jesus is the new Moses, calling us to a whole new kind of life in the kingdom of God that Moses tasted and began, but he couldn't complete, but Jesus did complete it, fulfilling in his life and death and resurrection all the law and the prophets. So come and follow me, says Jesus, the new Moses, Messiah. Come and follow my way of living and loving and being. But in order to do that following, you're going to need to remember some things. Sons of Adam and daughters of Eve, you're going to have to remember that in the beginning, I created them, male and female. And when he created them, he blessed them. Genesis 1, 28. And he said to them, notice them. Not just to Adam, not just to Eve. He said to them, I want you together. One flesh to rule together, subdue and multiply, all of which speaks to a co-ruling and reigning on the earth with God. And it's just fascinating to me in light of what we know now about how the sons of Adam in Jesus' day were treating the daughters of Eve. It's fascinating to contrast that with how the original Adam reacted to the original Eve. In Genesis chapter 2, when God brought her to him, because what's fascinating is Adam didn't say when he saw Eve, hey, great, a maid to serve me, someone to wait on me. Remember always that she's subservient to me, and always remember also that she can be easily discarded by me. That isn't what he said. That's what the sons of Adam said. And now some daughters of Eve say. No, he saw it more clearly than that because he said, this is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. And for this cause, Genesis 2, 28, of co-reigning and co-ruling with her and God, for that cause a man shall leave his father and mother, cleave to his wife, the two, shall become one flesh. But then you know the story, sin spoiled the party. we call it the fall theologically with the fall came separation among other things between God and between us and each other between us and God and us and each other and among the tragic results of the fall as recorded in Genesis 3 was this loss of co-reigning and co-ruling this one flesh dance with the Trinity actually Father, Son, and Holy Spirit God created man and woman and says come join the dance but all that's lost because now replaced, now this co-reigning and ruling dance together is now replaced by a vying for power. Who can be on top and win? Because now in verse 16 of Genesis 3, it says that her desire shall be for him and he shall rule over you. Now, I can't tell you how many times, I've even been at weddings where the preacher will read that verse and her desire shall be for him and he shall rule, as if that's God's design. And that's so wonderful, you like him, but he rules you. Isn't that beautiful? That's the flaw. In fact, when it says, for her desire shall be for him in Genesis 3.16, that word desire sounds warm and gooey. I desire you. That's not what the word means. The word actually speaks to a desire to tear down and you serve. Indeed, it's the same word. This will help you see it in the next chapter of Genesis. Genesis chapter four, Cain has killed Abel. God comes looking for Cain, finds him and says, Cain, why has your countenance fall and if you do well, things will be better for you. But here's the deal. Sin is crouching at the door and its desire, same word, is for you. And sin didn't want to give Cain a hug. Sin's desire for Cain was to tear him down to destroy his life and he shall rule over you. Which is not loving headship. It's despotic, tyrannical, crushing, which was never God's desire, design, or dream in the beginning. All of that is a result of sin. And in Matthew 5 and Matthew 19, all of that is on display for everyone to see. Being fleshed out in plain view. And into all of that, mess. How far we have fallen. Jesus comes saying, among other things, at the very beginning of his ministry, Matthew 4, 17, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is within your reach. A different way of living is within your reach, and you are so far from it, but the way you're going to come to it is if you come, come follow me, and I will bring you into a whole new way of living and loving and being, if you're actually serious about following me, most of you won't be, says Jesus, still true. Indeed, you can begin to partner with me, said Jesus, and this is the whole message of the kingdom, in the restoration of all things, which is, as you know, where all these things are headed. We've been talking about the kingdom for months around here in the Sermon on the Mount. It is the mission of God, mission of God, the restoration of the whole wide world. But what if that mission could begin where it all began, when he created the male and female? What if all this save the world, restore the world stuff? is actually supposed to start between a man and a woman in the most basic and fundamental of all human relationships. Fact is, that's exactly what Paul is calling for in Ephesians 5, 21. When he says this, Ephesians 5, 21, be subject one to another in the fear of Christ, in reverence for Christ, which means I'm reversing the order. I'm telling you, I'm giving you the teaching of Jesus. No more vying for power to see who can be on top to win control and crush. Indeed, the call in the kingdom of God is to learn how to be subject one to another, stooping to serve one another. Being subject to someone literally means to take all the strength that you have as a woman, to take all the strength that you have as a man, and get underneath that person to lift them. And then in verse 22, Paul says, wives, I'm talking to you. And in verse 25 says, Paul says, husbands, I'm talking to you too. Indeed, what I want to say to you, husbands, is this. Remember. And again, they needed a stronger word. You give them that culture. This is, I need to say something more to you, men, says Paul. Remember, and here's what I want you to remember. Remember your father, Adam. And I want you to remember how your father Adam looked at your mother Eve. You know when I say that, it kind of brings you back to the garden. But I would speak to the men and the women. Do your men, do your sons and daughters notice how you look at the daughter of Eve? It's contempt, lust. They do notice. They do notice. Do your daughters notice? Yes, they notice. so men women remember how your father Adam looked at the at your mother Eve and now remember something even more remember now the second Adam I'm giving you a lot of theology here the second Adam is do you know who it is Jesus you might want to take some cues from him men and women but here he's talking to men to love your wives verse 25 as Christ, who is the second Adam, loved the church, his bride, by giving himself away for her, which was, I mean, what a far cry for the way things were in Jesus' day and in ours. You see, beloved, we talk about following the rabbi. We've been talking about it for well over a year here. My question is this. Will we follow him into places like this? I'm talking to men and to women, obviously. Indeed, my question actually is this. Do any of us have any intention at all of following this rabbi named Jesus into this kind of life, this rabbi who made it clear to his followers right up front, right at the beginning, in Matthew 20, verse 26, that whoever wishes to be great among you shall be the servant. In fact, he gives that word when the disciples were wondering who can be the greatest, who will be the greatest in their home, in their church? No, you don't get it. Whoever wishes to be great in the kingdom, you want to follow me? Become a servant. Want to be the boss? Put on the apron to serve. And whoever wishes to be first among you shall be the slave, for I have set the pattern. And some of you are going to, you want to believe in me so you go to heaven when you die, but you have no intention of following my way, because here's my way. I came not to be served, but to serve, and to give my life a ransom for many. Come, follow me. What if we did? What if we would, men and women? And what if we didn't do it for the whole wide world, to save the world? What if we just did it at home? But what if, when we started doing it at home, it actually began to ripple out and affect the world? And so we pray that kingdom come. You know, we pray for the kingdom to come. We're usually in a church service wanting some really jazzy thing to happen. You know when the kingdom comes? When we start to obey and follow his way. Repent, therefore, for the kingdom of heaven is within our reach. Would you stand with me as we pray? What occurs to me, Lord, is that all of us have wounds around this. The Daughters of Eve, have been wounded and are wounding. And the sons of Adam have been wounded and are wounding. And I pray in your name that you would give us the courage and the faith to become men and women who are learning what it means to follow you, our rabbi, into this kind of living and in this kind of loving because we must confess we're not doing very well. So Holy Spirit, come. In all these things we pray in Jesus' name. Amen. If you need prayer, I'm going to ask the prayer team to come and make themselves available. You come for that if you need it. The rest of you are dismissed. God bless you. Thank you.
