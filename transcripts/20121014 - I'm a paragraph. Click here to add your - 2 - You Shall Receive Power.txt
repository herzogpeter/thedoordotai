Today we're back to the book of Acts. Open your Bibles. Book of Acts second week, I feel like This is in some ways part two of last week, kind of still in that introductory place. And even as you're opening your Bibles to it, in fact, there's different ways to look at that. They'll be on the screen, but we're going to be moving around a little bit and to have your Bibles might help you a little bit, even to keep track. But let's pray as we move into this. Father, what I feel rise in me relative to the word today, particularly, not even today, just hold this whole book of the Acts, is the prayer of Paul when in the end of Ephesians he said this, God, I need this, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth that I might make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel. And the mystery of the gospel is Christ. But not Christ in some vague abstract way, Christ alive by his Spirit inside, living inside. Ordinary people like us help us to taste that and see that, understand that, enter into that, experience that, which is a lot to ask of a sermon, but we want that. And I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, last week as we began our journey into the story that is the book of the Acts, more accurately known as the Acts of the Apostles. More accurate still, I think it should be called the Acts of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles because this story is all about the power of the Spirit through ordinary people. I likened it last week to an epic movie that brings us to places of grandeur, of great danger and delight. But like a lot of epic movies that do that, I think of Lord of the Rings, they begin often with a whisper that belies the wonder of the story to come so to the book of Acts. And the story found therein is epic. Like when in Acts chapter 2, verse 2, that's pretty early in the story, there suddenly came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, distributing themselves, and they rested on every one of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, the ultimate result of which was 3,000 souls. It says in verse 41 of that same chapter, being added to the church, being added to life in the kingdom of God, it happened in one day, which is epic. And it speaks to grandeur and delight, and everyone kept feeling this sense of awe, it says in Acts chapter 3, but not long after that. disturbing winds began to blow because this is an epic movie bringing you sometimes to places of great danger when in chapter 4 verse 1 the captain of the temple guard the Sadducees and priests came upon them being greatly disturbed because they that is the apostles were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead and so they were arrested and soon after that Stephen is stoned, and soon after that, James is beheaded, which is epic, but speaks not to grandeur and delight, but to great danger, but like an epic movie that brings us to such places. The book of the Acts begins with a whisper in the quietest way with a first-century physician whose name was Luke. He was Dr. Luke. Sitting at a table, quill pen in his hand, a candle providing light in what I imagine to be a dark and probably damp room. This solitary figure in the opening scene in the book of Acts is writing a simple letter to a friend. That's all he's doing. He wasn't writing to us. We're here listening to this story now. but he was writing a simple letter to a friend whose name was Theophilus. And it wasn't the first time he'd done such a thing. That is, write a letter to a friend, particularly this guy named Theophilus. Acts 1 verse 1 makes that clear, because in the first account I composed to you, Theophilus, in the first letter that I wrote to you, and we discovered last week that the first letter he wrote to Theophilus was actually what we know as the Gospel of Luke. I wrote about all the things that Jesus began to do and teach. But that, and the that is what he told Theophilus about in Luke's gospel, that was just the beginning. Because after his suffering and death, now look at Acts 1 verse 3, he presented himself alive after his suffering with many convincing proofs that he actually was indeed alive, appearing to them, appearing to us over a period of 40 days. And I know, Theophilus, that that is a mind-bending thing to conceive, that he was risen from the dead and that we saw him. But maybe the biggest part of this story, and the reason it continues to live on and even grow, is because of something that Jesus reminded us of just before Jesus ascended to the Father, which was what he referred to as the promise of the Father. Acts 1, verse 4 says this. Look at Acts 1, verse 4. And gathering them together, this is again Luke writing this to Theophilus about what Jesus did and said. Gathering them together, he that is Jesus commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait. Be quiet and wait. For what the Father had promised, and what the Father had promised, as recorded in Luke 24, 49, was what Jesus refers to there as a clothing with power. Not a baptism, which he talks about in Acts, but a clothing with power. Acts 1 verse 5, the metaphor is switched. Look at Acts 1 verse 5. For John baptized you with water, Jesus is saying, you're familiar with that, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit. Not many days from now, you're going to have to wait. And when this baptism arrives, Acts 1 verse 8, you shall receive, you shall be clothed with power. Power to become, among other things, my witnesses. Read verse 8. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you, the Holy Spirit being the key ingredient there, the result of which is this, you shall be my witnesses, both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest parts of the earth, which once again is epic. This is something that will change the world. And all of that is why today I want to talk about, and it's still kind of by way of introduction to the book, but we're getting down a little bit deeper into the specifics of it. I want to talk this morning about this baptism, this clothing with power which will unfold in other ways. I want to talk about this Holy Spirit thing, but because I do indeed think it can be argued that the rest of the book of Acts is actually an accounting of what it looks like when these baptisms of the spirits come, when this clothing with power is experienced. Because of that, I'm not going to feel compelled to say everything there is to say, and I'm kind of saying that to myself today. Don't feel like you have to say it all, because it'll kill you. Because over the next several weeks and months and maybe years, probably years, it is going to unfold. It's part of what I'm excited about around this. It's going to come and unfold, and it's going to manifest itself in ways that I don't think we can even anticipate right now. So today, an introduction, again, of sorts, a primer, if you will, that might provide for us the kind of theological framework I think we need to be able to talk about these things, to understand them, to enter into and embrace these things, maybe even for some of you to just desire these things around the Holy Spirit, the baptism of the same, because lots of people are afraid of these things. You start talking about the Holy Spirit, the baptism of the Holy Spirit. It's just so weird. So let's begin kind of a piece at a time by talking about this baptism. And before we talk about this baptism, baptism in general, some teaching here, because while the word itself, baptism, pretty much means the same thing everywhere it shows up in the Scriptures, because all the word literally means is to be immersed in, to be plunged into, surrounded by, overwhelmed with something. There are, in fact, even though the word always means the same thing, in essence, there are, in fact, different kinds of baptisms all through the Scriptures, serving different kinds of purposes, accomplishing different kinds of things. There is, for example, water baptism, which actually after the 11 o'clock service, right out in the gathering place, we are going to witness. And it is a symbol that you have been raised to newness of life. But in this kind of baptism, water is what you're plunged into. Water is what you're surrounded by, immersed into. And as I said, it's a symbol of the fact that you've been raised to newness of life. If you go under the water, the symbol of being in the water is a symbol of I was dead in my trespasses and in my sins, but we pull you up out of the water, which is a symbol of the fact that I have been made alive through Christ. And then there's a baptism into Christ, which is weird. It's a baptism that Paul talks about in Galatians 3, 27, saying that everyone who comes to faith in Christ has been baptized into Christ. Word means the same thing, to be immersed into Christ, clothed with Christ. In fact, that's the second part of the verse, being baptized into Christ. You're clothed in Christ. And when that happens, when you first come to faith, there's another kind of baptism. Word means the same thing, but it's meaning a different, it's applied a different way that Paul talks about in 1 Corinthians 12, 13, when he says that you have been baptized by the Spirit. In fact, this is even a baptism, an immersion by the Spirit, but this time it's a baptism or an immersion into the body of Christ. For by one spirit we were all baptized in one body, whether Jew or Greek, slave or free, all made to drink of one spirit. In Matthew 28, 19, it's the Great Commission, and Jesus says, I want you to go into all the world making disciples, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. And in that place, the word baptize could speak to water baptism, and I think it does, but it also speaks more specifically, the way you make disciples is to baptize people or immerse them, plunge them into everything there is to know and experience about the Father and about the Son and about the Holy Spirit. I actually think of things like that as a pastor with you over the years. Have you been here baptized into the Father? Do you know about the Father? Do you know about the Son? Do you know about the Holy Spirit? Because we as people, if we are going to grow up, become followers of Jesus. We need to be immersed in those things. It's a kind of baptism. But in Acts 1 verse 5, there is a kind of baptism from the Spirit that isn't just about being immersed into water or being immersed even into Christ for salvation. It's a baptism, an immersion, if you will, into the reality and life of the Holy Spirit for power. primarily power to do what we couldn't ordinarily do and power to be who we couldn't ordinarily be. And all of that is why we pray what we so often pray around here. When we pray, Holy Spirit, come. Because behind that request is an awareness that that's our only hope of us ever doing what God's called us to do. Because He hasn't just called us to get a big church and make people come run a good organization. Those things matter. They're good. But he's called us to be part of a program that's bringing dead people alive and deaf people here and blind people to see better have some power. Which brings us now to the Holy Spirit. Because some might be wondering, what exactly are we asking for when we're asking for the Holy Spirit to come? So we're now about the Holy Spirit, still in this kind of introductory mode in what for some of you may be for the first time, an introduction to this weird thing called the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost. Say it, the ghost. Anyway, you can just even get weird saying it. So let me introduce you to the Holy Spirit this morning, who in John 16, which I think is a good place to start the story, is being described by Jesus as a reason for hope. And he's describing the Holy Spirit is a reason for hope in the context of His trying to prepare His disciples for His departure. After three years of being together with these disciples every single day, Jesus, in John 16, verse 5, makes this announcement, that I am going now to Him who sent me, which means I'm going back to the Father. And in my going there, I'm obviously leaving here, I'm leaving you. And in verse 6 it says, and sorrow filled their hearts, which is understandable. He's going to leave. But I tell you the truth, he says in verse 7, that it is to your advantage that I do this, that I go away. For if I do not go away, the helper shall not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. And he was speaking there of the Holy Spirit, who in the book of Acts is referred to by Luke as the promise of the Father. I promise to do this, the promise of the Father who will provide for you, disciples, when I leave, a clothing with power to do what you couldn't ordinarily do and to become who you couldn't ordinarily become. So in my leaving, disciples, you're covered. No worries. I'm leaving. No problem. All of which looks real good on paper. in theory. But just for a moment, try to be in their place. Hearing these words, designed by Jesus to bring comfort and hope, even excitement. This is great, guys. You're going to love this. Anticipation is the design of Jesus to be kind of stirred up in the hearts of disciples. But that whole, hey, this is great, is a tough sell for these guys looking now at Jesus, who is still physically there, because there was a time for them not long ago, before they met Jesus, when their lives were just fine. They really were a bit boring, perhaps, but content they were to live out their lives as their fathers had and their fathers before as fishermen and tax collectors and whatever else they might have been. But then one day their life got interrupted. And we're looking for this, but this guy named Jesus happened to be from this place called Nazareth. And when they met him, their lives were interrupted and nothing would ever be the same again. Indeed, for three years, they had been captivated by the things that he said and the things that he did that they had so captivated that they had rearranged their lives, their entire lives, just to be with him. Because I want to hear what he's going to say next. And I just want to be in a place where I can see what he does next. But now, this guy Jesus is telling us he's leaving us. And that he's leaving us is actually to our advantage. One question. Who are you kidding? I don't believe this I mean maybe it's good for you Jesus to return to the one from whom you came to return to the Father but for us honest this just sounds like a cruel joke that it's somehow to our advantage that you go accept and this would maybe just be a very small thought in the midst of all the wondering of what this meant. You know Jesus well enough to know that he wouldn't say something this important that wasn't true. And what he said was this, that it's better. You're going to have to trust me on this. That it is actually advantageous to you to live in the era of the Spirit. It is more advantageous for you to live in the era of the Spirit than to live in the days when Jesus lived in the flesh. I promise. Indeed, he called it the promise of the Father, this Holy Spirit thing, both in Luke 4 and Acts 1. And in both those places, the promise of the Father was for power, to do what you couldn't ordinarily do, and to become who you couldn't ordinarily become. And when, in Acts 2, this promise is finally fulfilled, they were told to wait. In Acts 2, the waiting is over. This baptism, whatever it is, arrives. The power that was promised arrives too. And it was pretty obvious, actually. Indeed, it was epic. Manifesting first in a supernatural capacity to do what Acts 1, verse 8 said they'd be able to do. because when the Holy Spirit comes on you, you will receive power and the power will be to witness, to be my witnesses. You will be empowered to give witness to my life, to my eternal life, resurrection life, and there it is. Look at it in Acts 2 verse 4. Having been filled with the Holy Spirit, the promise of this clothing with power has come. The first thing they did was to speak in such a way that people were amazed in verse 7 and marveled because the Holy Spirit was giving them utterance. Read that on the screen, Acts 2 verse 4. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues. And the other tongues there is actually literally other languages as the Spirit was giving them utterance, which raises a question that we're actually going to unpack in detail in weeks to come. But the question around that, do you notice the little tongues thing in there? Nah. One of the questions that comes in things like this is, if I experience this baptism, will I speak in tongues? Because the first time this shows up, people are speaking in tongues. They're speaking in other languages. Is that, in fact, the sign of this baptism, this immersion into power? Because I've heard some talk, many of you would say, about this baptism of the Spirit as evidenced by the gift of tongues. So will I speak in tongues? I mean, maybe you're sitting there going, I've got to get out of here if that's the case. Or, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, the answer to that question, will we speak in tongues when the baptism comes? Is this maybe? Maybe not. And again, I'm going to unpack this more later, but here's what you need to know. The sign of this baptism isn't tongues. Not always. Sometimes. The sign of the baptism isn't wind, a mighty resting wind. Sometimes, but not always. The sign of the baptism isn't fire on everybody's head. Sometimes, but not always. But always, the sign of this baptism, this immersion, this filling is power of some kind to do what you couldn't ordinarily do, to become who you couldn't ordinarily become. Case in point is Peter. Early on in the story, Acts 2, we're still in Acts 2, that's early. This baptism has just come. And Peter, it says in 2.14, Acts 2.14 says this, that he took his stand with the eleven, this inconsistent mercurial personality, and raised his voice and declared to them, Men of Judea, and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give heed to my words. Then verse 22, he began to preach Jesus the Nazarene. Acts 2 verse 22. Jesus, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through him in your midst, as you yourselves know, because you saw this man was nailed to a cross by the hands of sinful men and put to death but God. raised him up again, a fact to which we are all witnesses. And when he was done, it says in verse 37, that they were pierced to the heart, and there were added that day 3,000 souls, which speaks to power. And the power, you know, I was reading his words. The power wasn't that he said them like I just said them, really forcefully. That wasn't the power. The power was that when he was done, Something happened that Peter couldn't make happen. 3,000 souls came alive by the Spirit. That's power. But it wasn't just power to speak. This is why this baptism spreads out to all aspects of life because there came with this baptism a new kind of power to love people. As people who for as long as anyone could remember had lived separate from and hostile to each other, began to love each other, male and female is kind of where it started. Marriages actually changed. Young and old were coming back together, slave and free, rich and poor Jew and Gentile. Why? Because the Spirit was being poured out on all flesh. Acts 2.17 and Acts 2.45 and Acts 4.34, they began to see the poor among them. And it wasn't because somebody yelled at them and made them feel like... No. See, the Spirit had fallen on them. They got drenched with Spirit. And one of the results was they began sharing whatever they might have with anyone who might have need because they'd been baptized. They'd been immersed into this spirit life. There was power to heal. Acts 19, Paul is on one of his missionary journeys. I love this phrase. We'll come to this in Acts 19, which should be 2015 or something like that. But it says extraordinary miracles were taking place at the hands of the apostles. And I love the word extraordinary because in addition to regular, ordinary, boring, everyday miracles, extraordinary miracles, which is epic. It's epic. This whole story is epic. Closer to home, closer to the actual beginning of this baptism, Acts 3, verse 6. Peter and John had been to the temple, were leaving the temple, saw this guy who every day was brought to the temple begging alms, and he was crippled. And they said to him with this confidence in the power of the Spirit, here's the deal. I know you want money, but I don't have any money. Silver and gold have I none, but what I have I'll give to you. in the name of Jesus the Nazarene, this risen one, take up your bed and walk. And he did. Which makes me wonder, did that really happen or is that some sort of metaphor of something else? And should we expect that kind of thing to happen? And people who saw that kind of thing happen, did that just happen? One of my dreams in this book of Acts is we will have more than one experience where we're sitting here and we kind of look around and go, did that just happen? there's power to be transformed by this baptism to become different kinds of people Peter again this Peter who denied that he ever saw that he ever knew Jesus in that crucible place of Jesus being brought to the cross he was being confronted with whether he was with him full of fear he denied he ever knew him not long after the events of Acts chapter 2 the same Peter is brought to the same group of people who condemned Jesus to die, the Sanhedrin, and ordered him, that is Peter, to stop speaking with threat of death. Acts 4.19 is his response. You guys, here's the deal. It's kind of my paraphrase of the verse. Whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God, you will be the judge. But I cannot stop speaking what I have seen and what I have heard. So they flogged him, it says in chapter 5, verse 40, which isn't nearly as much fun as it sounds. They whipped him, and his back was laid open, bleeding. And then they ordered him after the flogging to speak no more. And Peter, it says in chapter 5, verse 40, with his back bleeding, went away rejoicing that he had been found worthy to suffer for the name. What happened to him? What happened to him? I could go on. But I'm going to reduce it all to this. Again, in this kind of introductory. We're going pretty deep for introduction here. No, but really, it's an introductory thing. I'm going to reduce it all to this. That whenever and wherever the Spirit comes with power, whatever else the signs of it might be, Be they power to witness, to love, to heal, to change. The one constant in every case is this, that dead and dying things are brought to life. Because the life is in the breath of God, and the breath of God is the Spirit, the Holy Spirit of God. It's how you can tell it is the Spirit. And this dynamic of the breath of God, being the Spirit of God that brings life to everything it touches, comes early in the story. And I love this, because this power of the Spirit thing is evident in the world far long before Acts chapter 2. Genesis 2, pretty early in the story. Verse 7 says this, And the Lord God formed man from the dust of the earth and breathed, did God, into his nostrils the breath of life. And man became by that a living soul. More than a physical being, the breath of God, the Spirit of God came into him and he became a living soul, a spiritual being. So there's the Holy Spirit in creation doing what the Spirit does give life, which is in His breath. Indeed, there's a way in which at creation, men and women were full of the Holy Spirit. And to be full of the Spirit is to be full of life. One writer put it this way. Whenever the Old Testament refers to the Spirit of God, Life is intended because vitality and aliveness is the essence of the Spirit. Psalm 104, 29, speaking of all living things, says that when you take their breath away, they die. It's all about the breath, and they return to dust. But when you send your spirit, they are created, they come to life. In Romans 8, 2, he's called the spirit of life. In 2 Corinthians 3.6, it says that the law kills, but the Spirit gives life. John 7.38, Jesus says that whoever puts confidence in me, out of him will flow rivers of living water. Not just wet, cold, warm water, living water. And by this, he meant the Holy Spirit, whose primary function is to bring dead things to life. And so we pray, Holy Spirit, come. Fill us, baptize us, clothe us, breathe on us. Indeed, one of my favorite pictures of this, and we've talked about this before because it's one of my favorite pictures of this in the Old Testament, is where God is giving the prophet Ezekiel a vision. And it's a vision of the spiritual condition of his people, of God's people, over whom Ezekiel was a prophetic voice. And the vision wasn't good relative to their condition. Indeed, they were dead. It says Ezekiel 37 verse 1 describes it this way, as to what Ezekiel actually saw, saying, the hand of the Lord was upon me. And he brought me out by this, and I was brought out by the Spirit of the Lord, and he set me down in the middle of the valley, and it was full of bones, end of verse 2, and they were very dry. Which means that not only were these bones dead, but they'd been dead. The symbolism here of very dry is that they'd been dead for a very long time which speaks to utter hopelessness. Like we've quit even thinking that anything new can happen here when out of the vision there comes this question. And I think it's Ezekiel's question, can these bones live? In other words, is there any hope? Because he knows the vision is about the people of God? Is there any hope for this thing or these people who are not only dead, but they've been dead for a very long time, God? Is there any hope? Bring it down to you and me. So is there any hope for my marriage or my heart or this person who I love or the church or our church or the next generation? Or is there any hope for the way things are in the world? Verse 4, then the Lord said again, here's what I want you to do, Ezekiel prophesied. This isn't going to be by remote control. I'm not going to just do this. I want you to speak, Ezekiel. Prophesy over these bones and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord, which on more than one occasion I have noted whenever I've come to this text with you. Seems a little weird, speaking to dry bones. I mean, if you actually saw someone do that, you'd think them more than a little strange, but maybe no more strange than preachers who all across America right now, maybe even around the world, are preaching in rooms full of dead people, which is a scary picture. And they've been dead, maybe, for a very long time because all they ever got was religion. they never got baptized they never got immersed in this spirit life they never got filled with his breath so here's the word he's told to deliver Ezekiel is told to deliver by God verse 5 tell them that I the spirit will cause breath to enter you and you will come to life verse 6 and I will put sinews on you make flesh to grow back on you and cover you with skin and put breath in you that you may come to life. And when that happens, you will know, not because you heard it in a sermon, but because you were touched by me, that I am the Lord, your God, verse 14, and I will put my spirit in you, my breath in you, And you will come to life, and so we pray. Come, breath. Blow, wind. Fill, spirit. But now, bring all of that weird stuff I just told you about was going on even in the Old Testament. Bring it back to Acts chapter 2, where we are. Where when the Holy Spirit, the breath of God, is poured out, It says this, that they heard a noise in Acts 2, verse 2. I love this. That one of the things that happened was they heard a noise like the sound of rushing wind. What was that? Ah, it was the breath of God. And Peter, under the influence of the Spirit, he was full of the Spirit, having been immersed in the Spirit, began to explain and to proclaim that what you're seeing here is what was prophesied by the prophet Joel, who was speaking of when Joel said in Joel 2.28, that in the latter days, God would pour forth his spirit on all flesh. Acts 2.17. He would pour forth his spirit on all flesh, not just a select few, like Moses, Old Testament stories. People were used to hearing stories of the spirit falling on people like Moses and David and Deborah and Ruth, Ezekiel. And then in our day, kind of, oh yeah, the Spirit's fallen real powerfully on Paul and Peter, James, and John. But it's not just the spiritual superstars, because now your sons and your daughters will prophesy. Young men will see visions. Old men will dream dreams. All flesh, not just Jew, but Gentile, not just old, but young, not just men, but women. In other words, anyone who asks for this life of the Spirit, the Father will give it. Indeed, the promise of the Father is clear. Luke 11, 13, if you ask me for bread, I won't give you a stone. So ask for the Holy Spirit, and anyone who asks, I will give it. And with all of that, in Acts chapter 2, hope begins to rise. That maybe, just maybe, these dead bones can live. These dry and barren places in our minds and hearts and souls, in our marriages and families and churches could come alive. Indeed, I can't help but believe that some of you are asking that question right now, maybe as it applies to a variety of things, can these bones live? And it just makes me wonder, what is the dead place for you right now? What is the stuck place, the addicted place, the confused, angry, and afraid place? I'm guessing you know the place. Here's a question. Can we invite the Holy Spirit into that place? And so we pray, come, breath of God. Blow, wind of God. Baptize, immerse, fill us with the Spirit of God. Final note. Before all this happened, Jesus says, Luke is telling Theophilus, that Jesus said something to the disciples that we need to heed as well. He said, all of this is coming, but I want you to wait. I want you to be quiet. I just want you to be still and wait. And part of the reason to wait is because this isn't about you. In fact, right here, right now, be still. Close your eyes if that helps to be still. Lord, I don't know how to make this happen, but we right now in this quiet place, We lay down all our striving to figure it out, all our wanting to do it right so we get all this stuff. Help us in this place, in this space. Let the turbulent water of your spirit calm right now. some of you can feel the water calming no circumstances change in your life be still and now I pray by your spirit you stir up hope as we wait for you to manifest for your wind to blow for your spirit to flow for life to come maybe today maybe tomorrow we will wait Holy Spirit come be in and on even this study of ours as we go through this story for those among us right now who have places of where they can identify the valley full of dry bones. I pray for words, gifts of your spirit, the wind of God's to bring life. And may this ripple out from today to tomorrow to next week. I pray it ripples out into eternity because this story is epic. I thank you, God, that we get to be a part of the story. And all God's people said. Thank you.
