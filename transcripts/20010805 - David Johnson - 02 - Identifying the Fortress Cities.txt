Let's pray as we go to the Word. Father, I ask that the power of your Spirit in ways that are consistent with the Word today would be released and that from it would be borne much fruit. I pray that in your name. Amen. To the Word we have been examining these last several weeks in 1 John 5, 21, where John, at the end of his epistle, says, Little children, guard yourselves from idols. Last week, we added a picture that speaks to where I believe we are in our journey of faith as a church. The picture is found in the book of Joshua, the first three chapters, where we found the people of God on the shores of the Jordan River. The days of the Red Sea crossing and the wilderness wandering are over. Moses is dead. Joshua is the new leader, putting them on the threshold of an entirely new era in their journey of faith with God as a people, for they are about to enter into what's been referred to since the book of Exodus as the land of promise. And they are finally, as a people, going to deal with idolatrous strongholds in this promised land that heretofore they have left standing, which, by the way, is how the story of Joshua ties in with 1 John 5, 21, to guard yourselves from idols. The story of Joshua and the crossing of the Jordan River begins in chapter 1, verse 1. Let's read the first five verses just again to get caught up with the flow of the story. It came about after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spoke to Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses' servant, saying, Moses, my servant, is dead. Now therefore arise, cross this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel. And every place on which the sole of your foot treads, I have given it to you just as I spoke to Moses. From the wilderness and this Lebanon, even as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and as far as the great sea toward the setting of the sun will be your territory. No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you. I will not fail you or forsake you. so far in this prospect of crossing the Jordan River and entering the promised land it sounds easy sounds like a done deal that that can passively be received for no man will be able to stand against you he says in verse five I will give it to you verse three every place on which your foot treads belongs to you it's yours already again which gives me this impression that it's passively received. The first indication that it might not be that way is in verse 6. Be strong and courageous. Verse 7, only be strong and courageous. Verse 9, have I not commanded you, be strong and courageous. Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you. And all of that raises a question for me. If it is something I'm going to give you, and it sounds so automatic, like I can passively receive it, why would he say there, you need to be strong and courageous? Don't be timid or afraid. Well, here's why he would say that. Because the promises of God spoken of here in this journey of faith need to be, by a faith-filled, obedient partnership with God, And to be fully possessed, some things need to be dispossessed. In chapter 3, verse 10, it says this, And Joshua said, You see, when the people of God crossed the Jordan River into the promised land, And the land was full, as we indicated last week, of cities, fortress cities. And this became for us an analogy. It's a story that physically happened to these people. But for us, it's a story that is analogous to spiritual warfare. And going into this promised land, it's not something we move into and just start sipping lemonade because it's all there. There are cities, strongholds, if you will, of the enemy that need to be taken. These fortresses, cities, whether it was physically faced by these people or spiritually faced by us, strongholds in our lives or in our family or in the community within which we live, or maybe even strongholds in our church, strongholds are always intimidating. Most strongholds that are intimidating are intimidating partly because they've been there a long time. They are established. Their walls are high and thick. The inhabitants are strong and well-armed. And one of the initial responses to any stronghold that becomes apparent in your life, church, community, family, is this. Who on earth am I? Who on earth are we to think that we could bring down and inhabit in a healthy way these fortified cities? They've been here for long, forever it seems like. Again, in our family it's just been this way. In our church it's just been this way. Hear the word of the Lord to that trepidation, to that fear that we're nothing to bring these strongholds down. The word of the Lord in Joshua is this. It's not going to be you. I will dispossess the Canaanites. I will crumble the walls of Jericho. You be strong and courageous. Don't be timid or dismayed. You be willing to put your feet where I tell you to put your feet, to come against what I tell you to come against. I will bring the wall down. And as you begin to move toward the strongholds in your life, family, church, community that I identify to you that I want you to go against, do it with confidence in this promise that I will be with you wherever you go. But before you go anywhere, people of God, Church of Jesus Christ, before you do anything, and by the way, I'm getting this before you do anything dynamic from the fact that in the text where we are in Joshua, they haven't crossed the Jordan River. Before you cross the Jordan River and take on the Jerichos of the world, prepare yourselves, chapter 1, verse 11, and consecrate yourselves, chapter 3, verse 5. That's what you do before you take all this stuff on. In other words, don't just rush these cities. Church, don't just rattle your spiritual sabers expecting walls to come down the first time you blow your horn. Prepare yourselves. Consecrate yourselves first. and part of how in the story of Joshua the people did this preparation and there were other things they did as well but one of the things that's just clearly part of the story was by way of preparation they sent out spies chapter 2 verse 1 go view the land was their assignment and again this was before they went they just sent out a few come back and tell us what's going on in other words before we go win the world for God this afternoon and we could maybe lather things up and get everybody all worked and we're going to do it now and send you out the door. Yes, no, no, no, no, no, no. Slow down, slow down. Let's find out what we're up against first. We're going to send some spies out. Come back, view the land, come back and tell us what cities are strategic in this culture we live in. How big are the walls? How many are their soldiers? What gods do they serve? So that we can know how to prepare. so that we can know how to pray, so that we know what we're up against. Well, the first city they had to face was Jericho. In fact, in chapter 2, verse 1, it says, Go view the land, especially Jericho, because that was the first place they were going to go. The primary people group they were going to face were the Canaanites. And I just want you to note this. When the story mentions the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Jebusites, and all the ites kinds of people, it wasn't as if the Canaanites lived in one city and the Hittites all lived in another city and the Jebusites were somewhere else. You just need to know that the Canaanites and the Hittites, they were in every city. Certain cities were maybe more dominant in terms of the Canaanites and things like that. But you were gonna run into Canaanites wherever you went. You're gonna run into Jebusites wherever you went. Sometimes, again, there'd be varying degrees of influence. But the first people group that's mentioned as being most prominent, that the people of God, when they crossed the Jordan River, were going to face were these Canaanites. And the God of the Canaanites, any spy who just had their eyes open would notice, was the God called Baal. We have spoken of Baal before. As these spies would come back, whatever else it is that they would report, their report would at least entail this. What we're up against, among other things, is Baal. We're up against the God of money, sex, and power because that's what Baal's about. What these people worship, the spies would come back and say, is money, sex, and power. So people of God, before you've crossed the Jordan River, are you ready to take on the gods of money, sex, and power? Are you ready to confront that? Are you ready to bring those walls down to set those people straight? Well, some of you might think, yes, I am. Here's the word of the Lord. Before you think, you go rattle your sabers and bring all that down and wag your finger and correct the whole wide world. Prepare yourself. Consecrate yourself. Don't go blowing your horn quite yet. You're not prepared to bring these walls down. Now, the way all of that story applies to us so far, I indicated last week was this, that I believe that where we are specifically in our journey of faith as a church is in many ways similar to that of the people of God on the shores of the Jordan River, that like them, we are on the threshold of and about to enter into an entirely new era of life and ministry. And the essence of it isn't found in our physical journey, though it's captured somewhat in that, this time of transition. While we're meeting in this building, we've been in Robbinsdale, we're going to Maple Grove, and here we are with a sense that we're going somewhere, physically, obviously, but spiritually as well. I believe, quite frankly, we are on the threshold of an era that will be marked, on one hand, by incredible opportunities for success in the best kingdom sense of the world, word, but dangers as well. So the word of the Lord to us in these days, I declared last week, is this, Church of the Open Door, consider this season of transition from Robbinsdale to Maple Grove, a season set apart to prepare yourselves and consecrate yourselves. Don't just be rushing in, Raffling your spiritual sabers, expecting walls to fall down the first time you blow your horn. First, prepare yourselves. Consecrate yourselves. And part of that preparation, just kind of follow the flow of this story so far, is the sending out of spies. Go view the land. It's a very wise thing. I want to just go to that. No, no, no, no. Don't just run in there. Go view the land. In the culture within which we live, in the land in which God has, by his sovereign choice, placed this church at this time in this city, a very wise thing to do from time to time is wonder what strongholds in this city, in this community are strategic. How big are the walls? How many are the soldiers? What gods do they serve? How pervasive is their sin? In other words, in this time and place that God has chosen to place this church? What are we up against? What do we need to be ready for in order to have a kingdom effect and not just go to Maple Grove and just be another church that kind of sits there taking up space, doing our little isolated thing? Well, if we were to send out spies, not just to Maple Grove, it into the culture to come back and tell us what's going on in the culture. What are the strategic strongholds? What gods do they serve? It would not require spies of great discernment to come back and say, we live in a culture that worships the God of money, power, and sex. That's about a five minute journey of thought to figure that one out. Well, if it's true that we do live in a culture that worships the God of money, power, and sex, then interestingly, what that means is this, that we are up against exactly what Joshua and the people of God were up against when they were about to cross the Jordan River. See, we're up against Baal. We are up against the God of the Canaanites. For Baal, even by a different name, all cleaned up and suburban, is still Baal. What I want to do this weekend is essentially bring to you, and this is a little different than what we normally do. I want to bring today the spies report about what we're up against. Before we get all excited and win the world for God, church of the open door, in this time of preparation and consecration, let's hear the spies report. Go view the land. and what we see in the land is Baal. I've spoken to you of Baal before, to teaching I've done at least twice. Many of you have heard it, to teaching that we've talked about at leadership levels that we should probably figure out a way to bring at least once a year, just to kind of remind us of the context within which we live and are trying to minister and do our families. There are two things with Baal this morning I want to do. Number one, I want to identify Baal historically And that's some teaching you've probably heard before from me. Number two, I want to put a face on Baal presently. Let me just give you the history of Baal. So again, you are reminded as to what I'm even talking about. Among the false gods to which Israel had consistently been vulnerable, you'll see this all through Scripture, Baal posed the greatest threat. Baal is mentioned 63 times in Scripture in different localities. Baal had a different name, but no matter where Baal showed up, whatever the name was, it was still Baal. And sometimes in different cities, the worship and the form of the worship would kind of take on a different form and a little different look. But after you scratch beneath the surface, you would see their money, sex, power. The pursuit and worship of those three things is what Baal is. The worship of Baal was thought to increase one's abundance. That was kind of the essence of Baal. God of fertility, the worship of Baal was thought to increase one's capacity, in particular, to possess. In fact, the word Baal literally means Lord Possessor. So at the core of Baal and Baal worship is the capacity to possess, among other things, possessions, power, money, and control. Now, in addition to Baal being about the possession of power, money, and control, there's a very strong sexual component. And most of us even think when you talk about Baal worship that sexuality or disordered sexuality was the core of it. It was not the core of it. The core sexuality and disordered sexuality was mixed in horribly, but at the core of Baal worship was this pursuit of power of possessions and money. And in the midst of that, sexuality got horribly disordered. It would often work like this. In your pursuit of possessions, power, and money, this sexuality would be mixed, it'd become disordered, and sometimes, therefore, you would use your sex to get power. Power was what you really wanted. You used the sex to get that. Sometimes people used their sexuality to get possessions or get control or get money. Sometimes that would get flipped the other way, where people would begin to use their power, possessions, money, and control to get sex. There's a trap in all of this. For once you possessed, through your worship of Baal, what you wanted to possess, be it money, power, or control, or sexuality, it would turn on you and begin to possess you. He is Lord Possessor, this Baal God. Here's how it worked in your pursuit of money, power, and sex, people would often end up, because of the blindness with which they were pursuing these things, abandoning the things that ultimately they cared the most about. In other words, in their pursuit madly of power, money, control, and sexuality, they would sacrifice on the altar of Baal things like their family, their friends, their relationships, even their own health. Baal had a female counterpart her name was Ashtoreth her priests were eunuchs dressed in women's clothes it's a bizarre thought, not at all they were the original transvestites, that's who they were her female devotees were prostitutes for men and sexual orgies were the main part of worship in their temples and as you kind of think of a temple and you think of worship and then you put sexual orgies in there you think, well, that just is too bizarre I can't even picture that. It's hard to imagine. Not really. At all hard to imagine. For if you were to go right now to any singles bar in Minneapolis area, if you were to go to any gay bar, strip joint, adult bookstore, maybe 20 minutes from here, you would find there up close and personal the worship of Baal and Ashtoreth. And their temples don't look like temples. They look like a bar. or they look like a scripture, or they look like an adult bookstore. For Baal, even by a different name, is still Baal. Leanne Payne, in her wonderful working with this issue of Baal and Baal worship, has this to say about all that. And I quote, whenever there is the worship of the created, like in Romans where it says they quit, they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and began to worship not the creator but the created, whenever that happens, sexual orgies eventually follow. We either worship the creator or we begin to worship our own ability to create, even descending into the worship of our procreative faculties or sex. Finally, a quite literal worship of men's and women's own genitals ensues. Demons, principalities, and powers attend this worship, And the dark inroads into human sexuality and personality from this kind of activity are almost incomprehensible. So the next time you think it might be fun to rent an adult video or go to a strip joint, because wouldn't that be funny, or log time on the internet, dialing into the pornography things that are so available there, Consider the possibility that what you're really doing is more than just a bad choice. You have walked into a worship service attended by demons and you've bowed down to Baal. Payne goes on to say this. The worship of Baal in whatever culture it is found always eventually manifests itself in phallicism. meaning the worship of the phallus as a symbol, primarily of male generative power. In the worship of Ashtoreth, things get flipped, and the symbol changes from the male organ to the female sexual organs. Indeed, some sort of worship. Well, that's a bizarre thought. Such symbols become objects of worship. They do. Well, this was a weird culture. We're carried on with all sorts of sexual impurity by crowds of devotees involved in, unbeknownst to them, demonized orgies. And again, you just think, what? More familiar than we know. You may be connecting the dots already for yourself. And if you haven't seen it, your kids probably have. MTV coverage of spring break is what this is. Bikini contests, wet t-shirt contests are ceremonies. Never saw them as a worship service before. That's exactly what they are. As we bow down to and give reverence to and then vote on what? Body parts. It's called Baal worship. You know, when we see these things in the media and we're horrified as we ought to be and we just get this idea, oh, this culture is getting worse and worse. It's never been like this. you need to understand that what you're seeing is absolutely nothing new. The worship of Baal that we see in our culture is exactly what Joshua and the people of God were needing to prepare themselves for and consecrate themselves for before they crossed the river and went where God was calling them to go. Because they had some work to do themselves before they had anything to say. well that's the identity of Baal historically what I want to do now is try to put a face on Baal presently to do that I'm going to show you an excerpt and this is a little unusual for us from a public broadcast system video that I saw a couple of weeks ago on channel 2 the education channel here in town at least in our TV that comes on channel 2 PBS in this video the face of Baal is revealed in a very sobering but much closer to home way than many of us might consciously be aware. Among the things I want you to look for, in fact, just kind of help you to take in everything you need to see in this video, among the things I want you to look for and notice are these things, that this suburb of Atlanta, which is being highlighted here, might as well be where we live. It might as well be Maple Grove, quite frankly, that at no time in this video will you hear the word Baal mentioned. Not once But Baal, even by a different name Is still Baal What I want you to look for And just kind of make a mental note Every time you see disordered power Disordered sex Or disordered pursuits of money Just know It's Baal, that's Baal, that's what it is And what I want you also to do Is just kind of let you into Why we're even showing the video I want you to consider that the video we're showing Might just be the kind of report that present-day spies would bring back if they were given the assignment of Joshua 2, verse 1. What was the assignment? Go view the land, especially Jericho, especially Maple Grove. This isn't Maple Grove, but it might as well be. You're about to see disordered sex. You're about to see disordered sex given birth by disordered pursuits of power and money. what you're about to see is Baal with a very familiar face. Rockdale County is the outer edge of what has been called the fastest growing settlement in human history. The rings of suburbs surrounding greater Atlanta. It was a surprise then when something happened among a number of the teenagers here that revealed a life unknown to their parents. It all began, investigators would determine, with a loosely knit group of friends. In many ways, they were indistinguishable from other teenagers in Conyers. Most drove nice cars, lived in new homes, and on weekend nights gathered on the strip looking for something to do. I actually called my colleagues and at the time I said, hey, you're not going to believe this. We have an outbreak of syphilis in a middle-class, largely white community, a suburb of Atlanta. What was unusual about this particular outbreak is that it focused around a group of young girls. They were described to me as almost cherubic in some of their characteristics, and again, very young, some of them 13 years of age. Noelle and her colleagues constructed a chart tracing the sexual histories of each infected teenager. As the investigation progressed, the number of contacts named by the kids multiplied, and multiplied again. Actually, I mean, it was a social thing, but it was more of an underground railroad thing. It was just everybody was secretively having sex with everybody, and everybody knew it. Teenagers knew it, but parents never knew. It's no big deal anymore. It's just a thing. It's just like going to school every day, getting up and going to school. Oh, you know, you meet this guy, let's have sex. That's just how it is with people now. I was like, no, I don't care. These guys say such sweet things. I know. They say it to me. They say, you know, you're so beautiful, and they don't even know, and, you know, I care about you, and I love you, I want to be with you forever. Please, you know, they don't know what that means. Let us go to class. Do you enjoy it? No, sex sucks, actually, so I think only guys benefit from it. When it comes to teenage sex, the community sends a clear message to its teens. At school, there is a comprehensive sex ed curriculum that centers on abstinence. In a popular after-school program, 7th graders pledge their virginity until marriage. Do you think of girls who decide they're going to stay virgin until they get married? It's not going to happen. I mean, there's still a few out there that... actually do say virgins till they get married and that's real good I wish I could have done that but it's just most of them that say that that's gonna they're gonna do that it's not gonna happen it's a typical age for girls to lose their virginity 13 14 14 that's typical you regret losing your virginity It was one night stand. Why? Because I was too young. We weren't going out. It was one night stand. How old were you? Thirteen. It was a one night stand? One kid many of them wanted to be seen with was DJ, a 14-year-old known for his charm and a streak of recklessness. I didn't really want to be notorious. I wanted to be popular. I wanted to be famous. I wanted people to like me. I didn't want people to hate me. I always tried to be the likable one. And I could be. DJ had money and little supervision at home. His parents were divorced, and he had moved in with a family friend, whom he called his godfather. My father is a good businessman, my godfather. He would buy me really anything. and just give me all the money I wanted, any time I needed it, whatever I wanted, and buy it for me. I felt like I've never had anybody. Never had the family that would be there for you, the friends that would be there for you. I always felt like I was out in the cold. - How did the guys in general treat the girls? - They were mean to 'em a lot. They treated them like they were just, I don't know, not trash, but not very, like, respectable. And the girls seemed not to care. I don't know why. You didn't ever get angry at them? I did a few times, but I couldn't really do anything about it. Because they just, they wouldn't care. They just told me to go home or something. Why didn't you? I don't know. I don't know. I just, I would be alone then. Most of my friends' parents were not the kind of parents that really cared. They cared what went on, but if it interfered with their lives, then it really wasn't. They didn't want to bother with it. I knew it was possible that it was happening, you know, that she was sexually active. But we didn't sit down and talk about the diseases and the dangers of that out there either. And I know it's there. I guess if we could have talked more about what she was doing then, we didn't. You know, we didn't talk that much about what was happening when she was not with us. I'm not a George Bush fan but when he talked about the family unit and the breakdown of the family unit that's the way it is I do as much to destroy it as anybody else we've got TVs in every room of the house I watch my programs my wife watches her programs in another room in the house the kids watch it or play on the Ataris the video games you mentioned a while ago about the time we spent together. Yeah, we would spend time together, but much of the time that we had in the house together was not together. What was so extraordinary to me is these parents started looking for externally who to blame. This has caused this. TV has caused that. External groups have caused this. But few of them, none of them that I can recall, ever looked to themselves. And the minister turned to me and said, they don't see. It's them. It's the parents. They have done this. The kids don't talk to them. I think you should, you know, put your foot down and tell them that you're not going to put up with this and that. And just the other day, I mean, Jenny was in here talking, and she said, she was saying, I wish you'd have been more strict. You should have been more strict with me. And I said, Jenny, how can you, you wouldn't let me be strict. Their daughter Jenny is 19. They used to be real strict on us, but it was like us kids kind of took over. and started doing what we wanted to, and they just gave up. Seems like you've lost the war for control against your husband and your kids. Yeah, I have literally gave up. A lot of the adolescents had parents who worked, were at home alone, had parents who put in 40, 60, 80-hour work weeks, and were doing that to ensure that all the resources that they wanted to give to their children were available. Parents just, they know that it's out there, but they don't know it's that close to, you know, where you're at. It's everywhere. I probably took more of the blame than I gave her because I felt like I was not the parent I should have been. I should have been home. So, yeah. It's painful. Yeah, it is. can't go back no no and that's why i knew when she told me that we can't go back you know we have to go forward now what do we do so we're trying to do last spring pat quit her job and started her own company allowing her to spend more time at home with Heather. Do you think that on some level Heather might have wanted you to step in and take control? Yes, I do. What makes you think that? Because she kept getting worse. And once I took control, she has done so much better. I mean, it's just, it's night and day. It's night and day. I think she was crying out for help. I really do. Oh my God. The face of Baal. And what happens to people when they worship at the temple of what he offers. What he offers is disordered sex, money, and power. Once you scratch beneath the surface seduction of the external attraction, the face is not a pretty face. In fact, its effect is frozen in the lostness of that little girl at the end of the video. It is not a pretty face. But it is a familiar face. It wasn't that hard to spot in the video, was it? Did you see the disordered sexuality? That was the easiest thing to spot, actually. That was the presenting issue of the video. That's why the news crew went down to the suburb, because they heard about this outbreak of syphilis among very, very young children. But could you tell that sex was not the real problem? Are you saying it was a huge problem? But that was not the root of the problem. In fact, the disordered sexuality was a flag that said something far more serious is going on here. For people had begun in their pursuit of power, possessions, and money to abandon their children. Was it something that you noticed, I mean, it was obvious, I think, that these kids didn't want sex? In fact, one of the kids, the girls themselves, and if you were able to watch the whole 90 minutes, this was a theme that came on over and over again. One minute they would be talking just kind of cavalierly and casually about sex, and just kind of going, grab them and say, shake them. And then the next second there would be a sobriety come over them when they were asked if they enjoyed it. No, I didn't. You know what these kids wanted? Connection. You know what they longed for? Intimacy, authentic love. These kids were normal. What they were doing wasn't normal. But what they wanted was normal. But their parents had quite literally sacrificed them to Baal. We hear of ancient cultures that practiced human sacrifice. You know, you watch this thing on some history channel, and they'll show you in this culture. And we're just horrified. Oh, I'm glad we don't live then. It still happens. Powerful and successful at work, passive and powerless at home. It's another thing that affected me when I watched the video. The disordered sex was easy to spot. The disordered relationship with money, the pursuit of wealth was easy to spot. But I was thinking, where's the power thing? That's the bail package, the power, pursuit of power. And what dawned on me was because normally I look at power as being that crushing mean and you know where are the mean parents you know the crushing and what dawned on me was that what we have is disordered power they had learned how to use power to procure the money and the finances they had used power to be successful in the corporate world but where God had called them by virtue of how we're wired as people to wield authentic authority and some real power at home, what happened there? No power. Power less. That's disordered power. It'll be hard to forget. I hope you never forget that one woman who said, you know, my daughter thought I should be more strict, but then I looked at her and said, you wouldn't let me. You wouldn't let me. Who's got the power? It's disordered power. so what do we do well dearly beloved before we wag our fingers and shake our heads and become indignant about what we see in our culture before we make a list of all the people we want to send this videotape to before we rattle our spiritual sabers and blow our spiritual horn maybe we should wonder if we're really very different maybe we should ask God to show us the ways we bow down to and serve Baal as well before they cross the Jordan River before they cross the Jordan River the word to them was this prepare yourselves consecrate yourselves examine yourselves and repent then when you cross the Jordan River and go to the place that I am calling you you might have something of value to say you might have something of life giving virtue to offer I want to close this morning not with a bang, no rattling sabers no we're going to win the world, none of that but in the spirit of preparation and consecration, some very quiet examination just with God in you, I want you to close your eyes and bow your heads and I just want to give you a moment of silence and let God speak what he wants to speak and then after just a very short time of that we're going to begin to play a song that I believe you are going to be able to enter into as a song of repentance and as best you can give your spirit to it and wonder what God can do and begin to move even as you just let this affect you let's be quiet Thank you. Thank you.
