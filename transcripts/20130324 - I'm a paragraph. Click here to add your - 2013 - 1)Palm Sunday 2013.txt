A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, Hosanna to the son of David. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest heaven. When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, Who is this? The crowds answered, This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. God, thanks for your grace and your mercy. And so right now, as we open up your word, I pray that you would meet us where we're at, that you would open our eyes to see, open our ears to hear the life that you're calling us into. And then you'd give us the courage to respond and move toward you, and so that we can really live. In your name, amen. Okay, well, Julie, I just read the text that I'm going to be preaching from, And I love it, especially when a female reads that, because then you hear God's word in beautiful stereo, the male voice, the female voice, and we get a much fuller picture of who God is, both male and female, and it's beautiful and wonderful. Now, there's a couple words that I think you need to get your minds around in order to understand what was really happening. The first one is Hosanna, because we don't really use this word in 21st century nomenclature. We do not go to the Vikings game shouting Hosanna. We shout other things. Some are appropriate and some are not to utter in a church building. But that's the kind of spirit actually that was happening on that day on Palm Sunday. It was rowdy. It was an adventure. People were fired up. People were excited. And they were saying Hosanna, which turned into, it meant something. It really did mean to be saved. It meant to be delivered. It meant to be liberated. And it also meant what you would say when you were hoping for victory. It was a kind of a chant that you would say if you felt like your team was about to win. You know what I mean? This is what you would say. So on the one hand, it really could be interpreted as a cry for saving from someone who was down on their luck and desperate. On this day in Palm Sunday, with the crowds waving the branches and putting them down on the floor for Jesus to ride in on his donkey, which was the way that kings were coronated back in the day. It sounds very funny for us that Jesus would be riding on a donkey. I mean, it almost sounds like, why would you pick a donkey? That's so weird. But that was what custom called him to do. When a king would come to be crowned king, he would be riding on a donkey. And so people were shouting, Hosanna. And they were shouting, Hosanna, save us. Because when Jesus rode into Jerusalem in the first century, Jerusalem was a hotbed of corruption. The Roman Empire taxed the Jewish citizens to the point of poverty and were absolutely in this city of Jerusalem ruling over them. And there was not the freedom for them to worship in the way that they wanted to worship. And there was also religious corruption. You remember when Jesus came into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, one of the first things he did was go into the temple, and he overturned the money changers' tables. And I never really understood, like, you know, okay, so that means don't sell books in the gathering place, right? Well, actually, Jesus was not mad because they were selling Chris Tomlin CDs in the temple courts. He was unbelievably incensed because what they were doing was families would come in with their spotless lambs that they had raised since that lamb was a baby in order to enter into the temple on this Jewish festival and meet with God. And what the temple officials were doing as a way to get even more rich is they would inspect the lambs that these families would bring in to see if they were spotless enough. And inevitably, they would find that they were not spotless enough. And then they would say, but you're in luck. We have some pre-approved lambs in the back that we will bring out and sell to you for a very high price. And that's the introduction that people would get after traveling for days and days to meet with God. And Jesus said, no. This is not the way my father's house is gonna run. And so Jesus came to the shouts of Hosanna because people really did need to be saved from corruption. And it was a messy scenario. But the other word I want you to dial into is this word, in the Greek it's translated seismos, but in the English it was translated stirred. Do you remember when we just read that? The whole city was stirred. Now, when you learn about seismos is the word, and it means to rock, to agitate, to throw into a tremor. It's where we get our word seismic, when the plate tectonics shift and cause an earthquake. To me, stirred is not exactly a good translation for what it means that Jesus was doing on this day in Jerusalem. I stir a cup of tea. I am stirred by Downton Abbey. Thank you. You like Downton Abbey. It's great. When Jesus rode into Jerusalem on that day and the whole city rocked, what it means is people were sensing and feeling that the foundation upon which they had stood for years and years was about to break apart because of the force of this person named Jesus of Nazareth, the prophet, and he was coming in to do something that if you miss, then you'll miss the beauty of Resurrection Sunday one week from now. This word seismos is also used in Matthew 27, 51, describing the moment that Jesus died on the cross. At that moment, Matthew 27, 51, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth seismos, the earth was stirred. The earth shook, the rocks split. And then when Jesus rose again, the word is also used. And Jesus bust out of the tomb, which we'll celebrate seven days from now. We read that the guards were so afraid of Jesus when he came out of that tomb that they shook and became like dead men. Now my guess is when you apply to be a guard of a tomb, you're a pretty tough dude, right? You've seen probably a lot. So for them to have that reaction, to shake like a dead man, meant that something incredibly powerful was unfolding right before their eyes. And that was what was happening on Palm Sunday. If you don't understand the confrontation that Palm Sunday brings, then Easter Sunday will be a series of events which includes hunting for your Easter eggs inside because we're so sorry we can't do it outside this year because of the snow, and getting to brunch on time, and you will miss the fact that the resurrection of Jesus was the hinge point in human history, ushering in an era of completeness and wholeness that Jesus would come and bring and is coming to bring. But if you miss the confrontation of Palm Sunday, then you'll miss all of that. In fact, Jesus, when he came into Jerusalem that day, he came to knock something down and he came to raise something up. He came to knock down the corrupt system religiously and politically and economically of his time, but he also came to knock down our stubborn insistence that our team's gonna win. He came to knock down our pride. Because in truth, we are all a mixed bag. On Sunday, Palm Sunday, we shout Hosanna, but we're the same people who on Friday will shout, crucify him. And so Jesus is marching into Jerusalem, into all of our mixed bagness. And if you miss that, you'll miss the whole story of this whole week, the holy week. So when the children of Israel cried Hosanna, save us, the redemptive arc of the story of Israel and actually our story can really be located in three different geographic areas. Egypt, Sinai, and Jerusalem. So Egypt is the place where the children of Israel moved from bondage to freedom or from slavery to freedom. And so in Egypt, if you were a young child of Israel learning about the story of Israel, at any time that anyone ever brought up Egypt, an immediate status update would flash upon your screen, if you know what I'm saying. Egypt meant slavery. Egypt meant 400 years of our ancestors being forced to make bricks to build the empire that was Egypt. And Egypt was the most, Egypt was the richest, most prosperous country in the world at that time. And the children of Israel for 400 years were slaves to that empire. They couldn't go where they wanted to go. And many, many people were born, lived, and died during that era. And so the cries of the children of Israel would constantly go up to God. God save us. Hosanna, Hosanna. God save us. and then in Exodus chapter 3 verses 7 and 8 when Moses met with God at the burning bush the next thing the Lord said to Moses is that I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers and I am concerned about their suffering so I God says have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land. The story of Egypt is the story where we cry out in our slavery and when we are saved by God's grace. When we could do nothing for ourselves. When we cried out over and over again, God save me, God save me. And then God came. And you know the story. God led God's people out of Egypt across the Red Sea and then onto another journey of wandering the desert for another 40 years. But the identity of the children of Israel as it relates to Egypt is moving from slavery or bondage to freedom. So question for you. What does it mean to be set free? what does it mean to be set free I think in order to understand what it means to be set free you have to understand where it is that you are enslaved right you have to be honest about those places in your life the Egypt in your life where you are stuck where are the places in your life that you absolutely cannot get out of on your own whether because of your own sin or because of the sin of someone else and you're crying out to God and saying, God save me, Hosanna. Where are those places in your life and what would it mean to be set free? Well, about a month and a half ago, I was sitting in the window room right across the gathering place in one of our all staff meetings at Open Door and I love these meetings because every month a different area leads them like Next Steps leads them, or Groups leads them, Next Gen leads them, Kids leads them. And one of my favorite parts of our All Staff meetings is that we invite people from the community to come in, I mean, from the congregation, to come in and share their story. And so on this particular day, I met this beautiful man named Dave. And there we all are. There's Dave and actually another Dave. And Dave, the guy in the blue, shared his story that day. and he gave me permission to share it with you. And his story includes being abandoned by his father, having an alcoholic mother who abused him and his brothers and eventually kicked all the brothers out of the house. It involves a lot of sickness in his family. It involves divorce. It involves anxiety, depression, and attempted suicide a couple of years ago. And as he was telling us his story, I mean, I'm sitting in there. I mean, the room is just silent. And I just start weeping because it's just so sacred what he's doing, so vulnerably sharing his story. And then he said a couple years ago in 2011, his oldest daughter came to him and said, Daddy, I love you, but I love God more. Which is beautiful, isn't it? Except for they weren't going to church. I mean, they weren't having, you know, like spiritual conversations. I mean, they weren't. She just said this, and it was like this wake-up call for him. It was one of the whispers that God used to get his attention. So he began to seek spiritual advice from friends, and he found his way to Open Door. And he's the story, he tells the story that many of you have where he came in and then just started crying. And God began to meet him, and he was blown away, and he loved what God was doing here. So he signed up for Open Door 101, this beautiful class that Al Shuck leads. and if you sign up for 101, you get assigned to a table. And at that table are table leaders. And Dave and Jan Nelson were the table leaders of Dave. And the table leader's job is to love the people at the table. That's their job description. It's beautiful. And so Dave started talking to Dave and Jan and had numerous conversations. And over the course of months, God began to set him free and point him toward life. And Dave is now in a process of becoming fully alive in God. and it is a beautiful thing to watch. And at this all staff meeting, he brought his membership agreement because if you go to 101, you have an opportunity to become a member if you want to. And so there's a sheet that you actually sign and he brought it to the all staff meeting. He said, you know what? I've signed up for a lot of things in my life. I've been flaky, but I didn't want to be flaky about this one. I wanted to make sure this was the right deal. So he brought it and he said, but standing in front of you all today, I just want to be, I'm just so thankful to you. I'm so thankful to God, and I want to become a member of this place right here and right now. So he signed it. And I mean, it was like, ah. Because it was one story of someone moving from death to life, from slavery to freedom. And it's a journey, right? I mean, it's a process. He's still moving from slavery to freedom in some areas. And that is the story of many of you in this church. And so this place of what does it mean to be set free? first you need to be honest about where it is you're enslaved. So that could be a good question for you. Where are you enslaved, either by your own sin or maybe the oppression of someone else? And what would it mean for you to cry out to God to be free? The second geographical place in the story of the children of Israel and also in our story is Sinai. Now Sinai is the mountain that Moses climbed on his own to get the Ten Commandments from God. And then, remember, he spent 40 days up there in the cloud, and then he came down, and he found his brother leading the people, and they had made a golden calf, and they were all worshiping him. And so it was like, I leave for 40 days. But he came down with these Ten Commandments, and they've been so, I think, misunderstood over the course of at least my upbringing in the church. These were the ten rules that you better at least follow these ten rules, or else you're a terrible person. Well, really what they are is wedding vows. I will not have another God except for you, God. I won't kill anyone else. I won't want what's not mine. You know, these basic things that are wedding vows. Because in Sinai, the story is we move from wandering, remember in the desert for 40 years, we wander, we wander, we wander, to being in covenant. And this is a whole different step in your relationship with God where we're always being rescued. In Egypt, we're being rescued and we always are being rescued. But if that's your identity, rescued one for your whole life, you never move to the next click in your relationship with God and that is I am covenanted with God. God is my God and I will go God's way, which involves things like partnering with God and obeying God and sometimes saying no to the things that I want so I can say yes to the things that God wants in my life and in the world around me. Exodus chapter 19, after Moses comes down, this is what God says to God's people. Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine, you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. God is saying, you know, yes, I rescued you, and you will always be rescued. I will always need to rescue you, but I'm inviting you into a whole other part of relationship with me, which is me investing in you and you following me like a married couple that lives their life together. Jesus echoes this later on in John 14, verse 23. Jesus says, anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My father will love him and we will come to him and make our home in him or her. And I love that picture. So question, what does it mean? I love that picture. I love it. What does it mean to be in covenant with God? I remember 18 years ago when I was just starting out as a pastor I was coming to Open Door on Saturday nights and I somehow got a meeting with Dave Johnson and I was talking to him about ministry and I was asking him about ministry and about whatever else that how do you preach like that? and about ministry he said oh Steve it's super hard typical Dave fashion oh it's horrible actually awesome I was 25 at the time, you know, full of certainty and idealism. But he goes, here's what I've learned. He goes, are you married? And I was at the time for about five minutes. I had been married for about five minutes at that time. And he said, well, me and Bonnie have learned to say this thing to each other that no matter how hard ministry is, no matter how bad it goes, at the end of it all, when it's all done, it's me and you. Me and you. And he said, I would encourage you to say that to Mary because ministry is going to go up and down, but at the end of it all, when it's all over, it's me and you. And this is the picture of what God wants with you. At the end of your long life, filled with all the mistakes that you're going to make, continuously, all the things you're going to continually need to be rescued by God from, and all the joys and all the highs and all the lows. God wants to say, I want a relationship with you that is so close that at the end of it all, it's me and you sitting on the porch of life, sipping our iced teas and smiling because we did it together, you and me. That's the kind of relationship that God wants with you. And yes, God will continue to rescue you out of Egypt, but God wants more than that. God wants a relationship with you that is covenanted, that you are God's and God's alone, and that you will go God's way. And that's what Jesus came into Jerusalem wanting to convey on that Palm Sunday. The third geographical place that is a part of the story of the children of Israel is Jerusalem. And in Jerusalem, we move from hiddenness to wholeness. From hiddenness to wholeness. I get that from Luke chapter 19, verses 41 and 42. And sorry about the typo, third service in a row. I haven't fixed that. I'm so sorry. As he approached Jerusalem, that is Jesus, and saw the city, he wept over it. And he said, if you, even you, had known on this day what would bring you peace. but now it's hidden from your eyes. Those three words that are bolded, you need to understand just super quick. Kla'o means to weep or wail with the emphasis on the noise that accompanies the weeping. Jesus, when he entered Jerusalem, it was not one single tear that he stoically sucked back in. It was a wailing because he felt such sadness about the state of God's people at that time in history, that it was not as it should be, that they were not following God, that they were not covenanted to God. And he felt such compassion that he wept and he went right into the center of that city anyway. And he said, if only you had known what brought you peace, and the word for peace is shalom. The Greek word is erene, actually, but the root word of that is this Hebrew word called shalom. And it doesn't mean peace as in no conflict. It means completeness or soundness, integrity. It means to have total welfare or to be at peace in the sense that you are as you should be, whole and complete. And Jesus was saying that my people are not whole and complete. And individuals are not whole and complete. And it's been hidden from their eyes. The word hidden is crypto, and if you get the nuance of this, it's really quite a confrontation. It means to cause to be safe or protected by hiding in some context with the intent of not being found. Have you ever done that? You ever done that in a relationship? You kind of hide away, and you're hoping they won't find you. We do this with God all the time. I mean, this third place, Jerusalem, if Exodus is the place where we're freed from bondage and Sinai is the place where we enter into covenant, Jerusalem is the epicenter of where the earthquake is gonna happen. Jerusalem is the epicenter of the activity of God in the world and in your life. And when you move from bondage to freedom and when you move into covenant with God and when you're partnering with what God wants you to do in the world and you are at the epicenter of the activity of God in your life, it is scary. Amen? It's freaky because you're right in the center of what is happening. And sometimes it's overwhelming. And God is with you and God will give you what you need, but it doesn't stop it from being scary. In my experience, when it gets scary, that's when I want to hide. And it's not because I'm not covenant to God and it's not because I'm on a journey of being set free, it's because it's overwhelming and I get afraid. And Jesus is marching into Jerusalem and one of the things that he is saying is it's time, even in your fear, to open your eyes to what God is doing. It's time to not be hidden. It's time to wake up and understand that part of what it means to be set free and part of what it means to be covenanted with me is to move into the areas of darkness that I'm moving into. And I will cover you and I will give you my spirit and I will pour out my power on you. But you have to remain unhidden. And so you get to this point where you say, okay, God, I will expose myself to you again and ask you to come and fill me with what I need because otherwise I want to just hide. So question, what does it mean to stop hiding and pursue wholeness? Well, first of all, it means being honest about what you're enslaved to, even right now. What does it mean to cry out to God and ask God to set you free? and you might say well I've been doing that for about the last three years thank you very much children of Israel cried out for 400 which doesn't mean that your situation is not dire it is all I can tell you is keep crying out to God the God that created you is concerned about your suffering and is moving toward you you might be in a situation where you need to so it might not be Egypt you might be in Sinai and you're at that place where you gotta remember I am God's and I wanna follow God's way and I've been wandering and it's time to return it's time to return today like today time to return no more wandering you might be in this place where I just know that I've been hiding I've been at the epicenter of the activity and it's been really hard and I've started to hide and it's time to come out again. So I want to invite you as I close here into three prayers for Holy Week. It's Holy Week and it's the time that we journey with Jesus to the cross. It's a time to look at our sin and look toward what Jesus will do about our sin on Resurrection Sunday. But three prayers. Number one, you might pray this, God, reveal where I'm enslaved and set me free. Because I need help sometimes even knowing where I'm enslaved. so God reveal where I'm enslaved and set me free God only you can do it prayer number two reveal to me where I'm wandering and help me remember my covenant with you God help me remember at the end of it all it's me and you and I've been wandering and it's time to return home so God help me with that prayer number three reveal where I'm hidden and help me to see help me to walk around eyes wide open because I'm at the epicenter of God's activity I know that I am and I'm afraid help me to stay Help me to open my eyes and see what's really happening around me. Help me not to run. And some of you, I think, need to hear that just as a word right now. Some of you, some of you, you are at the epicenter right now, and it's scaring you, period. And the word of God to you is do not run. God will give you what you need, but you have to stay. Eyes wide open and no hiding. so as you enter into holy week this week my prayer for you is that you would locate yourself on the redemptive ark are you in Egypt? are you in Sinai? are you in Jerusalem? and you would bring wherever you are to God and you would ask God to give you what you need so that you can enter into the pattern of resurrection which is dying and coming to life what does it mean to really come to life? What does it mean to be fully alive in God? Well, you gotta locate yourself on your story and you gotta cry out to God to come and rescue you. Amen? Let's pray together. So God, into this moment, come with your power and your grace and give us the courage to admit where we are. Maybe we're in Egypt, we're enslaved, we need to be set free. Give us the courage to name it. Maybe we're at Sinai, we've been wandering, and it's time to come home and remember that we are married to you, God, and no one else. At the end of the day, it's you and me, God. So it's time to return home. It's time to say no more wandering, no more maneuvering. It's time to come home. come home to you, God. Maybe some of us are at the epicenter of activity and we're right where we need to be, but it's really terrifying. God, help us to stay, to not run, to open our eyes to see who you are and what you're doing. Give us the courage to partner with you so that we can see resurrection in our life and all around the world. in your name amen
