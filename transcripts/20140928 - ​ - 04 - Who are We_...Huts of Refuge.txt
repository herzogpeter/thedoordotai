Good morning, everybody. I hope you're all doing okay this morning. We're excited to get back into our study this week. My name is Al Shuck. I'm the Next Steps pastor here, and I get the privilege of bringing the word today. Three weeks ago, at the beginning of September, we started a new kind of fall, obviously, but a new kind of series that we're going into where we invited all of you to be a part of a journey. And the journey is our mission of pursuing the struggle of becoming fully alive in God. And you're all invited. Jump on, be a part of it. We said that to do that, it would involve real intentionality in three areas of our lives. We'd have to be intentional about taking an inward journey where we discover who God is and who we are to stop and actually pay attention and notice what's going on in our lives and ask some tough questions and press in and seek God together to see what's really going on in our souls. Two weeks ago, Pastor Dave Johnson stood here and he explored the question of who is God? Because if we're going to seek God, we need to know a little bit about who he is, what God is like. And there's a lot of confusion out there, isn't there, about who God is. And so Pastor Dave did what we do here at Church of the Open Door. He took us to Jesus. Because at Church of the Open Door, if we're going to answer the question of who is God, we always start with Jesus. and last week Vicki Degner helped us look at the question of who am I through scripture and her own story Vicki asked us to take a close look at our identity how we define ourselves and how critical it is for us to come to know more and more the truest identity that we have that deep inside we need to know that we are the beloved of Christ Jesus amen Vicki just did a fabulous job with that And we started looking at those two questions And those two questions, who is God and who am I Are so closely connected and so important That we're offering a class that starts next Monday night Called God Is, I Am And again, you're invited But this week, we have another question to look at Today's question is, who are we? The church Who are we together? And since this is a question of we We're not going to do this on a Monday night We're going to take several weekends and we're gonna press into that question and look at who are we and we thought we would do that together and so we're excited to get started with that today and I can't wait to see what God has in store for us and to do that, let's pray and ask God as we have been the last number of weeks here just saying God give us eyes to see and ears to hear what you have for us so let's pray together as his people. Jesus, we ask that this morning you would be lifted up in everything that goes on here. I pray that you would, by the power of your spirit, give us eyes to see and ears to hear. I pray that you would speak words of truth to us I pray that you would be the head of the church at all times And would lead us and guide us in all things In your name, amen All right, to get us into this question of who are we And to start us there this week And to kind of get our feet wet It'd be really helpful to know a little bit of the bigger picture Or the bigger story One of the things we talk a lot about around here at Open Door Is that we're a part of a bigger story and we have to remember that. And as a church, we wanna be a part of the bigger story. To not just study the church in the book of Acts, but to be the church. To not just learn about the church in the book of Acts or admire the church that's in the book of Acts, but to actually be the church ourselves. We wanna be in the story, the story that keeps being written. We wanna help write it. We wanna keep writing it. Church of the Open Door, keep writing the story. And so we talk a lot about the bigger story. Bigger than our individual stories is the story of God. And we talk about this a lot because it's a real challenge to remember that. Because while many of us claim to believe in a spiritual world that we cannot see, and many of us claim to believe that we know there's a life after this life that lasts forever. Honestly, we're prone to look at this life and think this is all there is. This is it. We get sucked into the world's thinking. And this life becomes that important to us. While we know that the Bible tells us that there's a thing called the kingdom of God, we get pretty comfortable with the kingdom of this life. It's pretty easy to get sucked into it and be conformed to it. So scripture is constantly reminding us that there's a bigger story going on. That our individual stories, while they are important, they only matter when they're in the context of a much bigger and grander story that's of utmost importance. And so it's easy to forget. So we have to be reminded. And that's why the message that Jesus came declaring is such good news to us. That this isn't it. This isn't the end of the story. That there's a much bigger story. Jesus said, repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Repent. Change your mind about what kingdom is real and worth living in. Change your mind about what story you're living in. Change your mind about who is your king. Change your mind about who it is that you're going to follow. Jesus is saying to every one of us I know your story I know you feel lost and alone and hurting and broken sometimes It's part of life But let me tell you, there's a bigger story There's another kingdom There's another way to live And if you get sucked into believing this is all there is This world is all there is You need to know there's much more And even if that story, even if your personal story You're sitting here today and you're going The story of my life feels like a losing story Let me tell you, Jesus is saying the kingdom of God is at hand There's a bigger story and you can be a part of that story If you bring your story into that story, you know what? You're a part of a winning story It's a much bigger story But if you don't have that, where's the hope? Because life is hard Which brings us back to the question What is the church? Because for us to really become the church we're going to have to face that many of us, myself included we have been deeply influenced by the way this world teaches us to live and that we've grabbed on to our little stories and we've protected them that makes it really hard for us to enter into something bigger than ourselves to enter into the body of believers, the church and sadly it's a temptation for the church as well to do the same thing in our lives we get sucked into the system the apostle paul says in romans it's like letting the world or the kingdom of this world squeeze you into its mold and it's a small mold really small and today i want to share with you just a passage of scripture where there were two things that jumped out at me that i went oh if we are going to be the church we're going to have to face that we have we've bought into a couple things in this world that is so different than the kingdom of god and if we don't face them we'll never be the church it's a beautiful passage it's in the little book of Titus chapter 2 starting with verse 11 it says For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. It teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly possessions and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in this present age while we wait for the blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good. There's a lot there, and that's a sweet passage, but I just wanna look at two things, and they both actually come in the last verse, not the beginning, in the last verse. And I think both of them help us start to define what it means to be the church. First, a people of his very own. A people. A people. You see, from the beginning, some things have always been. Some things were created by God a certain way, and from the very beginning, some things are actually in us. Some things are in our DNA. Some things God set in a certain way, and he says this is the way it's going to be. And one of those things is that we are hardwired deep inside to not be an individual, but to be a people. We're called to that because we need that. We desperately need to be a people. Right from the start, he says to Adam, it's not good for you to be alone. It's not good for you to be alone either. It's not good for any of us to be alone. We're not designed to be alone. We're not created to live distant from each other, separate. We're intended and called to live together We're created to move towards each other To do this face to face Not separate We're called to be one But to be a people We have to be in relationship To be a people we have to move closer to each other That's why the writer of Hebrews reminds us The priority we have to make of actually coming together Gathering together, being a part of something To be the church we have to gather We have to connect We have to be face to face in relationship Now you do get how different that is From the world system don't you? You see how radically different that is From what the world tells us And what we're prone to do in the world And how God designed it versus how the world system works How this way of life is in direct conflict with what we're surrounded by? It's completely different. Especially, in some cases, especially in our country and in our culture. After all, it's a free country, right? I can do what I want. I get to choose. Nobody gets to tell me what to do. You have to look out for yourself. You pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. It's all about what I want. In our culture, it's all about the individual. isn't it? Americans are all about individuality. There's a book, it's actually a secular book called The Look Inside of America. And what this gentleman did was he started to try to really look at our culture and place all the values that people live out in our culture. And number one on the list, individuality. That's what Americans value. Individualism is America's means to freedom. We choose our own way. We make our own decisions based on our own criteria. In other cultures, It doesn't necessarily work that way. In fact, in some cultures, individuals aren't free to make their own choices. They must consult, right? They must consult with others. And in some cultures, they even have to obey their elders. That isn't going to happen in the United States, right? We're all about individualism. While in other countries, the needs and considerations of the family or the tribe or the community, they heavily weigh into the decisions that are made. Can you imagine trying to sell that here? individualism is actually viewed as selfishness in some cultures. And you know what? You kind of see that in scripture too. You see it there too. Because individualism is a small story. And there's a much bigger story that Paul tells us about in Philippians 2. Check out this story, folks. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility, value others above yourselves Not looking to your own interest, but each of you to the interests of others It's a different story It's a different story Do you see the problem? Even for those of us that claim to be followers of Jesus It's not an easy thing Even for those of us who claim to know about the kingdom of God And know that there's a life after this life Actually living the way Jesus taught us to live and the way scripture tells us to live is gonna confront some of our strongest beliefs, our habits, our ways of living. Actually living the way Jesus lived is gonna hit us where it hurts. It's gonna hit us in the areas of time and money and choices and priorities. To be the church, it's a different story. One that we're not prone to live in. We're gonna have to remember. It's a contrast between moving towards one another or separating from another, keeping a distance from one another. One of the toughest relationship things that you have to do if you're going to move towards others and you're gonna be in relationship, and you know this, is what do you do when you're with someone and they're in pain and they're in deep sorrow? And one of the hardest places to do that is when there's been death. And so when I'm around funerals, I just watch how difficult it is for people to move towards others. Why? Because this world, this world is crazy. They don't know about relationships this way, the way Jesus talks about them. They are prone to, no, you go, I don't feel comfortable. You know what? I don't really feel comfortable. I don't know what to say. So what does this world do, folks? What does the world system do when it comes to grief and being with other people. You know what this world system does? What does the world do? It comes up with drive-through funeral homes. That's what it does. I'm serious, no joke. In the September 16th edition of the USA Today, it tells the story of Paradise Funeral Chapel in Michigan. Just added a drive-through viewing area shown in the picture taken last week. People wanting to pay their respects, drive up to the window, curtains open up, music comes on, and they have exactly three minutes before the curtains close. to pay their respects. In the article, I thought this was just unbelievable. In the article, the owner of the funeral home said that while there are a couple other funeral homes out there with the drive-thru option, none is as good as us. Why? Check this out. Why? He said this, quote, at these other ones you can drive up, but it's just the window wide open. They don't have a curtain. Okay. Okay. And now this is the world system. This is what you do when someone's in pain. You don't move towards, you move apart. And you think they're the best funeral home? Uh-uh. There's a funeral home in Compton, California. One funeral home advertises what sets them apart is not just the drive-through option, but they actually have bulletproof glass to protect the deceased. Okay. Help me. Somebody help me. What is going on in this world? this is what the world does with pain right this is what the world relationship I don't know how to relate to you I don't know what to say to you you're in pain I don't know what to do I would much rather drive up to a window I don't have to say anything to anyone I don't I don't have to feel what I feel discomfort the world doesn't know what to do with relationships and so it finds ways to keep moving further and further apart. And it's in direct contrast to the church and what we're supposed to be doing of moving closer and closer together. A week and a half ago, a week ago or so, I had this incredible honor and privilege of doing a memorial service for a dear friend and a longtime member here at Open Door, a wonderful man, Gary Tate. And to be with his wife during this really difficult time. And to watch the church come around her and move towards her. And Judy said, I was sustained by this. It's a different story. It's a different way to live. And it's what we're called to if we're gonna be the church. It's about moving towards one another. But we have to ask ourselves, are we willing to do that? Are we willing to move towards others? And you might think, well, of course, it's not such an easy thing to answer because in the reality of life, even for those of us who know it's difficult, it's not just in the painful times, it's in ordinary everyday ways. Do we move towards others? I'm gonna get really practical with you and maybe even a little personal. To move towards each other can be a simple thing. Like when the service is over, not rushing out the doors. Ouch. I didn't mean to say it that strong. No. There's no condemnation in that. Sometimes you have to get going. Sometimes you're like, that's just what I do. You can do that. And if you do, we love you. We're glad you're here. But you need to know, it's going to be really hard for you to feel like you're a part of a people. Because a people has to do this. A people has to be known, has to enter in and move towards. And if that's hard for you to do, we just encourage you, stick around, say hi to someone. Look someone in the eye. Ask someone a simple question. How long have you been around here? What is it that you like about Open Door? Get to know someone. It's the first step in moving towards. And if that's hard for you to do, stop at the kiosk. We have people there who understand that it's difficult for some people. For some of you, that'd be a huge risk to do that. Take the risk, move towards. It's part of being the church. And one other thing, if you are here, I see this all the time. If you're here and some of you in this room are incredible with people. Some of you in this room are so good, you can strike up a conversation with anyone. You do it all the time at work. You could sell anything. Some of you would make Tony Robbins look like an introvert. All right. Some of you are so good and it's because you genuinely love people. We're going to ask you to bring that here. Be the church. Why? Because we want people to feel like they really like Open Door and stay? No, it's because we want to desperately be the church We want to desperately be this place where we're moving towards each other And see what God can do with that And not moving away Which we are so prone to do and this world so teaches us to do Second thing is this Jumped out at me in verse 14 Not just a people of his very own, but how does it end? It ends with this statement Eager to do what is good For me, I think it's actually the word eager that gives me the problem I'm all for doing good, but now you're saying eager to do what is good I mean, I'm all about doing good But eager would imply that I'm enthusiastic about it Eager would imply that I'm passionate about it It would imply that I have the time to do it It would imply that I have the energy to do it Eager is a problem for me but you know I look around and I don't think I don't think I see a lot of eager people in the world eager to do what is good I think I see a lot of people who are excited to have fun there's nothing wrong with fun I love fun but there's a difference between being eager to do what is good and being excited to have fun being excited to have fun is all about me it's all about what will make me feel good. What is it that I want? It's back to the individuality. Eager to do what is good, that's about we. That's about us. It's about the church. The kingdom of God is all about doing something of lasting goodness. It's all about arranging your life in such a way that you actually have energy and time to love others well. do you have that in your life? I know how hard that is. That is really hard. This isn't a condemnation thing because I'd be talking to myself. I'm just saying that if we're gonna be the church, we're gonna have to find some eagerness about doing good. And that may mean taking a ruthless inventory of our priorities and looking at our lives and looking at our schedules and going, I cannot do all that I'm doing because if I do, I'm gonna continue to be frantic and I'm gonna continue to be fragmented and separated and I'm running over here and I'm running over here and there's no sense of this. It's I'm just scattered all over. It may mean cutting some things out, making hard choices, being very intentional about what we give our time and attention to. And you see how different that is from the world and what you get pulled into? The world will squeeze you and squeeze me into a life of being scattered and fragmented, running all over the place, keeping us busy, but busy in a very small story. As the church, we're called to gather together, to move towards each other, but then to prioritize our lives in a way that we're going out in meaningful ways, eager to do what is good. A while back, I heard a story. I love this story. To me, it painted a picture of what we would envision for what your experience in the church would be and a vision for what it could be like. It's a story of a community of people back in the 1800s that formed what they called the Massachusetts Life-Saving Society. And it was located between the ports of Boston and New York, where it was an incredibly high traffic. Ships would go by over 250, 300 ships a day, would pass through this area right by Cape Cod and Nantucket. And because of the waves and the rocks, many ships went down. They had over 700 ships sank in that area because of the weather and because of the rocks, oftentimes within sight of land, people would drown. And even if they could swim and make it to shore, they would die because they had no food and they would freeze to death from the water. And so what happened was the people that lived around there, they decided this is not okay. We can't allow this. We have to do something about this. And so faced with the large number of shipwrecks and the tragic loss of life, a group of volunteers decided that they were going to make it their mission to save the lives of those who were part of the shipwrecks. These groups, small groups of people, families came together. Two or three families would come together, and they would say, you know what? This part of the shore, we're going to watch. We're going to be looking out here. We're going to keep an eye on this. We're going to be looking for shipwrecks and drowning people. And what they did was they created little stations all along the shore that were equipped with rescue blankets and boats and blankets and food and needed supplies. And they called these little areas, this is one right here, they called them huts of refuge and the oceans behind it there. And you see the guy up there looking out. These were families that would come together and they would say, this is gonna be our section. We're gonna watch. And if a ship goes down, if something happened, word would go out and families would come running. And they would do whatever it took to try to save as many lives as they could. 24 seven, someone was always watching. They had a motto They had a motto to try to attract people to be a part of this thing You know what their motto was? Their motto was this You have to go out, but you don't have to come back That's right up there with pursuing the struggle of becoming fully alive in God, right? I mean people are gonna sign up for that But you know what? People did People did All kinds of people signed up to do this You wouldn't think that they'd get a lot of people But they signed up to many people Signed up to risk their own lives To save the lives of people they never even met Didn't know their names Now as years went by Something very interesting happened Because there was a thing created Called the U.S. Coast Guard And the U.S. Coast Guard Started doing What these huts of refuges did And one of the things that happened was Was all of a sudden the volunteers stopped manning the stations because they didn't need to. They decided, well, let's let the professionals do it. The people that get paid, the people that have been trained, let's let them go out and rescue people. They no longer had a life-saving mission. Now, here's the part that I think is incredibly ironic. I just think it's just amazing. They didn't disband. They didn't quit meeting together. They kept meeting together. They kept having get-togethers. They kept having parties. They would have some banquets. They'd even still give out some awards. They would enjoy each other's company. They just didn't go out and rescue drowning people anymore. And I thought that was so odd. And then I thought about the church. and how easy it is for us as a church to keep meeting together. We still sing songs together. We have a party now and then. We've got programs. We do all kinds of good stuff. We just don't go out and rescue drowning people anymore. And you see how radically different what we are called to compared to what this world offers. We are called to save lives. And I don't mean save lives necessarily. We're not along the coast. You get the translation here. There are people drowning all around us. Drowning in shame. Drowning in poverty. Drowning in guilt. Drowning in depression and anger. Loneliness, my goodness. There's people all around us. What would it be like? if we were small groups, little groups of people, little families, connections here and there, and wherever you are at in life, wherever you live, wherever you move, if you were looking out with some other family, you go, we're gonna watch this section here. We're gonna keep an eye on it. And if we see someone go down, we wanna be a hut of refuge that we could reach out and just show the love of Jesus. Help them know there's hope. Help them know there's a different story. There's a bigger story. You think you're drowning. There's a different story. Let us help you. It isn't about preaching the gospel. No. It's about putting your hand out and saying, I don't want you to drown. We're here for you. It's about being a hut of refuge in your ordinary, everyday life. It's a beautiful vision. It's what we believe the church is called to do. Now, what do you have if you go out to the East Coast? If you go out to the East Coast and you look up and down the coast, you know what you have? Yacht clubs That's what you have You don't have huts of refuges You have yacht clubs And what's a yacht club? A yacht club is all about the comfort of those who are members And if their comfort level is ever subpar The members will complain about the food Or the dress code Or the furniture Or petty things But people with a life-saving message They don't complain about the food they don't have time to complain about the food there's people drowning I'm not going to stand here and complain about the food I'm going to say come on let's go and in my life I get really petty because I'm not looking for drowning folks I'm looking here at what I need and what I want and I get really petty and God's saying you'll never be the church you'll never be the church you see a yacht club exists for the sake of the people who are part of the group but a life-saving society exists for the people who are not a part of the group John Ortberg is the first person I ever heard tell this story years ago and he said this, he said the church was the first organization in human history that was created for the benefit of non-members I love that and if you come through Open Door 101, you'll hear us say, you wanna be a member here? Awesome, but this isn't about you. This is about the people who are drowning. This is about the kingdom of God, a much bigger story. This speaks to five little words that are in our purpose statement for the sake of others. What about you? What's your story? What's your story? I'm very aware Someone could be sitting in the audience right now Going I'm actually the one who's drowning You know what If you're a part of a little hut of refuge Where you've grabbed on to some other people And you're like let's look Let's be intentional You're not going to drown Why? Because you're looking out for each other too Maybe you're lonely Then say something Say help I'm drowning We want to know Don't leave here alone and stay alone. Say something. Let us know. Talk with us at the kiosk. Find someone else who's here. Take a chance. Take a risk. We want to know. It's not easy to know, but we want to know. What's your story? Maybe you're already a part of a hut of refuge and we don't know about. We'd love to know so we can encourage and pray for you. What is your story? What's the church? The church isn't a building, folks. You know that. The church isn't a pastor. The church isn't the staff or the traditions or the music. You're part of a life-saving society. You got a mission. There are people drunk. You have time to complain about the music? No. You just don't have time to do that. You don't have time to complain about who's speaking this weekend. And I'm sorry, it's not Dave. Not really. Not really. No. You don't have time to complain. Why? Because you're a part of a... There's people drowning. Creating little huts of refuge. Church isn't music. It isn't programs. It isn't the church's people. People who've decided that they want to live in the kingdom of God, the bigger story, and they want to bring that kingdom to lost people who desperately need to be loved. That's the church. And you know what? creating little huts of refuge, it's happening already. And one of the things I know we want to do as a church more and more is we want you to know some of the stories that are happening here. And I'm going to run through them real fast, but you need to know that we want to know your story. We want to know your story. We want to know what's happening in your life. And not just us as in the staff. We want you to know each other's stories because the connections that can happen and what can happen for the kingdom are huge when you know some stories and when you share your stories. This is my friend Sharon. Sharon has been here at Church of the Open Door for 31 years. 31 years she's been a part of the church. And you know what? Sharon and I share a little special thing that we've known about each other for a few years now, and that is that both of us grew up in situations where we have a hard time getting the love of God from up here into here. That's our journey. That's our struggle. And so we know it up here, but to get it in here, and so we check in with each other every so often. And I was just, I checked in with Sharon not long ago, and as she was sharing with me her journey and how she has been doing this inner journey of discovering God's unconditional love for her. And she's been doing some, putting some effort into that. She's been doing some retreats and she's got a spiritual companion that she talks with. And she's been, all of a sudden the lights came on and I went, it makes total sense. It makes total sense Why every Sunday morning Sharon shows up And she goes downstairs And she creates a little hut of refuge With some other women Why? So that little kids can come in Little kids can come in And what they get is They get the love of Jesus It's a hut of refuge It's not about We need volunteers It's about What do you Are you a part of a hut of refuge Are you a part of something that matters With others This is Nick and Anna Nick and Anna are a newly married couple And they're a part of Open Door And Anna's been here I've been fortunate enough to know Anna Since she was a teenager And they've been recently married And they've said to us They said you know what we would love to do Is we'd love to actually get to know Some other newly married couples But not just get to know them We actually want to share our lives with them And not just share our lives with them But we want to be a hut of refuge We want to do something that matters so we're gonna be mentors to teenagers on Wednesday nights. Man, it'd be great if we could find some other young couples that we could do life with and do that together. It's a different way of thinking. This is Ben and Ginny. Ben and Ginny have been here at Open Door for years and they're absolutely wonderful people and there's two things that came to my mind this week and some of these people are out here and I'm sure they're going, I can't believe he's talking about it. It's because your stories are beautiful, folks, and you're the church. And you know, Ben actually has been working with a thing called IFI for a number of years. And on Friday night, I got to go out to Lionel Lakes Prison with our dear friend, Charlie Bench. And I got to speak to a bunch of guys in prison. And it was absolutely amazing. And I was there for one night. But you know what? Guys like Charlie Bench and Ben Kui and Jeff Zidzlaff, some of the men in our church have committed to, you know, we're gonna go out there every week and we're gonna be a hut of refuge to these guys week after week, reminding them of who they really are. reminding them that they're a part of a bigger story because they feel like they're in a losing story. That's a hut of refuge. It's what the church is called to do. Ben and Ginny live over in St. Paul area and they're like, man, we would love to know some other people in the St. Paul area. We'd like to form a little hut of refuge and just be looking and sharing our stories and seeing what God does with it. This is Rennie and Linda. Rennie and Linda have also been here a long time. And they have a thing where they would love to get to know some people as well. But what they did was they felt really called to do something by God that was a little crazy. They joined with some other people and they started a summer camp for mentally disabled adults. And they bring these campers to camp and they have a week of just incredible fun together where they feel incredibly blessed. But what they do is they partner up volunteers with these adults. And this last summer, Taylor Bongard went out there and he was their worship guy for a week. And Taylor said, Al, it absolutely changed my life to join in this little hut of refuge for a week. He said, Al, do you know that we have mentally disabled people that come every Sunday here to open door? He goes, Al, I never saw him before this. But I did this and all of a sudden I saw him. And I went up to him and I introduced myself. it's a bigger story it's a bigger story and Renny and Linda we'd love to meet some other people who maybe have the same passion what's your story what's your story we want to know we want to know we want to hear seriously I'm talking to you each and every one we would love to know don't blow this off if you want to be if you want to move closer for us to be the church we gotta start sharing our stories more. And we're not exactly sure how to do that yet, but we're gonna find a way. And it starts by saying, let us know. And so we created a real simple way for you to do that. We're gonna start with this. We're gonna start asking you to share your stories at a real simple, stories at the door.org. Send us. I've been here for, some people might say, I've been here for 15 years. And it's like, but I don't know anyone. We wanna know that. Maybe your story is, I had a guy last night come up to me afterwards and he says, What you shared, I didn't even realize that I've been pouring it out as a teacher for 20 years. And I've just realized, no, I'm not a teacher. I run a hut of refuge in class 115 every day. It's a little hut of refuge for kids. I'm a coach from 3.30 to 4.30 every day. It's on a field or a hockey rink or a basketball, but it's a little hut of refuge. That's what I do. Or maybe you're going to say, I want to know one of these people that you showed the pictures of because I would like to talk with them. Or maybe you're going to say, hey, if you've got anybody around there who might have this as a passion, I'd love to hook up with them. We can't promise them, but we're going to do everything we can to find ways to connect. Why? Because that's the church. That's the church. It's moving towards one another in each other's lives. We invite you to take a step towards each other. Let's pray. Holy Spirit of God I know that you deeply desire that we would be a people your people and together we would be eager to do what is good God help each of us individually even do a little assessing of our lives to see if there's some changes that we would need to make, some ways that we've been sucked in that we need to say, I can't keep living that way. God, help us to know that and help us to give us the courage and the strength to make the choices we have to make, changes we have to make. But Holy Spirit of God, I pray that in a way that we can't even explain, you would give us eyes to see one another, that we would move towards each other, that we would lock arms and we would form little huts of refuge all around this city. In our everyday lives, God, Holy Spirit, come. We ask you to do this. We ask that you would build your church. In your name, amen. Again, bless you. We encourage you to not just go to church, but to be the church, amen? You're dismissed. Thank you.
