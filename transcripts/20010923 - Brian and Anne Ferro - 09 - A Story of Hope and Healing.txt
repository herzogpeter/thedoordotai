For those of you who have been with us these last few weeks and months, you're aware of the fact that we've been involved in a series of sermons dealing with the issue of, among other things, sexuality. And for the bulk of that series, we have been dealing with and trying to bring order to our understanding of disordered sexuality. Well, last week, we began to examine and tried to get a good, healthy, biblical picture in our mind of what healthy sexuality looks like. We called it healthy, holy, happy sexuality. At the end of the talk last week, one of the things I said in closing was that I was aware of the fact that for some of us to walk in and to experience the reality of healthy sexuality would in fact require significant measures of God's healing for us to enter into that because there has been so much disorder, sometimes because of choices we have made, sometimes because of choices other people have made and imposed their will on us, causing profound damage in this arena of our lives. I also told you that this week we were going to do something that would powerfully illustrate that healing really, really is possible. Well, the something we're going to do is to share with you story. The story you're going to hear is the story of Brian and Ann Farrell. I'm going to ask them to come at this time as I continue to introduce them. Let me just set this idea of story up for just a moment. A few weeks ago, in the context of dealing with the September 11th events, You might remember we did some work in Acts chapter 12. James had been beheaded. Peter was in prison. It didn't look good for his end. And the people were praying for him. Peter was miraculously set free. The chains fell off. He walked out of prison, came to the prayer meeting, and told him the story of his incredible deliverance and how the chains fell off and he was set free. And then he said these words that kind of just resonated in my spirit and they kind of, to me, are part of what we do in the ministry. What he said to the people was this, repeat these things. Report these things. Tell these stories over and over of how it is that God sets people free. Brian and Ann's story is a story of journey. It is a story of incredible courage. It is a story of healing. And it is a story, maybe above all, of God's amazing grace. This gospel that we preach is true, is one of the things that resounded in my spirit last night as they shared their story. And I would like to pray for you as you begin. And you know what? I want you to pray for them too. In your spirit, just extend your hands if you feel comfortable with that. If not, it's okay. But just let's get around them and pray. Father God, I thank you that you are our Father. I thank you that you are not distant and detached from our lives, sitting in heaven watching, but you invade and you are involved and you redeem and you call us out. And you call us out of our fear and hidden places into the light where there is amazing grace and life. I thank you for Brian and Ann. I thank you, God, for their incredible courage and their simple but tenacious faith that has empowered them to enter into this journey of healing. Thank you for the courage that they've had on that journey and the courage that they evidence in the very fact that they're willing to share it with us. Bless them in Jesus' name and prepare us to hear with ears that are atoned to the truth of your spirit and ways this story needs to call things out of us as well. I pray all these things in Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you. We begin our story about nine years ago. It was around the summer of 1992. We had in my eyes the perfect life. We were living out the American dream. We had been married about seven years, and we were living in the Chicago area. Our life was going on just like I hoped. We had two kids. I had a good job. We had a nice house. We had a great church. We had some wonderful friends. Really, it was what I had all dreamed about. And not only that, we lived right across the street from Six Flags Great America, which, for those who know me, I love to play. It's a great park. And really, we had a great dream. In the middle of the summer of 1992, Anne went to a women's event at our church. where a speaker had touched on some issues close to her heart. I remember sitting at the kitchen table as she shared about the meeting and said she wanted to go see a counselor to work through some things that had come up for her. Being a little stunned, yet wanting to be supportive, I said, that'd be fine. But yet I'm sure she felt my real heart, which was, sure, and you go get fixed, you do your thing, and then we'll get on with life again, just like we were. Little did I know what God had in store for Ann, for me, for our marriage, and our relationship with him. Following that meeting, God invited me to look at some major areas in my life at the time. I knew there were things that I had vowed I would never go back to, but God wanted all of my heart. He wanted to show me how much he loved me. He wanted to show me and experience a love in a way that touches the deepest part of my soul. To do this, he was calling me to deal with some of the painful areas of my past. I was uncertain and scared, but I decided to move forward with God. My journey actually begins at home where I grew up in a family of four girls. My twin sister and I were the youngest. In growing up, I was your typical girl. I loved flowers, dolls, played house, and I did all those type of things. When I was seven years old, I began to take dance and ballet class. My ballet class met at a local church, and I loved to dance. I felt beautiful. I felt graceful. Something happened, however, that would transform this innocence forever. At the church where we held dance, there was a janitor who would begin to watch me. He would show up and just stare at me, smiling a smile I didn't understand. I would feel dirty and degraded. Then there were times he would hide in the bathroom where I changed before class. After class, I would often wait for my ride. He would often wait until everyone had gone, and then he would sexually molest me. It was a horrible, violent thing. I never knew when or where he would show up. I was scared. I was alone. I would cry and pray myself to sleep at night. God, if you're out there, if you're good and kind and won't hurt people, please help me. After coming home from class, I would hide. I would feel dirty and awful inside. I never talked to my parents about it. It was too scary. I didn't feel comfortable talking to them. Not only was I ashamed, but I didn't feel safe. In our family, we didn't talk about things. As I look back, I can see that there were certain unwritten rules in growing up. Some of these rules you may relate to. Such as, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it. I knew what was happening wasn't nice. I felt safer just to keep quiet. the second rule if you disagree with someone in authority don't question it just listen and obey although what was happening seemed wrong i just one i just did what i was told and finally conflict is bad avoided at all costs what would my parents do would they be mad at me was this really all my fault i was so afraid of being punished i was scared of what my parents would do or say, so I kept silent. The pain and horror of my situation didn't stop even after I quit dance. Growing up in my early teen years, I experienced other instances of sexual abuse. Every time, I kept it all inside and started believing the lies that it was all about me. Something was wrong with me. On the outside, I worked hard at holding it all together, appearing like any other girl, but on the inside, my heart was slowly dying. I began, it was deeply affected, I was deeply affected by those around me in their disordered view of sexuality as I was used and abused. My heart was becoming hardened and I was afraid to get close or trust anyone. Time passed, life went on. Going into high school, I began to get involved in my youth group. I had accepted Jesus at the age of eight at a Christian camp and now in high school I wanted to get involved. I started to take on leadership roles in our youth group. My pastor and I began spending lots of time together. I started to trust him and open up my scared heart. He seemed to love God, and I felt safety because of that. Over time, something changed. He started calling me his special friend. He started making inappropriate contact with me. I felt this was wrong. He was married. He was a pastor. I struggled. It was all so confusing. I liked the attention and the care that he showed me. I drank it into my thirsty, love-starved heart. As he continued in his abuse, he used scripture to say it was okay. But deep down, it didn't seem right. Later in life, I would see it for what it was, sexual abuse. In confronting this issue as an adult, I would find out that he had done this to several other young teenage girls as well. Once again, I felt the pain of being abused. What is sexuality all about? Is it being used and feeling dirty? alone and confused. I couldn't help but ask God, do you care about me? Where are you while this keeps happening? Are you there? Are you any different? Can I really trust you with all the pain and confusion of this? After I finished high school, I had the opportunity to go to college. I decided to use this chance to get away and to forget all that I left behind. I went away to a small Christian school in Indiana. Soon after settling in the first month of classes, I received a phone call from a man who I'd known over the years. He was my Sunday school teacher years ago and a long-time family friend. He was coming through on a business trip and wanted to hook up for dinner. I welcomed the chance to see a familiar face from home, but what I didn't realize or welcome was the agenda that he had for the evening. The impact of that night I will never be able to forget. You see, that night he raped me. He violently assaulted me, and I felt the hatred of a crime against my soul once again. Not knowing anyone real well at school, I decided to tell no one. Once again, I kept the silence. I was scared and confused. After being raped, my shame grew into horror. My worst fear became a reality. Not only was I raped, but I was pregnant from being raped. I wanted to forget what had happened like I'd done all my life, but I couldn't. My clean image that I'd worked so hard at creating was shattered. I couldn't bear the humiliation and disgrace. I hated all the abuse and the heartache that I continued to experience no matter where I went. My heart was full of hate and anger and hopelessness. I channeled it inward toward myself and wanted to die. Desperate and afraid, I aborted the baby and tried to end my life as well. At that time when I had no hope to go on, God intervened. He saved me from the enemy's plan of bringing me to this point of death and destruction. Although I survived, I now had the guilt and shame with my choice to abort my baby. I continued down a path of self-destruction. I tried to numb the pain and heartache with excessive exercise. I began to starve myself and developed anorexia. I tried to gain control and soon found myself out of control once again. My heart was dying inside as I refused to get out what was going on within. I didn't want to go on pretending, but I was scared and overwhelmed to honestly face the truth of what happened and the shame and disgrace I felt as a result. So I did what I learned how to do. I kept silent. At the time in college, I was confronted about my eating disorder and began to address the outward issue. It wouldn't be until eight years later that the heart issues that led me there would be looked at as God began to invite me into these areas. The challenge I faced was I had developed a way of coping, denial to the point of not remembering. I would totally shut it off. I blocked out many of these painful memories. It was the only way I knew to cope at the time. A few months later at college, I met Brian. We dated for a couple years. He knew very little about my past and the abuse I'd experienced. I planned to just move on. We got married, and I tried to live out the married life and all that comes with it. But as you can imagine, my view of sexuality was very disordered as a result of the abuse I'd experienced. I continued to feel shame and fear. Sexual relations were an obligation in my marriage. My heart was far from being engaged or touched. I was not experiencing intimacy at all, the type of intimacy that Dave was speaking about last week. Seven years into our marriage, after this women's event at church, God started to stir. I clearly felt his call to look at these areas around my heart that I had vowed to never go back to. For the next eight years, I experienced many highs and lows. I took steps to trust God with some of the pain, and then I'd go back to my old ways of coping again and numbing out the pain. As I went through years of uncovering these events, I withdrew from Brian emotionally. I kept my heart very distant from his. Although I worked hard at being a good wife and mother, I was doing all I could to heal. As you might imagine, this period was a very rough time in our marriage. Over this period of years, Ann would share different events that happened to her and the resulting pain. As you might imagine, life was really hellish. For me, I was experiencing a variety of emotions, as you might imagine. Initially, I felt extreme anger. How could this have happened? How could this have happened? I began to play in my mind on how I could hurt the people that hurt my wife. How could I destroy them and mutilate them? Especially since I knew who a couple of these men were. I could easily find out where they lived. I started to play out in my mind how I could carry out vengeance and believed I was very justified. I was burning with rage and anger. At the same time, I felt a deep sadness for Anne. What terror and pain she must have felt. The deep hurt she was working through, it was gut-wrenching. I saw many nights of tears and crying. I wanted to do whatever I could to care for her. I tried to be a caring husband, but in a lot of ways, though I really felt helpless. During this time on the outside, I tried to hold it all together and do all the right things that you're supposed to do, like listen, take care of the kids, give space, do whatever. But on the inside, I found myself in a mixed-up world. I was scared. I felt alone. I was at a loss. And in the midst of all this, I also realized something else was burning inside of me. I was extremely angry with God. Questions like, where were you? How could you have let this happen to Anne? were ringing in my ears. My faith took a dive as I wrestled with how my God stood by and let this happen while doing nothing. Over time, my anger did not stop with what happened to Ann. The question grew even louder in my heart, a question that revealed something deep inside of me. God, how could you have done this to me? The impact of Ann's pain was spilling into our marriage as she became aware of and in touch with her past, our relationship was a roller coaster. Our ability to connect was now in question. Our ability to care for each other was strained. Our ability to relate sexually was a mess. On the surface, we were trying to hold it all together. But underneath, I knew I was dying as well. I wasn't sure if we were going to make it. I felt I couldn't trust anybody, including God. I was on my own. at least that's how I felt and I started looking for something to relieve the pain and the hurt and my heart grew very, very thirsty where did I turn to deal with my pain and the hurt? I would love to say that I saw my wayward views and confessed them and prayed my way through the pain but that's not what happened you see, growing up, I learned that you could numb pain through other means in my past, I learned the power of disordered sexuality or at least as we've been talking about it. As a kid, I grew up in the late 60s and early 70s, maybe like many of you, when there was a revolution happening, often referred to as a sexual revolution, where free love, open sex, and nudity were in, where streaking people and naked concertgoers made the news. TV was starting to open the airwaves and sexuality. Certain magazines, such as Playboy and Penthouse, were growing dramatically in popularity. As a boy of six or seven, I was very curious about nudity and sex. I remember finding pornographic magazines, not in some back alley, but in people's homes, people I knew. As a curious little kid, I saw parts of the body that I never knew existed. In third grade, I remember going to a friend's house where his parents bought him pornographic magazines so he would not have to be curious. It was in his closet next to his toys, and we'd look at pornographic magazines and we'd go play. As time went on and as a 7th grader, I saw my first pornographic movie. Throughout my junior high and high school years, I had easy access to pornography. Needless to say, I grew up with a healthy dose of the prevailing view around sexuality. Something we've been calling disordered sexuality these past few months. And based on what I saw and the men I knew who had pornography, it didn't matter if they called themselves Christians or not. All the men in my life were involved in pornography. I thought this was what guys did. And even if you accept Jesus as your Savior, which I did in junior high, it really didn't matter. You know, boys will be boys, and that's just what guys did. There were times I came across Christians who were against pornography, and although I might even pretend to agree with them on the surface, my behaviors behind closed doors reflected something different. Deep down, I would simply say to myself, they just can't handle it. It's not a big deal. They just need to loosen up. They need to learn what it is to be a real man. When I started to date girls, I realized that having a girlfriend gave me a great feeling as well. It made me feel like a man, just like some of the movies I used to watch around James Bond. By having the beautiful girl, I was something. I tried to act cool like it didn't mean much, but my heart knew otherwise. I worked hard to learn how to do the dating thing. In junior high, I acted like I really didn't need a girlfriend like many guys do. But deep down inside, I knew how important it was. As I explored my sexuality with girls and dating, I found that the pleasure and excitement made me feel like a real man. I learned that the hunger and thirst of my heart could be met for a time by having a girlfriend. And in those relationships, if they started to waver, I was always the one who broke it off. I was afraid of the rejection. It was my way of just protecting myself. And looking back, I realized how I approached sexuality in relationships with girls. I used them to make me feel okay about me, to feel like a man. As ugly as it sounds, I was a taker in the relationships. I took what I could do, Took what I could get to feel okay. I had a hungry and thirsty heart, and I looked to women both real and in images to help me feel like a man. So as time passed, when I got married, I thought everything would be great. I had a committed wife who loved me. I was free to have sex. I was feeling like all was well in my soul. And then the floodgates of pain came. My wife withdrew from me to seek healing. I felt no longer desirable my source of what was helping me feel okay was gone I felt God became very distant what was I to do with the pain and hunger and fear I turned back to what numbed the pain in my past my work called me to travel quite a bit and I began to medicate through pornography at the time I knew it wasn't right but I just didn't care I was alone, I was anonymous, and I was hurting. And I believed that I deserved what I could get. One thing led to another, and I started hitting all the strip clubs. I was heading down a path of personal destruction. At home, I was working hard to be this caring husband, yet on the road, I was getting deeper and deeper in a world of disordered sexuality. So if the story ended here, I think we would all go home depressed. What you see are two hurting people, two broken people, hungry and thirsty, twisted views of sexuality and relationships, both desiring to find intimacy, yet desperately trying to numb the pain, trying to hold it together, looking for answers. We were a mess. Fortunately, we know a God who can take desperate people and breathe life into them. He can take marriages that are ravaged by views of disordered sexuality and bring healing and hope. A verse that has taken on deep meaning for us comes out of the book of Ezekiel, where God takes Ezekiel in a vision to a valley of dried bones. In the midst of this, God says, this is what the sovereign Lord says to these bones. I will make breath enter you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the Lord. We both needed a strong breath of God to heal and bring life. Fortunately, God showed up. For me, I began to experience this as I started to reach out for help. With the support and direction of a godly counselor, Maureen McNeil, I began to take steps forward and open the door to my heart where the heartache and pain were locked up. I knew I needed to invite God in. I made choices to try trusting God with my pain and made a commitment not to go to my old places. I had accountability and support from a few close friends. As I little by little took steps of faith with my, took steps forward with my one ounce of faith into what felt like a dark, bottomless pit of death, God began to meet me there. He had heard the cry of my heart as a little girl as I prayed every night, God, if you're good and won't hurt me, please help me. He began to help me. I slowly began to see him differently. I saw his face with tears streaming down it as we walked through the years of abuse. His heart was full of compassion and love for me. His heart broke with mine as he said it was never meant to be this way. He was good, and he would never harm me. He was there each and every time. He never left my side. I just didn't know it, and I couldn't see it before. To help me understand what he was doing, God gave me eyes to see into the spiritual arena of my abuse. I wasn't a vision person, but God gave me a vision, a real vision. He let me see how he did warfare for me. I saw the enemy and God go to battle for me as a 7-year-old little girl after dance class. Initially, the enemy looked at me and pointed and said, You're mine, something that the abuser actually said to me. But in this vision, God stepped in between me and the enemy. They fought a violent battle. God fought for me until the enemy fell to the ground into a pile of ashes. I saw firsthand that he won the battle against my soul of the enemy that day, as he risked his all for me. Another time, I saw him literally clothe me in my nakedness and minister to my aching body. He covered me with beautiful purple cloves of royalty. after all I was a child of the king I started to let this in and renounce the lies of the enemy all these years the disgrace, the shame, the inadequacy the hate that I channeled toward myself I began to see God not as the source of the pain but rather as the only source of hope and healing for my pain I began to trust my heart to his with the deepest part of my soul and he began to restore and heal me from deep within throughout this time God brought people into my life to come alongside me to hold me up at times, to cry with me, to pray with me I became close friends with a few women from the Fresh Start ministry here at Open Door they became my community of faith women who I could lean on and journey with together I met with members of the restoration through prayer team who lifted me up to God and prayed on my behalf God was active through his people Even with the support and love, it was not a nice, neat journey. It greatly impacted my marriage and my children. There were times when I couldn't think I could bear it all. I felt like I was breaking and unable to give love to those closest to me. I could barely hang on myself. I was talking to the police officers about the clergy sexual abuse as they filed reports about what happened. It was like experiencing it all over again. It also brought up issues for Brian and I in our marriage. Sometimes when we were being sexually intimate, the floodgates of memories would open up. It was a terrifying arena for me to walk into. As I started to heal and become free from some of the pain, God invited me to go deeper in the area of the abortion. Initially, I didn't remember it, but slowly it all started to come back. I began to walk through the abortion with my counselor. We were able to work through what happened. She helped me see how God viewed me and the choices that I had made. I began to experience deep forgiveness and love from my Father in Heaven. God was restoring me. It was truly his amazing grace. As a part of my healing process, my counselor recommended that I join a post-abortive support group called Conquerors to get further healing with others who have been through it. Brian supported me in this and took the kids one night a week for three months. I was facing my sin head on and was in desperate need of God's love and grace. In a new way, I experienced his loving kindness and his goodness for me. Where I had chosen the enemy's plan to kill and destroy this innocent life, God came and washed me with his love and his forgiveness. At this time, I also experienced love from Brian. He chose to adopt this child that was conceived in violence and hate. we had a memorial service to give honor to this life that I couldn't give 19 years ago. As I symbolically released this child to God, he reminded me of the truth that because of the cross, he has overcome death, and there would be a day of reunion with my little child. As my heart received love and grace from God, I was then able to forgive Brian for his past choices and give him love and grace. Just as God was showing up for Ann, he began to show up for me. While Ann was in the thick of her journey and I was out numbing my pain, I received a phone call from a friend of mine who lives in Chicago. He called to see how I was doing. Bill was someone I trusted, so I opened up and told him what was happening on my road trips. The only words I remember from the conversation was his comment. Brian, you are out of control. Do you still go to that open door church? At the time, we'd only been coming to the church for a couple of years, but I didn't really know anybody. I was one of those guys who stood around in the gathering place looking at everyone but not talking to anyone. I told Bill I was going to open door, and we ended our call. A couple of minutes later, he called to say that he had left a message for Jan Brose and Tom Johnson to let them know that I was attending and I was out of control. At the time, I was extremely irate. I felt exposed. My image was blown. And yet, deep down, I knew Bill was right. although I was heading down a road that was destroying me God was not going to let me go he and I had discussions in some of the worst places I could be at and through Bill's phone call God was calling me to change after the call I contacted and met one of the pastoral staff at Open Door we got together and I spoke candidly about the choices I had made and the sin I was ensnarled in and the need to change I knew there needed to be changes I had heard God calling me In my past I had prayed for change I had promised I'd be different But this time I knew I was desperate I knew I was out of control If change was going to happen God would have to work in my heart I just couldn't white knuckle it anymore I confessed my sin And repented and asked God for help For the next few years My journey led me down a road toward healing what happened during this time was a series of things that have been more of a process than just being zapped I share them with you not as a formula but rather as steps in my journey the first step I took I knew I had to eliminate my intake of pornography although I knew my heart needed to change I couldn't keep feeding it with poison I took some very practical steps I set a ground rule for myself to not turn on the TV in my hotel room when I was traveling I needed just to take out the temptation We got rid of AOL for our internet provider And moved to the internet screening service We used the viafamily.com service I wanted again to take the control out of my hands Finally we got rid of our extended cable channels Because there was lots of things on cable That were not good for me to be seeing So those are a few practical steps around that but that really wasn't enough. I recognized I couldn't do this alone. I needed to connect with some other guys and God led me to a few men who were also looking for a place to be honest and to share what was going on in their lives, to be encouraged and prayed for and to grow in our walk with God. These special brothers, Tom, Greg, Steve, and Bob, have more than once been instruments of God in my journey. Through them, I started to experience God's love in some very tangible ways. During this time, I also started to ask God to show me what it means to really be in love with him, to develop a relationship from my heart. I went through the Beatitude series of sermons that Dave preached some time ago. I began to look at what was going on in my heart, the need for honesty, brokenness, and healing. At the same time, I began to read a series of books by John Eldridge that began to help me see the heart of God for me and how much he truly loves me. I remember sitting in my living room reading the book Sacred Romance and beginning to see that God not only loves me, but he delights in me, that he truly likes me as well as loves me. Another powerful book from John Eldridge was Wild at Heart, where Eldridge puts words to things that I've seen and experienced, the addictive power of pornography, the struggle of men to deal with sexuality, and the need to connect with the only source that brings life, adventure, and passion, Jesus. In my desire to have a heart relationship with God, I asked him to speak to me in real ways. He began to show up in my thought life. Whether it was during times of worship, sitting in my office, or flying on an airplane, it seemed God was speaking to me. I kept hearing him say how much he loves me. I kept hearing thoughts of his heart for me and for Ann and for our marriage. I began to feel like I'm actually having an ongoing relationship with him versus just a heady faith or a set of sterile beliefs. There are other things that happen, like timely sermons or scripture verses that popped out, various one-on-one conversations, or working with godly counselors, such as Thad Early, who attends here, who helped me explore my heart and challenged me to go deeper. God spoke in a variety of ways to call me back to him, to fill my hunger and thirst, to invite me to intimacy with him. As I began to experience a living, intimate relationship with God, I also saw that he wanted me to experience intimacy as he intended with Ann. I was scared of what that meant, yet longed for the intimacy. God showed me how he wanted healing in our marriage. one example came in the midst of our struggles Ann had been in counseling and started remembering memories that she had repressed in the midst of this God decided to give me a dream I'm not typically one who quickly jumps to give credit to God for dreams and things like that but this one came at a real unique time I dreamt that Ann had had a baby before I met her she had kept it secret from me and then I found out I remember waking up upset and angry initially I didn't want to say anything but a few days later I told her I remember saying that I'm not sure what it meant but for some reason the dream was sticking with me little did I know but at the same time she had just begun talking about the abortion with her counselor in God's timing he had given me a dream to prepare my heart for what I was about to hear when the time came for Ann to tell me about the abortion I could listen and care for her in a much better place God was at work healing our marriage and bringing us back to him as we began to see how God was working in both of us we began to confess our sins to each other and the hurtful choices we had made against each other it was not easy it was very painful and it was filled with many tears over a couple years I began to realize in certain ways I was similar to the men who had abused Ann I'd used women for my benefit I needed to repent and ask her for forgiveness fortunately we had godly friends and counselors to work with us and to walk alongside with us through these difficult roads but through it all God kept showing up calling us to himself, bringing healing and restoration. In looking back, one of my deepest regrets of all this is that I was not able to care for Ann in a better way during this difficult time. Yet in God's amazing way, he brought Ann and I together for a purpose so that we both could look at the issues of our heart and all that came with it, to experience healing and to draw us closer to himself. and after 18 years of being together Anna and I are now beginning to experience a level of intimacy with each other that we never really thought possible God intervened to take the depth of our disordered sexuality and breathe life into our hearts to make something new In our lives we have found healing and intimacy first in our relationship with God and then in our marriage He began to restore our scared and pain-ridden hearts. In our marriage, Brian and I have begun to experience that intimacy is about giving our hearts to each other. Sex has become an expression of freely giving ourselves to each other. It's a clean and beautiful expression of the love that God has given us and the love that we have for each other. It's been a long process, but God is giving life to those areas that have been so deeply influenced by the sin of this world. We all live in a sinful world where evil is all around us. It impacts each one of us in different ways. Whether we experience it with the unexpected tragedy of terrorism, through disappointments in life, through addiction, abuse, or feeling the heartache of loneliness and helplessness, we are all in need of God's amazing and incredible love and grace. He will breathe life into the dark places as we get out what's inside. He didn't call us to do it alone. We have the body of Christ to be Jesus with skin on when we can't see him and to pray for us when we can't pray. God is faithful. He will meet you in those difficult places. Brian and I are here today to testify that he can restore and bring healing and freedom. Although we may not always be able to see it, we must always remember that because of the cross, God is victorious and evil will not win. Thank you for letting us share with you today. That was very appropriate, what you just did. Flood of emotions for me, it kind of comes down to two things. One is, where are they? They're there. I'm so proud of them. That's one. Four, I mean, I could just go on and on for all the things. But two, I am so grateful to God. Because this gospel that we preach is true. The power of amazing grace to heal is true. We were up praying just before the service for them. Having heard this last night and also heard the talk as they were preparing it, one of the things that occurred to me was that on one hand, if you were to leave after this service and somebody asked you what happened at church, You'd say, well, we heard this couple tell this amazing story, and it was an amazing story. But I want to tell you what you heard. Maybe you know. You heard the gospel today. You heard the good news about what the life of God can do in people's lives. When we talk about the gospel, we talk about the power of redeeming love, redemption in general. When we were in 1 John, I couldn't help but think of 1 John as I heard this story of the very beginning of 1 John. We made it very, very clear that Jesus, John made it clear, is inviting us into an eternal kind of life. And that what redemption is about is not just securing a home for us in heaven, though it certainly includes that. But that he, the God we serve and love, by the power of the Spirit, through the work of Christ, is desiring to invade our lives and redeem every dimension of our lives. What you heard today was a story of redemption, of healing. and how when we bring into the light what we hide in the dark it might blind us for a while i don't want to bring it in the light but in the light is where there's healing you know that analogy of light is powerful when i think of ann's story and the abuse that came to her it wasn't her fault think of a seven-year-old girl and the things that came to her over and over again that distorted her image of God and of herself and of sexuality. But what she chose to do with that was hide. I don't blame her. People would do that. But she was in the dark with it. And God was calling her into the what? Into the light. Come and tell the truth. Bring it out. And her first response was the most normal response. No, that's too scary. The light will blind me. Do you know the courage it took to bring it into the light that on the front end scares you to death. It's going to blind me. And they bring it into the light and God began to work. Same thing with Brian. When the sin of his own addictions and the choices he made to quench the thirsty heart that he had, that we all have, were destroying him. The call of God on him was bring it into the light. It took a friend to drag him. Aren't you glad for friends like that? Not on the front end, who dragged him into the light and said, you know what? I love you so much. I'm not going to let you live there. But somewhere Brian had to say, okay. He could have resisted it. He could have yanked away and said, I'm staying in the dark. But he didn't. And that's the courage. That's the faith. And God began to work. Did you hear no magic wands? Did you hear supernatural power? But no magic wands, is process, journey, courage, faith. Welcome to the kingdom of God. I cannot possibly begin to try and articulate the kinds of things that a talk like this would stir. What I want to say is we are following this service with next week's communion service as a service of consecration. It's going to be the final week of our dealing with sexuality. We're going to have a consecration service at the end of dealing with money and power as well. but come back for that as we just kind of bring some closure to this. But also today, as is normal, the prayer team will be here for people who need prayer for anything. And I can just imagine that there will be some things stirred up that you want to deal with before you leave. I would also encourage you, just if you're not ready for prayer, that's just not appropriate for you right now. God is speaking to you where you're just feeling things. I mean, part of me for this was just to be in awe of what God did through them, to just sit quietly for a while and be with God where you are. Maybe talk to a friend, but the rest of you will be dismissed. We're going to do something a little different in our dismissal today. Ashley is going to sing a song. It's not a song that we're going to sing. It's a song that she's going to sing after we're dismissed. As we're dismissed, you'll be free to go. People will come for prayer. Some of you will just sit for a while. Others will just leave. And it's a song she is just going to sing over us. For those who come to pray, it will be a prayer to call you to prayer, to stay where you are. For those of you who are leaving, it will be a song to bless you as you leave. Just let the song be that for you. Let's stand as we're dismissed in prayer. Father, I thank you for your amazing grace. I thank you that the story that we heard is why we do what we do. It's why we have a church. we thank you for the courage of Brian and Ann and so many people that I know just like them who have had the courage to come out into the light not just in this arena but in many where you begin to do healing and we thank you that you're faithful pray father that you would take this word and may it be hope and healing for many the beginning of hope and healing for some and give the courage that is necessary for all of us to be a people who walk in the light of what is true and what is good, giving you access to the deepest recesses of our hearts. Pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. The altar team will be here. Stay if you would like. Be quiet as you leave and let the Spirit minister to you through this song. You're dismissed. God bless you as you leave.
