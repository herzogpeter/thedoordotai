Music Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began proclaiming Christ to them. The crowds, with one accord, were giving attention to what was said by Philip as they heard and saw the signs which he was performing. Now, there was a man named Simon who formerly was practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great. And they all, from smallest to greatest, were giving attention to him, saying, this man is what is called the great power of God. But when they believed Philip preaching the good news about the kingdom of God in the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized, men and women alike. Even Simon himself believed. And after being baptized, he continued on with Philip. And as he observed signs and great miracles taking place, he was constantly amazed. And this passage also from Matthew 8.1 and 7.29. When Jesus had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him, and they were amazed at his teaching, for he was teaching them as one having authority. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Father, for the kind of life and energy and clarity and power that can only be generated by your Spirit, I pray. And I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Acts 8 verse 1 says that it was on that day, that day being the day that Stephen was stoned, on that day a great persecution arose in Jerusalem, spearheaded by this guy named Saul, who I think you know eventually became Paul, so there's a miraculous story in that. But Saul, at this particular place in verse 3 was ravaging the church, entering house after house and dragging off men and women who would, he would then throw them into prison. But instead of destroying the church, which was clearly Saul's intent and desire, instead of putting out this fire that had begun to burn in a very small upper room in Jerusalem when the Spirit of God landed in Acts chapter 2, It simply served to spread the fire from Jerusalem, where it began, to the regions of Judea and Samaria, because those who had been scattered by this persecution, it says in verse 4 of Acts 8, went about preaching the word. They went about proclaiming the reality of this Christ, risen from the dead. And Philip was just one of them, it says in verse 5, who in his personal being scattered by this persecution in Jerusalem found himself running to Samaria. He didn't go there on a mission trip. He went there kind of running for his life. And there he did what everyone else did to begin to proclaim Christ. So he's in Samaria where he, along with the rest of the church, still very much in its infancy, was introduced to a different kind of threat to the church than the one they had just endured and escaped in Jerusalem. Because in Jerusalem, the threat was obvious and clear. It was in your face. It was angry and hostile and wanted to hurt you. But in Samaria, the threat, and it didn't look like a threat at the beginning at all, was that everyone was cheering them. They weren't hostile to them. They were loving. They wanted to marry them, indeed, with one accord. It says in verse 6 of Acts 8, the multitudes, the multitudes, kind of everybody with one accord, were giving attention to what was being said. But not only that, they weren't just giving attention. Very clearly, the text says, they believed Philip when he spoke, preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and in the name of Jesus they were being baptized. This is amazing. Men and women alike were being baptized including this guy named Simon who we met last week who prior to Philip's arrival in Samaria was kind of the big guy in town. He was the one to whom the multitudes were giving attention and then Philip comes and the crowd begins to shift. So when even Simon believed along with everyone else, kind of, it looks like we have everybody. This is really going well. Even Simon believed, it says in verse 13, he, Simon himself believes, verse 13, and after being baptized himself as well, he continued on, kind of following Philip and being part of this work. So again, everyone is believing, being baptized. In fact, Simon says, it says of Simon, he was amazed So it appears that Simon is their biggest fan. Verse 13 says, as he observed the signs and great miracles, as people were being healed and some people were being delivered, literally of demonic empowerment in their life, they were being set free. As he observed all this, Simon was constantly amazed, and it had to just feel so good to Philip and these other new believers, still in, again, infancy in their life with Christ, having just escaped this horrific ravaging of their lives back in Jerusalem. To be received like this, to be heard like this, applauded like this, it just had to feel really good because everyone, everyone believed, and were baptized, and were continuing on, But like a weed in a garden, something's wrong, I said last week. Like a weed that kind of doesn't belong. Something here doesn't belong. Something is off. Something is false. Particularly with this Simon guy, who though he believed and was baptized and continued on and was, in some sense, their biggest fan. In verse 21 of Acts chapter 8, Peter, and it took a while to dial into this to figure out what was going on, says to Simon, there really is something wrong in the soup here, Simon, because your heart is not right. You believe and you're baptized. I get all that. Because even though he was their biggest fan, he was, in fact, the biggest fraud. A fact that comes to light in verse 18. I remember this from last week because it says in verse 18, when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was imparted by the laying on of the apostles' hands and all this power came on people, and this seemed to be the source of all these signs and wonders and healings, Simon offered them money. And it was obvious that he offered them money to get the power. It's probably not the first time money and power have been connected. Simon is the embodiment of someone who is using money to get power and get power to get more money. He wanted to get in on the act. He wanted to get in on the action, so he offered the money, believing that if he had the power, he could get more money. I mean, that was exactly why he gave money, to get power. He wanted power to get more money because he would get the money, he knew, and he was right about this. He would get the money from people who believed he had the power. if he had the power. And he would get it from desperate people who needed the power to heal them, to deliver them. And if he believed that he had the power, they would give him money. So Simon gave money to get power. He got power to get more money from desperate people who would give their money. Often more than they had to give, they would give their money to the television preacher who says, I'll pray for you. If you send 50 bucks, 100 would be better. You'll be healed. You'll be delivered. You'll have health. You'll have wealth. Just speak the word and send some money. It's like a seed, and it will grow, and you'll get rich, and so will I. And where does that stuff come from? It's very confusing because they believed. Simon did. And everybody believed. And they were baptized. And they continued, it's very confusing, but it isn't new. It's kind of what I want to press into today. This isn't new, this kind of distortion stuff or something real. It has something false that's mixed right into it. Indeed, Jesus in Matthew 13, 47 says, this is almost like saying, you guys, I don't want to alarm you, but you need to be aware. You need to be discerning. here because wherever the kingdom of God actually begins to move in an authentic way, in a city or a church or in a Samaria of some kind, what it's like is a dragnet. It's like a dragnet that gets thrown out into the sea, and when you pull that dragnet in from the sea, having been out there a while, it's full of fish. Picture that if you can. The auditorium is full of fish. Not a really a good comparison, is it? Fish of every kind, it says. You drew a crowd is what he's talking about. It's a multitude of fish, but not all the fish are good for eating. Indeed, if you eat that kind of fish, you're going to get sick. You're going to get sick. I know it looks like a fish, but it's not a good fish to eat. You'll get spiritually sick. So when the nets were full, it says in verse 47 or 48, they drew them up to the beach, these nets, and gathered the good fish into containers. Because they were mean, they were basically saying, and this was the point of his parable here, his little analogy here, what he was saying was, this kind of fish is good for you. This kind of fish will nourish you, but the bad they threw away, as if to say, these fish will make you sick. Because if you swallow that, if you buy what that guy is selling, what Simon is selling, you're going to get sick, spiritually sick. And it's confusing because it's all coming in the name, not just of God, but of Christ, Jesus Christ. They believed in that name. We're baptized in that name. So you better sort the fish once in a while, which is another scary thing. How do you do that? You better be discerning, I think is what it means, because it's a greater threat sometimes than the persecution of Jerusalem that we saw not long ago, that Philip saw not long ago is this simony. I told you last week that that's an actual word. That word has been coined. The word simony coming from this story is used to speak of people who kind of take religion and money and stick them together and make money the object of how you get your blessing or your healing or your forgiveness. It was the flattery, the popularity, the celebrity, saying all of that to kind of again sit in this one more week that while all that's confusing none of it is new Jesus dealt with it all the time Jesus was constantly dealing with the multitude he was constantly dealing it's part of the story you see it all through his life his story he was constantly dealing with the multitude and not all the time but very often the multitude multitude was doing what the multitude was doing in Samaria with Jesus, they were often cheering him. They were admiring him. They were his biggest fans, much like in Matthew chapter 7, verse 28. The context here is that Jesus has just finished what most consider the greatest sermon ever preached, the Sermon on the Mount, and after he's finished preaching that, it says this, that when Jesus had finished, the multitudes were applauding. They were amazed because this guy's speaking as one having authority. They were cheering him as if to say, Jesus, we're your biggest fans. But when you're dealing with a crowd, with a multitude of people, particularly, and this is when I like them the best, when they're cheering, you don't always know what you have. You don't always know why they're here, why they're really here, what they're really hearing. So Jesus would start sorting kind of the fish. Just a bit. He did it all the time, often by simply clarifying what he meant by what he said. And it would often, when he clarified what he meant by what he said, no, I didn't mean that. I meant this. It would often thin the crowd. He wasn't trying to get rid of anybody. In fact, he was trying to draw them into the real deal, but he always did that. And when he would clarify what he meant, it would often thin the crowd, like in Matthew 8, 19. This is one of my favorites. I think you remember this one because there was a crowd following Jesus, and Jesus noticed the crowd. And out of the crowd there came this guy. He's called a certain scribe, just like a certain man named Simon. This is just some guy, but he's a scribe, which makes him significant. and he comes to Jesus from out of the crowd saying, Teacher, I'm your biggest fan, and I will follow you wherever you go. And it was true. He would follow him wherever he would go until, however, he heard what it might actually cost, what it might actually mean to be a follower of his, because when Jesus said, and I think he was hoping to call him in. He wasn't trying to get rid of him. yes, yeah, that'd be great if you follow me. Come, get in the boat with me. We're gonna go, but just know this. I just need to tell you something. I need to clarify something. Foxes have holes and birds have nests. The Son of Man has no place to lay his head. And if you follow me, it might be that way for you, scribe. And I can tell you're kind of not used to that kind of thing. So follow me now. And the guy who was his biggest fan, this time the guy disappears, as I've said many times, in the white space between 20, verse 20 and 21, he wasn't trying to get rid of anyone, but there was kind of a sorting of the fish, if you will, in this Simon story. And it happened not by Jesus kicking anyone out, it was by clarifying what he meant by what he said. Sometimes people would just leave. They'd kind of identify themselves when Jesus would talk about what it really meant to follow him, what it really costs to follow him, they'd simply realize, I kind of liked it till now. I don't like that. I'm not doing that. I'm not going there. This is just too much. Indeed, in John chapter 6, it says this fascinating verse, I think, that as a result of this, and the this there, as he was doing what he always did, he kind of got this following, and these are disciples. He says, I need to clarify what I mean. This is what I mean by what I'm saying. And as a result of that clarification, many of his disciples, it says in John 6, withdrew from him and were not walking with him anymore. So the crowd is getting smaller. This is not the direction you want to go. I don't know. Because much like the scribe and Simon 2, along with the crowd in Samaria and the crowds that followed Jesus, when Jesus would clarify what he meant by what he said, and it became clear what it would cost, what it might mean to follow him, they'd back away. And though not hostile to Jesus, indeed, they still might say, I admire him. I even in some sense believe in him. I kind of believe in that guy. Many, not all, but many had absolutely no intention of actually following him or becoming like him, which brings us to the question of the day. And it's one you just need to go inside yourself with a little bit, and that's this. Where do you find yourself in this story? We can't always ask that question, because we talk about the story of God, and where are we in the story as a church, as individuals? Where are we in the story? Where do you find yourself in this one? Who are you in the story? An admirer who, like the many in the multitude, are amazed, even believe in some way, at some level. That's good. That's fine. Or follower, a follower of Jesus in his way of living and loving. There's just a difference between an admirer and a follower. Let me get at that by telling you a story several years ago. At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China, the world was taken by storm and became quite enamored with a young man, a swimmer named Michael Phelps. You know the name. He destroyed the competition in that Olympics, won eight gold medals by 2012, just a few years ago. He added to that number, so his total was 15 gold medals. He He had 19 medals in all. He broke several world records. He was the hottest thing in town, and people were amazed, and rightly so. Indeed, it was reported on Facebook that Facebook added 5 million people to its network when Michael Phelps simply mentioned that he'd been on it. So the multitudes back in 2008 were with one accord. They were all giving attention to everything Michael Phelps was saying, and they believed. and continued on following this guy. People loved him and admired him, and there were lots of reasons why. But right in the middle of all that admiration, all of that adulation, somewhere out there, some people were watching the Olympics just a little bit differently than everybody else. Because what happened inside of a few went beyond admiration. It's kind of a little weird. You know, if it would go beyond admiration, it is a little weird because some people, as they watched this Michael Phelps do what he did, their hearts started pounding and their minds started racing as it dawned on them that what Michael Phelps was doing, they wanted to do. The way he was swimming was the way they wanted to swim so that somewhere out there, several years ago, there were some people, probably kids, were reading articles and watching videos and getting up early to go to a pool and finding a coach and swimming laps endlessly and eating differently. It was horrible, really. Sleeping differently because they actually wanted to and had come to believe that they could become like Michael Phelps. Indeed, there were some kids out there who actually believed that one day they would, and whoever they were and whoever they are, they are not admirers. Well, they are admirers, but they're not just admirers. They became followers. A big difference. Now, when I think of that story of Phelps and being an admirer follower. I'm not in the category of follower. Just trust me on that. I applaud Michael Phelps. I'm classic admirer here for his swimming, but I'm not going to change my life because of him. I promise you that. I didn't. I haven't been in a pool since the Olympics. And if I was in a pool, it wouldn't be to train. Promise it would be to cool off or throw my grandkids in. I'm an admirer. Clearly not a follower. Big difference. Dial all that now into Matthew chapter 5. Told you about Matthew chapter 7. Matthew chapter 7 was when Jesus finished the Sermon on the Mount. In Matthew chapter 5, he began to teach the Sermon on the Mount, and the multitude was there. It says just prior to Matthew chapter 5, and when he saw the multitude, he began to teach. Went up onto the side of the mountain, and he began to teach, and he kept on teaching until Matthew chapter 7, and when he was done teaching, the multitude that was there at the beginning and was there at the end were amazed. They were amazed at his teaching, but somewhere in both those crowds, the one that was listening to him at the beginning and the one listening to him at the end, all of them amazed. Somewhere in both those crowds, there were some who were hearing it a little different because somewhere there were some in whose hearts something was stirring that went way beyond admiration because as they watched this teacher and heard his words, their hearts started pounding. Their minds started racing. So it began to dawn on them that maybe, just maybe, the things that he is doing we could do. It's maybe, just maybe the things that he is saying we could say. The way he is living and loving we could live and love that way. Indeed, if we follow him, we could maybe one day be, wow, could we be like him? And so there were a few. There always were, a few in the multitude who said, I gotta have that. I gotta have that. Indeed, I would rather have what this man has to offer and give up everything that the world has to offer than to have everything the world has to offer and to give up this man, so I will do whatever he wants me to do. I will go wherever he tells me to go. I will give whatever he asks me to give, which means, among other things, this. You're not just an admirer anymore. You become somehow in there, a follower, and it's a big difference. See, Jesus knew that his presence in his life and his words would have an effect with a few. And so he was constantly, constantly inviting people, pressing people, kind of forcing people to decide, will they move from being an admirer? I'm glad you're here, I think he would say, at least in his spirit. But would they make that move from the admirer to the follower? Will they step out of the multitude place and become part of the few, if you will? In John 3, there's an illustration of this. Jesus meets this guy named Nicodemus. He's a Pharisee, a ruler of the Jews, it says in verse 1. John 3, verse 1 says this. Nicodemus came to Jesus by night and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher, for no one can do the signs that you do unless God was with him. So Nicodemus is clearly, whatever else he is, he's an admirer. We know you've come from God, for no one could do. You're amazing, Jesus. But he comes to him by night, it says. And I don't know if that means anything for sure, but I kind of read some things into that that maybe I shouldn't. He comes to him by night, and when you do something at night, it's dark and it's dark so people can't see. I think he came to him at a time when he maybe wouldn't be seen. He didn't want to be seen because that would risk being associated with someone of whom his friends did not approve and his friends were the Pharisees and he didn't want to be seen with him. But he admires him. So the risk for him in coming to Jesus, even though it was night, and maybe people wouldn't see him. The risk was the loss of status, being among the Pharisees, and what people would think. So Jesus says to him these words that mean, I think, something different to us than it did to Nicodemus originally. He says, you must be born again, Nicodemus. And when he's heard that for the first time, when we hear that, I mean, we hear that in the context of maybe growing up with it. You need to be born again. And I go, okay, do it. And we pray this prayer. And when Nicodemus hears it, it just sounds so weird. But I think he maybe did understand, because what Jesus was saying is that you must allow my spirit to remake you from the inside out. Are you willing, Nicodemus, with all of your power and status and knowledge, are you willing to start over and declare yourself, understand yourself to be someone who, like a child, knows nothing? Are you willing to start over from the beginning and become not the knowing Pharisee, but the learner? Are you willing also to quit sneaking around in the dark and come out into the light? Well, like a lot of people, Nicodemus wasn't willing, at least right away, which is something that speaks to journey. Jesus isn't going to force you, but eventually Nicodemus is willing to come toward Jesus, because when Jesus died and they pulled him from a cross, it's fascinating really, because it's Nicodemus, the one who came to Jesus at night in order to not be seen, who publicly in front of everybody says, I'm with him, claims the body and places it in a tomb, which means that Nicodemus, both literally and figuratively, went from being in the night to being in the light, no longer an admirer. He's a follower. No. Mark chapter 10, verse 17, another story. The young man, again, one you're familiar with, I think, comes to Jesus running, running to Jesus, because Jesus is just, I'm just your biggest fan. And he kneels before him, calling him teacher. Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life? I know you know. And Jesus says, after a little bit of dialogue, just one thing, sell everything you have. Okay. In other words, I want you to radically change how you use the resources of your life. Give what you have to bless the poor and come and follow me. But at these words, verse 22, this fan of Jesus, his face fell, and he went away so sad, grieved, it says, because following Jesus would have affected not just his financial life, it was bigger than that, what Jesus was asking, what he was telling this guy was, this is going to affect your sense of and your source of security. I'm going to ask you to let go of whatever that is and becoming an admirer and being an admirer. If you're in that, you just never do that. I mean, why would you? I like to cheer for you. I like to hear the talks, but I'm not doing anything. And he went away, sad. It's actually a fascinating category of people, this rich young ruler is who he's identified with. because much of the gospel record, I think you know this, involves people who were hostile toward Jesus, just like the people in Jerusalem were hostile toward this new church. They were always wanting to trick Jesus, discredit Jesus, ultimately kill Jesus. But this group, actually, that we're seeing in this, embodied in this rich young ruler, actually likes Jesus and would say at some level that they believe in him, maybe even have accepted him, I don't know, as their personal savior and whatever. But they have no intention of actually following him. Not his way of living and loving and being, of actually dealing with and getting help for, you know, like their anger or their lust or their marriage or their mouth or their money or how they treat their neighbor, let alone love an enemy. See, when Jesus was finished, the crowd was amazed. But that was never the point. It was never the point because Jesus never went up to people and said, boy, I really want you to admire me. In fact, you can check this out. He never even said, I want you to worship me. He said, I want you to follow me. into a different kind of life, an eternal kind of life that will result in heaven when you die, but that's not even the point. It's an eternal kind of life right here and right now, but now know this, that sometimes in your following, you will stumble. Sometimes some of you are even sitting here wondering, I don't know if I'm a follower. You need to know sometimes in your following, you will stumble, and sometimes in your following, you will stumble badly. And when you do, you will wonder if it's worth it. You maybe wonder if you're worthy. What's the use? I don't have what it takes to be a follower. Let me leave you with two pictures as we just pull this together to close. The first is from 1 John 3, verse 7. And it speaks of people like little children who practice righteousness. And there's a call to practice righteousness, which actually sounds a little intimidating. So I want you to see it like this, like a little kid who instinctively, almost desperately wants to be like his or her daddy or mommy, I suppose, and wants to follow in his footsteps. I relate to this as a little kid with my dad. You've heard me tell stories of my dad, but dad is big. He's a big guy. I'm a toddler. I'm a little kid, and his stride is really long. So sometimes when I try to follow in his footsteps, kind of picture snow. And I'm trying to put my feet where my dad puts his. I'm trying really hard to do it. I can't do it because he's bigger than me and his stride is longer than me. Can't make it. The snow is too deep. And I begin to wonder as a little kid if I'm ever going to make it. I don't think I'm worthy. I don't think I'm ever going to be there, and I'm here to tell you, I just want to tell you something. As we're talking about admirers and followers, you just need to know if your follower that's stumbling is part of what it means to follow. You're going to stumble. Sometimes badly. It doesn't mean you're not a follower. Second picture closed with this is actually a story. A couple years ago, I was in New York speaking at a school out there. I got picked up at the airport by a guy who was going to be my host. He actually became a good friend of mine. His name was Ron. One evening, we were going out to dinner in part of a town that he was not familiar with, so he had this GPS that kind of tells you, you know, turn right, turn left. You know how that works, but he didn't trust this thing. He was kind of crabby about the GPS, talked about all the times it took him the long way, and so he made it real clear. He knew better ways to go. So sure enough, as we were coming to this intersection, the nice lady's voice in the GPS said, turn right at the light. But Ron knew a better way when he said turn right. And so we went straight and turned left and got lost. And then the voice came on saying, recalculating route. When safe to do so, execute a U-turn, which irritated Ron a lot. So he turned it off, which is what you do. And we got really lost. He had no idea where we were. And finally, as you might guess, we had a big laugh at his expense. And he plugged it back in. And it was fascinating because when he plugged it back in, you know what the voice said? I loved it because the voice said this, you big idiot. You think I'm going to help you now? After you rejected me, there's no way. You just find your own way home. No, no. She said, recalculating route. And when it's safe, take a U-turn. Turn around. And find your way home. and I will bring you home. But you're going to have to follow. Beloved, Jesus is not looking for admirers. He's not looking for a large group of hearers or correct believers. He's looking for followers who will do what he says. particularly when he says recalculate your route it's time to execute a U-turn so I can not only bring you home but I can introduce you into an entire new kind of life an eternal kind of life right here and right now but you're gonna have to follow me. Let's pray as we close. Would you stand with me? Father, I thank you for your patience with us. Thank you for the relentless way you keep inviting us, actually you keep inviting us back because all of us turn that GPS thing off. And I thank you for your grace. Give us the courage to continually recalculate, make the turns back to you we need to make, following you into a new kind of life, a kingdom, eternal kind of life. And all God's people said, Amen.
