Ah, let's pray as we go to the Word. Father, I pray that you would provide the very breath of God on these words in order to allow us to enter in and learn to do the dance of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. I pray that in Jesus' name. Amen. That prayer will actually make more sense after you hear my sermon. It strikes me as poignant that for well over a year, we have been preparing ourselves both physically and spiritually, consecrating ourselves for a move that is now just two weeks away. Next week will be our last week, gathering as God's people in this room. But next week is going to be our service of consecration, bringing an end to our series on money, sex, and power, where next week we will, with power, do what we've already done with money and sex. We will corporately consecrate our power as belonging unto God, which means that this week is the last week that I have opportunity to preach what I would kind of consider a full-blown sermon. This side of our move, this move that we've been anticipating for so long. So on a day like that, it's kind of the last sermon. What do you talk about? Something important, something central. I was feeling some pressure early in the week. Something really good. Something that I hope is consistent with the waiting room of Acts 1, verse 4, that we've all kind of sensed we are in right now as a church. Well, you'll have to decide how important or central this word this morning is. But for several weeks, I've found myself drawn to a text specifically for this weekend that I just couldn't get away from. It's found in the book of Ephesians, the fourth chapter, the third verse. If you have your Bibles, you can turn to that. But rather than just reading it, I want to give this text in the form of a word. because I think it is kind of a word from God to us, a paraphrase, if you will, that embraces the context of where we are right now as a church and includes what I think God is wanting to say to us just two weeks before we move to Maple Grove. Here's the word. Church of the Open Door. As you anticipate and have even come to rightly expect the power of the Holy Spirit of God to be manifested among you in a variety of ways in order to do the work I have been preparing you for and calling you to for many years. Be very diligent. Make every effort, Ephesians 4, now verse 3, to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. For it will be by preserving the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, not by your demonstrations of power, but by the preserving of the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace that all men will know that you have come to follow me. In fact, that's how men and women will come to know that I have come in the flesh because the power of the Spirit without the unity of the Spirit can undermine and even destroy the work of the Spirit. And if you think that's an overstatement, read 1 Corinthians 13, verse 1. where Paul says this, if I speak with the tongues of men and of angels but don't have love, I'm a noisy gong and a clanging cymbal making lots of religious noise, but that's all it is, religious noise. And if I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge and if I have all faith, so much faith, so as to remove mountains but have not love, I am nothing. Here's the deal. It is in living in and living out in practical, visible ways the unity of the Spirit that has the power to actually rightly order power, which has been our concern over the last several months, dealing with power and rightly ordered power, which raises this question relative to the text of the morning. What exactly is the unity of the Spirit? We need to do some teaching around that, for the fact is this, that the unity of the Spirit is a very specific and unique kind of unity. It's a unique kind of love. Plainly stated, the unity of the Spirit is the unity of the Spirit. It's very helpful, I know. We say it this way. The unity of the Spirit is the unity that the Holy Spirit himself experiences and enjoys as the third person of the Trinity. It's still a little weird. Let me explain some more. One of the fundamental teachings of Orthodox Christian faith is the doctrine of the Trinity. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, three distinct expressions, one God. This three-in-one dynamic is central. There are some doctrines over which people of faith over the years have agreed to disagree about. The doctrine of the Trinity is not one of those. For centuries, Christians have agreed that this is essential information about God, that he is three, that he is one. Why is that essential information? Well, for many reasons, but relative to this issue of the unity of the Spirit, this is why, because the triune God, three in one, represents, among other things, the origin and model of all relationship and community, serving as the foundation for and mirror of our life together as a community of faith. As we have been called into a life with God, who is himself a community of love, we are called into that kind of community, which is precisely why we need to make every effort to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Now, even after that explanation, which I think, by the way, is correct, it may not have sunk down into your soul. I just have the sneaking suspicion. Still a little bit obscure. So let me get to what I think this means by asking a question. And the question itself is a little odd, but it's going to kind of force you to stretch your mind a little bit and look at this thing maybe a little different way. Question is this. What do you suppose life must be like in the context of the Trinity, the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit? Same question, a different way. How do you suppose the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit interact with each other? Weird question. Okay, well, for example, do you think they ever argue about things like whose name gets mentioned the most in the Bible? Do you think they ever argue amongst themselves about who's the most omniscient, who's the most omnipresent, who's the oldest? Oh, this is weird stuff. You have a weird pastor, so this is all just real consistent. Now, you know, again, it makes you stretch your mind a little bit. But with that thought in mind, and we're all kind of going, of course they wouldn't argue about that. That is correct. It's ironic, however, when it dawns on you that when Jesus, the second person of the Trinity, came and manifested to us and revealed to us who God was, when he came to earth, the most common argument he heard on earth with people he was very intimate with, the most common question he heard, and it came in the form of an argument, was almost always this. Who among us is the what? Greatest. See, that was kind of a new thing for God the Son. You never heard that in the Trinity. In our day, that statement, who's the greatest, or that kind of thing, is associated with a very famous athlete, Muhammad Ali, who made a habit in his peak years of telling anyone who'd stick a microphone near his mouth, I'm the greatest. That's what he said all the time. He was known by that. True story about him. He was getting on an airplane one day. A flight attendant told him that, Mr. Ali, you have to buckle your seatbelt before we take off. He said, no. She said, no, you understand, there's a federal law. If you don't buckle your seatbelt, we can't leave the terminal. He said, lady, I'm Superman, and Superman don't need no seatbelt. And she said, that's very helpful, because Superman don't need no plane. Now, I told that for two reasons. One is because I thought it was funny. Two, well, that really wasn't in the tattoo. No, no. I did tell you that for a reason. Because the point of this whole thing is that the unity that the Spirit enjoyed, when we talk about the unity of the Spirit, what the Spirit experienced in the context of the Trinity, There was none of that who's the greatest stuff. New Testament theologian Dale Bruner wrote a little book on the Holy Spirit entitled The Holy Spirit, The Shy Member of the Trinity. He says this, One of the surprising discoveries in my own story of the doctrine and experience of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament is what I can only call the shyness of the Holy Spirit. What I mean by that is not the shyness of timidity or self-consciousness. After all, the Holy Spirit is most commonly associated with power, but the shyness of deference, the shyness of concentrated attention on another. In a word, the shyness of love. Now, his suspicion of that, what he was smelling there is confirmed in places like John 14, where it says this, that when the Holy Spirit comes from the Father, one of his primary functions would be not to say, I'm here. His primary function would be to bring into your remembrance everything that Jesus said. He's constantly pointing to another, to the Son. John 15, same kind of thing. When the Holy Spirit comes, he will bear witness to Jesus. He will glorify and lift up Jesus. His function is to say this, pay attention to him, listen to him, be preoccupied with him. Bruner further writes that the Holy Spirit is almost like the Cinderella of the Trinity. the great neglected person of the Godhead. But he's not off in the corner pouting about that. In fact, he may be behind that. Because the great desire of the Holy Spirit is that we become overwhelmed again, thrilled again, excited and gripped again by the wonder, majesty and relevance of Jesus. The Holy Spirit does not mind being Cinderella outside the ballroom if the prince is honored in the kingdom. So if you're ever in a place, maybe a place like this place, where we're lifting up Jesus and singing songs about Jesus, and the sun is being lifted up, and in some supernatural way, the veil that sometimes closes our eyes begins to pull back, and you get a sense of who Jesus really is. Don't wonder what's going on. The Holy Spirit of God is doing that. We look for manifestations of the Spirit, and the ones I'm about to mention are manifestations of the Spirit. We think of signs and wonders and people falling down and people speaking in tongues. Those are all manifestations of the Spirit. Can I tell you, the primary work of the Holy Spirit is to reveal to you the Son. How do you know the Spirit really came today? Because I got a picture of Jesus. That's how you know. But Jesus is the same way. That's what's amazing about this. He has the same shyness, this deference of love. For Jesus says things like this, if I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. I'm here to reveal the Father. That's why I came, to reveal the Father. I don't come to be served, but to serve. Last weekend, the time we spent in the Word, we discovered that Jesus spent his entire earthly life listening to, responding, and submitting to who? The Holy Spirit. And then his prayer to the Father in the garden, not my will, but thine be done, submitting to the Father. He had come to reveal Jesus had this shyness too. Then there's the Father. Twice in each of the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, not John. We hear the voice of the Father two times, once in the transfiguration and once in the baptism of Jesus, say this, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him. So the Son reveals the Father, and the Father glorifies the Son. Bruner writes again this, The major fact, bar none, that God the Father wants the world to know is all that we have in God the Son. Jesus of Nazareth is almost God's, the Father's total preoccupation. It's worth noticing that when the Father's voice came from heaven, saying of Jesus, listen to him, he didn't say, listen to me too. Don't forget about me. No, says Bruner, for each member of the Trinity points faithfully and lovingly to the other in a glorious circle of being. Here's the picture I want you to have in your mind. The Son exalting the Father. The Father taking great delight and glorifying the Son. The Spirit comes not to point to Himself. He points to and lifts up and tries to reveal the Son while the Son Himself submits to and listens to and responds to the Spirit. The Father sends the Spirit and is delighted in the Spirit while the Spirit ever intercedes on our behalf with the Father. What I'm describing to you is a dance. I want you to get a picture of a dance. the dance of the Trinity between the God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, dancing a dance of unbroken, mutual submission to each other, mutual servanthood in the Godhead, mutual love, and mutual, absolutely mutual delight. Here's the best part of this dance. It was out of that dance that creation was born. You need to get this. God did not create the world. God did not breathe the breath of life into you and me, into Adam and Eve. He did not breathe the breath of life because he was bored. You can't get a picture of the Trinity sitting there. What do you want to do? I don't know. I'm getting bored. Let's make a mountain. No. He didn't breathe the breath of life into humanity because he was lonely. It's just a street. It's so boring. Maybe if we make somebody to play with, like a person. He wasn't bored. He wasn't lonely. This makes a difference. Our existence and the creation we live in is here as a spinoff of delight from the dance. That's why sometimes we see beauty that takes our breath away. That's why C.S. Lewis writes, there are no ordinary people. You've never met a mere mortal. Why? Because it's spun off of the dance and the delight of God. Someone reminded me between services that C.S. Lewis got this, the music of God and the dance of God. In the Chronicles of Narnia, one of the volumes speaks of Aslan, and he appears to one of the characters, and he sings in a very low tone, and the grass begins to grow, and he sings in a high tone, and the birds begin to fly, and another tone in the water. He was speaking to creation, and it was about music. It was about the dance. When I shared this picture of God, the Trinity, in this incredible mutual submission, mutual servanthood, love and delight dance to Scott, when I mentioned it to Scott, he said, Dave, he says, do you know that in the Old Testament, when it says God spoke in the context of creation, the Hebrew for speak there is sing. When God sang a low tone, the grass grew. I mean, sang a high tone, that kind of thing. I mentioned the same picture to Sarah, She said, Dave, I'm reading a book right now, and it's kind of a scientific perspective on a number of things. And one of the things they're discovering is that the universe can kind of be broken down to two components. It's all made up of light and sound. And I go, okay. No, Dave, do you hear that means the universe is full of sound. It's full of music. And guess what? God's dancing to it. When God created man, he said it's not good for man to be alone. How did he know? well he's God he knows no no you know he knew because he was dancing he was dancing and in his delight of the community father son and holy spirit he from that dance created man and says oh you got you got I just want you to experience what we're experiencing so he created them male and female he created them with this potential with this design that the two shall become one flesh. Two becoming one. Now, does that sound familiar? You know why the two will become one thing is real important? Because it came right out of the dance. The dance was a three in one, and he creates man, and he says, you're gonna be just this image of me thing, two in one. The two will become one. See, that came right from the dance floor of God. And by the way, because this two becoming one thing has been so shattered in so many of our lives, in all of our lives, in one way or another, we've never fully come back to that. Our journey home is coming back to just getting tastes of what it means to be two in one in marriage. But it's been so destroyed. This almost sounds like a fairy tale to us anymore. But continue with the wonder of God's design and the innocence and the beauty of this dance. When God breathed and he said, then the two shall become one. When the two do really become one and they experience the dance of mutual submission and mutual servanthood and love and delight, those two becoming one, you know what happens? They make another one. I'm serious, a baby. And the picture I have is this continual spinning off. It's why in the church I grew up in, they would never let us dance. The dance of, yeah, that's what dancing will get you. The church I grew up in didn't get it. Well, they kind of got it. Get to picture. God wasn't lonely or bored. He was excited and he wanted to share. It just spun off. You know, in the most beautiful, precious, innocent way, when a man and a woman comes together in their dance of mutual submission, love, and delight, it is the most beautiful dance. And it spins off another. It does. You get it? And that's all God. I'm just trying to populate the earth. No. Oh, man. This is a dance. And it's the model for relationship. Came right from the dance floor of God. So he breathed into man the breath of life and said, Come dance with me. Come dance with us. Come join the dance. Enter into the circle, men and women, of unbroken mutual submission, servanthood, and love and delight. But that dance didn't last long. For by the third chapter of the book of Genesis, ego, pride, jealousy, anger, hatred, and murder, actually, had spoiled the dance. And every broken relationship you look at, every evil, awful headline you read of one life imposing its power on another to take life is another evidence that the dance has been destroyed, the dance of mutual submission, love, and delight that was so full of delight. And we've been trying to get back to the dance ever since. Now, most of us aren't aware that that's what we're looking for, but even if you're not aware that that's what you're looking for, every human being feels the ache, feels the longing. I think it's a grief for how far we have fallen, even if you can't articulate that this is the reason. Now, the reality of this dance and that we were made for this dance is why the greatest pain that we can experience is relational pain. Brokenness in families, mothers and fathers, when husbands and wives decide, I don't want to do the dance anymore. And divorce is the ultimate result of that. But how many of you know that there's a lot of people who've never gotten divorced, and they stayed married because they maybe went into a church that said, you can't get divorced, and they stay married. But they left the dance a long time ago. This dance of mutual submission and mutual servanthood and love and delight, that dance ended a long time ago. and it leaves a wounding in the heart. Splintered relationships. And you wonder, why? You know, I'm such a wimp. How come it's so hard to get over the fact that I trusted that person and they weren't worthy of it or we were dancing for a while and I opened up my heart and I gave it and they weren't giving back and they left the dance and I can't get over it. I'm such a, what's the matter with me? Here's why it's so hard to get over. Here's why it's so painful because we do not have the equipment to deal with it. We weren't made for it. It's like a car underwater. Cars were not made to run underwater. Now, I suppose that if you had a car underwater and someone was very inventive, they could bring some pipes down and some hoses and ventilate it in some way to make it run underwater. But it wasn't made to run there. And we had, you know what? I have this feeling like most of us are like cars underwater. We've learned to cope. But it's not the design of God. It wasn't the dance he had for us. by the way this dance in the reality of it is also why our greatest joy is relational joy go to a wedding now some of you go to weddings and you're cynical you're going oh it's not going to last forget about the it's not going to last thing forget about the it's not going to last okay all you get is a taste on the tip of your tongue okay oh i taste that and and and you go there and you see this couple getting married, and it's the best, it's the most joyful day of their life. And there's something in them that's just going, this is what I was made for. It is what they were made for. They were made to dance, a mutual, a dance of mutual submission, love, and delight. One of the best movies I have seen in a very long time is a movie entitled, My Big Fat Greek Wedding. How many of you have been to it? We're gonna have a movie night. You know, the truth is, In our new building, I don't know if you've been there, but we have huge screens. This is nothing. I'm going to have to cut the hair in my nose hair, I've been told, in our new place. Any zits you have, baby, they're going to be this big. Welcome to Open Door. But we're going to have, from time to time, we're going to have a movie that's so cool, and our sound system is like surround sound. Whoa! Oh, we're going to have movie nights, and so I want this one as soon as it comes out on DVD. Anyway, anyway, this movie is about a big, fat Greek family who weren't just big and fat. No, they were loud, obnoxious, opinionated, and stuck in their ways. Every single one of them, as far as I could tell, needed therapy badly. But, but, no matter how big, fat, loud, obnoxious, opinionated, and stuck in their ways any of them might be, if you were family, in this family, there was always a place at the table for you. And you would always be invited, and you would always be included, even Aunt Rosie, and even Uncle Ted, and even if they embarrassed us, of course they embarrass us. Of course they're weird. Of course they're invited. Of course there's a place for them. So at the end of that movie, what you'll notice most about the movie at the end is they were all there together. Now, they were still big, fat, loud, and obnoxious, but they were all still together laughing and dancing and rolling their eyes at how weird their family was. Now, that movie is being called a sleeper right now at the box office, and the reason I'm bringing it up is because it didn't start real well. I mean, it almost closed a week or two after it started, but it's been at the theater for a very long time now. In fact, I keep going, how long has this thing been around? And I didn't go for a long time until somebody told me. Well, that's what happened. Word of mouth began to spread. They're getting more people to go to this movie now than when it first opened. Why? Well, if you go, I think you'll know why, because it gives us a taste of what we were made for. It touches a longing that all of us have, and we don't know that's what we're longing for, and we don't always know that's what we're looking for, and most of our behavior acts totally opposite to this, but what we're longing for is to dance a dance of mutual submission, mutual servanthood, love, and delight, right in the middle of all of our frailties. I remember walking out that movie thinking, wouldn't it be something if people really stayed? wouldn't it be just think of all the people leaving that movie going i mean and then they'll go out to their real life and go nah but just for a moment you get a taste on the tip of your tongue wouldn't it be something if people stayed in the dance back to the trinity after the fall the dance is over god could easily have said as you well know I don't think I want anything more to do with broken, fallen, angry human beings for a number of reasons. Number one, it's their own fault. Number two, inviting them back into this dance and including them in the dance is going to cost even more than it costs to create them in the first place. So God the Father said, it's going to cost? Okay. Well, I'll tell you what I will do. I will give. Why? Will you give, God? For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. Herein is love. He gave. I will empty heaven of its finest treasure. And then God the son said, You will give, and I will go. And in my going, I will empty myself of all the rights and privileges that belong to me as God. And I will take on the form of a slave, and I will become obedient to the point of death, even to death in the cross. And God the Holy Spirit said, You will give, and you will go, and I will pour. And I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh. flesh. But then it gets again into the costs, because not all flesh would respond to this pouring out of God's grace. Not all flesh would be grateful. Not all flesh would even care that He did it. So for the very first time, the Holy Spirit of God, in the context of the Trinity, would be entering into and making Himself open to the possibility of an experience He never experienced in his relationship with the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, he was entering into the possibility of being resisted, of being rejected, of being quenched, of being grieved and the Holy Spirit is quenched and the Holy Spirit is grieved and he could have avoided it all. But that, beloved, is just a little bit of the cost to the Godhead in inviting us back into and including us in the dance. A dance that now finds the Father singing this song. And he sings it over and over and over us. He sings this song, I will give, I will give, I will give. And the Son in this dance sings, I will go, I will go. And the Spirit says, I will pour, I will pour. And if you want to know what love looks like, it's not a warm puppy. Love is this, I will give and I will go and I will pour out my life. And then turning to the bride, the Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit says, come rejoin the dance. Come back to the dance that I created you for, a dance of mutual submission. Quit arguing. You know how loving, patient Jesus was. Now that I'm getting a picture of who God was when Jesus came, to hear the disciples, who's the greatest? How patient. I mean, he got a little frustrated. Oh, you have a little faith. Remember, he got kind of testy there. But can you imagine his patience with them? They're just these human beings. I just want them so bad to come back and dance. But it's going to be a dance of mutual submission and mutual servanthood and mutual love and delight. So come join me, says the bride, says the groom to the bride, to this kind of dance, not only marked by submission, servant, love, and delight, but it's a dance of sacrificial giving and going and pouring it out because I didn't just do this for you. I am calling you to this. If you're going to join the dance, you're going to become a giver. You're going to become a goer. You're going to become a pourer. That's what the dance is, you see. so when Paul says in Ephesians 4 make every effort to preserve the unity of the spirit part of what he's saying is this make every effort to enter this dance of mutual submission servanthood, love and delight make every effort to invite other people into the dance well how do you invite people into it? here's how you invite them by giving and going and pouring out your life so people can come into the dance. We have to go to Maple Grove with that spirit. We are going there to do what? To get big. We are going there to give and to go and to pour out our lives. We are going there to dance. Inviting them into the dance and then to teach people how to dance. Once we invite you into the dance, you know what? And that's, by the way, I've just articulated our vision, to teach people how to dance, the dance of mutual submission, love, servanthood, and delight. And even as we're learning how to dance ourselves, finding very specific ways to teach people how to dance, to live this life of God. So Church of the Open Door, as you anticipate and even have come to expect, rightly expect, the power of the Spirit to be manifested among you in a variety of ways. Be very diligent. Make every effort to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, for it will be precisely by entering into this dance of the Spirit, marked by mutual submission, servanthood, love, and delight, marked by sacrificial giving and going and pouring it out, that all men will know that you really are followers of Jesus. That all men will know that I have come, says Jesus, in the flesh. And now you're talking real power. Rightly ordered power under God. And with that word, I can end this series. Let me close with this thought. Based on a definition of love I heard this week, actually from Greg Boyd, he said this, Dave, you can always tell what something or someone is worth to a person, in other words, you can always tell how much they love it or the person, by what they're willing to pay for it, by what they're willing to sacrifice for it, by what they're willing to be inconvenienced by for it. And that obviously fits with God. If you're trying to figure out what he was worth to you, all you have to do is look at what it cost for him to love you. I get it now. But by that definition, as he said it and it landed on me, one of the things I had to look at, and I think one of the things we have to admit is this, if honest, that many of us love our houses and our cars and our clothes and our stuff and our career far more than we could love any human being. Certainly, any lost human being, people I don't even know, why would I pour it out for them? So I'm wondering today as I close this series, if you would join me in coming to God with this request. And let it be a long-standing request, maybe for the next several years, maybe for the rest of our lives. Lord, teach us how to dance. Lord, teach us how to dance this dance of mutual submission, mutual servanthood, love and delight. Lord, teach us how to dance this dance that you began to dance for the first time when you said, Father, I will give. And you said, Son, I will go. And you said, Spirit, I will pour. Make us givers and goers and pourers because that's the dance. Lord, teach us how to dance. in sacrificial ways. A couple weeks ago, a few maybe months ago now, we participated in Maple Grove Days. We've announced that and told you about it. It was such a delightful thing. It was so much fun. It was such a good idea. And part of it, as you know, participating in that, it was just such a practical and tangible way for us to kind of, before we even moved to Maple Grove, communicate not only to Maple Grove, but even to ourselves. There are easy, even easy ways to communicate. We're here to serve you. And so even our request, you might remember, was we went to the people who needed help and volunteers, and we said we want the things that nobody else does. And so most of us, myself included, ended up picking up garbage. We just picked up garbage. And we are still receiving the effects of that. The response to that was incredible. It just blew us away. It was a relatively small thing, I think. And this last week in our staff meeting, and we read two more letters from Maple Grove and city fathers and mothers and whoever they are, whatever, thanking us. It's like, come on, it wasn't that big a deal. Even in my own experience of that, I really did enjoy that. But one of the things that dawns on me about doing that for two hours on a Saturday afternoon or morning, whatever it was, it was hot, it was really hot, was that it didn't cost me much at all, two hours. And, in fact, one of the things that put me over the edge, you know, I mean, there were a lot of good reasons to do it, and I was very eager to do it, but one of the things that I remember just kind of putting me over the edge was, you know, and on top of that, it's going to be what? Fun. In fact, one of the ways we appeal to people, even in announcements and stuff, to work with the kids or help with the parking, and you know what? It's going to be what? Fun. And there's nothing, please, there's nothing wrong with that. And you know what? There's incredible joy when we give and we go and we serve. There's incredible joy in that. But what if it wasn't fun? get a picture of the Trinity again who said these creepy people who don't even who've left the dance it's their own fault and they're angry at me but I will give I don't know about that I don't know about that I know parts of it I do I've tasted some of that anybody here say I want to dance like that you really want to reach a community then we need to learn to dance like that because it could cost us everything we have it cost him everything he had did he lose everything he had? he didn't lose a thing for God raised him up again and you know the rest of the story I mean the vision I want to give you is a very positive one and in fact, here's the parable, just the little Maple Grove days. If Maple Grove days, a couple hours of picking up garbage, which didn't cost anything, had the incredible result it did, and it did. We have real goodwill at the city hall right now. How do you get that? Well, I know I have a plan. We'll trick them and be nice to them. You know? Ah! Ah! If that little thing did, what a big thing. Just a minute. Here's the vision. what if it cost what if we gave something to cost what if we gave something significant same analogy Jesus said a cup of cold water in my name does incredible things in the kingdom of God and I go that's so great so I'll give a cup of cold water no I want you to get your vision captured here if a cup of cold water has impact in the kingdom just think if I poured out something more valuable than water like what if I gave my life or what if I gave? What if I shed my blood? I don't even know what that would mean. But I tell you, we begin to dance this thing. I'm going to kind of tell you something else. I'm on a cast vision here and I'm stirring things in you, I hope, and I'm inviting you in a deeper level of the dance. But you know what? I got to tell you, I can't tell you, after 22 years being the pastor of this church, I am more convinced that I am with a group of people who want to dance. I am more convinced of that. I see more people who want to dance than I have ever had. We are ready to go to where God has called us. We are ready to go. We're going to go, and we're going to dance. Ready to dance? I'm hearing that. I'll close with that. I will close with that. But let's pray. Can we pray? Father it occurs to me in this service as it did in the last just as I close I just feel a strong impression that there are some among us who need to come back to the dance or maybe come to the dance for the very first time and even some of what I'm saying today is a bit lost on them so I'm going to ask for a miracle to happen for some among us who didn't even come looking for anything in particular, that for ways in which I wouldn't be able to describe and can't make happen, I pray that first they would be able to hear the music. That the Father and the Son and the Spirit are singing over them, have been singing over them, have been singing over you. Some of you are having a weird thing happen to you right now because you're hearing my voice, but God's speaking to your heart. The Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit have been singing over you a song of love from before you were born. You are loved by God. And more than you can ever know, more than you could ever imagine, He wants you to join the dance of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. So it's not about joining a church. It's not about signing a card. It's as simple as saying, it's as simple as looking into the eyes of God right now and saying, I don't even fully know what it means, God. but I want to join the dance of life, of mutual submission, servanthood, love and delight. And you know the other good news? You don't even have to dance well to start dancing. You can be a real lousy dancer. You can be a very selfish person. God will change that as he teaches you how to dance. But if you want to dance, some of you right now are being invited, and I just encourage you to say yes. Before you leave, say yes to God. Help us hear the music of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. And help us be a people who not only enter the dance, but learn at deeper and deeper and deeper levels how to dance. Help us be a people who are inviting others into the dance. and God I pray over the next weeks, months, years that you would give us more and more tangible ways to practically help people learn how to do this delightful, wonderful dance that we were created for and all God's people said, Amen. Amen.
