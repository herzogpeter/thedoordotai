Turn your Bibles with me to the book of Ephesians, the fourth chapter for our ongoing study in the book of Ephesians. Ephesians chapter 4, starting in verse 11 this morning. If you've been gone for a little while because of vacations or anything and are back now, you'll realize that we have not gotten very far since you left. I hope that doesn't mean that you haven't missed very much. Verse 11. And he gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers and their task to equip the saints. And what would that result in? The work of ministry. And what would that result in? The building up of the body of Christ until we all attain the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result of all this, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness and deceitful scheming. But now, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body being fitted and held together by that which every joint supplies according to the proper working of each individual part causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your precious word. I thank you, Father, for the impact that this particular book, Ephesians, has had on me and has had on us as a church. And Lord Jesus, as we open it once again, we ask for the anointing of your spirit that, Father, we would hear from you. And Lord, this morning, especially with this text that I see as being absolutely crucial to us in our time in history as a church. That, Father, that you indeed would be our teacher. That something more than words would be communicated, and that our hearts would catch what you would have us catch. In Jesus' name, amen. Gene Goetz wrote a book called The Measure of a Church, and in his introduction he says this, Some say that a mature church is an active church. They evaluate its depth by the number of meetings held each week or by the number of different programs going on every day. Some people say that a mature church is a growing church. As long as new people are coming and staying, then all must be well. Some people say, on the other hand, that a mature church is a giving church. As long as people are giving to the ongoing program of the church and supporting its many ventures, it must be a mature church. Some people believe that a mature church is a soul-winning church. In fact, this is proof positive. When people are bringing people to Christ regularly, we must surely be mature. Some people, on the other hand, believe that a mature church is a missionary-minded church, a church that supports missions around the world and designates large portions of its budget to world evangelism. Some people believe that a smooth-running church is the sign of maturity, A church whose organizational machinery is well-oiled, where everyone does what he's hired to do on time and with efficiency. Still others say that a mature church is a spirit-filled church. This means that it has enthusiasm and it's dynamic, lots of emotion and excitement. Finally, for some, the ultimate mark of a mature church is that it's big. Unfortunately, says Goetz, some people actually believe that what I have just stated actually are biblical marks of maturity. Let me hasten to add, he says, many of these things will be and must be present in a mature church. There will be activity. There will be people leading other people to Christ. There will be an emphasis and a strong desire for missions. There will be a sense of enthusiasm and excitement. But, unfortunately, all those things can also be present without having maturity. There can be lots of activity, and lots of busyness, and lots of programs, and lots of growth numerically, lots of organizational structure, and still not have a mature church, still not be a commendable church. Now, if all that is true, what is the biblical criteria for a commendable church? How do we know that we're moving in the right direction? How do we become commendable? How do we become and how do we move into the kind of growth that would be ordained of God? It's amazing all the different formulas that are available to us right now. We are living in a day and age when church growth is an obsession of ours. You can go to seminars on church growth and there are institutes of church growth and conferences and books are being written and discussions all the time on ways that we as a church can grow and all that's good. I think growth is important. It needs to be a major thrust in church. We need to grow. But I want you to catch this just as we begin, and it's very important. How we grow is crucial. That we grow is important. But how we grow is absolutely crucial. Filling this place with bodies is not our goal. Filling this place with bodies is not a priority of ours. I submit this, That the pattern for the systematic progress for the building of the church is found in Ephesians 4, 11-16. It's the how to. It's the how to grow. It's the how to build. In fact, I would also submit this, that any seminar or any institute or any conference or any sermon that is preached is valid only insofar as at some point it intersects with Ephesians 4, 11-16. I believe that this is the divine plan for growth in the church. Hebrews 4, 11 to 16. Okay, you got that? The foundation is laid. Let's get to it and understand. Let's start again by just establishing a foundation. The foundational purpose and objective and priority of the church, and get this, so far as it relates to the believer, when believers come together on a Sunday morning and we are here, The function of this time here is very simple. It's found in the first line in verse 12 to equip the saints, to perfect the saints, to mature the saints. We are here to be matured. We are here to be built up, to be edified, to be perfected. That's why we're here. That's the bottom line. That is what we're after. and everything else, everything else that we talk about, from evangelism that can turn the city of crystal upside down to groups of fellowship to discipleship that's very important is going to come flowing out of a commitment to perfecting the saints. That's the bottom line. By the way, the word perfect, to equip, is the Greek word katartidzo. It means to be mature. It doesn't mean to be absolutely sinless. It means to be mature, to be complete, to be grown up, to be fully equipped, ready to go. The problem is this. The church in America has lost this as their focus, I believe. I believe that the church in America has lost this as their focus, and I believe it can be evidenced by our superficiality and our shallowness. Church growth is important, but if we lose this as our focus, what it becomes is nothing more than a numbers game for us. And when it becomes a numbers game, and that is the focus of everything we're doing, We're going to do anything we can to get people in. We're going to start with the lollipops, and we're going to start with the balloons, and we're going to start with the clowns. And I've heard of a church that they were giving 50 cent pieces to people who were coming new, and it was just a wonderful thing. And the big thing was getting bodies in the church, you know. We were really big on bodies. And anything that it takes to get them here will do. And you have thermometers in front, and you can see how many people you're getting, and it's just a wonderful thing. Just getting bodies in the church. And so you have contests, and you set a record, but, you know, you never reach it again. It's a big deal. You've got bodies in the church, though, and that's the goal. Told you a couple weeks ago about a pastor who was involved with another pastor in a contest in their church for Sunday school, and the goal, again, was to get bodies in the church. And they had this contest, and it came to an end, and one of the pastors lost, and it upset him so badly that he went home and threw up. Kind of makes you want to go home and throw up, doesn't it? I'm afraid that we have gone on from there. The focus now is probably entertainment. the focus now is entertainment we just entertain the saints there's jugglers for Jesus and sword eaters for Jesus and magicians for Jesus and we're just going to use all those people to help build the body the result of that kind of mentality just filling the place with bodies and then entertaining the saints the result of that in the people of God is that we lose our sense of commitment we lose our sense of loyalty and convenience becomes the operative word if it's convenience I'll be there if it's easy I'll be there if it's entertaining I'll be there It's wonderful. The problem with that is simply this, that God's standard is still the same. God's standard is still the same. We are not here to entertain the saints. We are not here to coddle the saints. We are not here to pacify the saints. We are not even here to evangelize the saints. We are not here. You know, that brings up another problem. One of the problems in many evangelical churches today is that Christians can go to church and go to church for 15 years and go to church every Sunday. And you know what? all the lover here for 15 years is how to get saved. Over and over and over and over again. And you know what? I believe that's a misdirection of what God has called the church to do. We need to mature the saints. The result of that kind of mentality is that the saints never move to maturity. We never equip the saints with that kind of mentality. The result of that is you end up with a whole bunch of people who believe their carnality is spirituality. You end up with a whole bunch of people who are shallow and superficial believers and they don't even know they are because they've never been taught the deep things of God. We have been called of God to equip the saints, to mature the saints, to edify, to make capable the saints. The question is, how do we do that? How do we do that? Let's go to the text. Two basic dimensions this morning that I want to share with you from this text. The first dimension we're going to call the progress to perfection. And by the way, this is kind of involved this morning, so I gave you some things to follow in the bulletin. There's an insert in there, I believe, and you can follow along with that if you'd like. The first thing I want you to be aware of is the progress to perfection. Again, when we talk about perfection, we are talking about maturity. We are talking about being grown up in the Lord. We are talking about being fully equipped. What is this process? First of all, it involves three things. He gave gifted men to the church to equip the saints. Two, those saints who have been equipped do the work of the ministry. And three, the result of that is that the body will be built up. Okay, one, the men of God preach the word of God and that builds up the saints. Two, the saints do the work of the ministry. And three, the body is built up. Let's look at every one of those singly. The first thing we're looking at is the gifted men equipped the saints. Verse 11. He gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastor-teachers. Same thing. Pastor-teacher is really synonymous there. It's the same thing. Apostles, those men of God who were used in a very special and powerful way at the beginning of the church to lay the foundation for the church. They were the ones who went into places where Christ was not named and they named Christ and their function at that time was to establish churches, to disciple believers, to get elders in their churches and then move on to another work. Prophets, the same kind of thing. They would come often behind the apostles and preach the apostles' doctrine. The apostles were the ones who laid out the doctrine. They had a revelatory ministry. God revealed to them specifically the doctrine. Prophets came in. They were the preachers. They came in and they built the churches. They continued to come behind and teach. Evangelists. I hope you don't think that some of us do believe that evangelists are simply people who have 15 sermons and 15 suits, you know? They blow into town and they give you five dynamite sermons and they blow out again. An evangelist, scripturally, was something very, if you want to get a hook to put it on in your mind, it was very much like an apostle who would go into a place where Christ was not named, preach the word of God, and establish a church. They didn't blow in and out of town. They didn't just come in, do two or three things, and leave. They were church planters. One parallel I could draw very simply would be to our missionaries as we're anticipating our missionary conference. That is a gift. That is a special kind of working of God through gifted men to build this church, pastor teachers, those who are coming behind and teaching the word. The function of all four of those people is to what? To build the saints, to mature the saints. The question we have as we look at those four kinds of people, apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastor teachers with the function that they have, and that is to equip the saints, to mature the saints, perfect them. How do they do that? What are the tools that they need to use to bring the saints to maturity? I would point you to 2 Timothy 3.16. It says this, All Scripture. There's your tool. There's a clue right there. You want to mature the saints? Use all Scripture. All Scripture is God-breathed. And it's profitable. For what? for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness. Why? What's the result? That the man of God may be what? Perfect, complete, lacking nothing. Perfect, thoroughly furnished for every good work. There's only four things in the New Testament that are mentioned in the New Testament that the Holy Spirit uses to bring the saints to maturity. Four things. One of them is trials in James 1. Count it all joy, brethren, when you meet various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result that you may be what? Perfect, mature, complete, lacking, nothing. Trials is one of the things that brings us as believers to maturity. Another thing is suffering, 1 Peter 5. Suffering brings us into position of submission to the Lord and brings us into maturity. Another thing is prayer, Colossians 4.12. And another thing is what I've already mentioned, the Word of God. those first two things in dealing with God's people and bringing them to maturity is God's business I am not here to bring you trials I am not here to bring you suffering that's God's department and he's going to bring things into your life and into my life that are just his work in you to bring it to maturity the other two are our responsibility to be praying and to be teaching the word of God in death that's why Paul said in Acts 6 as one who was chosen of God to edify, to build, to equip the saints. He said this, if that's my job, I am going to give myself to two things fully. To prayer and to what? To the ministry of the Word. I'm going to give myself to that and I'm going to get some other people to do some other things so that I can do what God has called me to do. Colossians 1.28, Paul's view of the ministry again was very, very simple. Surely we preach Christ. What do we do? We warn every man we meet. We teach every man we meet. Why? That we may present every man we meet complete, mature. That was his function, to bring them to maturity. Again, there is no virtue in evangelizing the saints over and over and over again. There is no virtue in the men of God, teachers in our church. There is no virtue in them spending all their time organizing new plans, sitting in our offices and thinking of new programs or reorganizing the ones you have. You know, every once in a while, I get an impulse to do this, and somebody even comes up to me and says, Boy, Dave, you know, we just need a renovation. You know, just to get some new blood in here, we just need to reorganize the whole program, top to bottom. You know why that wouldn't work? Because we'd still have the same problem if we had problems with this. We'd still have the same problem, and it would be this. We'd still have the same 10, 15, 20 people who are committed to service and committed to the Lord. We'd still have them doing all the work, right? Only they'd be doing it in a different structure. We don't need reorganization. What we need is maturing. What we need is growing up. What we need is seeing our ministry. The saints need to be edified. Paul said it to Timothy. When he was a young pastor, he said, Timothy, your job is clear. Perfect the saints. How? 1 Timothy 4.6 says, Constantly nourish them on words of faith. Constantly nourish them on sound doctrine. Verse 11, he gets real feisty here and says, Command them and teach them the word. Verse 12, he says, Don't let them hassle you on your age. You may be afraid, but do it anyway. Verse 13 says, Till I come, In fact, I want you to turn to this. 1 Timothy 4. This is very important. 1 Timothy 4, verse 13. Till I come, give attention to public reading of the scripture, to exhortation, and to teaching. It simply means this. give attention here's your job Timothy you take the word and you read it and when you read it then you explain it and after you explain it then apply it you know what that is it's just expository preaching it's taking the word of God and reading it and explaining it and then applying it that's your job verses 14 through 16 I like this do not let do not neglect excuse me the spiritual gift within you which was bestowed upon you through prophetic utterance with the laying out of hands by the presbytery take pains with these things. Be absorbed in these things so that your progress may become evident to all. Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching. Persevere in these things. For as you do this, you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you. You know what that is? That's a job description for a pastor, teacher. That's a job description. You know, you better not be looking for a pastor for, oh, I say, about 40 years. That good? About that? you better not even be thinking about it. But you know what? When you do, there's your job description right there. There's your job description. Someone who will absorb themselves, pay close attention to, teaching the Word. In the swan song of Paul's life, as he was passing on the mantle, as it were, to Timothy, again he said it, 2 Timothy 4, 2 and 3, Timothy, here's what you do. You preach the Word. You preach the Word. You be ready in season and out of season and what that means is simply, Timothy, when it's easy, you preach the Word. And when it's hard, you preach the Word. And when it's convenient, you preach the Word. And when it isn't convenient, you preach the Word. And when people like it and pat you on the back, you preach the Word. And when people don't like it and they're getting angry at you, you preach the Word, in season and out of season. And what do you say? You reprove, you rebuke, you exhort. And how do you do that? With great patience and all instruction. For the day will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but wanting their ears to be tickled will accumulate for themselves entertainers, teachers in accordance to their own desires. But you, be sober, preach the Word. Be ready in season and out. Okay, if that's happening, okay, you got this picture in your mind? If the men of God are teaching the Word of God, the saints are going to be matured. And if the saints are going to be matured, if they're going to be perfected and built up, a second marvelous thing is going to happen. It's this. The saints are going to do the work of the ministry. Turn back to Ephesians 4. I want you to follow this. The men of God preach the word of God. The saints are matured. And the result of that is the saints will do the work of the ministry. The work of the ministry. That's the pastor's job, right? That's the pastor's job. In fact, that's why we call you minister, right? Because it's the ministry and it's your ministry. It's your job. It's what we pay you for. The pastor is the organizer of the whole thing. He runs the whole thing. He calls all the shots. He is on all the committees. He does all the visiting, and he does everything in the whole church. He makes it run. And what we do is we come and watch, and we see how he does, and if he does real well, we pay his funeral expenses. Okay? I've got this thing, and I really wanted to bring it up here this morning, and I forgot it, and I'm really angry at myself. It was somebody in church who gave me this little magazine clip of the perfect pastor. You know, it said on the side, On the top, you know, your church needs this pastor. And there's a guy sitting there like this in a suit and real nice and glasses and all these things. He had a mop and a Bible and tennis shoes. I don't know what else. And all these little distinctions all the way around. And he was the perfect pastor. And a wife, you know, if you want him special, a wife comes, a matching wife comes with it. And he's able to leap tall buildings in a single bond and da-da-da-da-da. You know, all these wonderful things. And as I looked at that, I thought, you know, I don't warn our people that if I ever get like that little thing in there, that you ought to take me behind the barn and put me out of my misery because we go crazy. The function, biblically, of the teaching people, the people who have been called of God to do that, is to do what? To build, to equip, to edify, to perfect the saints. How? Through the Word of God. And then what's going to happen? The saints will become mature and they're going to do the work of ministry. I believe that's God's design for a healthy church. But more. It doesn't just mean that I'm kind of dumping all this on you. See, the principle is real clear. When people become mature, when people become equipped, when people become built up and perfected, it isn't so we can just kind of sit here and go, well, I'm mature. Well, I'll tell you, we've been learning, And I'm perfected now, and I really feel equipped, ready to go. And you sit there, and you feel good about how mature you've become, and how strong you are, and how adequate you are, and you haven't caught the point if that's where you're at. Because the whole purpose of evangelists and pastors and prophets and teachers and apostles and the whole thing, the whole point of their building the body, building the saints, is so that they will be equipped to minister, to act, to do what God has called you to do. And out of that flows our evangelism and our discipleship and everything else that is the pulse beat of our church. It isn't so we can just sit here and feel good about how mature we are. It's so we can move out and act. The third result. As the men of God teach the Word of God and the saints are built, the saints do the work of the ministry. And you know the result of those two things? The body is built. The end of verse 12. to the building up of the body of Christ. Those two things happen and the body is going to be built. It's going to be built on the inside. You're going to be built as a believer. Your faith is going to grow deeper. Your trust is going to grow deeper. You're going to understand more about the Word of God and more about God Himself and how you relate to Him. And you're going to grow, so the body will be built. We'll be stronger as a people. We'll be more sensitive to each other's needs. But more than that, it is going to grow numerically. You know why? Because as I'm matured and equipped, I begin to serve and I begin to share my faith. and it does have a very strong evangelistic thrust. We do not come here to hear evangelistic sermons every Sunday. We come here to be equipped so we can go out and share in our factory, in our work, in our school, who Jesus is because I know him. And I'm equipped now to share him. The body is built. The process of perfection. The men of God teach the word of God and the saints are matured. The saints are matured and they do the work of ministry. When the work of ministry is being done, the body is built. That's the process. The second thing and final, but don't get excited because, you know, I laugh about my sermons. I don't always have three points. See, I have one point and they have four points. My first point has three points. My second point has five. So hang on. Okay, but we're almost done because we're on the second point now. The second is the purpose or the result of this maturing, the result of this perfection. Okay, we've seen the process. Now we're going to see what happens to the church, what happens to the individuals when they begin to go through this process. five results the first thing is in verse 13 verse 8 we all attain to the unity of the faith the first result in people being mature is unity it's going to be a natural result it's what we talked about in verse 4 I entreat you to walk a worthy walk to be mature to be equipped how do you do that? with all humility and gentleness we went on and on unity will be the result of maturity it always results maturity always results in unity when we are mature we have a view for the ministry. We see the things that are important and the things that are petty get set aside. When we are immature and we are carly minded, one of the things that just boggles our minds in terms of church fights is how petty we can be. We'll argue about the color of the piano. If a window gets broken, we go bonkers. If some sort of group isn't just working out, if Ann Matilda doesn't say hi to me, and if I can look that cross, I'm just leaving this. Every two weeks they're leaving. I believe that carnality and infantility are the greatest contributors in the church of Christ to discord carnality and infantility are the greatest contributors in the church to discord and strife 1 Corinthians 3 Paul is speaking to Christians there and he points out the fact that their lifestyles are marred with jealousy and strife jealousy and strife and that discord, he says, is simply a manifestation. The fact that you're jealous and there's strife and you can't get along is just simply a manifestation to me just like the fruits of the Spirit, love, joy, peace are a manifestation of Spirit's control. Your jealousy and strife and discord is just a manifestation that you're babies, that you're infantile, that you're carnal. Hebrews 5 says, You are dull of hearing. Jim read it. you're dull of hearing by now you ought to be teachers but you're still babes in 1 Corinthians 3 he said the same thing I speak to you as men of flesh I speak to you as if you didn't even know the Lord because you're still babes in Christ the first result of maturity the building up of the body is going to be unity unity the second result is going to be simply this and I love this until we all attain to the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God the second result of this maturing process is a knowledge of the Son of God. It's very important that I point this out that this knowledge I'm talking about is not a salvific knowledge. It's not, I know Jesus Christ as my personal Savior. It's not that kind of knowledge. It's something deeper. It's something far more intimate. I want you to catch the heart of this. When Paul said in Philippians 3.10, he said, my ambition in life, my ambition in life is that I might know Him. That I might know Him and the power of His resurrection. and the fellowship of his sufferings, that I might know him. And we might think in our minds, well, Paul, for crying out loud, if there's anybody in the world who knew Christ, it was Paul, right? Anybody in the world knew him, yeah, it had to be Paul. You met him on the road to Damascus. He appeared to you twice. You walked with him all your life. Man, you've already got to know Christ. It's fine. And Paul says, my ambition, my driving ambition in life is that I might know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering. I want to know him intimately. it's intimate. It's talking of a deep knowing. It's the same kind of intimacy on a physical level where the Bible says, and Cain knew his wife and she bore a son. Intimacy, knowing one another. The intimate knowing of which God said, among all the nations of the world, Israel only, have I known. An intimate knowledge, knowing. Listen, this is awfully important. When the men of God, teach the word of God, the saints are built up. And when the saints are built up, they're going to do the work of the ministry. And when the work of the ministry is being done, the body will be built. And when the body is being built and we have mature people, there's going to be a marvelous unity. But not only that, there's going to be an intimate knowledge of God. You see, we're not talking about birdbath Christianity anymore, are we? And this is just exactly why we cannot handle little sermonettes for Christianettes. We can't come to here on Sunday mornings and hear little cute stories and little funny things. We are here to do the things God called us to do. We are to grow up and all into the very image of Christ. And we need to know him deeper. We need to know him more. It needs to be more intimate than it is right now. The result of maturity is that we're going to grow into that kind of intimacy. And carnal baby kinds of people never really even catch the glory of that. And if the men of God aren't teaching the word of God, we'll never even see the need for it. the third result is this the same verse we move to a measure to a mature man we move to a mature man to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of christ we come to a mature man to the measure of the stature which belongs to christ you know this verse is the whole point of ephesians we've been with this we've been in ephesians for about nine months now and it's all culminated right here. This is the point. This is the climax, almost, of everything we've been talking about. The whole point of Ephesians, we're body two. Remember, Jesus Christ came 2,000 years ago, body one. The church of Jesus Christ, body two. We are called to be Christ in the world. We're the only Christ that the world is ever going to see. And how do we get that point? How do we get to that point? I've already been telling you all morning. Simply this, when the men of God preach the word of God, the saints will be built. When the saints are built, the work of the ministry will take place when that takes place there will be unity there will be knowledge of the son of god and we will move to the measure of the stature of christ we're talking about being like christ christ likeness and then the world that is lost will be able to look at the church and see christ is that your desire i know it's mine it is my desire when i think of the church of the open door and all the vision that God has given me for us it's it it blows my mind when I think of what God is already beginning to do among us but my deepest desire is that when people in the world can begin to catch wind of what God is doing here that they will come and they will hear the word and they will see the ministry and they will see the people who are moving into the measure of the stature of Christ and when they leave they will feel like they have seen Christ and they will want to be part of that and they'll accept the Lord and the evangelistic for us you know I've I feel like that's one of the next major things that we need to move into I'm going to get to that in just a few minutes the sequence is going we hear the word we see the maturity they experience the ministry they see the glory and we meet with Christ when we're moving into maturity the fourth is this there's no more doctrinal ignorance I love this as a result we are no longer like children to be like children tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men by the craftiness and deceitful scheming no more doctrinal ignorance when we're hearing the word we are no longer to be children verse 14 you know what really bothers me and i don't want to hurt anybody's feelings but i really get the feeling sometimes that believers are among the most gullible people there are on the face of the earth we see more Christians buying into more junk in the form of shallow and superficial Christianity from con men and slick hucksters than from any other group in the whole world it just boggles my mind how gullible we sometimes are just buying into anything you see it almost Paul calls them the the corruptors of the word and they even come into our churches and their message is kind of right but it's off and we don't even know it but if they wear a three-piece suit and they have a bible and they sing amazing grace and they look sincere they talk about the holy spirit and they have a good delivery he must be okay this happened to me in my former church i remember there was a there was a guy who came and spoke and he was just that he you know he had all those characteristics and he had a good delivery it was easy to listen to in fact he had a lot of humor but his theology was almost 180 degrees in very crucial areas to where we were at to where we were at and we listened and we listened and i listened i was getting upset and upset. And all of a sudden, as he closed up and he left, I began to get feedback from all the people. Oh, isn't that wonderful? Wasn't that great? Maybe that's a reflection on my teaching that they didn't discern. You know what? It isn't okay to be shallow. It isn't okay to be superficial and gullible. But you know where you find shallow and superficial Christians? You find them in churches where the men of God have not warned and rebuked and admonished and exhorted night and day with tears. I think our responsibility is clear. The fifth result and final, this is it, verse 15. The result of all these things coming down is finally this, we speak the truth in love. We speak the truth in love. First and foremost, this is speaking of evangelization. Evangelism. the word child there in the 14th verse is the word nepios and one of the dimensions of its meaning is one who does not speak one who does not speak and when you're a child and when you're immature and when you haven't grown at all you do not speak there's nothing to say but when you move to maturity you begin to speak you begin to speak the truth and love and again i just shared a few minutes ago i believe that that and i just want to share my heart with you i feel as a church we need to begin to pray towards this end that there be a movement in our church as we move as individuals to maturity that as individuals we begin begin to speak the truth in love to our schools and in our factories and in our businesses and then the people we meet with and call with to speak the truth in love but there is more to this speaking the truth in love than just evangelism opening my mouth and sharing my faith. There's something even deeper than that. Again, the result of maturity is that I'm no longer a child. You know what that means? It means I'm no longer naive. I'm no longer simple-minded. You see, now I know. Now I know. You see, when I was a child, superficiality didn't bother me because I didn't know it. When I was a child, shallowness didn't bother me because I didn't know it. Nobody told me. When I was a child, darkness didn't bother me because I never saw light. Falseness didn't bother me because I never saw the truth. Carnality didn't even bother me because I never saw depth. But you know what? When I see depth, carnality bothers me. When I see real spirituality, infantility bothers me. When I see light, darkness bothers me. As a child, it was no big deal. I didn't even see the problem. But now as one who is equipped, one who is mature, one who is discerning, who is no longer naive, now I see you see now I see that spirituality isn't determined on the basis of how long you've been a Christian that guy that gal that woman who's been a Christian for 40 years I just kind of assume but then I begin to see what real spirituality is and I don't see that anymore and just because you're on the board all of a sudden I just go that's automatic no it isn't see when I'm a child I think it is when I'm immature and when I'm undiscerning I just kind of assume but I don't know because I don't even know what the word says but see that poses the problem you know what it is when I'm no longer a child when I was a child I didn't speak but now I am a child now I am not a child and so I begin to speak and I see the distinctions and I make the discernments and now that I see it I gotta say it now that I see it I gotta say it when i see shallowness i got to call it when i see carnality i got to call it when i see sin we got to call it it's called speaking the truth in love you know traditionally in evangelical churches the way we handle problems of shallowness of carnality of poor leadership of sin traditionally the way we handle it is by ignoring it slipping it under the carpet waiting till it goes away usually it kind of does settle but I guarantee it doesn't go away it's so much easier that way though because no one gets upset and no one gets angry and no one gets disturbed the problem is that no one is challenged and no one has changed and no one grows and the body of Christ walks with a very severe limp and that bothers me you know what the church that's committed to the biblical mandate I don't think is an easy place to be i don't think the church that is committed to this biblical mandate of speaking the truth and love is an easy place to be because in a place where we speak the truth and love the word of god is going to constantly be confronting us with the truth it's going to constantly be confronting us with our own shallowness and with our own superficiality and our own carnality and we're always going to be agitated to think and we're always going to be agitated to grow but it's so much easier to sweep our carnality under the rug but what a glory it is when the men of God preach the word of God because then the saints are built because then the saints are perfected and when the saints are perfected and moved to maturity then they do the ministry and then the ministry is moving and the church is growing and the body is built when the body is built there is a marvelous unity and not only is there unity we as a body begin to know Christ to really know Christ and more than just knowing him we become like him to the measure of the fullness of the stature of Christ and the result we're no longer children we're no longer children we're no longer as those who do not speak we begin to speak the truth and love and a world that is lost can look at the church and see christ what a glory what a commission what a responsibility so what are we going to do where do we go from here i'll tell you what we're going to do we're going to preach the word we're going to preach the word all the time you know what we're going to do it when it's convenient and we're going to do it when it isn't and we're going to do it when it's easy and we're going to do it when it's hard. And we're going to do it when people like it and we're going to do it when people don't. And what are we going to say? We're going to reprove and rebuke and exhort. How? Of all patience and instruction. And then, you know what we're going to do after we do all that? We're going to take that whole ball of wax that is simply us being obedient to God. We're going to take that whole ball of wax and give it to Christ verse 15 who is the head we're going to give it to Christ who is the head from whom the whole body being fitted and held together by that which every joint supplies according to the proper working of each individual part he causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love I feel real I feel real small next to this and I feel like my words are real insignificant compared to the bigness and the power of the text we just dealt with. And I just need to pray right now, and let's do that. Lord Jesus, I believe that this was crucial. And I pray that as we leave, that the truth of this as being the foundation and the format and the direction and the destiny for the church of the open door would be blazoned on our hearts, that we would move to maturity, that we would build the body, that we would speak the truth in love. Father, even as we go, continue to take the seed that has been planted and bring it to fruit. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
