For exceedingly abundant, beyond everything I could ask or think, I pray that this word would go forth. Amen. It was three weeks ago at the Northrop Auditorium that I invited you into the waiting room of Acts 1, verse 4. For that is where we see ourselves these days as a church, as we anticipate not only our physical move to Maple Grove not many days from now, but also as we anticipate the things that God seems to be preparing us for and calling us to. Things that, if they're true, if what we're discerning and sensing is true, will surely be marked by and will surely be requiring power. Supernatural, Holy Spirit power. Acts chapter 1, verse 8, the promise was given that you shall receive the power that you need to do the things I've called you to do when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. But before the Spirit's going to come upon you, and before you enter into this power, I want you to wait, said Jesus to the disciples in Acts 1, verse 4. Don't leave Jerusalem. Don't blow the trumpet. Don't take out an ad in the paper advertising your special meetings. Just wait. And so they did. And while we don't know specifically what they did while they did wait, We do know from the text that they were all together in one place, devoting themselves to prayer, Acts 1.14. It was a time, I'm sure, of preparation and consecration, much like the season we have been in as a church for over a year, where they spoke of many things pertaining to the kingdom of God and the person and the work of the Holy Spirit, basic things, foundational things, upon which their anticipated experience with the Holy Spirit and with this power thing would need to be built, which is precisely why these last few weeks we have been doing and trying to enter into the very same thing. And it's also why this week I want to use our time in what we've been calling this waiting room season to bring up a concern by way of warning. Now, that word warning might send a chill through you. I want to temper it with this. This is not a corrective, and I'm glad correctives are harder, but it is a warning. Plainey stated it's this, that the procuring of experiences with and the seeking hard after the power of God is embodied in things like signs and wonders, healing, deliverance, the gifts of the Spirit, all wonderful things that need by God's people to be pursued, but to pursue those things, and here's the warning, without a corresponding passion and pursuit of formation in the character of Christ, is a recipe for spiritual disaster that results in confusion among God's people at best, cynicism and unbelief at worst. Let me state the warning this way, that the gifts of the Spirit without the fruit of the Spirit can ultimately undermine, even destroy, the work of the Spirit. If you lived in Minneapolis 20, 25 years ago and were old enough to be aware of what God was doing in this city at that time, you would have been very familiar with a church that met in the downtown area, purchased, owned, and ministered out of the historic state theater. the name of the church was the Jesus People Church. It was a church founded by and led by a group of unusually and wonderfully gifted young men and women. Their gifting, their anointing was particularly evident in areas of evangelism. Hundreds, even thousands of people were saved as a result of that amazing ministry. They were gifted in anointing in areas of teaching. They had amazing creativity like people in this area had never seen. We thought they were all from California. they were without a doubt anointed by God empowered by the spirit that church was a legitimate and powerful manifestation of God's spirit in this city till one day some things got disclosed they thought they could hide they thought they could ignore I'm not sure why they thought they could hide it or ignore it maybe it was because the anointing was so strong sometimes when you're unusually anointed you get that sense maybe they thought they could hide it because the power was so real the results were so great develop character? well that would slow us down seriously enter into the process of inner transformation as priority one not only for us as individuals but to call the entire church into that kind of inward journey we need to win the world but here's the deal beloved it was precisely for the lack of inner transformation in the character of Christ particularly in areas related to three things guess what they were money, sex, and power that one of the most significant manifestations of God's spirit in this city in the last 30 years no longer exists great sermons wonderful worship, authentic anointing, real power, no character, incredible damage, resulting in confusion and sadness among many believers, disillusionment, cynicism, and unbelief among others. A few weeks ago, Bonnie and I were listening to some friends describe some trouble they were having with a client they had in the context of their business. But this client was also a friend of theirs. They cared about this woman and wanted to help her but didn't know how, and so they told the story. She's a high roller here in Minneapolis, living a lavish lifestyle, houses and boats and cars, into the millions of dollars. But the downside is this. She's got a string of unpaid bills, Staggering debt also into the millions of dollars, numbers that you can't even relate to, and shady business dealings for years and years that have exploited even friends of hers as she's invited them into her exploits to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars. And no one seems to be able to hold her accountable. And oh, by the way, she's a Christian. She is? Oh, yeah, spirit-filled. long pause, while I risked the instinct to gag, as you can imagine, that spirit-filled, oh yeah, spirit-filled thing, set us off into a very long and spirited discussion of what on earth does it mean to be a spirit-filled Christian anyway? See, I think it means some precious things. I think it means some powerful things. but if you've been around the church for any length of time at all it means a lot of different things to different people and in fact that's a little phrase people are you spirit filled i think you're spirit filled i think are you a spirit filled we have calls to our church are you spirit what kind of church are you a spirit filled church am i saying this too fast yeah i am slow down so what does that mean well again it means a lot of different things a lot of different people turns out that what it meant to this woman who had no compulsion about dishonest financial gain and ripping off her very best friends, that what it meant to her was that she went to some Holy Ghost conference, fell down under the power, came up under the laughter, and spoke in tongues, all of which might have been real, all of which might have been a wonderful gift from God to woo this woman to himself, but it never touched her life, it never formed her heart, it It never changed her character. And let me tell you something else it never did. It never did her any good, not a lick of good. Early in my ministry life, I recall my father telling me many things. Among them, I remember him telling me of a well-known pastor whose name he wouldn't disclose who had an incredible anointing for preaching in the Chicagoland area. His church was huge. Hundreds of people every year under his ministry and preaching were saved, but his disposition was so sour that they had to hide him from the people of his church because he'd hurt them. He had the gifting. He had the power. He just didn't have the life. He wasn't being changed. Let me ask you a question. Are stories like this confusing to you? I mean, you hear things like this, and I bet you could add your stories to mine, couldn't you? You just kind of scratch your head and go, what is that about? Is it for some of you way past confusing? Do they make you cynical? Do they even stir up unbelief? Like, this whole thing's a crock. Well, that's what power without character does. That's why it's so important to talk about it in this waiting room that we're in. I want you to open your Bibles to the book of Judges, where this morning we're going to hear the story of a man who had an amazing anointing. The Spirit of the Lord, the breath of God, was on him for power. This thing we all want, power. But he lost it all for lack of character, for lack of virtue, for lack of substance and depth. His name was Samson. His story begins in the 13th chapter of Judges, verse 1. Sets the context. Now the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord, so that the Lord gave them into the hands of the Philistines 40 years. Stop right there. What we've got here is a full circle dynamic going on. They were delivered out of Egypt. They wandered into the wilderness. They went into the promised land after they crossed the Jordan. But they're now back in bondage again, have been for 40 years. So what are they looking for? Another Moses. They need another deliverer, a man or a woman that God can use to set the people free. God has a plan. Starts to unfold in verse 2. There was a certain man of Zorah of the family of the Danites whose name was Manoah, and his wife was barren and had born no children. So the angel of the Lord appeared to this woman and said to her, Behold, now you are barren and have born no children, but that's going to change. You're going to conceive and give birth to a son. It's very much like Abraham and Sarah who gave birth to Isaac. Supernatural stuff going on here. but be careful verse 4 not to drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing for behold you shall conceive and give birth to a son and no razor shall come upon his head for the boy shall be a nazirite to god from the womb and he shall begin to deliver israel from the hands of the philistines he will be a kind of moses as it were just a few things we need to know to understand some of the story and things that will come later in our story it says in the middle of verse 5 that he would be a Nazirite, which means he would take a Nazirite vow. There's three things you need to know about the Nazirite vow. Number one, it means you touch no dead body. Number two, drink no wine. Number three, never cut your hair. Those three things, and this is important, were designed not to be the essence of his power or life. They were to be the symbols of his authentic devotion. They were symbols of something else that was real, devotion to God. And when someone took the Nazirite vow authentically, that's what they were. They were not the source. It was a symbol of what was really going on inside. Book of Numbers is what gives us some more information about these vows. And part of what Numbers reveals to us is that there was nothing moral or immoral about these three things in and of themselves, whether you cut your hair or didn't. Didn't really matter in the big picture of things, but they were symbols, once again. Sometimes people took them on the basis of a temporary vow, often taken to express a singular, intensive devotion to God for a season, and then the vow would be revoked and they would kind of go back to normal. Sometimes people would enter into these vows, this Nazarite kind of thing, when they were involved in a particular task that they felt or knew that God had called them to, and it required specific, very intentional spiritual focus for a season of time, and for that season they would enter into this kind of restriction of themselves to maintain kind of a focus spiritually. But for Samson, this was to be a way of life. Verse 24. Then the woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson. And the child grew up, and hear these words, and the Lord blessed him. Verse 25. And the Spirit of the Lord, the breath of God, began to stir him in Mahanadan. Mahanadan, I'm pretty sure, is a summer Bible camp in northern Minnesota. And I want you to get that picture. This is as a young man. This is the Spirit of the Lord just stirring him as a young man and him coming to God in some context, Mahanadan, whatever that is, and saying, you know what, I don't know what gifts you give me, but I want to use them in your service. The point of all this, the picture I want you to get is this, that Samson came from a place of great privilege. He had enormous potential. He had godly parents who prayed for him before he was born. God had invested in him amazing gifts. Some of them he didn't even understand. Amazing gifts such that over and over the scriptures of him would say that the spirit of the Lord had come upon him mightily. The breath of God was all over this guy. To perform acts of great strength. Not so he would become famous. He might become famous, but it wasn't so he would become famous. It would be because by his strength, the enemies of God would be defeated and the people of God would be set free. Great exploits. He put whole armies to flight. One time he killed 1,000 Philistines with the jawbone of an ass. That's supernatural strength. Now, I picture Samson physically to be a very strong guy. I mean, he was a Shaquille O'Neal type of guy. Huge, strong, muscular, could take several people. I'm quite sure, by himself. Five, maybe ten, on a good day by himself with no supernatural strength, this guy could maybe take ten guys. We're talking thousand people that he defeated. There wouldn't be anybody who wondered that there was something else going on in his strength and his physical strength. This guy obviously had an empowerment from God that took his physical strength and did exceeding abundantly beyond everything he could ask or think. but Samson had a problem it was a very very serious problem it's this his interior life his character had not developed at all in a way that corresponded to his eternal gift his external gifting his external strength he had incredible power it was real he had an amazing anointing from God for real but he did not have the internal character the internal strength for him to carry the external anointing. I think there's a principle in there. I think it's important to know. There are anointings and empowerments from the Spirit of God that come, but if you're going to carry that thing for long, there needs to be a corresponding inner strength to carry it. I even think I know why he didn't have the internal strength to carry this external gifting. It's because he didn't want it. He didn't care about the inner stuff. Character? Why would I spend all that time, like, humble yourself and all that groveling stuff and all the time? You know, waiting room, waiting room? I got the gift. I can put this into play any time I want. The enemy runs for their life every time I speak. The arena is full. Character? I don't got time. He didn't have character because he didn't want it. He didn't care about it. You know, when I was in high school, I took two years of Spanish. I didn't learn any Spanish. I passed. I don't know. I have a clue how I passed. I passed, but I didn't learn anything. I remember three words from Spanish. Burrito, enchilada, chimichanga. That's it. You know why I didn't learn Spanish? I didnít want to. I didnít care or rip about Spanish. I still donít. Maybe I should. I donít. I'm not going to learn Spanish. You know why I didnít have character? He didnít want it. You know how many times I remember ending sermons here. So what do you want? You know what? You can get what you want. You didnít have character because he didnít care about it. You didnít want it. You didnít think you needed it. I got a gift. I have a theory, I think I'm right. The people like Samson who have unusual anointings, physical capacities that God can use, and I'm kind of using this in a spiritual context, so I'll just stick with anointings. Unusual anointings and empowerments from God can sometimes be the spiritual equivalent of rich people. Jesus said in his Gospels, in the Gospels several times, of rich people, it's hard, not impossible, But it's hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. Sounds like a mean thing to say about rich people. Why? A lot of rich people who know about this would probably tell you because there's a tremendous tendency in people who have physical resources to put their trust in that. When they get a little bored, they don't have to deal with what that feels like and what that's about. They can just buy another one. They can buy another color. I don't like that color. I get bored. Why are you spending your money on things that don't matter? Because I can. And true kingdom perspectives are hard for people like that. They can do it. But you see people who do it, and you will see a tremendous amount of internal character. People with unusual anointings, empowerments from God to do incredible things for God, develop character? Some of them do. Some of them do. But there's another thing. When you got this unusual anointing, why would I bother developing character? Why would I spend my time doing the inner journey? The stadium's full. The church is packed. I'm on TV. The kingdom is advancing. The enemy is fleeing. I don't need to look inside. Humble myself under the mighty hand of God. What for? I mean, from everything we can see, we don't need to do that. Let me tell you something about the danger of people of privilege, whether it be physically privileged or spiritually privileged, the danger for people of privilege is that they aren't hungry, desperate for God. Because they can just whip it off and no one will know that they're doing that without God. His lack of character becomes evident very early in his life and could have been corrected and needed to be corrected early, but it was in chapter 14, verse 1. Then Samson went down to Timna and saw a woman in Timna, one of the daughters of the Philistines. So he came back and told his father and mother, I saw a woman in Timna, one of the daughters of the Philistines. Now therefore, get her for me as a wife. Stop right there. How well did he know her? He wants her for a wife. How well did he know her? Right here. What is the basis of his desire? It says he saw her. Okay, that's it, verse 3. Then his father and his mother said to him, Samson, we've got some concerns here. Is there no woman among the daughters of your relatives or among all of our people that you could take as a wife that you instead need to go and take a wife from these uncircumcised Philistines? The uncircumcised Philistine, to call her that, was not a term of derision, but what it was saying was that she's not a person of covenant. This woman you're attracted to has no interest in God, has no desire for God. What are you going over there for? It would be like today us being troubled with our kids, getting involved with somebody who doesn't care about God. What are you doing that for? But Samson said to his father, get her for me, because she looks good to me. He doesn't say, Dad, I met this girl at a Bible study. I was captivated by her thirst for truth. You know, he doesn't say that. He's like, Dad, Dad, Mom, I met this girl while we were ministering to the poor. I was so moved by her compassion. Here's what he says. I saw a woman in Timna, and she looks good to me. And here's these really romantic words. Get her for me. Samson is a walking impulse control disorder. Which, by the way, to give this some perspective, is fairly common. in pre-adolescent and adolescent children. How many have pre-adolescent kids? How many of them have impulse control problems? I like that. God bless you. It's very irritating. But if you're a parent, and I hope parents, you need to know, it's normal, it's normal. You're not flushing these kids. I'm not giving up on these kids. It's normal to be that way when you're pre-adolescent or adolescent. What you're always praying is that they grow out of that. It's interesting, I was talking about this with Scott a couple days ago, and I don't know what the source of this, Scott Bernstein, I don't know what the source of the study was, but they've done studies on people's development in our country, in our culture. And some years ago, they said that the truth is people aren't coming out of their adolescence, their immaturity, their impulse control problems, until they're 23 years old. Well, that was before. Now it's 30. See, it's not that big a deal when an adolescent acts like an adolescent. When a 30-year-old does, you've got a problem. Samson had a real big problem. And one reason he didn't grow out of this, I told you before, it's because he didn't want to. Let me tell you another reason. He didn't have to. See, he had a gift. he had an anointing he was special and the rules are different for people like that aren't they let me just say this one time no they aren't and while you may get away with it for a while the truth is that this problem of Samson's is going to ruin his life it's going to take a while but it's going to ruin his life by the way his parents weren't much help you heard the concern they had in verse 13 or verse 3 why don't you look for a woman among people of covenant who care about the things we care about well in verse 5 they didn't protest very long because pretty soon they said they were on their way to Timna with him to get this girl to be Samson's wife see I don't think anybody ever said no to this guy and they didn't do him any favors verse 4 there's something I'm bringing verse 4 up because it just kind of irritates me when I was studying this I thought you know some of you have your Bibles and some of you won't the ones who won't even notice this so I can just skip right over it but it says here's Samson following his impulse and it's a sinful impulse and it has nothing to do with what God has for him. But it says in verse 4, but the Lord was in it. The Lord was in it. Let me clarify something about that. That does not mean the Lord was in it in the sense that we identify the Lord being in something when we say the Lord was in it. When I say the Lord was really in it, what I mean by that and what I think you mean by that is the Lord was endorsing this, was blessing this, was cooperating with us in seeing this thing go this way. It does not mean, when it says the Lord was in this, it does not mean that God was blessing or endorsing Samson's sinful choice. What it does mean is that God was going to use Samson's impulsive, simple sinful choice even though it was an impulsive, sinful choice to further the purposes of his kingdom and deliver his people. And whether we understand it or not or like it or not, God does that all the time. He uses unbelievers sometimes. He used the hardness of Pharaoh's heart to deliver the people in Israel. In Numbers 22, he spoke through Balaam's donkey. Remember that one? Hello, Samson, you're used by God. God will even use your sin. He would have rather done it a different way. You have any idea how much he wanted to bless Samson? Samson, I'm going to use you to deliver people. Submit to me. love me, seek my kingdom seek my glory you'll have more than you know what to do with spoke through Balaam's donkey to confront the priest, spoke through a donkey reminds me of one of my dad's favorite phrases, actually it wasn't his favorite phrase, he only said this to me one time, it became my favorite phrase, he said Dave in the Bible it was a miracle when an ass spoke and now it happens all the time see one thing that Samson never got and sometimes people of gifting never get is that Samson was not the point people who have privilege people who have unusual anointings are not the point God is saying to you and me, you know what, Samson, I didn't give you this gifting for you. Now, this gifting is something Samson could have wonderfully enjoyed. But I didn't give it to you primarily for you so that your name would be great. I gave you this gifting for the people. And by the way, that's the way all the spiritual gifts work. Any spiritual gift that comes through you and for you, it's for us. Now, you're going to get some wonderful sense of God's blessing. just to know he used you. It's incredible. See, Samson never learned to pray what we talk about around here a lot. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. He never had the perspective that said, God, it's your kingdom, it's your power, it's your glory, it's your name. Samson was far more interested in his name being known. By the way, if you want to forget everything I say today, and you want a spiritual discipline that will rightly order your power, just pray that prayer. It'll change your life. Pray this prayer every day. Pray it all. Your kingdom, your power, your will, your glory, not mine, not mine, not mine. And you watch your personal power come under the authority of God, and you will see power like you've never seen. I promise you. Verse 5, it continues. Then Samson went down to Timna with his father and mother and came as far as the vineyards of Timna. And behold, a young lion came roaring toward him. And the breath of God, the Spirit of the Lord, came upon him mightily so that he tore this lion as one would tear a kid, not a kid, a child, a small goat, though he had nothing in his hand. But he did not tell his father and mother what he had done. So he went down and talked to the woman. There he is. He's talking to her. That's good. Samson, what did you guys talk about? What was she like? And she looked good to Samson. She looked good. I don't know what she said. Okay, he hasn't grown much here. When he returned later to take her, he turned aside to look at the carcass of the lion, and behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the body of the lion. So he scraped the honey into his hands and went on eating it as he went. When he came to his father and mother, he gave some of the honey to them, and they ate it, but he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey out of the body of the lion. Did you notice that two times he says he didn't tell his parents? Why? Why? Vow number one, do you remember? Don't touch a dead body. He broke his first vow. Maybe without thinking. You know, you could see the line with the honey. I was just going there, I didn't think. I don't think he was the brightest bulb on the tree. I don't think he was. But while I'm trying to give him some room that maybe he did it without thinking, he knew enough about whether this was right or wrong to not tell his parents. So there was something going on that he knew. I think probably with all sorts of rationalizations he took this honey. It was a stupid vow. I never should have made it. My parents made me do it. Fine. In the middle of this, there's something very important about the direction he is going that we need to note. It's this. Spiritual formation and character development, just like spiritual decline, is always a process. You don't wake up one day with character. You don't wake up one day in ruin. it is the result of directions you have been choosing choices you have been making vows you have been breaking all along the way very often in small incremental ways and one day you do kind of wake up and realize there is a substance I have some substance I have some care it's not that hard to say no to that or you have no substance no capacity to say no to the wrong thing, yes to the right thing. So here's a question for you to ponder, and some of you maybe need to quit listening to what I'm saying and just ponder this question the rest of the time. What direction are you going? What choices are you making? What yeses and noes are you making? Because here's the good news. You can change your direction anytime you want. By the way, this would have been a real good time for Moses to change his, or Moses. You just figure out who I'm talking about. For Samson, it had been a real good time for Samson to wake up and change his direction. You could see it, couldn't you? He just broke his vow. It would have been a great thing to see Samson go back and go, oh, what have I done? And to come up broken, wondering if there would even be forgiveness for this, and scared to death to tell his parents, and then tell them, I touched the dead. And you know what he'd find? Forgiveness and grace and the building of character. it doesn't happen verse 10 his father went down to a woman and Samson made a feast there for the young men customarily did this he made a feast no big deal except for the fact that the word feast speaks not only to food but to drink strong drink and lots of it and it says he made the feast it means he wasn't invited to this drinking party he threw the party vow number two is broken which speaks to further decline but notice this and this is actually a bit frightening after his second vow is broken he still has his anointing he's still quite successful his life hasn't fallen apart leaving him and this is very important leaving him with a very dangerous and totally false impression the false impression very dangerous to have was this that what he's doing and the direction he's going doesn't really matter principle by the way i don't have an outline today i've kind of i kind of have just these little nuggets here and there and if you notice one write it down and if i think I have one, I'll let you know, but you can tell me later. I think this is a nugget. Do not confuse the patience of God with the directions you are choosing. The patience of God that, in fact, is giving you time to change your direction. That's what the patience of God is for. Do not confuse the patience of God that is giving you time to repent with what you may think is the indifference of God or even the endorsement of God as if he doesn't really care about the choices you're making, the directions you're choosing, or he's even okay with those choices and directions that it isn't even sin at all. 2 Peter 3, 9 says, The Lord is not slow, as some count slowness, but patient, not wanting any to perish. God does not enjoy dropping the hammer. God does not enjoy us having to suffer consequences. he doesn't like bringing judgment he doesn't here's the word do not confuse the patience of God with the direction you're going and the fact that you haven't had some huge consequence with the fact that God must be okay with my direction that's a very dangerous assumption now I don't have time to give you the details of the rest of Samson's decline but it culminates as almost all of you know with his illicit relationship with a woman named Delilah you know the story seducing him, which couldn't have been that difficult. She tries to draw from him the source of his strength. For a while, he makes stuff up that isn't true. She does all the stuff that he says. In fact, he says things like, okay, if you make seven fresh cords that haven't been dried and tie me up, yeah, that's the ticket, then I lose my power. It's the fist of the Philistines. If he'd be waiting outside the door, she'd tie him up with these fresh cords and they would come in to kill him and he'd break them free and slaughter them. He did that three times. And she told the Philistines three times. Till finally, in chapter 16, verse 15, she pulls out all the stops and says this. And you got to picture this with tears and weeping and probably late at night, you know, just before dinner, right after it, it's a nice little romantic. Samson, how can you say you love me? When your heart is not with me, you won't confide in me. See, what she wants is intimacy. You have deceived me three times. Oh, never mind it, three times. She had the Philistines out the door waiting to kill him. And have not told me where your strength lies. Tell me your inner thing, your inner truth. the most incredible thing is samson falls for he buys it and he caves tells her tells her what the source of strength really is cut my hair my first response to samson's yielding to this pressure she applies is is that this guy's not only weak he's stupid this guy's dumber than dirt it's like it's hard to believe. And, you know, calling him stupid, that's not very nice. You shouldn't say something stupid. Can I tell you what? He's not. He is not intellectually incapable. He is not stupid in that way. But here's the deal. And this is another huge piece. Sin makes you stupid. Scott talked about this a few weeks ago when we talked about Achan. Remember? He hid the stuff, and God said, don't touch that stuff, and he hid it. And I loved what Scott did with it. He goes, what was Achan thinking? Like, where was he going to wear this robe, you know? And everybody, anyway. You ever see anybody dominated by greed? Their life is dominated? You ever see people who are dominated by greed end up spending money they don't have? To the extent that it basically sometimes ruins their whole life. And you're looking at them, and you go, you know, I love you like crazy, but that's really, this isn't a nice word, stupid. You ever seen anybody dominated by rage and never deal with their rage, never deal with their anger? And because they're undealt with anger and they just think they can get away, they ruin their marriage. Road rage is that kind of thing. A couple weeks ago, somebody got killed in the Twin Cities because of road rage, remember that? You ever think the people who do that a day later when everything's calmed down, look at their own behavior and go, how could I have been so? stupid. It was a stupid thing. I mean, all they did was cross a yellow line. I mean, Samson, blinded by his lust that he had left unchecked from his youth. Pay attention to that. From his youth. Oh, it's no big deal. Boys will be boys. Check it then. Blinded by it from his youth, left unchecked. He concluded, oh, I can trust her. She cares about me. Though he had mountains of evidence to the contrary, he caves in. Look at verse 16. And it came about when she pressed him daily. Oh, that would be hard, wouldn't it? She's nagging him and bugging him. And tell me, please, please. And urged him with words that his soul was annoyed to death. Some of your translations, and I like this better, say he was tired to death. some of the people i read around this text say that this this tired to death thing and this nagging speaks of the power of a nagging woman oh so it's really about delilah let me tell you something about that delilah ain't no prize okay but this story is not about her this is all about samson consider this that having the strength to say no to what is wrong and yes to what is right requires energy. You feel that? You've got to get your energy up to say no or yes. In fact, to stand firm against the kind of pressure that Delilah is putting on Samson right now would require a lot of energy. In fact, you might need to be in shape. What do you mean? You might need to have been learning how to say small no's all along the way so when the need to say a big no comes along. You got the breath, the energy to do it. Samson got really tired really quick. You know why? He never, ever learned how to say no. He had no practice saying no. You know, by the way, this thing I'm talking about, it's on the front page of the newspaper these days. Corruption being revealed in the Enron scandal. in the great halls of finance. These people who are at the top of the financial picture of our country are very gifted people. But the thing that's falling apart right now did not start with big things. It started with small yeses and small noes. So when the big noes needed to be there, they couldn't do it. They were incapable of it. They were tired to death. so let me ask you a question again what direction are you going what choices are you making what small compromises are you living with let me say something very quietly but don't let the quiet voice mislead their importance if you're going the wrong direction, here's the word from the Lord. Stop. Repent. Change your mind. And change your direction. And do it today. We'll close with a couple of noticings. First noticing is a noticing I have of myself around this sermon. And it's this. I have a lot of energy about this. Yesterday when I was doing my final draft, Saturday, Friday actually, I was saying, God, how do I close this? Well, what are the noticings? And one I noticed, I mean, while I was writing this, I even found myself getting frustrated and angry at Samson. I don't know this guy. Why? Here's why. Because he came from privilege. He had so much promise. He had every advantage. But he didn't care. He didn't treasure The fact that he came from the kind of home he came from, that he had parents who bathed him in prayer. He didn't care. He didn't care that God had called him to be used in some amazing ways. All he had to do was say yes. He didn't treasure those things. He didn't develop his gift. He didn't surrender his gift to God in humility and say, I can't believe, God, that you would use me this way. You know what else? He didn't even know he had the anointing. Where did he get that? Verse 20 says that when he had shredded the last vestige of his devotion to God by cutting his hair, letting Delilah cut his hair, it says the anointing left him, and he didn't know. You know what? Samson didn't know when he had it, and he didn't know when he lost it. You know why? He didn't care. He wasn't sensitive to the presence of God in his life, to the still small voice that you hear in the quiet places. He didn't notice it because he didn't care. I'll speak very plainly here. As I close, I have real concerns, and they come from a heart of profound love for the Samsons among us. I'm kind of a potential Samson person. I come from great privilege. So do many of you. I have great concern for young men and women, among us of privilege, growing up in godly homes with godly parents who've bathed you in prayer in ways you don't even know. Maybe growing up in this church, third and fourth generation Christians, some of whom have no idea what you have. You just have no idea. you take it entirely for granted the privilege there's evidence by no passion no fire, no sacrifice you need to look around if that's kind of where you are because God is raising up a generation of young people in this age and many of them have not come from privilege and you know why? because we live in a culture that's unraveling and many of the young people growing up if the kingdom of God is going to have an effect in this country it's going to come from young men and women the next generation Keith had all this energy about this a few weeks ago and still does and I'm just saying he had energy in the pulpit about passing this on to the next generation but a lot of the next if there's another generation it's going to be people coming from abusive situations and destroyed homes but here's the deal about a lot of those kids who come into a knowledge of God they have something they have hunger They are really hungry for amazing grace. And they are discovering the pearl of great price. Jesus said the kingdom's like a field that's got a treasure in it. And when you find that treasure, you just go sell everything you've got. And there are people who are discovering out of their spiritual poverty and out of a real bad background that the amazing grace of God, this kingdom thing's the best thing going, and they're going to sacrifice everything they have to get it. To the Samson's among us, I just want to say, change your mind, change your direction, wake up. But it's not just about young people. I'm talking to young people, and I hope you hear this from this incredible place of love. But it's not just young people. We are Samson. In fact, during the worship time last night, God gave me a picture of this. I think the church in America is a Samson. Would you think about that? We are a people of unprecedented privilege. I mean, figure out a time. Read, read. Do you find anything in Scripture that talks about people who name the name of Jesus, who have more opportunity than we do, who have more ease of worship? We have people who have incredible, more access to teaching, incredible power, incredible blessing. And in the church of America right now, there is a, and we talk about this all the time, a frightening, a frightening lack of character. The divorce rate among evangelical Christians is higher than the culture right now. Keith just got back from Korea along with his wife, Sherry, and he tells me, he says, Dave, he says, it's just bizarre, the giving of these Christians. They give close to 20%, well over 10%. They don't get a tax break. What kind of kingdom orientation is that? I saw an article in the paper a while ago. People are freaking out. Churches are all ready to go to court if the churches lose their tax-exempt status. I hope we don't lose their tax-exempt status. What if we do? Could be the best thing that ever happened to us. Find out who we are. George Barnum, the latest edition of Christianity Today, kind of speaking prophetically out of his own perception of the church, said, I'm giving the church, I think the church has five years. And by the way, it's not going to exist and it'll exist. The churches will be everywhere. But in terms of actually being able to affect this culture in positive ways for the kingdom of God, if it doesn't turn in five years, it's over. And it's just going to go to Korea and Africa. By the way, where's God moving right now? Korea, Africa, amazing ways. Word of the Lord to us 10 years ago was this. You remember what it was? We were churning and burning. One of the biggest churches in town. The word of the Lord to us was grow up or die, Open Door. We pulled the plug in a building program, said we're going to wait. And I'm not saying we've arrived, but something deep inside of us was communicated about developing character. We're on the urge of moving into some of the biggest resources we've ever known. Maybe some of the greatest demonstrations of power we've ever seen. Could I just put a prayer request in your spirit that never leaves? God, keep us from a Samson spirit. There's nothing wrong with having privilege. There's nothing wrong with having resources. We're going to have great... But to put them fully into play for the purposes of the kingdom. This is not about me. It's not about... This is about his name, his glory, his... Final noticing. Samson is not a symbol of someone who lost their salvation. It's not about that. He lost his effectiveness, he lost his purpose, and he lost his destiny. That's an awful thing to lose. By the way, Paul knew that could happen. Some of you don't know that could happen. Oh, it's just grace. It'll never matter. That's not what grace means. More on that next week. 1 Corinthians 9.27, Paul says, I buffet my body, I discipline my body, and make it my slave. My body's always talking to me, saying, oh, you need more of this, you need more. No, I told my body, shut up. I'll tell you, body, what you need. I'll make you my slave. Why? Lest possibly after I have preached to others, I myself should be disqualified. Poor Paul, he was worried about losing his salvation. He wasn't worried about losing his salvation. He was worried about losing his effectiveness. You know why? Because it can happen. Samson's hair grew back. It says they gouged out his eyes. The Philistines did after he cut his hair. And he put him around this little mill where he just walked round and round and round like an ox for the rest of his life. But then his hair began to grow back. How many of you know that it really wasn't his hair? Do you remember that hair was a symbol of what? Devotion to God. See, I think what happened while he was going around in a circle, is something happened to Samson that had never happened to him in his whole life. Devotion to God began to grow. Here he was blind. He wasn't killing anybody anymore. No big victories. Nobody knew his name. Totally anonymous. Going around in circles. And I think something in his heart began to break. I think the path was full of tears. And he just said, oh, God, what have I done? What have I done? And I think devotion began to grow. And he said, God, if there's a way, if your breath could come on me one more time so I could do something for you. You know what? I think, and then you remember, he pushed the pillars and it all fell down. I think this was, by the way, the only selfless thing he ever did. You know, remember when he killed a thousand with the jawbone of an ass? You know why he did that? You know, that's marked as one of his great exploits. You know why he did it? Because he lost the bet and he was ticked. God used it, but it had nothing to do with his virtue. Samson now at the end of his life, his heart of devotion is coming to God. He says, God, I will die for you. I will die for you. Just let me vanquish your enemies and advance the kingdom of God somewhere. I'll die for you. And he killed more of the enemy. in the last act he did, than he ever did in his whole life. But it's still a tragic story, isn't it? And see, I think even heaven weeps at the Samsons as God would look at Samson and say, Samson, I'm really glad I got your heart there at the end, but how I could have used you. If it would have been my kingdom and my glory and my power, your name would have even been known. Yeah, I mean, you would have just had a whole life. You would never, This moving around the grill, this mill thing, that was never my plan for you. Here's your assignment as you go home. I want you to pray for two things. Number one, I want you to pray this week for power because that's what we're going to need to go where we're going. Number two, I want you to pray for character, the kind of character that would enable us to carry the anointing of power that God is bringing. Let's pray as we close. Just be quiet for a moment. If you're a Samson, there's something that I know about you right now, and that is that God is making you aware of some directions you need to change and some choices you need to change. And my word to you, beloved, whether you are young or old, is pay attention. Maybe it's a small thing. stop repent change your direction change your choices God has incredible things for your life humble yourself under the mighty hand of God and he will exalt you at the proper time but you may have to wait humble yourself we've got it speaking to you this morning you need to respond you need to do it now you can do it where you are we invite people to stay it's kind of what we do to stay sometimes if a need of direction is a change of direction is needed it might even help you to get up physically and come to the front and maybe someone will pray for you but you don't know this is more of a thing that you need to be with God with and say God I'm sorry and I need to change and I need to take a little step if you hear the voice of God don't harden your heart don't walk out of here today without doing business with God Father from this word bring much fruit and call the Samson's back to yourself. The Samson's that you have such great plans for, for we are a people of privilege. Give us the character to carry it well in Jesus' name. And all God's people said, amen. Amen.
