Today, as we resume what we've been referring to for the last several months, actually, as a journey of the heart, I want to return to a season in David's life. David's life is what we've been using as a sort of guide for us on this journey of the heart, a season in his life that we began to deal with a couple of weeks ago, just prior to Christmas, that I believe was among the most powerful and formational seasons in the battle for and journey of David's heart, that is, the 10 years that he spent, 10 years that he spent running from King Saul, living in caves. He lost it all, you may recall, primarily because of Saul's jealousy from 1 Samuel 19 to 1 Samuel 30. We watched a couple of weeks ago as we studied through there as he lost his power and position in the court. As a warrior of the king, he later lost his popularity with the people who had been at one time singing his praises in the street, for Saul had killed his thousands, but David, his tens of thousands. Then he lost his wife, Michael, who was the daughter of Saul with his wife. He lost his home. He lost his spiritual mentor soon after that, his spiritual mentor being Samuel, who died soon after this, and then he lost his best friend, Jonathan. He was expecting a throne. He had been promised a throne, and it looked like going to the throne was going to be a straight shot. But instead of a throne, what he got was a cave. 10 years of wandering in a cave-like wilderness experience. Today I want to talk some more about these cave-like experiences of life for a number of reasons. One, because we haven't said all there is to say about this dynamic. But for another reason, maybe even more primarily, is this. Because these issues of cave-like experiences are universal themes in Scripture, almost serving as an archetype of sorts for life in the kingdom of God, making these cave-like experiences an almost unavoidable destination on what we're calling this journey of the heart. See, David's experience in caves and wilderness stuff was not a blip on the screen of life in the kingdom of God. I want you to get it into your mind that it's fairly normative. some examples remember joseph old testament joseph had the same thing as a young boy through a series of dreams he was promised by god to be a great leader of a great nation sounds very similar to david and his expectation was the same as david's going to be a straight shot to this power and this throne first thing that happened to him however in the fulfillment of this promise to be the great leader of a great nation was that he was sold into slavery by his brothers He goes to Egypt where he rots in prison, being falsely accused by Potiphar's wife. But it was precisely in that cave-like place that felt like death. In fact, a cave is in some ways a symbol of death to life. Because it was in this cave-like place that God was preparing Joseph for the work of his life, for the fulfillment of his dreams, for something very much alive. Not dead at all, but it went through this death-like place before it came to the life-like place. Same thing with Moses. Same kind of pattern. Moses, who spent the first 40 years of his life as the rising star in Pharaoh's court. He was born to be a leader. Everyone could tell. He was marked for success until he killed that Egyptian. Then, running for his life, he spent the next 40 years of his life, 40 years of his life on the backside of a desert in Midian, alone as a shepherd, a cave-like, death-like experience, if there ever was one. But it was in that desert place, that dying place, if you will, that unbeknownst to Moses, God was preparing him for the work of his life where God would use him to be, in a sense, the redeemer of people, bringing them out of Egypt, preparing him for the work of his life, for something very much alive, not dead at all. But that living thing came through a death-like experience. Jonah learned some things when he was in the belly of the whale, and the imagery is the same, confirming that this theme is a normative thing in the belly of the whale. It's a symbol of death. But out of that whale's belly, he was spit up on the shore, And it symbolized a whole new way of life for Jonah, a whole new direction of life for Jonah. But one of the most obvious parallels in Scripture to this David's cave-like experience is found in the book of Exodus 13. In fact, I want you to open your Bibles to that if you have them with you. Exodus 13, verse 17. It's a story that's familiar to us. We've dealt with this about five or six years ago. I know we're going through the book of Exodus and touched on this at that time. This is a story where the people of God are being brought by God to some places where they did not want to go. The kind of place that David was brought and Joseph was brought and Moses was brought. Cave-like wilderness places. We pick up the action in verse 17. It says this. Now, it came about when Pharaoh had let the people go, so they're just freshly redeemed, if you will, that God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, even though it was near. It was the straight shot. That would have made more sense. For God said, lest the people change their minds when they see war and return to Egypt. Hence, God led the people around by the way of the wilderness to the Red Sea. And the sons of Israel went up in martial array from the land of Egypt. Drop down to verse 21. And the Lord was going before them in a pillar of cloud by day to lead them on the way and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light that they might travel by day and by night. He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people to affirm this eternal promise, I will never leave you nor forsake you, but I might take you around by the way of the wilderness cave on this journey of faith. Now, this Exodus 13 story actually began back in Exodus chapter 3, where God had called Moses to lead his people out of slavery into freedom. Exodus 3, verses 7 and 8 makes it sound great and relatively simple, like this redemption going into the land of promise. The land of milk and honey is a done deal, like it's going to be a straight shot. Verse 7 says this of Exodus 3, I will bring you up from Egypt, I'm going to do that, to a good and spacious land, that sounds good, to a land flowing with milk and honey. So to kind of parallel these two stories, The promise God gave to Abraham was a throne. The promise God gave to the Exodus 13 people was milk and honey. It's a good thing either way. This land I'm bringing you to is the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. A bunch of ites in there. The reason I read that is because those are specific places. And when they were spoken of to these people, they knew exactly where this place was and it wasn't far. It wouldn't take long to get to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, whatever they are. Once you left Egypt, all you had to do was cross the Sinai Peninsula and you were there. And if you went direct, which only makes sense, why would you go any other way but direct? It was less than two weeks journey. But they did not go that way because God led them, according to verse 18, around by the way of the wilderness. It was a way they did not want to go. It was a way they did not expect. It was a way that in their minds did not make sense. It wasn't a straight shot to the throne, to the milk and honey. I want you to imagine these people for a moment being among these people, if you will, in your own mind. The whole nation gathered. I kind of see them as being in a place like new Christians. Though Pharaoh has been defeated, he has not been destroyed. Symbolic kind of of Satan. Though Satan has been defeated, he's not been destroyed. So he still poses a threat. But in this journey of faith, we're okay. Even though we know Satan can attack, God is with us. He will guide us and protect us. It's a pillar of cloud by day and fire by night. All we have to do is cross the Sinai Peninsula and we'll be home free. A short trip, a straight shot to whatever it is we think God has promised us. A throne, milk and honey, whatever. it is. That's what they expected. That's what David expected, and so did Joseph, and so did Moses, and so did Mary and John and Peter and Paul, but they didn't go that way, the straight shot to the milk and honey to the throne. They didn't go that way. So what we have in Exodus 13, as they're not doing the straight shot, but they're going around by the way of the wilderness, is the first major crisis. among the people of God after their newfound freedom, their newfound redemption, if you will. And the crisis is this. It's the crisis of the cave. Will the people of God continue to follow God when there is no milk and honey, when you cannot see the throne, when what you thought was being promised by God is not being material, is not being fulfilled, when you do not understand and what's happening in your life doesn't make sense, will they still say yes to God in the cave-like experience of the desert. A little side note here. Among the most common responses that I think all of us have, and maybe I should not assume that, it's certainly one of my responses to these cave-like experiences is to wonder why and then to assume it must be me. I mean, I must have done something wrong. I must have taken a wrong turn somewhere because the promise of God was milk and honey, and I ain't tasting any of that. The promise of God was a thriller, and I'm not even seeing that. So if I'm not seeing the promise of God, if I'm not tasting it, it must be me. I must have taken a wrong turn because the promise is going to happen. It was going to be a straight shot. I must have gotten off somewhere. It must be me. I thought I was following God. I must not have been. I'm probably harboring some secret sin, so I start repenting of things that aren't that hard to find, actually. But there's got to be some secret sin that has caused me to misread what God is doing, hear what he is saying. Here's a flash for you. Sometimes the reason we're in a cave-like place is because of sin. I mean, you thought I was going to get you off the hook, didn't you? Sometimes it is because of sin. Moses spent 40 years in the desert in Midian by himself as a shepherd, and that experience had something to do with killing an Egyptian. But sometimes it has nothing to do with sin, this cave experience. So I wanted to spend another week on this and walk around this a little bit longer, because David, who started this whole cave-like thought of ours, his cave experience had nothing to do with his sin. He was in a cave experience because of Saul's sin because of Saul's paranoia. So David's cave was because of someone else's sin. And one of the things that David could have easily fallen into in this season of his life was to just play the victim and just get stuck in that. It's not my fault. I didn't do anything wrong. Anyway. Sometimes the reason we're in a cave is because of spiritual warfare. So it's the devil. Why else would we be struggling? Again, God promised milk and honey. God promised the throne. We're not seeing a throne and we're not tasting milk and honey. It's being blocked. There's demonic resistance here. I rebuke you. Okay. Here's the deal. Here's a flash for you. Sometimes it is Satan. Sometimes it isn't. Are you getting confused? Welcome to life. Life is confusing. Sometimes it's sin. Sometimes it isn't. Sometimes it's Satan. Sometimes it isn't. I don't always know. Don't you wish you always knew? Sometimes we pretend we know. We don't know. We like it when people sound like they know. I got a flash for you. They don't know. But one of the problematic realities of this story, and it's one of the reasons I'm bringing us back to Exodus 13 to just throw one more piece into the pot of our thinking, is that this time, the wilderness experience, the desert experience they're going into, is not because of Satan at all. It's not because of sin, and if those are your paradigms and they're the only ones you have, you're really kind of stuck here. It was God this time in Exodus 13 who was leading them on the roundabout way of the desert, not bringing them on the straight shot. Which, if you're paying attention to the story, and I don't just mean this story in Exodus 13. I mean to the story of the kingdom of God, the story of life, which is where we have to live it. If you're paying attention to the story and the fact that sometimes it's God who's bringing us into these dark places, it reveals something to us about his character. Very irritating to people like me. Among those characteristics that are revealed in this dynamic is this. God's just not in a hurry. and God always seems to have an agenda beyond the one I have he always seems to have an agenda beyond the one that's obvious now in the story of David the obvious agenda having been promised a throne having been anointed as the king the obvious agenda and it's not sinful it's not bad it's the throne get me to the throne I'm anointed I'm called I have the mantle give it to me that's the obvious agenda that's where I want to get to the obvious agenda for the people of God in Exodus 13 is to get to the land to get to the milk and honey you know our church has been on a journey I mean I'm sitting in this this room sometimes I drive by the church and I still have to pinch myself that this is where I go to church because this building seemed impossible for a long time and when we were in the journey that wondered about a permanent place the obvious agenda we had was what? A building. And to get to the building, I want to go this way and fast. God sent us that way and slow. How slow? If you were with us on the journey, you know. 16 years of renting. Oh, I hated that. I didn't hate it all. But here's the point. The reason for this is this, because God's agenda for his people, whether we like it or not, whether we understand it or not, whether we accept it or not, almost always has more to do with who we are becoming than where it is we're going or what it is we're accomplishing, even for God. This building, just using it as an example, and the journey around it is all about what God was doing in us. That's why these cave-like experiences are so incredibly important and why so many of God's primary people spend prolonged periods of time there. People like David and Joseph and Moses, but not just, please get this, not just primary people. In fact, I wonder if when I said God's primary people, well, that would be Joseph and these superstar types, not me. That's why, again, I'm using Exodus 13, this time. Because the Exodus 13 people were just people, just like you, just like me. So here's the deal. I've said this before. If you are a follower of Jesus Christ, a participant in the kingdom life of God, you can pretty much count on it as a guaranteed thing that somewhere along the line, you're going to spend some time in the desert. You're going to have some cave-like wilderness experiences, and the cave is the place that you do not want to go. Caves do not flow with milk and honey. There isn't a throne in sight. They are dark and cold and smelly and harsh, and as I said three weeks ago, when we just began to touch on these cave-like experiences, the reality is that some of you in this room are in a cave right now. so before i go on any further let me say something directly to those of you who are in this kind of place here's the word all of god's people go where you are all of them all of us everybody logs some time in the desert cave and you need to hear something if you're there right now God has not forgotten you even though it feels like he has you have not been abandoned he knows your name he knows where you live but here's the hard reality he is never in a hurry so the message of the day is this God is at work in the cave-like experiences of life in ways you do not see and may not understand that sometimes feel like abandonment. God's way is rarely the quickest way. It is seldom the easiest way. But here's the deal. God shapes souls and makes hearts strong in the desert caves. That's why on a journey of the heart, we have to spend some time here. I think actually it could be argued successfully that some of David's best days, if you were to look at his whole life, the span of his life from when he was youthful to when he was an older king, that some of the best days of his life, particularly as it relates to God doing deep things and forming deep things in his heart, the best days of his life might have been those cave years. Not the most enjoyable, not years he necessarily wanted to go back to, but some of the things that God built, best years of his life. With all of that in mind, the time we have remaining i'd like to talk a little bit about some things we need to remember and for some of you this may be by way by way of reminder some things that we uniquely learn in these desert caves first one that comes to mind is this that in the desert cave, you have a unique opportunity to learn what I would call patient trust. Patient trust. Not because you're necessarily so noble and deep, though you may be noble and deep, but when you're in the desert cave, the reason you are learning patient trust is because this patient trust is being pressed into you. The reason you're learning patient trust is because you don't have a lot of options. there's not a lot of choice if you're in a real cave you know there are times you know i'd like to think you know i just you know i would like to avoid the pain so i want to learn all the hard lessons the easy way how many of you want to learn hard lessons the easy way doesn't work that's it that's why i'm gonna just lord just form me in patient trust and you know whatever the patient trust gets pressed on you it's pressed on you when when, you know when you're trusting God for your next meal, when you don't know where it's coming from, when you really don't know where it's coming from. See, every day God gave them manna. And every day they got anxious. Shame on them. So would you, so would I. That's what you do. What about tomorrow was their question. The manna was provided. Well, what about tomorrow? So in their anxiety, they began to store the manna. You remember the story. And when they did, the man of bread worms, and became foul. Overnight, they couldn't store it for one day. Why did that happen? Because God was mad at them, and he just wanted to be mean. Yeah, that's why. No. Well, that's not why. Here's why. Because the desert is the place that is going to press you. It's the nature of the beast. The desert cave is the place that's gonna press you to live one day at a time because you don't have a choice. The desert place is the place you're gonna learn. It's gonna press you to follow God who's just not in a hurry. So you may not know what's gonna happen tomorrow and you can be all anxiety if you want to or you can learn in that place to trust God for tomorrow. See, every day the pillar of fire Which was a symbol of the presence of God moved Or it didn't move Here we go again And every day they had to decide again today If the pillar moves, are we going to follow? And if the pillar doesn't move, are we going to wait? When the problem isn't solved, are we still going to wait? When the answer isn't easy Are we still going to wait on God? Or are we just going to fix it ourselves? own. These issues of learning patient trust are things you learn, not from a sermon, not from this one, promise. You will not go out of here with more patient trust than you came in. This sermon has no power to do that. You don't learn this stuff from a book or a class or a Bible study. Where you learn it is in the desert cave because it presses you and me into it. We learn it in the belly of a whale. We learn it in an Egyptian prison when we've been falsely accused. In fact, I would get away from the word learn because we are so in our heads, most all of us, and it's not, I like to, I pick on evangelicals, that's us all the time, but it's really a Western way of thinking. We're all up in our heads. I think a lot of us are trying to think our way into new ways of living, so we take notes. I'm not saying don't take notes, but desert experiences press you to live into patient trust. See, I don't think, this is an old 12-step cliche. We can't think ourselves into a new way of living. We need to live our way into a new way of thinking. That's where we learn. That's where we change. We get changed in the desert cave, in the belly of the whale. We get changed in the Egyptian prison when we've been falsely accused. A warning here, however, because this deep growth in the desert cave is not automatic. How many of you know people who have had desert experiences and they didn't grow? They're bitter, sour, shriveled up people. It's not automatic. See, the first thing that happened to the Exodus 13 people when they went into the wilderness and found themselves in the desert was they wanted to get out of the desert. Those terrible people? No, that's a very normal thing. Nothing wrong with that. It's normal. The danger, however, is this. That is precisely the point at which we begin to look for a quick fix. And the quickest fix for the Exodus 13 people when they were in the wilderness, the desert place, was to just go back to Egypt. And in symbol for us, what it would mean is this, to just go back to what we know, to go back to control, to go back to whatever it is that medicates us. And when we go back, it isn't freedom, and it isn't joy, it isn't glory, and it isn't life, but it is a relief, at least for a while. Most of us, when we move into these dark places, places, these desert places, desperately look for a way out. In fact, we talked about David a couple weeks ago as one of the things he successfully did to navigate the cave was he didn't take the sinful shortcut. Remember when he had the chance to kill Saul? Richard Rohr, a guy whose name I've been mentioning some over the last several weeks in a book I hadn't mentioned. It's a different book. I think I was talking about the wild man's journey before. This one is called Everything Belongs, says this about what we're addressing here this morning. We seldom go freely into the belly of the whale, he says, to apply it to our thing. We seldom go freely into the desert cave. Unless we face a major disaster, like the death of a friend or spouse or loss of a marriage or job, we usually will not go there. And I agree with him, and I don't want to go there. And when we do go there, he says, we often give answers too quickly, take away pain too easily, and too quickly medicate and stimulate. In terms of soul work, he says, we dare not get rid of the pain before we have learned what it has to teach us. That's why, he says, the poor sometimes have a head start in soul work, Because they can't resort to the instant fix. They can't buy the quick vacation. They can't buy a new car. They can't get the designer drugs. And they can't exchange their old spouse for a new one on a whim. Those are all ways to escape the cave, to medicate the stuff, and to never do or enter into and allow God to do the deep heart work that brings life. and a readiness to be the king, the throne, a readiness to taste the milk and honey, a readiness to be a redeemer of people. But it comes through the dark place. Back to Richard Rohr. These dark seasons in life are the best teachers you will ever have, he says. And spiritual energy is actually found in dark questions, seldom in easy answers. Easy answers are the way out. That's, by the way, why we love them so much. That's why people flock to churches who give them. But that's not what we're here for, a way out. We're here for transformation. We must learn, therefore, it says, we're to stay in the pain of life, the desert place, like David did, avoid the sinful escape by a killing Saul. Remember that we talked about that. To stay in the place, Rohr says, where there are no answers, there are no conclusions, and sometimes we can't even find meaning. That is the path to true and deep transformation. To learning to live, that is the path to learning to live one day at a time, patiently trusting. And here's the deal, no sermon can teach you that. No sermon can take you there. Second thing you need to remember about the desert cave is this. Keith mentioned this a couple of weeks ago in a different context. It's this. Sometimes when you're in the desert cave, things are going to get worse before they get better. It's not good news, but it might help you survive the cave that there's not something wrong with you if things get worse. Let me explain why. Because the desert cave is the place where we come face to face with our weakness, our frailty, and our sin. And we can't hide it anymore. just come steaming out. See, it's most often in the desert cave that we begin to see the unvarnished truth about our real motives and the depth of our pride and our ego needs and our selfishness. It's where we see our anger. It's where we see our agenda, our demandingness, our sin, and again, we can't mask it anymore. The desert cave is pressing all that stuff, but please understand this. As the desert cave draws all that out, its design in God's hands is not to humiliate us and to destroy us, but to sanctify and purify till Christ be formed in us. There's something about the desert cave that speaks symbolically, and I've already made reference to this, it speaks symbolically to death. But in the Christian kingdom context, death is never the end of the story. It is always the beginning of the story. Whether it be ultimate physical death where we eternally then exist, or it has to do with death-like experiences all the way along the way, in the kingdom of God, death is always giving birth to life. It's the death resurrection. It's the sign of Jonah going into the belly of the whale, coming out alive. it's a very important dynamic we need to understand about life in the kingdom of god the desert cave is sometimes where you go for things to die for things that need to die to die where aspects of character are being exposed that we wish nobody knew about it's not there to embarrass you it is there to put this not to death so new things can come. I'm in the process of reading a book right now. I'm not even sure I recommend it. I mean, the thing I'm going to tell you about is good, but I just need to warn you. Books I tell you about, you know, you may get into, there's a bunch of heresy in here. I know, I read all sorts of books. So think when you read them. Okay. Yeah, okay. The book is called King, Warrior, Magician, Lover. the four archetypes of masculine essence, if you will. I'm into all that weird stuff now. That's because I'm 50. I'm right on time. One of the things in the book talked about ancient cultures, even biblical cultures, that had rituals of initiation. It was talking about the fact that we have a lack of this in terms of calling young girls to be women and calling young boys to become men. And in particular, when we're talking about the boys, one of the things that had to happen was that the boy has to die. Now, I hope you understand we're talking symbolically that the boy has to die. And if the boy doesn't die, it never becomes a man. And if you want to keep talking symbolically, one of the problems we have in the culture is we have a bunch of 35-year-old boys. Get it? Okay? And in these ancient cultures, there were initiation rites that would be symbolic of death. Now, that's horrible. But out of the death would come life. From the death would come the man, if you will. And what they did, this was interesting, especially when I'm talking about cave and wilderness, that some of the cultures did, was that they would bring these boys and put them in a cave and put them in a wilderness, and then they'd leave them there. And the little boy, when he's sitting in the cave or in the wilderness, I'm going to die, I think. I mean, it was real fear, but they weren't going to die because in ways they didn't know they were being watched and protected, and if anything serious happened, they would be rescued. But they went through what felt like to them death, And when they came out the other side, they came out alive. They came and they were kind of initiated into their manhood and the women into their womanhood. And I have these things bouncing around in my brain of the same dynamic being a kingdom principle. 2 Corinthians 5, 17. Old things are passed away. Behold, new things have come. But there's a death kind of thing that you go through there. You think you'll get redeemed? It's a magic wand. You say the magic words. He doesn't... I'm going to just throw this one out. Jesus didn't just die and rise again so we wouldn't have to. Jesus did die and rise again so we didn't have to, wouldn't have to. And he secured our redemption. He didn't do it just for that. Jesus died and rose again to show us how. To enter into the belly of our whale so we could come out alive in a variety of ways where God wants to call forth life. in areas of your life that now are dead or need to be put to death. Now, before you think this analogy, especially these ancient cultures initiating their boys is bizarre and pagan, we have some, as Christians, we have initiation rituals as well. One, you might be thinking of it right as baptism. That's a huge one. And some, they sprinkle. In our tradition, we immersed. And when we immersed, when I was a kid and I was baptized, It was like you go into the water, and you come out, and you're clean. And that's why we would hold people under longer, because someone really needed a lot of cleaning. Put a little soap on them, and then we'd put them up. The symbolism of that, in fact, the symbolism of what this is really all about is lost on us. And I think we need to, I don't know how to bring it back, whatever. The symbolism is that you go into a tomb of water. You're dead in there, and you come out. You went in a boy, you come out. You went in, girl, you come out alive to God, but you went through a death thing. I don't know. I think maybe to make baptism mean something more to us, we should make it scarier. You know? We're going to kill you. Yeah, be afraid. Yeah, we're not going to do that. Think about it this way. Desert caves are a kind of baptism. By the way, I hope talking like this brings more meaning to our baptism. That's what it's about. We clean it up, and that's why we aren't initiated into this stuff. Desert caves that God will sometimes bring you into, that your sin will sometimes bring you into, that someone else's sin might bring you into, are baptisms where you're gonna die. No, you're not. You're gonna come to life. it's kind of poking at the same thing from a different angle with a different story exodus 19 verse 4 exodus 19 verse 4 is god coming to moses and explaining to him what was really going on in exodus 13 in other words god is saying to moses moses you know when we're we led you along by the out around by the way of the wilderness and didn't do the straight shot and you thought you were abandoned by me. Here's what was really going on. You were being born on eagle's wings. That's what was really happening in that desert cave experience. Being born on eagle's wings is what sounds like a wonderful experience, doesn't it? To be born on eagle's wings is what I thought it was going to be like to live with God. And I'm on the eagle, and here we are flying. Here's the key word, above everything. And all my problems are down there. And all the little people who didn't say the magic words are living in all their stuff and not me. I'm above it all. That's what I signed on for even. That's not the picture here of eagle's wings. In fact, the reference here to eagle's wings is a reference, as many of you know, to how eagles teach their young to fly. And many of you know how eagles teach their young to fly. They push them out of the nest. Because the parent eagle knows that if they don't push the eaglets out of the nest, the eaglet will be content to sit and consume for the rest of its life. How many of you don't need to be eagles? How many of you parents know that if you let your little eaglets stay in the house till they're 45 years old, they're content to sit and consume all their, just consume and consume. Well, I mean, you call it empty nests, I think this is why. This is the empty nest. And when the little eaglets are kind of pushed out of the nest, the mothers all go, oh, it's so heavy. And the fathers go, yes. Let me explain. Let me explain the humor. It isn't yes, because we're finally rid of them. That's not why. Here's why. Because we want these eagles to learn to fly. That's why we're here as parents. That's one of God's purposes in our life, to teach us how to fly, to live. and I'm not going to carry you. I will empower. I will be with you. But there are things you need to learn to do, like live. So he pushes them out. And as the eagles are pushed out of the eaglets are pushed out of the nest, they're flopping and they're flailing and they think they're going to die, but they don't. Because the parent eagle didn't just kick them out to let them die. the parent eagle now swoops down just before they hit the ground and bears them up on eagle's wings and carries them along, and they're lifted up, and now the eaglet is on the back of the eagle saying, this is what I thought it was. Now I'm back, and... And then they get to the heights, and the eagle goes... And he's down again. During this process of being born up and then dropped again, and the eagle going like this, The baby eagle does not feel real good about mom and dad. Real confusing time. I thought you were an eagle of love. The pastor said you were. I thought I could climb on your lap and stay there my whole life. No, you can't. There's a number of things that you could notice. I mean, you can take this analogy and just kind of work with it yourself and apply it in a number of ways. One of the things I want you to notice this morning is that there is nothing passive about this process. On God's part, he's involved, swooping you up and carrying you, allowing you to experience some kind of whatever. And there's nothing passive on the eaglets part. Lots of effort. is involved in learning how to fly. Lots of effort is involved in becoming mature and growing up into the fullness of Christ. We've said this over and over here at Open Door. Grace is opposed to earning. You don't fly to get God to love you. He loves you. It is. Grace is opposed. I just said that wrong. Grace is opposed to earning. You don't fly to get God's favor. It is not opposed to effort. A lot of effort in learning how to fly. I read an article a couple of weeks ago that was talking about what they identified as the feminization of the church. Now, don't get offended yet. When I explain, then you'll get offended. Don't get offended yet. Feminization of the church doesn't mean it's being overrun by women or that men are leaving. The feminization of the church, what they did in the article, they identified a feminine energy as womb-like energy. And when the church is dominated by womb-like energy, it's a danger. Now, just work with that analogy a little bit. It's really a power. Womb-like energy, what does it communicate to you? In the womb, it is what? It is warm and it's safe. and it's nurturing. And I never want to leave the womb. I just want to suck my thumb. Is this great? If that's the only energy you have, I pray, you know what? You're going to die. You are never going to grow. And what it was, was a call for a different kind of energy. By the way, that womb kind of energy is the energy that says, come and sit on Jesus' lap. Now, do we need to have that energy? Does that need to be in the church? Does that need to be in life? Absolutely. If you don't have that kind of feminine, womb-like energy in the church, in your life, you're going to die. It's a frightening thing to not have that. But somewhere along the line, there comes a different kind of energy that says, you know what? You can't spend your whole life in the womb. You cannot spend your whole life on the lap of Jesus. Somewhere along the line, you need to get up off the lap of God and do something. Obey him, serve him, act on what you know and how you have been nurtured. And those two dynamics, feminine and masculine energy, together are the image of God. And by the way, when I talk about feminine energy, masculine energy, I'm not talking, this is really important. I'm not talking about men and women. Women have feminine and masculine energy. Get it? Men have feminine and masculine energy. Balanced people live in a balance of both. Balanced churches have both. The feminization would be, all we're ever saying to you is, sit on Jesus' lap, come and flow. You got hurt? Oh, no. No, here's what we'll do. We'll give you a hug and then give you something to do. Hold the baby, pass out a bulletin. By the way, this balance, plug this in, because we've been in this a couple weeks. This balance is exactly seen in Ziklag. Remember, David went to Ziklag, 1 Samuel 30. In Ziklag, David and his men had gone on a hunting trip, came back. The Amalekites had burned Ziklag to the ground and had taken all the women, the wives, and all the children with them. They were captive. And the Bible says that David and his men wept until there was no more strength for weeping. What does that require? Womb energy. And they were in the womb of God at that time. And they were being nurtured. And come unto me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest and I will heal you. And in the very next verse, David said, what should I do? And God said, go kill the Amalekites. Go and do something. Go rescue them. Go redeem them. Pull out your sword and take some action. Leave the womb right now and do something. And the very important words were these in the text. So David, what? Went. and those are things that get pressed into us forced upon us pushed on us when we're in these kinds of caves last thing and I close desert cave is a place where you learn to love God for God's sake and not just for the milk and honey or the promise of a throne because in the desert cave there aren't any toys you don't get the promotion you don't even get the job the disease isn't cured, the problem isn't solved, all you get in the cave is this. Verse 22 of Exodus 13, that he did not take away the pillar of cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people. Again, the pillar being a symbol of the presence of God, a presence that when you're in the cave, you can't always see or feel. But it's a presence that is confirmed in this promise, I will never leave you nor forsake you, but I might lead you around by the way of the wilderness, the desert cave, for he is the God of the roundabout way who himself secured our redemption and ascended to his throne, not by the straight shot of royal decree, but by the roundabout way of the cross. A cave-like experience if there ever was one. So to those of you who may be in a desert cave this morning, final word to you. All God's people, go where you are. God has not forgotten you even though it feels like that. You have not been abandoned. He knows your name. He knows where you live. But God is at work in the cave-like experiences of life in ways you cannot always see and may not understand. God's way is rarely the easiest way. It is seldom the quickest way. But God shapes souls and makes hearts strong in the desert caves of life. Let's pray. Father, I thank you for this journey that we are on. Help us to respond appropriately to this particular place. I pray for those who may now be in a cave, that they would experience the womb-like energy of God, but also respond positively to the places you are calling them to act. I pray these things be done among us in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
