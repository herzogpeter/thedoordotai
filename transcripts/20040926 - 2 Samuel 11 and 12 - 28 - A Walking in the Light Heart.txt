Father, I ask that you would bring light into those dark places, those places that by our instinct we would hide and give us the courage to live in that light, to leave the light on. I pray it in Jesus' name, amen. today in the larger context of what has turned into a year-long journey of the heart what we're calling a journey of the heart as we use the life of David as our guide for that journey we continue this week to deal with and examine the story of David and Bathsheba an episode in David's life where he clearly did not do well. An episode in his life that caused us to wonder what happened to this guy's heart. For a while, it looked like he would get away with it. That is, his adulterous affair with Bathsheba and subsequent murder of her husband Uriah, it looked like the cover-up of all of that was complete, especially when he took her to be his wife and she bore him a son, but he didn't get away with it, as we have discovered over the last couple of weeks, primarily because of a skillfully told parable by Nathan the prophet. David's sin was exposed in 2 Samuel 12, verse 7. Having lived with that sin for almost a year, a thing I want you to keep in mind as we go on into this word, his repentance began after the sin was exposed in the very next verse, or not the very next verse, but the 13th verse of the very same chapter, chapter 12, 13. God's forgiveness and grace was extended in that same verse, but the forgiveness and grace did not mean there were no consequences, which has been a primary point of the last couple of weeks. Verse 13, then David said, I have sinned against the Lord. Then Nathan said, well, David, the Lord also has taken away your sin. you shall not die, which on the surface makes this repentance thing look quick and easy. And rather superficial, actually. It sounds like it works like this. I say I'm sorry, God says, okay. Oh, and that murder thing, sorry. Okay. However. Now, however is the very first word of the very next verse. There is forgiveness, David. However, because of what you have done, the enemies of the Lord will blaspheme God. The baby born of your adultery will die. The sword will never depart from your house. For in the violence against Uriah, you have released violence into your life and into your family. There is grace, but not without consequences. The amazing grace and forgiveness of God does not magically remove those things. We've been saying it this way for a couple of weeks. The grace is not like a big mattress at the bottom of the cliff that keeps you from hurting yourself if you decide to jump off a cliff. It doesn't work that way. Life doesn't work that way. Here are the facts of life. If you jump off a cliff, you're going to fall. If you fall, you're going to hit. If you hit, you're going to hurt yourself, maybe hurt yourself badly, which is precisely why for the last couple of weeks and now again today, we have been talking about what happens when you jump off a cliff. We have been talking about sin. Two weeks ago, in our dealing with sin, we talked about the inevitable consequences for sin. Last week, we talked about the nature of sin, how it functions and what it does, discovering that what it primarily does is damage, diminish, and destroy people, which is precisely why God hates sin. God is not arbitrarily opposed to sin. He doesn't get angry about it because we broke one of his rules, and he kind of takes that personally. The primary reason God hates sin is because it damages, diminishes, and destroys the object of his love, you and me, people, relationships, marriages, churches, cities, nations, the world. Today I want to begin to wrap this thing up, David and Bathsheba, this whole issue of sin, by talking about two things, but talking about them kind of together. I want to talk, first of all, about the way out of this kind of sin, particularly David's sin, the downward spiral into which he fell and looked like there was no way. I want to talk about the way out of that kind of sin. At the same time, I want to talk about safeguards from that kind of sin, safeguards particularly from entering into the downward spiral. The picture we've gotten of David over the last couple of weeks is that he got into something, and if he would have stopped anywhere along the way, he would have done some damage. But as he kept on going, the downward spiral made more and more damage. I want to talk about the way out of that. I want to talk about safeguards from that. But I also want you to see that the way out of this kind of sin and the safeguard from this kind of sin are actually found in the same place. At the risk of oversimplification, the way out of and the safeguard from this kind of sin is to become the kind of people who are intentionally and tenaciously, and I would add courageously, because this is going to require courage, willing to live in the bright light of what is true about life, about God, about ourselves, and about our sin. When Nathan came to David, and after the parable said to David, thou art the man, what he essentially was doing was turning on a light, exposing David's sin in such a way that he could no longer deny. He was turning on a light. David, to his credit, did not turn off the light. People often do turn off the light when it comes on and exposes. We learn to hide in a variety of ways. David certainly could have turned off the light that Nathan turned on. He was a king. He could have used the power and his capacity to control and manage his life the same way he had done when he tried to cover up Bathsheba's pregnancy. by killing Uriah, Bathsheba's husband. I mean, the truth is this. You don't talk to a king the way Nathan talked to David. People have been executed for far less an offense. David could have turned off the light. He could have continued to live in the dark. He could have continued to manage this sin, to cover it and hide it. But to his credit, he didn't do it. He left the light on, which introduces us to one of the first steps to getting out of this kind of downward spiral. Step number one in the recovery of David's heart and the restoration of his soul was to live in the light, to literally leave the light on that Nathan the prophet had turned on. To literally live in the discomfort, in fact, for David, the agony of what the light had just exposed. I mean, I see happening, what's happening to David spiritually is what happens to us sometimes physically. And I know this happens to you. In fact, I talk to the ushers. When you walk out of the evening in the auditorium and there's all that light in the gathering space, it's like I watch people. They walk out and they start going like this. And they just stand there and let their eyes get adjusted. When I leave church, this very thing happens to me. I walk out. It's a dark room in there. I open the back door. The sun is shining. I stand there like this. And you know, the first thing I want to do when the light hits my eyes, having been in a very dark place, you know what? I want to go back into the dark. David could have easily gone back into the dark when the light went on it hurt his eyes this was his worst day and at moments like that we have choices am I going to leave the light on am I going to stand in this or am I going to kill the guy who just told me that am I going to turn the light off first instinct when we come into the light having been in the dark is to go back into the dark and if not go back into the fullness of darkness at least to pull down the shade. By the way, we come about this honestly in a way. It's kind of our emotional and spiritual. It's in our emotional and spiritual DNA. Back in Genesis chapter 3 is where it all began. Adam and Eve were walking in the cool of the day with God in fellowship with God, looking to God eye to eye, face to face, open face, nothing to hide at all. It was an incredible kind of intimacy. And then sin entered into that relationship. And as soon as sin entered into the relationship, Everything changed. They began to cover themselves. They began to be ashamed of what they saw. And they began to hide from God. And God starts going through the garden saying this, where are you, Adam? Where are you? Where'd you go? He's hiding. And we've been hiding ever since. And we've been covering ever since. It's just, it's kind of hardwired into us. Every instinct we have is to hide and to cover and to turn off the lights and to pull down the shade. Here's the deal. First step in recovering from this kind of sin is to live in the light. To intentionally, tenaciously, courageously be willing to leave the light on. It is the only way out of this downward spiral. And if at some point you don't leave the light on, you will continue to spiral down, I think, into death. And it is one of the primary safeguards from this downward spiral to intentionally, tenaciously, courageously live in the bright light of what is true about your life, about yourself, about our sin. And it does take courage to do that because I don't always like what the light exposes. 1 John 1, verse 7 says it this way. If we walk in the light, as he himself is in the light, in other words, if we are willing to leave the light on and look honestly at what it exposes, we'll have fellowship with one another and the blood of his son will cleanse us from all sin. The cleansing us from all sin is one of the results of living in the light and leaving the light on. I think if you've been in the dark, the thing I fear about the light is that it's going to expose me, and it is a scary thing to be exposed. You've got to let this part of the verse in, however. The only function of the light, the function of the light is not just to expose your sin. The function of the light and the purpose of the gospel is to cleanse your sin so you can be free and feel clean and not have to hide anymore. Wouldn't that be great? You walk in the lights. We have fellowship with one another. I'm going to explain that phrase later. But the blood of his son in the light can begin to cleanse the stuff that we're hiding, but we have to intentionally, tenaciously leave the light. Up to verse 5, same epistle, same chapter. 1 John 1, 5 says, This is the message that we have heard from him, that is from God, and now announced to you that God is light. He's not just in the light. He is light by very nature. And in him there is no darkness at all. In other words, no pretense in God. There is no illusion, no trickery. James 1.17, there's no shifting shadow. Why don't you let the imagery of a shifting shadow in on you. Have you ever seen a shifting shadow? Shifting means there's a little bit of light and there's a shadow and I can't quite see. And then it moved. Did it just move? And it scares you. Sometimes we have relationships with people like that where they're hiding in such a way where there's a little bit of light, but we find the shadow. We do this with each other. You ever been in a relationship like that, or just had a feeling when you were with someone like that, and you're seeing something, and you kind of see a shadow, and then it moves, and it just generates, because you can't see what it is. It just keeps moving, not with God. In God, God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. There is no illusion. There is no trickery. God would be like the best friend you have who tells it to you straight. We all love that, don't we? Don't you love those guys who tell it to you straight? No. Just give me a little sugar on there, something. Give me a little shadow because I want someplace to hide. Don't you? I do. Want to do the God thing? No shifting shadow. No illusion, no tricky light. Next verse, 1 John 1, 6 says this. If we say we have fellowship with God, who is light, and yet we're walking in darkness, we lie. About what? about being in fellowship. Why? Well, let me explain this. The darkness here, if we walk in darkness, darkness there is not sin. All of us sin from time to time. Darkness is the propensity, the instinct, all of us have to hide our sin, to deny our sin, to redefine our sin, to keep it in the dark, to pull down the shade. So if you say you have fellowship with God, but the way of life that you have entered into and commonly live out is to be hiding, to be pulling down the shade, to be turning off the light, to create shifting shadows so people can't really see the truth. You're lying when you say you have fellowship with God if that's the way you live because God is light. You can't be hiding and in the light at the same time. And now comes the verse I read to begin with, 1 John 1, 7. But if we walk in the light, if we have the intention to, the desire to, the tenaciousness to, the courage to walk in the light and leave the light on. We have fellowship with him. And not only will he expose your sin, he's not interested in just exposing your sin so you're humiliated. He would like to cleanse your sin, clean your sin, change your, remove your sin, so you can be free and feel clean and not have to hide anymore. But all of this raises a question. and on one level it's a very simple question and instinctively well of course I want to live this way but it's not as simple as it might seem the question is this do I want to live in the light or do I want to live in the dark well no before you answer I want to say some things about this one thing I want you to know is you get to choose and every day we do choose light and darkness in ways sometimes that are obvious. I mean, the way David was hiding and covering and managing his sin is obvious and it's blatant and it was a downward spiral and he needed a Nathan who in an almost tricky way, a violent way, an offensive way, turned the light on and intervened. It would be Nathan and David what we would be calling today an intervention. So there are ways in which blatantly we hide and live in the dark. I think I'm much more in tune with the ways I, we, subtly hide. Truth is, I'd be scared to live in the dark, you know, completely dark. And I would think you would be too. What I am pretty good at, though, is just kind of pulling the shade down and leaving enough light so I can see where I'm going, you know, so I don't run into anything in my house. But I don't want enough light to see what mess is really there. Thank you very much. We do it in subtle ways. With insincere smiles we hide. With half-truths we create a shifting shadow. What did they say? What did they mean? The question is a big question. Do I want to live my life in the light of what is true about my life? Do I want to live in the light of what is true about my relationships, my marriage, my character, my behaviors, my sinner? Do I prefer the dark? Do I prefer not to see the truth about those things, about how I treat people, about how I handle my money, about how I express my sexuality, how anger comes to me? I just as soon not look at any of those things and accept all of the ways I pull down the shade. do I want to live? another way to ask the question do I want to live in what most of us would call reality or do I prefer illusion? truth is I think all of us probably know someone maybe you're thinking of them right now certainly not yourself who consistently seems to choose the illusion I mean we even find ourselves saying things like this about them you know what they just they don't have a clue what they're doing they're totally in denial They keep making the same bad choices over and over and over again, creating all sorts of problems and pain for themselves and the people around them. And then we say this, can't they see what they're doing? The answer is no. You know why? They're living in the dark. And they have been doing that for a very long time. See, when given the opportunity to think about it and choose, do you want light or dark? Do you want reality or illusion? Most of us would choose the light. I think everybody here, when given the opportunity to think about it, would say, I don't think anybody here, yeah, I want to live in the dark. I want to be totally blind to reality. Nobody wants that. We would all go, yeah, sign me up for light. When I have time to think about it, I love the light. primarily because the light helps me see things that I want to see, that I need to see, sometimes beautiful things the light helps me see. You know what it feels like before the sun comes up and you're looking on a beautiful scene, and maybe there's a mountain there or the ocean is there, but it's dark so you can't see it, and then the light comes and it reveals beauty. I love the light that day. Sometimes what the light reveals are good things and noble things and virtuous things, and I love it when the light of reality reveals those things because when the light of reality reveals what is good and noble and virtuous, I can choose those things because I want those things. It's how I came to Christ, and you too. It was when the light came on for us about who Jesus really is, and I'm grateful. Oh, thank you, God. The light came on, and I could see you. I love the light. Sometimes the light helps me see dangerous things and hurtful things, And I love the light when it does that because it protects me. Because when the light shows me dangerous things, I can avoid them. If not for light, I would walk off the cliff. Just because I didn't see it. It wouldn't even make me a bad person if I didn't see the edge of this thing. I'd walk right off of it. I love the light when it does that. If it wasn't for the light, I'd step in a hole. Because I wouldn't see the hole. If it wasn't for the light, I'd fall into the trap. I mean, this is a simple... You ever get up in the middle of the night when you get up in the middle of the night to do what you do when you get up in the middle of the night? And there isn't any light and you step on things. And I love the light when I'm in the middle of the night and there's things there that weren't there. It's a weird thing. This is totally off my sermon. But our kids are gone now. And it is an amazing thing how in the middle of the night when I used to get up, I'd never know what was going to be on the floor because the kids would come. I'd go to the kids that come and they'd throw their toys. And I'd step on them and hurt myself. and now it's an incredible thing with our kids gone. When I wake up in the morning or even in the middle of the night, our house is the same in the morning as it was at night. And so I can't even walk in the dark. Anyway, I love the light when it reveals virtue and when it reveals nobility and when it reveals what is good because I can choose it. I love it when it reveals dangerous things so I can avoid it. But sometimes the very thing I love about the light is what I hate about the light. And that is this, that it exposes and reveals what is true, not only about beauty and virtue and danger, but it exposes what is true about me. Particularly, it exposes what is true about my sin. And then, I hate the light. I hate it. You see, I felt just fine about my marriage. until the light went on and I began to hear how my wife was experiencing the marriage. I hated that. I felt just fine about my attitudes and my addictions and my anger. And I think David felt just fine about his adultery until the light went on. I hate the light. I felt just fine about my sexuality. I felt just fine about how I'm handling my money. How I treat my friends. Before that stupid light went off. And every instinct I have before the light went on. And every instinct I have when the light goes on to the way things really are in my heart, in my attitudes, and how people experience it. Every time it goes on, I want to turn it off. I hate the light. John 3.19 says this. Men love darkness rather than light. Why? Because their deeds are evil. I get that verse. Because the reason the darkness becomes my friend is because I can use the darkness to hide what I don't want you to see about me. What I don't even want to see about me. And once again, I'm one of these guys, I'm just slick enough where I don't want to live in total darkness. I'll just pull down the shade a little bit, let in enough light that I can get around and not totally shipwreck my life, maybe, And create enough shifting shadows that you can't ever really confront me. And love darkness. Before you go, yeah, we want the light. The truth is most of us love the darkness because it provides a safe place to hide. But let me tell you something that's really scary about these tendencies we have to hide things in the dark. To pull down the shade. To turn off the light. It's this. That if you live in the dark long enough, if you make this a pattern of life, you can get used to the dark. And some of you might think, well, that's good. No, that's really scary. That's really, you can learn to live in the dark. In fact, I would ask God to help us to be afraid of the dark. But we're not. The darkness is our friend again. Danger is that we can learn to live in the dark and even begin to think that the darkness we live in is light. We can actually find ourselves saying things like this. You know, I don't see anything wrong with, and then you just fill in the blank. And the reason you don't see anything wrong, the reason you don't see anything wrong with is because you're in the dark. Of course you don't see it. you're living in the dark, and you've been in the dark so long, you're used to the dark. In fact, you think the dark is light. See, I don't see anything wrong with flirting with that woman at work, even though I'm married, and so is she. And the reason you don't see anything wrong with it is because you are living in the dark, and you've grown used to living in the dark, and that's why you don't see it at all. See, I don't see anything wrong at all with the way I talk to my kids, or the way I talk to my friends or my wife, when I kind of use my anger to manipulate them and control them and get what I want from them, then the reason you don't see anything wrong with it at all is because you are living in the dark and you have grown used to the dark. You've learned to live in the dark, and so you don't see. I don't see anything wrong at all. I was sleeping with my boyfriend or my girlfriend before we were married, and the reason you don't see anything wrong with that at all is because you're living in the dark and you've grown used to the dark. We've been talking about running red lights, David. Early in this series, we talked about David running red lights. And one of the things I said quite boldly was, when David started running red lights, he knew he was running red lights. Remember, she is Bathsheba. She is Uriah's wife. That was a red light. He knew he was running a red light. He ran a red light. And all of us are going, yeah, so where am I running red lights? I don't know. I don't see any red lights. I'm running. And he says I would know if I'm running red. Yeah, I'm here to tell you. I agree with what I said, and I don't agree with what I said. I think there are a lot of people who are running red lights and don't even know they're running them. You know why? Because they're living in the dark. And they've grown used to the dark and they don't even know the difference between right and wrong anymore. You don't even see it. This is, I'm talking about a dangerous way to live. The darkness is our friend. It helps me hide. You live long enough there and you will die. and you don't even know you're dying. Dallas Willard, in his book Divine Conspiracy, begins that book with an illustration, I've shared it with you before, of a fighter pilot flying upside down, only they don't know they're flying upside down. Now, that sounds weird to me. How could that happen? But I've talked to enough pilots about this to come to understand that that can't happen. And night and dark, flipping around, doing all sorts of things, all of a sudden you could be upside down, lose your bearings so much that you could be upside down and not be aware of that. And it's at that point, the pilots tell me, you have to follow your instruments and realize that what you're feeling of being right side up is wrong. You really are upside down and watch your instruments and believe them and obey them. Interesting analogy there. There are certain things that feel really good to me, but the Bible says, don't go there. You're going to hurt yourself, you're going to die, and you're going to have to trust what God says is true and act on that. Well, Dallas uses this illustration of somebody flying upside down, but they don't know it. With his hands on the controls, he moves into what he thinks is a steep ascent, but because he's upside down, he drives it right into the ground, crashes the plane, and kills himself. The point is this. Many of us, many of us, even those of us who name the name of Jesus, who have come into authentic faith, but we've learned to live with the shade, not all the way down, just enough to get by. We're flying upside down, and we don't even know we're upside down. We've grown used to the dark. The reason we've grown used to the dark is at least in part because the information we're getting about how to do life, about what is true and what is right, The information we're getting is coming from what I talked about last week, this world system driven by the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life. Those three things, basically, when lived out, destroy people. But if you live long enough in a system that is driven by those three things and you believe that the information you're getting from that system about life and light and health and happiness and joy is right, you're upside down and after a while it feels right side up. you're troubling you don't even know it you've learned you've learned to do a dangerous thing you've learned to live in the dark so that not only are we capable of hiding our sin from one another we are actually able to hide it from ourselves to literally deceive ourselves we have an incredible capacity for that it is a very dangerous capacity we have the Bible says we are fearfully and wonderfully made and we are and part of the wonder of it is not all good we are incredible at our creative capacity to deceive ourselves 1 John 1.8 says if you say you have no sin you deceive yourself my paraphrase of that verse is this if you are unable to see and acknowledge your own stuff If you're unable to see your own shifty motives and the ways you, if you're unable to see that you have gotten to the place where you have deceived yourself. Cornelius Plantinga in his book I referenced last week called Not the Way It's Supposed to Be says about this, this, and I'm quoting here, self-deception is a shadowy phenomenon by which we pull the wool over some part of our own psyche. We put a move on ourselves. We deny, suppress, or minimize what we know to be true. We assert, adorn, and elevate what we know to be false. We prettify ugly realities and then sell ourselves the prettified versions. We know the truth, and yet we don't know the truth because we persuade ourselves of its opposite. First, we deceive ourselves, and then we convince ourselves that we are not deceived. Then we actually forget that certain things are wrong. Let's say that again. We actually forget that certain things are wrong and that we are doing them. That's flying upside down and not knowing it. Don't believe it, he says. Why then do alcoholics and drug abusers typically go through years of denial? Why is the revelation of incest an astonishment to people who are living right in the middle of it? How did the Nazis convince themselves that their killing program served the best interest, even of their victims? Why do battering husbands offer minimizing and euphemistic accounts of the beatings they administer? And why do battered wives sometimes accept and repeat those accounts? Here's why. Because we've learned to live in the dark. We're upside down, and we don't even know it, And we think our darkness is the light. Since Adam and Eve, beloved, in Genesis 3, we have been hiding and covering and concealing our sin, which is precisely why I say emphatically that the only way out of the downward spiral into sin that we see embodied in David, And one of the primary safeguards from the downward spiral into the kind of sin we see in David is to become the kind of people who are intentionally, tenaciously, and courageously willing to live in the bright light of what is true about life and God, about ourselves, and about our sin. So it is today I invite you into the light. To live in the light. To, like David, leave the light on when it shines on a dark place. But to that invitation, I want to add some promises. Promises almost as an incentive to do this. That if you have the courage and faith to come out of hiding and leave the light on, there are specific, significant, and noticeable things that will happen to you. Two, just very briefly, two, I want to tell you about. The first is this. That if you come into the light, come out of hiding, and leave the light on, you will, maybe for the first time in your life, find freedom, feel clean, know forgiveness, and experience grace. Operative words there are these. Find, feel, experience, know. Not just an intellectual understanding and a theological grasp of freedom, cleansing, forgiveness, and grace. But if you bring out into the light what you're hiding in the dark, you will feel freedom. You will feel clean. You will know forgiveness. You will experience grace. Listen to David's testimony of this very thing in Psalm 32, beginning in the third verse. Here is his report. When I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away through my groaning all day long. Day and night, your hand was heavy upon me. Now, I hid this thing for almost a year, and nobody knew that God's hand was heavy upon me. I knew, but in terms of the shifting side, I covered this thing so well that nobody would have known. I think he's talking here day and night, sleepless nights. And my vitality was drained away as with the fever heat of summer. but when I brought out into the light what I was hiding in the dark that's my paraphrase of this next thing what I was hiding in the dark actually for almost a year when I left the light on acknowledged my sin verse 5 and my iniquity I did not hide any longer then thou didst forgive me of the guilt of my sin in other words David found freedom he felt clean he experienced forgiveness and he tasted grace and so can you but it doesn't happen till you come into the light till you leave the light on you know we talk about grace and giving people grace and we're a graceful church but you know what until you you you cannot experience grace until you leave the light on i mean grace can't get to you if you're hiding your sin see the fact is everybody doesn't get grace and by getting grace I don't mean understand it I mean experience it if you say you have fellowship with God but you're living in darkness your whole way of life is to pull down the shade you're not having fellowship with God you're not experiencing grace scariest thing you'll ever do is come into the light and leave the light on most liberating thing you'll ever do is to come into the light and to leave the light on because not only will it expose you, it will cleanse you. It will heal you. It will free you. A little side note here. As difficult, painful, and sometimes frightening as it is to leave the light on when it shines into a dark place, I want you to consider this, that in the long run, it is much more difficult to live in the dark than it is to live in the light and lonely too. Plantinga, again, writes this. In late 1992, 16 women charged a U.S. senator with flagrant sexual harassment. The senator's response was typical and revealing. First, he denied the charges. Then he attacked the credibility of the accusers. But when that didn't work, he issued this extraordinary apology. Faced with irrefutable proof that he had for years been groping and kissing his staff members, the senator declared that he never meant to make anyone uncomfortable. Still, he told the media that he would seek professional help to see if his alleged behavior was related to his use of alcohol. This is an apology, says Plantinga, of major, almost metaphysical elusiveness. I mean, even in his apology, he's still hiding, creating shifting shadows. What did he mean? I don't know. According to the senator, nothing happened. But if it did, he meant nothing by it. And regardless, he might have been drinking at the time, so he missed the significance of the non-event in question. End quote. Here's a deal about the senator. He might have kept his Senate seat with all of this hiding and pulling down the shade and creating shifting shadows. I don't know. He might have, with his very skillful creation of shifting shadows and pulling down the shade, been able to avoid some lawsuits. I don't know. For all I know, he might go to church every Sunday. I don't know. Here's what I do know. I do know this. That until he brings into the light what he is hiding in the dark, and until he leaves the light on, he will never, he will never, ever find freedom, feel clean, know forgiveness, or experience grace. And here's the deal. That is a very hard way to live. and lonely too. Which leads to the second thing, last thing. I can promise you if you come out of hiding and live in the light of what is true, it's this. If you do this, you're going to make some new friends. What does this have to do with making friends? 1 John 1.7 says if we walk in the light and leave the light on to see himself as in the light, we have fellowship with one another. How does that work? I grew up in church, and we were having fun, food, and fellowship all the time. Happened on Saturday night, and I'm not saying that was Sunday night after church. We'd have fun, food, and fellowship, and fellowship meant being nice to each other and having fun. And there was nothing wrong with that. There was nothing wrong with that. But nobody knew anybody. And most of the churches we have been in are... It's weird how because there's a desire to be holy or there's this thing about being holy in a church, We have actually become maybe the best pretenders, the best hiders on the planet. But if you know what that feels like, you know that it's also a very lonely place because you can't go anywhere. How many of you have ever been in a small group? It doesn't always happen in small groups, but in a relationship with someone where one of you, finally because you've developed some trust, and because maybe you've had the fun food and fellowship long enough that you want to go a little deeper, that you find something you trust enough, and you say, you know, I need to share something with you. And what you're about to share is just about to say, you know, I need to pull a shade up on my life so you can see in a little bit more about something I've been doing that you don't know about or some attitude I've been holding that, you know, you would never know. And I just need to tell you because I just don't want to be alone with this. And I just got to tell you, it's sin. And how many times have you ever done that? And maybe you've done that and they're aghast. They go, oh my gosh, I would have. I've never known. Well, then you never do it again, do you? You just pull the shade down, I'll never do that again. But every once in a while you'll do that, and someone will say, you know, thanks for sharing that. But you know what? You would never, I struggle with that thing too. And you know what? It's sin. It's sin. And it's hurting me, and it's hurting you. So let's hold each other accountable. And, you know, I'm going to ask you about that, and I'm going to challenge you, because I love you, to leave the shade up. And if I can sense that I'm with you, and I can tell the shade's down, you know what? I've got friends like that. I do and they tell me that they can tell when the shade is down when the shade is up and you know what and when you experience that you know what you're experiencing? fellowship that's fellowship if we live in the light as he is in the light we will have fellowship it's not saying nice things to each other all the time this is being in the light together we it's important we have fellowship I am not alone I can't live in the light by myself I need to do it with you you need to do it with me with people that we trust but if you're alone and nobody else is bringing it into the light and everybody keeps pretending that it's a frightening place to be Dietrich Bonhoeffer says it this way he who was alone with his sin is utterly alone it may be that Christians he says notwithstanding corporate worship common prayer and common service are in many respects still left in their aloneness the final breakthrough to authentic fellowship never comes because although never comes because although they have fellowship as believers and they have fellowship as devout people they never have fellowship as sinners the pious fellowship permits no one to be a sinner so everyone who is a sinner must conceal their sin from themselves and from the group and so we must decide says Bonhoeffer are we going to be a fellowship of pretenders living in darkness and denial, horrified when a real sinner is discovered among us, or will we walk as children of light who, with humility and authenticity as a normal course of life, are bringing into the light what every instinct we have tells us, to keep in the dark. And the reason we bring it into the light is not so we can be humiliated and exposed. And I'm telling you, this is why it's so important that we be a graceful people. Because all you need is one experience of being humiliated when you're exposed. And you'll just pull the shade back down. The purpose of bringing it into the light in the community of faith is to bring it into the light so God can heal that thing. And God can forgive that thing and cleanse that thing and change that thing. Change that thing. We live in a culture that's flying upside down that says of sin, oh, bring it out into the light so we can embrace that thing. And all heaven weeps. It's to change that thing we bring it into the light. As we walk in a light, as he himself is in a light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of his son will not just expose it, he will cleanse it. The purpose is to change us. We talk about community, and in our search for it, we look for things we have in common, like the same neighborhood or the same age of kids, the same interests, sports, art, music. How about this as a basis of community? Just try this on. We're all a bunch of sinners whose every instinct is to hide and conceal and deny our sin, my sin. But if you'll join me, how about we decide to live in the light of what is real? And by that, and then leave the light on. And then by that light being on, experience the amazing grace of God, the healing, cleansing, forgiveness of God that can make us a different kind of people. I'm here to tell you this is the only way out of the kind of downward spiral we see embodied in David. It is the only way out to come into the light. And it is the primary safeguard from that same spiral into sin. Because the truth, if I really am committed to live in the light and have people who can tell when I'm drawn to shade and kind of say, David, pull it back up. I may sin. I will sin. You will too. We will stumble, but I'm not going to get very far. And I don't want to get very far. And so we pray what David learned to pray in Psalm 51, and I would like you to go with this. And if you would, just pray it. Bring it to your memory. If you journal, write it down. Psalm 51. Pray it all week long and bring it back to communion service next week. Here's the prayer. Search me, O God. And know my heart. I invite the spotlight of your truth into those dark places. Into those hidden places. And sometimes we've hidden them so well, beloved. Can you tell I'm talking out of experience here? We're so good at hiding, we don't even know the hiding places. We don't even know places where we've hidden. David's saying that search me, know my heart because I don't know my own heart. Show me where I'm hiding and don't even know I'm hiding. Showing me where I'm upside down and don't know I'm upside down. I invite your light. I want to live in the light. I invite you to do that and then as you come back next week as a community we'll have the joy of bringing what God exposes to the table. How about that? We can bring what God exposes to the cross. It'll be standing right here. that would be a good thing let's pray as we're dismissed Father when we have time to think about it we want to live in a light but our instinct makes us hide I pray for those of us who need a Nathan because the light won't come any other way that Nathan's would come. I pray that you would do that. But many of us don't need, it isn't even that we need the big intervention. Some of us have just grown skillful at pulling the shade halfway down and not wanting to look at it all. I pray in the name of Jesus that you would give us the courage to be a people who in our community life together and in those relationships with people we trust would continue to just lift that shade up and live in the light so we can have fellowship with one another and be cleansed by you and to authentically by that live free and clean and full of grace and all God's people said, Amen. Amen.
