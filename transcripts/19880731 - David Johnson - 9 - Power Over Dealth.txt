Would the rest of you open your Bibles with me to the book of Matthew, chapter 9, verse 18? I'm sure most of you are aware that we are in Matthew, have been there for a couple of years now, and have been in Matthew 8 and 9 for quite a while as well. And these two chapters have comprised what we've come to call the healing ministry of Christ and the miracles of Jesus, and it has been a rich study indeed for my heart and for yours as well, I'm sure. I told you from the beginning that there were three sections of three miracles each. There were three miracles and then kind of a response, three miracles and a response. And we are entering into the last section of three miracles. And it is dealing now with resurrection. He has already affirmed the fact that he has authority on earth to move and touch people physically. When he healed the leper and he touched the paralytic and he healed the woman taken of a fever. But he moved past that and he calmed a storm and the disciples were amazed because even the wind and waves obey this guy. This is something special. But not only that, he moved and in the very presence of Jesus, demons were cut at the knees and bowed down and shrieked out and were cast out. And so he exercised and demonstrated authority over the demonic realm. But ultimately, he also demonstrated that he had the authority on earth to forgive sin and heal men's souls and give them back their very identity. But as we come into this last section, it is as if Jesus is putting the period on the end of the exclamation point where he says fundamentally this, I have authority in all of those areas. But the ultimate enemy and the last enemy of man is ultimately this, death. And I want you to know that I have conquered that as well. And with that in mind, let's read our text. As he raises a 12-year-old girl from the dead. And while he was saying these things, verse 18, behold, there came a synagogue official, an elder in the synagogue, a Pharisee. And he bowed down before Jesus, saying, my daughter has just died. I just want to clarify something here in both Mark and Luke. the account is that the daughter was dying not quite dead. Matthew here is kind of bringing the whole thing together because she was in some sense as good as dead but I want you to know that factually she wasn't quite dead this first coming she wasn't quite dead she was dying. Come and lay your hand on her that she will live and be well and Jesus rose and began to follow him and so did his disciples. Quite a gathering we're going to go see something about a healing or a resurrection but something interrupted at verse 20 and behold a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for 12 years, came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak. For she was saying to herself, if I could only touch his garment, I'd get well. I don't want to bother him. I don't want to mess this up. He's very busy. If I could just touch him, I'd be made well. But Jesus didn't let it go unnoticed. And turning and seeing her, he said to her daughter, take courage. Your faith has made you well. And at once the woman was made well. I want to just give a little teaching here too and filling in the blanks. In both Mark and Luke, the issue was this, that when she touched the garment, she was made immediately well. She was made well at that very moment. And Jesus stopped in that very same way and said, your faith has made you well. And when Jesus came into the official's house and saw the flute players and the crowd, and now we're back on the road to healing this little girl, and she is dead now, the crowd was noisy and it was disorderly, and he began to say to that crowd of people in the house, depart, for the girl hasn't died but is just asleep. And they began to laugh at him and scorn him. But when the crowd had been put out, he entered and took her by the hand, and the little girl arose, and the news of this went out into all the land. Let's pray as we begin. Father, I pray in Jesus' name that your spirit would come and give life to this as well. Father, we're going to hear facts and stories and things that are good to know. But, Father, we come to this point every single Sunday realizing that unless the power of your Spirit is released, there is no real work. And we ask that the kingdom would come to our hearts and to this place, fill this place with your presence and your power and your truth as we see even deeper who you are. In Jesus' name, amen. This morning as we come and consider these two miracles, one thing on my heart that I would give to you is this I would have you this morning see Jesus and I would have you see Jesus two ways and it's a way that we have been able to see him all the way through this section on the miracles the first way I want you to have him fixed in your mind's eye is that of Jesus my king who is the gentle healer and I want you to see him gently touching the leper and compassionately moving to that woman with the fever and in a caring way moving to that paralytic who was dropped through the ceiling on a cot and touching him and saying, Brother, you need to know the best thing is this. Your sins are forgiven. And you need to also see in your mind's eye this gentle healer coming to the house of a synagogue official, a 12-year-old girl, taking her by the hand and saying, Little girl, arise, the gentle healer. But there's something else I want you to see about Jesus as we consider him this morning. And that is this, not only seeing Jesus this morning as a gentle healer, but I want you to have firmly fixed in your mind Jesus is the warrior king. Now, when I say it that way, it almost sounds like a contradiction. How can you be gentle and tender and a warrior king, militant and almost angry at the same time? The way that works is this. One of the key verses we've been dealing with all the way through this section is this, that in relation to healing, Jesus is bringing into the Satan-defiled world the healing that he came to bring to undo the work of the enemy. 1 John 3, 8 is the verse, The Son of God has made Himself manifest for this purpose, in order that He might destroy the works of Satan. And when He is gently and caringly putting His hand on the leper, and the paralytic, and the woman with fever, and the man in sin, and now this little 12-year-old girl who is dead, He is gently doing that. But every one of those acts of tenderness and gentleness is also an incredible explosion in the kingdom realm, in the spirit realm, against the enemy. I have come to destroy what you have destroyed. I have come to destroy sickness and disease and pain and hurt and sin. And now I have come to destroy and wage a war against death. I am come that you might have life. The enemy comes to steal and kill and destroy. John 10.10, Jesus said those words, but I am come that you might have life. And everything I touch comes to life. Everything I touch. He is the gentle healer. He is the warrior king who destroys even death. Hebrews 2.14 says that very thing. Catch the heart of this. And Jesus came into this world in order that through his death and resurrection, he might render powerless him who had the power over death, that is the devil, and that he might deliver those of us who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives. So he reaches out to this little 12-year-old girl, raises her from the dead, an act of compassion and gentleness, but ultimately it is the act of a warrior king. I have come to kill death. That's our king. I would have you see Jesus this morning. and I would have you see him in two miracles one is the raising of the dead and the other is a miracle that I want to set up in your mind as almost a bother in the middle of the multitude Jairus and his people come to Jesus and says my daughter is dead or dying and I want you to come and raise him from the dead and boy what could be more important than that and right in the middle of that on purpose is stuck a woman who is bleeding get out of my way we're doing a resurrection right in the middle of that there is something about who Jesus is. I would have you see Jesus in that miracle too. Let's look at the first miracle first. First of all, the fact of it. While he was saying these things to them, stop right there. Just want to fill in the blanks for you just a little bit. While he was saying what things? Well, if we were to just kind of stick with the context here, we would get the impression that he was still just talking to the disciples of John, which was our text last week in verse 14. But again, Mark and Luke help us a lot, because those are the synoptics, and there's parallel passages. And what we discover from Mark and Luke is just this simple thing, that after he talked to the disciples of John, he began to move from city to city, and the word of him began to spread. And everywhere he went, there was a great crowd of people. And I want you to know in your mind, that's on TV, you know that? I want you to have in your mind's eye the fact that there was a great multitude of people around him when this happened. That is significant. And they're pushing and shoving, and they're trying to get closer, and they just want to get a glimpse and figure this guy out. And then it says this. While he was doing these things, behold, there came a synagogue official. There's that very significant word again, behold. And whenever that thing pops up, what that means is basically this. Something startling is happening, something shocking, and something out of the ordinary. What is it in this text that warrants a behold? Well, what warrants a behold here is that an official from the synagogue came. These are the guys who are at war with Jesus. These guys aren't supposed to come. We, so far, are used to lepers coming and the wretched refuse coming and loony bins coming, lunatics coming, demon-possessed guys cutting themselves with knives. Yeah, those are the kind of people. I can picture that now. I got that in my mind. But this guy's an official from the synagogue. In fact, Luke indicates that he is not just an official from the synagogue, but he is Rosh HaKoniseth. He is a chief elder in the synagogue. Elders would do in the synagogue what you would imagine an elder to do. In the church, he would be a spiritual leader. They would run the affairs. They would be the protectors of the faith. A chief elder would be what you would expect a chief elder to be, the top dog. And if anybody would be having responsibility to protect the faith, maintain the tradition and the system, it would be this guy. For this guy, in this position, to break through the crowd, fall flat on his face in front of Jesus, warrants a behold. it was shocking think if you will a minute you know so we hear these Bible stories and we go okay okay you can't read them as facts but if you were in that position wouldn't you think that even if he did think that Jesus held out some slight hope for his daughter that knowing his position he would at least send a messenger he could have done that couldn't he I mean he had a position to send a messenger I tell you what go tell this Jesus guy that my daughter's dying and she may be dead and tell him I'll meet him on the southwest corner of Capernaum up the stairs in that dark corner where nobody will see us and we're going to have a little meeting and I'll buy him dinner, okay? Tell him that. The message of Matthew from the beginning has been who comes to Jesus? The broken, the hungry, the mourning. And the message also has been the only ones who ever really get into the kingdom are the broken, the hungry, the mourning. And you know what I know about men and women who are desperate and they're losing their daughters? and they're about to die or they're dead. They don't have time for the clandestine plan. They don't have time to do it right. They don't have time to make sure their pride is protected. They don't have time to make sure all the bases are covered. They run to Jesus. There's a picture here we need to see. Because we have seen this picture before of a large crowd. We've seen that picture before. Close your eyes and get it. You don't have to do that if you want, but I want you to get this picture. We've seen a large crowd before, and we've seen people pushing and shoving to get closer to Jesus, and we've also seen a picture of a man breaking through the crowd, not caring what anybody thought anymore, even though he was ostracized, not caring he was going to break through, not caring what they thought, and fall at the feet of Jesus. And it was exactly the same dynamic, only it was a totally different person. You remember who did that? It was the leper. Same thing. Only the leopard was smelly and dirty, and nobody wanted to have anything to do with him, and nobody wanted to touch him. And this guy was well-born and wealthy and well-respected, and he had a long flowing robe, I'm sure. Nothing in common but one thing. Both of them were desperate, broken, hungry. Jesus, you are my only hope. The high-born, the low-born. We had the high-born over here, didn't we? The high-born and the low-born, the rich and the poor, find themselves at the feet of Jesus in the same place, Desperate, hungry, mourning, broken. They're the only ones who get into the kingdom. That's the common denominator. I think it's significant that we take time to look at that picture. My little girl is dying, my only hope is you. As we've gone through this passage from Matthew 5, really, it began in the Beatitudes, this brokenness concept that has continued to flow. I think many of us have been able to get, because the people who've come to Jesus have been this way, we've gotten possibly a real stilted view of who's coming into the kingdom and who's part of the kingdom. Because the only ones who have come to Jesus are what I call the wretched refuse. They are the lepers, they are the slaves, they are the lunatics, the cripples, and the publicans and sinners. And now we've got a big shot. And some people might even react to the big shot coming going, at least there's going to be somebody here with class, you know. But the picture you need to see again, and I've already said it, I just want it driven into your spirits, is this. the big shot and the little shot, come the same way, broken, desperate. My only hope is you. You're in the kingdom. And you're going to know the power of the kingdom. Verse 23. We're going to skip over this irritating interruption and come to verse 23. And when Jesus came into the official's house, now he's at Jairus' house. That's the guy's name, by the way. And he saw the flute players and the crowd and the noisy disorder. He began to say to them, depart. Get out of here. Let me tell you some things about funerals in those days. Funerals in our days, in our day, funerals are very quiet. One of the ways I show respect in a funeral is do something that goes totally against my nature, is be very quiet. It's very hard for me to do that. It's hard for you to do that. The last thing you want to do at a funeral is, in some embarrassing way, knock something over or draw attention to yourself. One of the ways that I convey concern is to be quiet. In those days, it was totally the opposite. In fact, in these days, when we see films of people in the Middle East and coffins are being carried through the streets, Everybody's making all sorts of noise. That's what was going on there. There were three things you would always find at a funeral. Number one, people would rip their clothes. Now, you might think that that was just something they did by impulse. There were 39 rules as to how to rip your clothes. It was important. One of the things you had to do is you had to stand when you ripped your clothes. You had to rip a hole over your heart. The hole that you ripped over your heart had to be big enough to put a fist through it. You couldn't stitch it up at all for seven days. It had to be open completely. After seven days, you could stitch it up, but you couldn't stitch it up very well. It had to kind of be sloppy so that people would be able to look at you and see that you're still grieving. Women had to do the very same thing. They were, however, allowed to wear their shirts backwards after they ripped a hole in it, for obvious reasons. We won't get into that. The second thing, the second thing after they ripped their clothes, was they had whaling women. Whaling women. They were professional. They were hired to come and do it. Now, what these whaling women did was they got the whole family history. All the people who had died previously, within the last couple of years, they would bring all of their names up, and then they would mourn over them and over the other one, too. And they would start coming, oh, you know, last year it was Charlie, and then just a little while ago it was Martha, and now Harry, oh, man. On and on and on, like that. They were real uppers to have around. It was really neat to have those people around. The third group of people would be musicians, and specifically flutists. Now, you need to know something, that in the Talmud, it was indicated that even if you were poor, you could have no less than one wailing woman, two fluting flutists, and a partridge in a pear tree. So that's all I don't know. I'm sorry. So all this chaos is going on, and Jesus sees the noisy disorder and says, Get out of here, you guys, because the girl has not died, but she is just asleep. And they began laughing at him. Why did he say she was asleep? Maybe she really was, and this really isn't a resurrection. that is not why he said it he said it for this purpose he is a sly old guy and he said it for this reason to get from their mouths the confirmation in front of everybody he's dead and she's dead and if you don't think so you're nuts this laughter was incredible scorn you are a stupid person if you believe she's not dead the funeral had already begun what do you mean she's not dead he just got from them a confirmation that she was and then in verse 25 the crowd left he entered and took the girl by the hand and the girl arose I love what it says in Luke it says this he came to the little girl and he said this telethakuma telethakuma it almost sounds poetic it means simply this little girl arise he touched her by the hand and said telethakuma little girl arise and she did and verse 55 of Luke 8 says and her spirit returned to her again why? because she was dead D.L. Moody tells the story of the very first funeral that he had as a young preacher. And when he was confronted with this very hard situation, being a young man and never doing this before, maybe being at a few, but at a young age, not even being at many, he was searching the scriptures for an appropriate passage of scripture to use. And what he did was he began to look for funerals that Jesus had gone to so he could maybe say the same kinds of words of comfort that our comforter would bring. But the problem was this. Every funeral he discovered that Jesus went to, he broke it up. He was a funeral basher. And he would come into funeral situations where everybody was moaning and groaning and wailing and making all sorts of noise, and some of them not even really cared at all about the people, and he would go to the people mourning and he would say, you guys get out, and you get up. I would have you see Jesus this morning who in the spirit realm we hear this truth and the enemy has come to steal and kill and destroy but I am come that you might have life to let the kuma little girl to let the kuma little girl that's what I came to do and I touch lepers and I touch people with fever and I touch storms and I touch sin and I touch death and I bring life to it that's who I am, that's what I do. There's a message in this miracle that we need to hear. There are several, as a matter of fact. The first message is this. I already gave it to you. I am come that you might have what? Life. There's another message here. I am here to render powerless him who had power over death. Talitha Kuma. That's a message. I am rendering you dead. Death. And bringing this girl to life. There's something else here you want to see too, though. It's a picture. Because this little picture of resurrection is a preview of kingdom reality. When you see this little girl raised from the dead, it is a preview. And by the way, all of this stuff is. Everything he's doing is a preview of the kingdom to come in its fullness. Now we believe, and we've been teaching here, the kingdom has come. It is here. And healing is here today. And redemption is here today. Forgiveness of sin is here today. But also, we have been teaching that the kingdom in its fullness is yet to come. And in the meantime, we are in incredible warfare against the enemy, and our mission is to bring the kingdom and its power to this earth. But everything he does that says is now is also future. And when he heals the leper, he says, in the kingdom there will be no disease. And when he forgives the sin, he says this, in the kingdom there will be no sin. And when he casts out demons, he is saying this, in the kingdom there will be no demons, the ultimate kingdom. And he's also saying this, in the kingdom you need to know there will be no death. Nothing but life in the ultimate kingdom when we all come and the redeemed come for that great celebration of the Lamb. But there's another picture here as well, and that is this. When I give you a picture of this little girl, I'm giving you a preview of my resurrection as well. As she rises, so will I, because I am the resurrection and the life. But the glory of that picture, as I kind of bring you through this whole progression, is that you know what his resurrection is a preview of? My resurrection. Because he will live, so will I. I want to bring you back to a study we did almost two years ago in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 where the resurrected Christ, you may remember, in verse 20 was referred to as the first fruits of those who sleep. Who is this Jesus, this resurrected Christ? He is the first fruits of those who sleep. And that means absolutely nothing to us until we go back to Leviticus and find out what the first fruits concept meant. Leviticus chapter 23, verses 10 and 11 was speaking of the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread. And that was the feast of the first fruits. And what happened was the Jews in that area would bring in the first fruits of their harvest to the priest. And it would be given to him as a sacrifice. That was a scary thing to do, however. Because in that day, what they would do with their plants, they would bring all of the... I always have problems with farm stuff. I'm from Chicago. I don't know anything about it. They would sow the seeds. You know, they'd do that and then it would grow. They would stagger how they planted, however. Because they didn't have the machinery we have today and they couldn't get to it fast enough. So they would plant and let it grow a little bit, then plant, so that when they harvested, they could harvest this, and this wouldn't rot while they were doing this. By the time they got done with this, this would be ready, and then the next would be ready like that. That's why the firstfruits was scary to give. You know why? Because when I'm harvesting all this firstfruit and then giving it to the priest, I'm giving away all I've got, and I'm not sure that's going to come through. But what the priest did was this. They would take the grain of the firstfruits that they got, and then they would mill it, And then they would begin to put it all together and bake bread. And they baked bread day and night during this time. And all through the community and all through the land, the smell of this baking bread would go. And it would be the smell of the first fruits. And that smell in the nose, every time those farmers would wake up in the morning, would be this. That smell in the nose would remind me of this, that the first fruits came through and God provided. And when I smell that bread baking, that's a reminder that these fruits are going to come too. The harvest will come. I can have confidence that it will be there. And when Jesus is called the first fruits of those who sleep, you know what it means? It means this, that Jesus Christ, in power and glory, one day raised from the dead. And every time you contemplate the resurrection of your king, every time you remember the fact that Jesus is not dead, but he is alive, what it does is it sticks a smell in the nose of those who are redeemed. And the smell in the nose is simply this. He is the first fruits. I smell it every time I think of the resurrection. And every time I think of the resurrection, it reminds me that so will I rise again too. When we celebrate the resurrection at Easter, I remember telling you this. Our worship is not just a matter of going, way to go, God, he rose from the dead. Up from the grave he rose. I'm so happy he did. That is part of it. I celebrate that. But every time I sing those songs, I get fired up about the resurrection. It needs to put a smell in my nose that because he did, so will I. Talitha Kuma, little girl, rise up. That is a picture of his resurrection. His resurrection is a picture of mine. I would have you see Jesus today. Acts chapter 5, verse 31 calls the resurrected Christ our Prince and Savior. We went over this too. He's called our Prince. That word Prince is Archegos. Remember that? That means pioneer or forerunner. He is our Archegos. I told you the illustration. I'm going to tell you again. It's wonderful. I love this. Sailors on boats had an Archegos. He was the best swimmer on the boat. And the way they would use him would be this. in times when they couldn't get close enough to the shore because of choppy waters that would spell death for the boat and all on it. They would tie a rope around the archegos, the pioneer, the forerunner, the best swimmer. He would jump into the water of death, literally, these treacherous waters, by himself and swim through those waters, climb onto the shore of the other side, turn around and say, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, I made it, you can't. No, he wouldn't. He would take the rope, he would move onto the shore, tie it around a tree, and his moving through the water and enabled everybody else to come because they'd hold on to the rope and pull themselves through. Jesus, the resurrected Jesus, is called our Prince and Savior. He is our Archegos who did this. He went through the waters of death. He not only went through the waters of death, but he came out the other side, turned around and looked at the broken, hungry morning who were coming to him in faith and said this, because I made it, so will you. I would have you see Jesus when he says, Talitha Kuma, little girl. I would have you see his tenderness and his care. I care about you. I came to give life, but I came to give life everlasting. Her resurrection is a picture of mine, and mine is a picture of yours. Satan came to steal and kill and destroy, and I am coming that you might have life. But another miracle happened that day. Feels like an interruption. Verse 19, Jesus rose and began to follow him. This is urgent. This is important. Somebody's dying. We've got to get there fast. Let's say she already has died. Even in that case, she's dead. She needs to be resurrected. This is ultimate. And this woman who has a legitimate need can wait, don't you think? But behold, a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage 12 years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak. For she was saying to herself, I really don't want to be seen. If I could just touch his garment, I know I'd get well. I want you to look at Luke 8 and just see the same account. I haven't been doing this with you. They have you look at it. I've just kind of been telling you about it. I want you to look at it. Luke 8, 43. And a woman who had a hemorrhage for 12 years and could not be healed by anyone. A little note here, couldn't be healed by anyone. That's what Luke said. Mark said, and a woman who had a hemorrhage for 12 years had gone to several doctors, and the doctors made them worse. Luke didn't tell you that, and Luke's a doctor, that's why. Verse 44, she came up behind him, and I think it's extremely important that we catch this thing. She didn't want to be seen. She didn't want to interrupt. She knew it was important, and she felt herself insignificant. And she touched the fringe of his cloak, and immediately her hemorrhage stopped. It says here that as soon as she touched the garment, the hemorrhage stopped. And Jesus said, who is this one who touched me? and everybody was denying it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. On one hand saying, we're not going to interrupt this thing. This is so important. Don't, no, no, no, no, not me. But on the other hand, they were saying, listen, what are you, nuts? Jesus, everybody touched you. The multitudes are crowding and pressing on you. What do you mean who touched you? Everybody touched you. And Jesus said, someone did touch me for I was aware that power has gone out from me. And when the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she wanted to, she came trembling and fell down before him and declared in the presence of all the people, the reason why she had touched him and how she had been immediately healed. And then he says, your faith has made you well in verse 48. I'm going to get back to that. I'm going to tell you about the disease just a little bit. The problem that she had was one that was common among people in Palestine. And there was no real legitimate cure. They had astringents and little ointments that they would give people, but it really didn't help at all. There was a lot of superstition that came around this kind of disease, and they had little mumbo-jumbo things that they would do. I don't have time to go into all of that. Today, this kind of problem would be diagnosed possibly as something like a carcinoma, but that was clearly not what she had because that would have killed her. She had this for 12 years. Probably what she had was a fibroid tumor of the womb, and it would surgically be repaired today. But in those days, they were not repairable. And she would not only have to deal with the humiliation of that perpetual problem, but like other diseases that we've talked about before in that culture, it always had some sort of spiritual significance. And this woman was considered by all around her as being perpetually unclean. In Leviticus chapter 15, verse 25, every bed she laid on was unclean. Every chair she sat in was unclean. All the clothes she wore were unclean. Every person who touched her was unclean. She was forbidden to be in the temple while this problem was going on. She was excommunicated from the congregation. She was given advice from her rabbi to divorce her. Her husband was given advice from his rabbi to divorce her. She was divorced. And people had ostracized her totally for 12 years. And that's why she gets a behold too. Behold, in the middle of all this wonderful stuff, a woman comes. And just a couple things. When he comes, she came and touched him. he saw her. Believe me, as I said before, she didn't want to be seen. The second thing was he knew her. Daughter, daughter, he looked at her eye to eye and then he healed her. Some messages I want us to hear in this. Again, use your imagination here and see the crowd. They're all around. They're pushing. They're shoving. They're trying to get to Jesus and they're on a mission that is incredibly important. It doesn't get any more important than this. We're going to raise somebody from the dead. This is good stuff. Whoa. And then all of a sudden, somebody touches him and power is released and he stops. But again, you've got to remember even the disciples' reaction. What do you mean who touched you? Everybody touched you, but this woman touched and he noticed. There's a truth I want you to get here. Message in a miracle, and it's this. That Jesus can always tell the difference between the clamor of the fickle crowd and the reaching of a ready heart. He can always tell the difference between all the people and all the noise. And he can always tell the difference between that and someone who's ready and saying, I need help. It's almost like this equation that I see in my mind's eye here that is illustrated for us and we need to see it. It's this. Almost without Jesus' consciousness, whenever and wherever brokenness, mourning, desperation, and faith intersect with the Jesus that we know and all of those things, brokenness, mourning, and faith, intersect with the healing desire of Jesus, the life-giving power of Jesus. Every time those two things come in contact, almost without volition, power is released like that. It just happens. I think it's significant. There's a picture here, a kingdom picture here, we need to see, that Jesus didn't notice until he felt it, that indicates when brokenness comes in contact, real, genuine faith brokenness, I got to have you, Jesus' heart is always, boom, it's there, the healing power is there every time. Something else I want you to see in that is this, his healing goes beyond the physical, his healing goes beyond the physical. I gave you a little taste of that in Luke, without knowing you were getting it, you got it. Remember in Luke it said that as soon as she touched the hem of his garment, she was healed. And then they turned around and had this interchange, and then Jesus said to her, your faith has made you well. And so obviously we're talking about the fact that the fact that you reached out in faith, what made you physically well was that you had faith. That is not what is being said there, and I want to just give you a little teaching here. The word well there, and the faith has made you well, even in chapter 9 in verse 22 that we're in, your faith has made you well. The word well there is not the Greek word for physical healing. The Greek word for physical healing, your faith has made you physically well, is aiaomai. That is not the word here. The word here is sozo. You have already been physically healed. When you touched the garment, you were physically healed. You have been more than that. You have been sozo. You have been redeemed. You have been saved. You have been internally healed. Do you know what we know about her healing that she needed? She needed the issue of blood healed, but she also had an incredible problem with shame, an incredible problem with feeling like I have no value and worth. I'm going to come in the back door. I don't want to bother anybody. I'll just touch the garment and get out of here. He stopped the whole show, looked her right in the eye and said, Daughter, you have been made more than physically well. You have been made sozo. I'm going to make you well on the inside out. By the way, so you know I'm not playing with that word. I want you to know that word is used in other places exactly the same way. Remember the story of the ten lepers came to Jesus, and he says, you will be healed as you go. And as they went, every one of them were healed. You also remember, if you know that story, that one of them, only one of them, came back to thank Jesus and worship him. All the others went on and had a little party. One came back and said to Jesus, I adore you and I love you and I recognize you as my king. And Jesus said to him, You need to know, son, that your faith has made you well. And the Greek word there was sozo. You have been made whole from the inside. All ten of you got physically healed. You got internally healed, redeemed, saved, soul healed from the inside out. Jesus did more for this woman than stopped the blood. He healed her heart. Daughter, you belong. You are clean. Everybody thought you were unclean for all this time. I'm here to tell the world you're clean. I will touch you. there's another message here that I think is real important to catch and that is with all the clamor and all the importance of a resurrection going to a resurrection again nothing's more important than that and the clamor of all of that stuff this woman found that she could still have access that Jesus was still available and he was still touchable she reaches she touches the power is released the whole thing stops i want you to get a freeze frame again on this whole thing in my mind's eye what i see is just that i kind of in my mind's eye i hear the crowd going what's going on what's that lady doing on and on and on complaining grumbling we're going to stop the show we're on to do something really important and he's looking at this woman and everybody around them, in my mind's eye, is a blur. The only thing that's focused is Jesus and this woman. You got it? The crowd is still there. The noise is still there. Pushes, shoves, stares. It's just Jesus and her eye to eye. Daughter, take courage. Verse 22, your faith has made you well. Sozo. There's a couple things we need to see in that. This one is just so practical for how we relate to each other even. Just a simple thing. How you even relate to your children. I don't want to even make a big thing out of this, but I just want to give it to you. You know that the crowd is always going to be clamoring for you. All sorts of needs. All sorts of people. I want this. I need that, I need that, I need that. All over the place. And you know that you are involved in so many important things. Some of you are saving the world. I'm so glad. Some of you are doing, you're off to a resurrection. and some of us are so off in the grandiose and the big stuff and the resurrection that we don't have the time for the individual for the person who is there just a word don't let the clamor of the crowd squeeze out the people who you're with and by the way that's not a call even to make sure everybody in the crowd is made well because a lot of people are clamoring for you you hear that The whole crowd's going, blah, blah, blah, what about us? He got one. He got one. And he looked him right in the eye. He was with who he was with. That's another thing you need to get. How many times are you with people and you're never with them? See, I'm with you and I'm sitting here and we're in the car, but I'm thinking about this resurrection. I've got a job to do. Good for you. I think of this even for me in relation to my kids. So important are we. Can a kid crawl up on you? Could a bleeding woman come and say, I need help? See? Matthew 19, we get the same picture with all this important stuff going on. Oh boy, this is good. And a little child comes in and Peter goes, get out of here, this is important. And Jesus says, don't you do that. Let that kid come. He was with who he was with, eye to eye. There's something else here that speaks to access and availability and touchability, and that is this. And I leave you with this just quickly. You need to get a picture of our king who on one hand does indeed deal in the grandiose. And I don't mean grandiose in a negative sense. He is life, and he brings life, and he is a resurrector. The function, he functions in the ultimate arena of life and death. He is risen. Because he is risen, so will I. He has defeated death. But what we need to know with this little interruption and being stuck right in the middle of this ultimate miracle is a message, a communication from the heart of God himself where he says this, while I do function in the ultimate arena of actually raising people from the dead, what I want you to also know in this miracle is that I have got a heart for and I've got time to stop the bleeding too. Does anybody here need to know that? See, Dave, I'm sitting here and I do love Jesus. And when you talk about being risen from the dead and the smell in the nose, I'm so discouraged sometimes that I just, just the smell in the nose of His resurrection that I will too someday, that's the only thing I've got to keep me going. But I've got to tell you the truth, Dave. See, I'm not dead. I'm not dead, but I am bleeding. And I am encouraged by the resurrection and that does help me a lot. And I know it's so important that I don't think, I'm not going to bother him because I'm just bleeding. I'm not dead. You need to hear in this miracle, on purpose, right in the middle of a resurrection, he healed a bleeding person, a bleeding woman, which says, I do do the ultimate. I do raise people from the dead. I will raise you from the dead. But you need to know too, from the heart of God, I can stop the bleeding too, today. I would have you see Jesus, your gentle healer, who in all that gentleness and touching and healing is at war with the enemy who is trying to destroy your life and destroy my life and destroy this community and destroy this nation and destroy South Africa. But the gentle healer has come that we might have life. Talitha Kuma, little girl, rise. Daughter, your faith has made you well. I'm going to stop the bleeding too. Jesus our general healer has come to give us life Dan and a group of people are going to come and sing in a moment a song that I am so excited they're singing so appropriate for this a general healer came into our town today and you listen to the words and let it minister to you and reaffirm the things that you've heard here and also let it give you the courage to realize that his gentle healer is here right now. And some of you, what dawns on me, is some of you do need, not just to stop the bleeding, but some of you need a resurrection. What do you mean by that? What I mean by that is some of you have a heart and you love Jesus, okay? I'm going to talk to believers for a second. You do love Jesus, but your heart has grown so cold and not because you wanted it to. You've gotten beat up. You've gotten wounded. You've been hurt. And your heart has grown so dry that if you were to describe it, you'd say it's just dead. And I need a touch because I can't crank it out anymore. I can't make my heart come alive. And I want to just be able to sing worship songs like we did a little bit ago and not feel dry. Do you think the gentle healer could say to me, to Letha Kuma, little girl, little heart arise, come alive. Yes. but some of you are in a condition that's more severe than that and that is that you're not among the redeemed at all and that spiritually you need a resurrection the word of God says in Ephesians chapter 2 we were dead in our transgressions and in our sins we didn't just have sin that needed to be forgiven we are dead people without Christ who need a resurrection spiritually and I would like to think that the spirit of God is moving among some people right now for a literal spiritual resurrection today. You walked in that door dead spiritually, and you can walk out alive. Talitha Kuma, little girl, arise. But there are some people here who aren't dead in any sense. But you are bleeding, and we talk about ultimate things like resurrection and salvation, and you kind of think, Oh, what is my little thing? It's so insignificant. I'm just bleeding. I'm not dead. You need to know today that Jesus, our King, who we have seen today, does raise people from the dead. He deals in the ultimate area of power and truth, but He can stop the bleeding too. Let that truth minister to you. Thank you.
