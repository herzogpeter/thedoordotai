Today, we're going to finish up talking about the inspiration of Scripture, and we're going to then move on to the doctrine of God. Are there any questions about last week? Everyone say hello to the Tay people. One, two, three. Hello, Tay people. There. Now, do you feel wanted and loved? We do love you. Boy, I can almost see you in my mind. I'm going to tangle up here. Okay. Questions from last week. We've had a week to chew on it, a week to think about it. everything's resolved everything's perfectly clear you're all saved okay review we talked about the importance of the doctrine of inspiration needing an authority that is over our minds instead of our minds being over the authority we talked a little bit about reasons to believe in the inspiration of scripture we talked about why don't I put this up on the overhead the Christian experience of inspiration Jesus is teaching on inspiration ultimately it's very difficult i think impossible to confess jesus christ as lord consistently and yet reject his teaching on scripture and he expressed a total absolute trust in scripture and that should be our attitude as well fulfilled prophecy hello late comers fulfilled prophecy is another reason uh that validates the inspiration of scripture the unity of the biblical message in the midst of a wide variety of cultural and historical circumstances. And then there's another attestation to the united authorship behind Scripture, that it was divinely inspired. And finally, the historical accuracy of the Bible. We talked about the nature of inspiration, and I gave you different views on that. And I tried to argue that, again, our attitude towards Scripture should be that of Jesus's, that the Bible is inerrant. And finally, we went over, and I just want to review this real briefly, four ways that, four means by which we can ascertain or try to ascertain what is eternal and permanent, what is the eternal and permanent teaching of Scripture, and what is this cultural adaptation. When do you know that an aspect of the Bible is simply for that culture at that time, and when do you know that it's a teaching that is relevant for today? and I went through these criteria. The first one has to be, what is the core of the scripture and what is peripheral? Is this a central ingredient into the salvation story, into the whole scheme, the whole central message of scripture or is it something peripheral? So for a person to deny the deity of Christ is certainly quite different than to say that we shouldn't greet each other with a holy kiss. though both are taught in Scripture. One clearly is on the periphery of what Scripture is all about. The other one is right smack dab in the middle of what Scripture is all about. What is inherently moral and what is not? You find this distinction sometimes subtly, but you find it in Scripture. So you have Paul repeatedly giving sinless or talking about certain things as being clearly antithetical to the will of God. I'm really having trouble with this cord wrapping around my leg. It's sort of a lively cord. attacking me if I rebuke you. So he lists things like adultery and fornication and homosexuality and drunkenness, etc., as being clearly antithetical to the will of God. There's no exception to those. There are other things, though, that just smack of being more a cultural thing. Again, greet each other with a holy kiss. That was a custom of the time. It's not a custom of our time. And so while it expressed genuine Christian love in the first century, it might express sexual harassment in ours. So we've got to be a little bit more careful about who we kiss in our day and age than they were back then. Or the drinking of wine. And usually, when Paul's talking about this, there's a good indication in the text itself that he's speaking about something that is particular to a particular situation. You can discern that. So, for example, in Romans chapter 14, when he's talking about should we eat meat that's offered to idols, or should a person drink wine, he says there very explicitly that it depends where you are and what the situation is. Are you around weak brothers or sisters who are going to fall because of your behavior? And if you are, the eternal principle there is don't do things that offend your brothers or sisters. Don't cause another person to stumble. That's the eternal teaching. The particular application in the first century context was eating meat offered to idols and drinking wine. Drinking wine still is an issue for a lot of Christians, but eating meat offered to idols isn't because we don't have a lot of meat that's offered to idols. A third principle, one of the most important, is this. What is uniform and consistent in the Bible and what is not? Many things are taught at different points in biblical history that are just relevant to that time and place. For example, a very clear example is the Old Testament laws, the customs of the Old Testament. Those are things that were applicable just to Israel, given the particular thing that God wanted to do with Israel and through Israel. There are some particular commandments and stuff given to them that are just for that time and place. But they're not taught consistently through the Bible. When something is taught consistently through Scripture, that's a good indication that what is taught is not a cultural matter, but rather is part of the permanent will of God. so for example you have um different views on um you have different views on women's role in the ministry sometimes in the old testament you have women women's leaders even in the new testament you have women deaconesses and things like that but at other times you have paul saying women shouldn't teach what's going on there in my view it depended on the historical circumstances when you were around a place like ephesus which had a lot of female goddesses and a lot of women in pagan roles, and where the general women populace was not very educated. For that particular time and place, Paul says, don't have women teach. But he's not, I don't think, though this is debatable, given an eternal principle there, he's talking about something in a particular context that's relevant there. But you never find any equivocation in the Bible on something like homosexuality or something like drunkenness. That's a permanent teaching that runs throughout Scripture. Okay, people, are you getting this? Good. Finally, what is the principle and what is the application? It's always a good thing to ask in a particular situation. What is the general principle that lies behind a teaching? And what's the particular application of it? And we use 1 Corinthians 11 as an example of that. The general thing that Paul's getting at has to do with decency in church. And in the first century, decency in church, things that wouldn't shock other people, meant women wearing veils when they came to church and behaving in a certain manner. So Paul says, women, you ought to wear veils in church. But the principle there has to do with decency. Don't do things that are against the custom of the time. Don't do things that, as Paul says in 1 Corinthians 11, even the outside world regards as being outlandish, that will destroy the church's reputation. And we have to witness to these people, so don't be doing that. Don't be using your freedom to bring the church into ill repute. Four principles that help us, in most cases, I think, ascertain what is a historical, particular situation in the Bible, and what is eternal. Do you have any questions about any of that? In another class that I teach, called How to Read the Bible for All It's Worth. In fact, we'll be teaching that next semester. We go into that in a lot more detail, but this will have to be. Okay, questions about it? All right. The final thing I want to say about the inspiration of Scripture has to do with how the Bible came to be, and it's just good that you have a little bit of a historical understanding of this process, how the whole thing came to be. There really are three phases, or you can break it down into three phases. as to how the Bible came to be compiled. The first has to do with inspiration. The first thing that happened was the Lord inspired certain people to write what is recorded in Scripture. It was the process of inspiration itself. That process might be, at times, very complex. It wasn't the case, always, that the Lord just sort of inspired a person, all of a sudden kind of took control of their hand, they began to write there is a good indication in scripture that certain segments of scripture were compiled over a long process of history uh they went through various editions called there was redactors that added on to the scripture and and the text we have is really the compilation of a long historical process that doesn't count against any theory of inspiration that just specifies how God inspired the Bible. God is the God of history, and he can use whatever means he wants to bring about the end product. Luke tells us in Luke 1, verses 1-4, to read that he says, that seeing that there are a lot of accounts of Jesus, of what Jesus did, and what the Holy Spirit is doing, and a lot of them are not so good, he saw fit to sit down and, based on his affiliation with eyewitnesses, and based on his research, to compile the most accurate account of the life of Jesus and the life of the early church. He's very up front. He's a historian. He's doing historical research. And so the book of Luke, the gospel of Luke, and the book of Acts are the results of his research. But that doesn't mean it wasn't inspired just because there was human effort that went into it. It just means that the Lord used his human effort to bring about an inspired work. So it can be a sort of complex historical process. Then there was, after the book was inspired, an informal acceptance. This is the second phase of the coming together of the Bible. The book was inspired, and it acquired general recognition among the people of God. People read it, they heard it, and they regarded it as being inspired. They believed what it said. They recognized the authority of God that was there. But it was an informal recognition. That is to say, no one sat down and made an official decree that this is an inspired book. They just recognized it. It was just sort of there. And most of the books of the Bible were circulated for a long period of time informally, and people believing that they were inspired, before anyone ever sat down and collected them all together into the Bible that we have now. So the book was written, and the community of God's people, both in Israel and then later on the church recognized these books as being inspired. The final process was official canonization. The word canon is the Latin word for rule. Rule. And the process of canonization was simply the process of the community of God's people sitting down and saying, okay, what exactly are God's inspired books and which are the fakes? what is true and what is false what are the books that we believe are inspired and what are the books that we that we don't accept as inspired and that was the official process of canonization the books had been recognized for a long period of time but the process of canonization was the process by which they sat down and decided officially which books they were going to make into what we now have as as the bible the canonization of the old testament was completed around the time of Jesus. Actually, it's not known when it was officially canonized. The informal recognition of the inspired books just kind of grew to have an official status. Around 90 B.C. is when that list was finally compiled. And the Old Testament was given to us pretty much as it is, with some problems that we'll talk about shortly. The New Testament was officially canonized around the 4th century, towards the end of the 4th century. That was when the church finally sat down and said, these are the books, and only these books, that we regard to be inspired. Again, the books were regarded. It wasn't that someone said, hey, let's have these books to be inspired in the 4th century. We need some inspired books, what are they? And they went out and tried to find some books. The church had always been seeing these books as being inspired, but it wasn't made official. until the 4th century. We have, just to give you a little bit of background on the New Testament canon, we have different accounts, or we can trace the process of this canonization back to about 140. There was a man named Marcion. And Marcion, what was significant about him was that he was a heretic. He believed that the Old Testament God was the devil, and the New Testament God was the only true God. He also was anti-Semitic, which means he hated Jews. So what he did was he took all the books that were circulating and that the church was regarding as inspired, and he kind of scissored and pasted the parts he liked and put them together. And he cut out all the pieces of the New Testament that made any kind of positive reference to the Jews or any kind of reference to the Old Testament. Because he thought that those were corruptions that crept into the inspired Bible by the devil. So he reduced the whole Bible down to just his little portion of Scripture, And he started his own little church, which believed in just these books of the Bible. That forced the church to come up with a counter-canon, so to speak. There was kind of a general consensus about what was inspired and what wasn't inspired. Until Marcy came along and said, no, only these particular works are inspired. He liked Paul, and he liked Luke, and he got rid of everything else. but even Paul and Luke, he did some editorial work to cut out all the pieces that didn't fit his theology. So he was really a catalyst in forcing the church to decide officially what books they thought were inspired and which books weren't. We have a Muratorian canon, the first known canon, which was written around 170 A.D. And this list includes almost all the books that we have in our present New Testament. it also includes a couple books that we don't have in our New Testament. So it omits some and includes some that aren't there now. But for the most part, it shows that the church, at a very early stage, had recognized the books that we have in our hands as being inspired books. Eusebius draws up a canon in 340 A.D., which is almost identical with the one that we have. And finally, at the Council of Hippo and the Council of Carthage, we have the finalization of the canon that we have today. The only book that was disputed up to this point was the Book of Revelation. And the Council of Carthage only added onto the Council of Hippo the fact that the Book of Revelation was inspired. There was a lot of debate about the Book of Revelation. Some people thought it was inspired, other people thought it wasn't inspired. And that was finally decided at the Council of Hippo. The Eastern Orthodox Church, interestingly enough, never has officially recognized the book of Revelation. Some Eastern Orthodox Christians regard it as being inspired. Other Eastern Orthodox Christians don't, but it's not a part of their official canon. They've never quite agreed with that judgment. There were a couple of other books that were questionable. 2 and 3 John were regarded as being a little bit suspect. They had a little bit of trouble getting into the Bible. 2 Peter was regarded as being suspect, Mainly because the language of 2 Peter sounds a lot different than the language of 1 Peter. And so they wondered, how could Peter write both books? And the answer is that he tells us that he didn't write both books. Suetonius, I forget the name of his secretary, but he dictated the second one to a secretary. And in those days, they were called an amanuosis. They were allowed a lot of free play in terms of how they would phrase things. so peter would dictate the book and uh this this aminousis would write it down and apparently peter gave him or her i'm not even sure of the gender now um quite a bit of free play in how he or she paraphrased peter that's why second peter is actually written with a little bit more of an eloquent style than than than first peter first peter has more of sound of a fisherman second peter doesn't uh the book of hebrews had a little bit of trouble getting in because people weren't sure who wrote it like no one knew who wrote it no one knows today who wrote it but the content was so great and the general recognition was so great that they voted it in. What other books had trouble? James had a little bit of trouble because it seems to disagree with Paul, but it really doesn't. But some people had trouble with that. The book of Jude had a little bit of trouble getting in because it quotes some apocryphal books that aren't inspired and they wondered why inspired work would quote uninspired work. So there was about seven books that had a little bit trouble getting in, that people debated, that didn't have the informal recognition as widespread as these other books, so there's a little bit of debate about them. There's also several books that some people wanted to get in the canon, but weren't in the canon. So the Didache is a real early work that some people thought was inspired, but it finally didn't get in because it wasn't written by an apostle and other reasons. The Shepherd of Hermas was an early work that some thought should be canonized, but it didn't get in. The Epistle of Diognetus. And there are several other works like that. But by and large, with the exception of those seven books and the exception of three or four that some people wanted to be inspired, the New Testament canon was pretty much settled at a very early date. Let me say one final word about, and then I want you to ask questions. This has got to bring about questions. And so this is, be thinking of questions. There's a difference between the Catholic and Protestant Bibles. I don't know if you noticed that, but those of you who have had contact with Catholicism or who were raised in it like I was, have seen this difference. The Catholic Bible has 15 more books than the Protestant Bible. 15. Actually, it depends how you divide it. I think it's 15, isn't it? Or it might be 13. Because some of them combine a couple of works. the Song of Susanna and a couple other ones are compiled into one book. I'm not sure about that. 15 or 13. These are called the Apocrypha. And you may wonder, well, how is it that they have more books to the Bible than we do? The answer is this. In the second stage of inspiration, the process of the community of God's people recognizing these books as being inspired, the apocrypha were books that some people thought were inspired and some people didn't think where it was inspired um and they all have to do with the old testament they were all written before the time of christ when the jews canonized their bible or in the process of canonizing their bible they didn't know what to do with these books because there wasn't widespread consensus about whether they were inspired or not so they put them in the canon but they put them sort of as a second class canon they put them there as being of being very inspiring but not necessarily up to the same caliber as the books that were canonized the early church inherited this this kind of dilemma some of the early church fathers thought that thought the apocrypha was inspired some of the early church fathers thought the apocrypha wasn't inspired and so what the catholic church did was early on they also included them in the canon but sort of on a questionable level good reading yes go to them but they don't have the same kind of authority as the other books of the Bible. The church went along like that for about 1,300 years until the time of Martin Luther. And when Martin Luther broke away from the church in 1517, he had to make a decision. Are these books inspired or not? And the reason why the issue really became hot was because the Catholic Church based some of their views on purgatory on these books. The Catholic view of purgatory was that when you die, most people, except for the very, very holy people, they go to purgatory where their sins are purged from them, their character is refined for a period of time, it was usually thought to be a couple thousand years, until they were ready for heaven, and then they sort of graduated to heaven. And that was a doctrine that Luther didn't think was true, he didn't find it in the Bible at all, he thought you're either saved totally by grace, you go to heaven, or you're not saved by grace, you go to hell, there's no in-between stage. But the Catholic Church quoted second maccabees and a couple other places this apocrypha literature in order to support their doctrine of purgatory as well as a couple of other things so luther then said these books are not inspired and so he officially got them out of the canon the catholic church countered by officially bringing them into the canon okay so what you have is a split here luther says they're not at all inspired and that's a new doctrine because the church always regarded them as being sort of kind of inspired but then the catholic church went to the other direction said no they're all inspired and that's also a new position because up to that point it was kind of an iffy question so that's how the prostitutorial and the catholic bible came to be uh different yes okay the question for people on the tape is uh who decides uh who's right on this issue that's a a very good question. I'll just give you my, yeah, how do you know your Bible is the right Bible? The first thing is that not a whole lot hangs on it. Even if you accept the Apocrypha, it's hard to get a doctrine of purgatory out of it. And there's not too many other things in the Apocrypha that are really heretical. I'm comfortable with the church before the split, which said, hey, they're good reading, but I wouldn't base your salvation on them. So not a whole lot hangs on it. My main reason for rejecting the Apocrypha, though, is this. Jesus quotes almost every book of the Old Testament. There's, I think, one book that he doesn't refer to as explicitly in his ministry as being inspired. He never referred to the Apocrypha. And so it seems to me that Jesus was so enmeshed in the Old Testament and quoted from it so frequently that had he regarded it as being inspired, he would have referred to it. But he didn't. But he does refer to the other books. And that, for me, is a pretty good basis for thinking that the Apocrypha was not supposed to be there. Plus, some of its teachings are, I think, a little bit questionable. There's also a subjective element. If you read the Apocrypha, and I have, maybe this is my bias, but they just don't ring the same way that Scripture rings for me. There's some fanciful stuff there. They don't strike me as being on the same caliber as the scripture that we have. And that maybe is partly my bias, but on the other hand, that's the feeling that most people in the church had up to the split. It's kind of like this isn't the same quality of stuff as the stuff we have in the Bible. So those are the main reasons that I reject it. In terms of who decided that the book should be canonized in the first place, God did. Right, oh yeah, God's always on your side. um but it was you know the book was inspired and then it made an impact in the world it it's it made an impact in in the community of god's people and they immediately recognized it so the process of canonization wasn't the process of giving the bible authority it was the process of recognizing the authority it already had so it wasn't that some people got together and kind of you know threw lots to see who what would get in what wouldn't it was a matter of these people saying you know look at we got people being fed to the lions and they're dying for the truth well we better know what we're dying for uh and and so we better decide you know what really you know what are the books that god's given us and which aren't there's a lot of forgeries out there so it's mainly a process of saying well what in fact have people recognized as being inspired by god they also had other criteria uh and not all the books meet these criteria but some of their working ideas was does the book teach a message that conforms to the rest of what we know to be true in scripture? Does it harmonize? That's why James had a little bit of trouble. It didn't seem to harmonize. That's why the Apocrypha had some trouble. Was it written by an eyewitness? Or was it written by an apostle or someone associated in the inner circle of Jesus, in other words? Was this person in a position to know what he was talking about? The book of Hebrews had trouble for just that reason. Though it had wonderful doctrine, wonderful teaching, it was kind of iffy on who wrote it. But those are some of the criteria that they went by. But that was a good question. Other questions you have? Yes? I have a picture of it. I have something to hang out. First of all, it doesn't seem to say that the Dead Sea Scrolls can't possibly exist. Yeah, because they have to be dead. No, that's wrong. Well, the Dead Sea Scrolls are really one of the most powerful witnesses to the accuracy of the Bible that we have. The Dead Sea Scrolls are some, there's a community called the Essenes in the 2nd and 1st century B.C. that kind of moved out in the desert and they had their own little religious community. And they had copies of the Bible with them. And these are now called the Dead Sea Scrolls. And what they did is they put these scrolls in jars, and that's how they were preserved so well. These were discovered in 1947. Papyri. And papyri can last that long. I mean... Yeah, it was ideal circumstances for the preservation. But your friend has to know that that doesn't affect the inspiration of the Bible at all. I mean, even before the Dead Sea Scrolls existed, you know. Okay, very good question for you people on the tape. As though you're standing on the tape. The question is this. She has a friend who's an agnostic, and he says that he has a Bible that's 150 years old, and he compares it to the modern Bible, and it says two different things. My question would be this. Some of the differences would just be translation. It's saying the same thing, but in different words. Just like our translations basically say the same message, but they say it in different ways. We've got a number of different translations, and all of them have some merits, and all of them have some demerits. You can never translate a language perfectly. You have to rely on idioms. We go into that a lot on the class on how to read the Bible for all it's worth. Talking about the different translations and which one's best. There's also been this difference, though, too. 150 years ago, when the King James Version was riding on the high horse, that was basically the one translation people used, we only had four major manuscripts of the New Testament. And so that translation was based on four different manuscripts. Today we have over 5,000 from discovering ancient manuscripts. What that means is that we can get much closer to the original manuscript than they could in the time of King James. So there are a few verses in the King James Bible which should not be there. A few. 97% of the Bible is absolutely, rest assured, solid based on all the manuscripts we have. We know with 97% accuracy what the original text said. But there are a couple of verses that are questionable. For example, 1 John 5, 7, which says there are three that bear witness in heaven, the Father and the Spirit and the Word or something like that. That verse, we now know, crept into the Bible in the 13th century. It wasn't a part of the original. And so modern translations take that verse out. But the King James Version has it in there. The ending to the book of Mark. We now know that we're not sure how the last eight verses go. We have a couple of different endings. See, these things came in because as the Bible was being translated and being copied, you know, up until very recently, this was all done by hand. And where you've got people copying things, you're going to have mistakes. And so what would happen is that sometimes scribes would miss a verse. Sometimes scribes would, you know, kind of fall asleep. They'd repeat a line. This happened in Romans chapter 8, where it says, There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the Spirit, but after the flesh. And in verse 4, it says the same thing. who walked not after the spirit, but after the flesh. The first walk not after the spirit, but after the flesh shouldn't be there. It doesn't even fit there. It really makes having no condemnation contingent upon or dependent upon how you walk. And it's really an inappropriate verse there. It fits better in verse 4. But we can understand how it got copied when these guys, I mean, how it got screwed up somewhere along the line, probably around the 5th century. A scribe was copying this stuff late at night by the candle, was dozing off and he mistakenly you know when he went back to the thing he recopied the what was supposed to be in verse four up in verse one mistakes like that happen the good thing is through textual criticism we can now begin to we can get a pure more and more pure uh copy or understanding of what what the original really said there are a number there's three percent of the text of the bible have some questions over them all of them are utterly irrelevant utterly irrelevant there's a story in first john chapter five uh one of the weirdest stories in the bible uh if you read the king james version it goes like this there's a pool of bethesda and all these crippled people would come around the pool of bethesda uh in order to get healed and once a year the angel would come down and trouble the water and when the water was troubled the first one to get to the pool would be healed you remember the story now it's kind of cruel when you think about it you know they have all these people who can't walk and and they're sitting on this pool and once in a while god says hey why don't you go down there and you know think about it take a little water and he watches all these crippled people try to get to the water fast and whoever gets there first wins you know and this is some poor sucker was sitting there for 30 years and that's the one that jesus healed he's waiting for the water to be trouble i'm gonna you know come and get it you Well, it's kind of a bizarre story. The original text we now know simply says this. There was a pool of Bethesda, and people would go there to be healed. That's all the text says. And Jesus met a man there who was waiting to be healed. He'd been waiting there for 30 years. The Bible doesn't say whether healing actually took place there. I think it was kind of like, what's that place where a lot of Catholic people go to get healed? What? Lord, yeah. lords whatever it's called yeah lords uh you know there's this fountain and people associate healing there and some of it actually occurs i think more for psychosomatic reasons than for anything else but uh so there's a pool there and people thought they'd get healed by hanging around there jesus comes there and heals the guy doesn't say anything about an angel coming down and troubling the water but we do know that there was a legend about that pool that was circulating that an angel would come down and trouble the water and that's when people get healed probably what happened the best hypothesis is that some scribe wrote in the side an explanation about that event. Namely, there's an angel. The next guy who copied that thought it was part of the original text and put it in there. And after that, everyone copies it. You see? So those things creep in there. Again, you're not going to lose your salvation if you thought that an angel came down and troubled the water. Nothing hangs on it. But there's just some small, small differences between the different texts. It's a really good question. Other questions? This is a good time to ask. What other questions? Does it leave you unsettled at all, or what does it do for you? Where are you at? There are people out there that say that if the Bible wouldn't be in charge of their dad, then they don't have to believe in that. They try explaining to them that this is about human error, and then they just try to throw out the whole thing. Yeah. The point that's being made is that, you know, what do you do with an unbeliever who's going to seize on this 3% error business and say, well, then how can it be the inspired book of God? Muslims take this approach all the time. If you talk to a Muslim, they'll say the Bible can't be inspired because it's got human corruption in it. The ultimate answer would be this, twofold. On the one hand, I'd refer back to your reasons for believing in the Bible. I mean, it's well enough to say, well, I'm not going to believe it because it said an angel touched the water and then it didn't say it. You can go ahead and say that, but you still have to explain who Jesus was and you have to explain his view of the Bible. And until you can explain away his miracles and his resurrection and explain away Jesus being the person he was, you've got your left face faced with an inspired Bible. Talk about the fulfilled prophecies. Talk about the archaeological accuracy. So there's a lot of reasons for believing in the Bible. As to these minimal kind of errors, I think that's just sort of understandable. God's the God of history, and he's not going to let a central part of the biblical message get screwed up. I think what's amazing is that there's been so little corruption. You know, no one today believes that we have a really defunct view of Aristotle's metaphysics. He has some books called The Metaphysics, and we trust that the book that we have is good enough to represent what Aristotle thought about different subjects. But we only have nine manuscripts of The Metaphysics, and none of those nine manuscripts are even within a thousand years of the time Aristotle wrote it. But everyone says, oh, good enough. I mean, that's regarded as being a very secure book historically. With the Bible, we've got over 5,000 manuscripts, and some of them go back. The earliest one we have is the John Ryland's papyri, which goes back to the early 2nd century. It's a copy of the book of John, which is incredibly close to the writing of the event by historical standards. So the Bible is, I'll go on record as saying, the Bible is the best attested work, historical work, that any person has. When you read your Bible, you can be more sure that you're reading the original Bible there than you can be sure of any other ancient historical work that we have. Sure. The question is, considering the fulfilled prophecies, is there any proof that the prophecy was written before the event, not after it? There's tons. I'll give you one example. the prophecy against the city of Tyre that we mentioned last week well even if it was debated whether or not Ezekiel wrote that before the time of Nebuchadnezzar or not he did prophesy that Nebuchadnezzar would come against the city of Tyre he prophesied that about 50 years before it happened so let's grab that 50 years let's say he wrote it right afterwards there are still seven other elements of that prophecy that weren't fulfilled until hundreds of years later and still being fulfilled today No matter when Ezekiel wrote that, it would take divine foreknowledge to know that the city would be pushed into the sea. That didn't happen until 300 years after he wrote that. No one thinks Ezekiel wrote it that late. It would take divine foreknowledge to know that it would be laid flat as a rock, that it would never be rebuilt again. Where you date Ezekiel doesn't matter in terms of those kind of prophecies. But the other thing is that we know from a lot of complex reasons that I can't go into, pretty much when these authors wrote these books. You can nail them down pretty well on the basis of the historical references that they make. And so it's pretty hard and fast data. When I was at the University of Minnesota and I was studying Hebrew, and we were doing some exegesis out of the book of Jeremiah or whatever, and there's some prophecies in the book of Jeremiah, The person who was teaching this class, Professor Reisman, he is an atheist, and we would debate once in a while on that issue. But I asked him, when we started translating these prophecies, I said, how do you think Jeremiah knew that this was going to happen when it didn't happen to hundreds of years after he wrote? And Reisman simply said, well, he claimed it was divine prophecy, and I'm not really in a position to debate that. I said, but you don't believe in divine prophecy. He said, true, but I don't have any other explanation at this point either. So, you know, coming from the mouth of an atheist, that's pretty hard stuff. So those things are pretty certain. Good questions. We can take one more. Any other questions about this whole thing of canonization? All right. Sometimes people get a little upset about the seven books that almost didn't make it in and the book of Revelation not getting in and things like that. And the only word I have for you there is not a whole lot hangs on it. I know a person one time who really had trouble with the book of 2 Peter because it's so judgmental and comes down so hard and it seems like it doesn't fit Paul's doctrine of grace and stuff. And she wished the book hadn't been canonized. And she just didn't see how God could write that. I told her that, as a matter of fact, 2 Peter had trouble getting into the canon. And this person kind of was relieved to hear that. Like, oh, good. That means I don't have to take it seriously. But my response was this. It's okay for you not to get ministered to by the 2nd book of Peter. There are other books of the Bible at different points in my life that don't minister to me the same way that Romans does or Galatians does. And it's okay to have that. But before you decide that a book isn't inspired, say to yourself, realize to yourself that you have a whole history of the Christian church of people who are more spiritual than you, more spiritual than me, who thought it was inspired and it did minister to them. And so it's a little bit presumptuous for me on the basis of my own subjective intuition to dismiss a book of the Bible. I can say it doesn't speak to me, but it's spoken to millions of other Christians, so I'm not going to reject it just because it doesn't speak to me right now. And maybe later on, it will speak to me. You see what I'm saying? It's not a matter of subjective preference. Okay. Okay. Okay. Can I say a word about that? On the one hand, I want to agree with you that there's no room left for inspiration and stuff like that. I don't know if you can get it out of that verse. In the end of the book of Revelation, it says if anyone adds to this book or this revelation, then let them be anathema. Let them be cursed. The trouble is that... Yeah, except that the author, the Bible wasn't compiled at that point. The other thing is that it says the same thing at the end of the Old Testament. So what's good for the goose is good for the gander. and so it's hard to prove that from that one verse. Okay, everything okay? Everything cool? Everyone still, your faith is intact? All right. It's good to know this kind of stuff so that you're not thrown for a loop when people approach you with it. It's good to know just how the book came about. We're going to move on to the doctrine of God. And I first want to talk real briefly about the attributes of God. They're called attributes or the characteristics of God. and I'm going to do this kind of in a general way. And then I want to move on and talk about the Trinity and explain everything there is to know about the Trinity. Ha! Okay. The attributes of God. These are just some of the more general, central characteristics of God that all Christians believe in. And some of it's pretty straightforward. The first one is that God is eternal. In each of these, I'm going to talk about the significance of the belief real briefly, and then I'll talk about whatever issues there are surrounding the belief. The significance of the belief. God is eternal. It means God never has not existed, and God never will cease to exist. God always has been. He's eternal. Think about that for a second, and you'll get brain damaged. If you think about it, how could something always be? You go back, back, back, back, back, back, back. No, he's still there. back farther back farther back farther he's still there always has been it's an incredible concept when you think about it and you think oh everyone knows that i've had students in my class at bethel and i'm sure northwestern has the same problem of uh students who who asked when did god begin god must have began at some point well okay well as soon as you find the beginning of god what's before that you know who brought god god into existence whatever brought god into existence has to be at least as great as God, so we'll call that God then. So it goes on eternally. God always has been. The significance of that, I think, one of the main significance of that belief is simply this. Not everything that exists is transitory, is temporal. Everything that we can see and everything that we can touch, everything we can taste, everything we are is temporal. It's temporary. February.
