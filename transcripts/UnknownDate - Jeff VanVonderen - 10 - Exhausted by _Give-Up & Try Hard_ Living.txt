Now I'm going to talk about the tiredness of give up, try hard Christian living and how, once again, this is still trying to either overcome shame with behaviors or else it's giving in to shame with our behaviors. And I think that both of those places leave us tired and more shamed than when we started. And so I'm going to begin this session by talking about outside sources of shame that people have. I think that all of us have outside sources in our lives, places in our lives, relationships in our lives that send us shaming messages. For some people it was abuse. What abuse says is your needs don't matter, your feelings don't matter, you're little, I'm big, and if you think there's a problem, you're the problem. And so those are all shaming messages, and those of you who have been abused certainly have received those messages. Sexual abuse is a little even more shaming, more complicated, I think, because our sexuality is very close to the essence of who we are, and when that gets violated, you know, it sends a shaming message. Sexual boundaries, safe sex in our culture is where our teenagers are being taught how to be sexual without catching something, basically. And that's not safe sex. Safe sex, in terms of what God thinks, is when two adult married people voluntarily lower their sexual boundary and invite the other person in. And so it's a giving thing, and there's a timing involved in it and things like that. But what sexual abuse does is that it's a person comes up to someone's sexual boundary and basically kicks it down and takes. And then that person isn't allowed to give, and they're not allowed to give in their own time and when it's appropriate for them. And so their boundary has been obliterated, and that's a shaming kind of thing. You're here to meet my needs. Your needs don't matter. and any kind of abuse where the abuser indicates that you're supposed to keep a secret then is really a shaming thing because if I tell you that it's not okay to talk about something, by virtue of telling you that, I'm telling you that this is not an okay thing. Not okay things are the things we can't talk about. And so if someone abuses you and says don't tell, what they're saying is what I'm doing to you isn't okay. And you're so not okay that I can do this not okay thing to you, and it's okay. So it's a shaming kind of message there. Growing up in an addictive family sends shaming messages like we talked about the other night with the fruit that gets splattered into people's lives. It doesn't have to be that severe of a thing for people to be shamed. Shame is so prevalent that it can just be a comment or a look. We talked about how people can shame you with an eyebrow. they can send you a message, you are really stupid, just by raising an eyebrow. The point of this is just to say that we all have places in our lives that send us shaming messages. It's what makes it difficult to remember this stuff when you leave the room. And all of us have these kinds of places. And then the messages that these send to us are what we'll call shame. And the shame messages are, you're defective, you're stupid, you're slow, something's wrong with you, you're bad, you're weak, you're whatever. Shame on you. Something's wrong with you. You're lazy. You're useless. You can't do anything right. You're not as good as this person. Comparing one child to another child says to the first child, I don't accept you, but I would if you performed like the other one. So it's a shaming message. And so these messages are prevalent once again. And I want to say though that some of them are subtle, some of them are sent without a word. Commercials and television ads and billboards don't say you're stupid and you're powerless and you're inadequate, but they kind of insinuate that by promising you that having a certain product can fix that. This car will give you status which insinuates you must not have it right now. These jeans will get you acceptable, which kind of must mean that you're not quite acceptable right now. drinking this liquor will give you significance, which means you must not have a lot of significance right now. So there's a shaming kind of message in this, and I think that we live in a shame-based culture. I think that we live in a shame-based world. I think that Satan is the accuser of the brethren who accuses us day and night. It's his job to indict us and steal from us what is ours because of the cross or attempt to steal. from us. And then, you know, Paul says be transformed by renewing of the mind. So that's what we're going to be talking about from now until the end of today, is our mind and the process that we've gone through in our mind to believe this stuff since we've been bombarded with this and surrounded with this, we accept this, we believe this, and then someone comes along and gives us a different idea and it's hard to believe, it's hard to accept. Part of the process of our mind is what we believe about ourselves and what we believe about what has the power to vindicate us or validate us. And for someone who has shaming messages I call this a shame grid. And a shame grid is simply a way of thinking that I've noticed in people that tends to translate things in a shaming way. In other words, if you've received a lot of shaming messages in your life, you may have a shame grid which is just a way of thinking or it's like a filter that filters information and interprets it in a shaming way even if it wasn't sent in a shaming way. Now certainly things that are sent in a shaming way go right in very easily. So if someone says you're stupid and you already think you're stupid then that lands real easily. But this is even where messages that weren't even intended in a shaming way sometimes get a little bit of a twist, like Dave was talking about, get a twist on it, and they land in a shaming way nevertheless. So for instance, if Jeff and I are having a discussion and I disagree with him on a certain point, what that means is that he thinks one way and I think another way, and the two ways aren't the same way. And that's all it means, you see. But if he has a shame grid, then what he'll hear me saying when I'm really saying I disagree with you, the way he'll receive that is that he must be stupid for having his opinion. Something's wrong with him for thinking that way. So the information gets a little bit of a twist and still lands in a shaming way. If your kids are acting weird in the grocery store, what that means is that your children are making a poor behavior choice in the grocery store. But if you have a shame grid, it lands on you like something's wrong with you. This means a bad thing about you as a parent that your kids are acting this way. If the Lord intervenes in your life and does a really neat thing, the way I'd hear that is that he must not like me as much as he likes you because he did a neat thing for you, not for me. I heard a story about this guy who was on his deathbed, and his wife Lois was there. So he kind of opened his eyes and he saw her there, and he said, you know, Lois, you've always been with me. When I was just a kid, you know, when we were growing up together, and I fell off my tricycle and skinned my knee and hurt my elbows, I looked up, and there you were. And later on, when I was playing high school football, and, you know, I got tackled real hard, and I broke my arm, and they hauled me off to the side, and there you were. And I went off to the Army, and I got wounded when I came back, and they brought me off the ship. there you were and uh you know every time that i've had a problem you've you've been there and and so i just want to say lois you're you're really bad luck and um here here i am here i am dying and you're here again and um see that would be a person this is this would be a lois you know who just loves her husband and loves this person and is always there It's a support, but it gets twisted, you see, and lands in a way that isn't received the way it's sent. And I don't know if that's a real story or not. But anyway, see, I think that it's a struggle to not interpret things in a shaming way. I think it's a struggle. You know, a lot of times in marriage counseling, a lot of the energy that we use in a marriage counseling session that I use as a helper is just trying to help people hear things the way they're sent and not hear them the way they're not sent. Learning to say things straight and hear things straight as well. It's as much of a struggle for me to hear things straight as it is to say them straight on the receiving end. That's a struggle as well. The other part of this mind issue is our will. Our will, what we decide to do. So how we exercise our will. And what I've noticed is this strange but very common phenomenon where people actually decide to live consistent with the messages of shame that they already have because there are some people who, in order to feel okay, need to feel not okay. And I'll show you what that looks like. Let's say that this outside source of shame is a husband that batters his wife. And in doing that abusive behavior toward his wife, the message that he's sending the wife is that something's wrong with you. You're a bad wife. You know, you're defective. You deserve this. As a matter of fact, if you wouldn't have done this, I wouldn't have to treat you in such an abusive way. So I'm not even responsible for the abuse. You're responsible for the abuse. And if you're the wife now, now we're in the mind of the wife, if you're on the receiving end of that, the message is something's wrong with you. And if you believe that, that you really are such a bad wife, and as a matter of fact, you're such a bad wife that you're so bad you deserve to be abused, then how should you feel for being such a bad wife that deserves to be abused? Now, in our economy, if you are this bad person, how should you feel? Bad. Now, bad really isn't a feeling, and so I need to clarify this. I'm going to say bad, but when I say bad, bad is really an adjective. Bad is like a category of feelings. Feelings are happy, sad, embarrassed, jealous, hurt, scared, guilty. Bad is an adjective that describes, you know, if someone says how you feel and you say fine, that's not a feeling. If you say okay, that's not a feeling. If you say lousy, that's not a feeling. Happy, excited, embarrassed, those are feelings. So when I say bad, what I mean is sad, hurt, scared, shame, guilt, those kinds of things. But I don't have to keep listing the list all the time every time I do this. So I'm just going to say bad, okay? If you really are this bad wife, how should you feel for being such a bad wife? You should feel bad. Well, what's the best way for you to feel as bad as you should feel for being such a bad wife that deserves to be abused in the first place? Stay in the abuse, see? If you stay over here in this abusive relationship, then you get to feel as bad as you should feel for being so bad that you deserve to be abused in the first place. And of course, then you get abused again, which says you're bad, right? And you ought to feel bad if you're so bad that you deserve to be abused, and the best way for you to feel that bad is to keep getting abused. Well, let's say that you're the husband that batters the wife. What does that say about you as the husband? Bad husband. Well, how should you feel for being such a bad husband that batters his wife? Bad. Well, what's the best way for you to feel as bad as you should feel for being such a bad husband that batters his wife? Beat her up again. See, if you beat her up again, then you get to feel as bad as you should feel for being such a bad husband that beats up his wife. And so now we have a scenario that I will call self-punishing. Okay? It's self-punishing. And we have a person who, in order to feel okay, needs to feel not okay. Some people don't feel okay when they feel okay. They only feel okay if they feel bad. Now, it's kind of strange, but it's something that I've observed, and it's something that I've even experienced. When I was in college, and maybe I've told you this story, but I'm going to apply it here now, I cheated on a course called Life and Teachings of Jesus, And in that course, I guess I haven't told you that story, huh? And the way I did it was that we had this reading report that was 70 hours of reading for this course. And if you got 70 hours of reading, you got an A on the reading report, which is 30% of the grade. And if you did 60 hours of reading, you got a B. And if you did 50 hours, you got a C. And, of course, I was at a place in my life where grades were a false god for me. like I described the other day, you know, that I got my sense of okayness from what my grade looked like, which means I need to get a good grade if I'm going to be okay. But the problem was I had partied all semester and didn't do any reading, and so now there's a week left in the whole course, and I got 70 hours of reading to do, and I hadn't done any. So what I did was I read a page in one of the books that was assigned, and I timed it and multiplied the amount of pages by the amount of time it took to read one page, and then I had a little bit of time for potty breaks and Oreos and things like that. And then I constructed this whole reading report, you know, and manufactured the whole deal and submitted it and got an A on the reading report and got an A on the grade. And then my instructor took off for the summer on a sabbatical to Germany, and about two weeks into the summer, all these good reasons I gave myself why really this was no big deal and this was okay for me to do kind of just evaporated, and I felt awful and guilty and defective and shamed and awful. But I couldn't even apologize to this guy because he wasn't around. See, so all summer long I just had this apology stuck in my throat and couldn't go anywhere with it because the guy was in Germany. And so I was miserable. And the longer the summer went and the less I was able to talk about this, the worse I felt. So I found out when he got back from Germany, when his flight came into the airport, and I found out about how far away he lived from the airport and how long it took to drive from there. and about figured out the time about when he'd get home. I was like a stalker. I mean, I was like I knew all about this guy's life. Because I couldn't wait. I couldn't wait. And so I called him about when I figured he'd be there. And actually, he had come in just like five minutes before. So I timed it out pretty well. I said, I have to talk to you. And he said, well, I just walked in. I said, I know, but I just have to talk to you. I have to talk to you. he said well I haven't even said hello to my wife my suitcases I'm holding my suitcases I said well when can I talk to you I have to do this and he said well how about tomorrow at 3 o'clock and I said well how about at 2 he said okay so so he says well I'll give you directions I said I already know how to get there so so so I got there too and I walked in I sat down and he said hi how are you doing but he knew why I was there. He already knew why I was there. And the reason he knew is because there are all kinds of people that cheated on that course. That was like one of the most cheated on courses that he ever taught. And he got letters from missionaries in Zanzibar 10 years later who didn't have any converts for 10 years. and they thought it was because he cheated they cheated on life and teachings of Jesus not like Zanzibar's really rocky soil or something but more like God was going to send the country of Zanzibar to hell because they cheated on life and teachings of Jesus which is really kind of a goofy picture of God anyway so I sat there and he sat there and listened to me and I spilled my guts and I told him what I did and how I did it and how bad I felt and all this and when I got all done, he looked at me and he said, you know, thanks a lot. I mean, I really think it's great that you came over here and told me that. And so I said, well, what do you mean? I mean, aren't you going to do anything to me? Because this is terrible, I mean, what I did. And he said, yeah, and I think that it took a lot of courage. I really admire you, you know, for coming over here and looking me in the face and telling me what you did. And I said, well, I mean, this is life and teachings of Jesus, you know. I mean, this isn't some stupid Old Testament course. This is life and teachings of Jesus, you know. The big one, you know. And he said, yeah. And, you know, and so I started to make him a deal. And I said, well, I'll take the course over. You can lower my grades. Or you can flunk me or give me an F or lower the reading report. I started telling him all the stuff I was going to do. And this went on for about two hours. With me trying to make a deal. And at the end of two hours, he lowered my grade. And the way he did that was he gave me an F for the reading report and then factored an F into the total grade and then gave me whatever that grade was. But he did not lower my grade until he knew that I knew that I couldn't pay for what I did. Because, you see, I just needed to pay so bad for what I did in order for me to be okay. See, in order for me to feel okay, I had to feel really lousy, and he kept not letting me feel lousy. You know, he kept affirming me, you know, for all the courage I had and stroking me for coming and looking at him and all this kind of stuff. And see, there is a principle in Scripture that says you reap what you sow. And so he wanted me to experience that principle. If you sow cheating on a reading report, you get an F. Don't be fooled. God is not mocked. You reap what you sow. So if you sow cheating, you get an F. But he did not give me that until he understood, until he believed that I believed that I couldn't pay for my sin because I wanted to pay for my sin so badly because I came from this system that said that's what you had to do. In order to feel okay, you had to feel lousy. The way that you could feel like everything was right now is if you felt so wrong about it. If you could just feel wrong about it, then everything was right. If you could just feel terrible, then you could feel okay. Then you were off the hook. I came from a system that the goal was to make people feel so bad about what they did that they wouldn't do it again. And then they'd leave you alone. And then they'd get off your case, and then everything was okay, and people liked you again, and that kind of stuff. And that's really twisted. The purpose of confession in the New Testament is to get forgiven. So the purpose of confession in where I grew up was to get nailed and made to feel bad and humiliated and terrible, because if you could just feel bad enough, then you could feel okay. Then things were okay. And this is a person now that I'm describing who, in order to feel okay, has to feel not okay. And so they continue to live in the behavior that they don't feel okay about because then they get to feel as bad as they should feel for being such a bad person that does that in the first place. You know, the studies that are out there suggest that there's a very strong connection between sexual abuse and people who struggle with eating issues. And I can't get into that without launching off into a whole different seminar on what that's about. But one of the things it's about is it's a boundary issue, you see, because sexual abuse is that someone comes and obliterates someone's boundaries. And one of the ways that people who have been sexually abused struggle with boundaries is that when they come now in a relationship later on, sometimes they struggle with who to have boundaries with and who not to have boundaries with, and so they don't put up boundaries with people that they should put them up with, and then they keep letting unsafe people come close and hurt them again. And they do put up boundaries with people they wouldn't need them with, and so they keep pushing away people that would be safe to let come close. But another way that I think is a connection is in this eating kind of thing, because people who have been sexually abused who also struggle with overeating could be that one of the things that they do to protect themselves is they create an actual physical boundary between who they are, the safety place between who they are and people who would be coming toward them and the people who under-eat, what that's about is that they are actually shrinking their boundary and it's a slow process of disappearing. Because if you can get small enough and disappear well enough, you won't be noticed and you won't be seen. Both of those behaviors tend to push people away. So let's say that this outside source of shame is sexual abuse in the life of somebody and it happened 10, 15 years ago and this person is dead. They're gone. Or they're just not, they're in Alaska. We don't even know where they are. They're gone. Well, the message, or the shaming message is that the person gets and somewhere in this person's life they overeat, let's say, which would be a very negative behavior for them. But it wouldn't simply just be a poor choice about eating, you see. It wouldn't just say, I made a poor choice. What it would say is that something's wrong with them. So the person creates their own shaming message with their own behavior. In other words, people get so good at doing this that they don't even need outside sources of shame to shame them. They can generate those messages themselves. So what this behavior says is something's wrong with you. You're weak, you're fat, you're lazy, you're undisciplined, you're unspiritual. Something's wrong with you. Well, if you overeat, how should you feel for being such a bad person that overeats? Bad. What's the best way for you to feel as bad as you should feel for being such a bad person that overeats? Eat again, see? So this person now can generate this whole self-punishing thing and doesn't even need this outside place anymore to do it. Well, let's say that you get drunk. What does that say about you? You're bad. How should you feel for being such a bad Christian that gets drunk? Bad. And the best way for you to feel as bad as you should feel for being such a bad Christian that gets drunk is just keep getting drunk. See, what if you don't read your Bible? What does that say about you? Bad Christian. Well, how should you feel for being such a bad Christian that doesn't read their Bible? Bad. What's the best way for you to feel as bad as you should feel for being such a bad Christian that doesn't read their Bible? Just keep not reading it. Because if you keep not reading it, then you get to feel as bad about yourself as you should feel for being a Christian that doesn't read their Bible in the first place. And so some people live their whole lives over here on this side of the deal, generating their own shaming messages. They don't even need the outside source. It's almost like their life is an echo of this other thing. You understand? Their life keeps echoing this other message that they got someplace in their life. So the message is shame, and then their life just, shame, shame, shame, shame, just echoes that over and over again. And they live in a self-punishing kind of mode here. Well, this is very shaming. If you live this way, it's very shaming and very tiring to live this way and very self-punishing. But sometimes this person gets tired of feeling this bad. They look at this and they go, I do not want to feel this way anymore. I hate feeling this way. I don't want to live this way anymore. Or they read a book that says how to not do this anymore, whatever it is. Or they go to a seminar that says 10 steps to get your daily devotions back or 15 Ways to Quit Acting Out Sexually or 3 Ways to Quit Drinking or, you know, whatever. I mean, there's lots. There's no shortage of those kinds of books out there. You know, 5 Ways to Do It Right. And they go, wow, a formula, I can do it. You know, or maybe they have a friend that struggles with the same thing that they struggle with and their friend gets better. And they go, wow, you know, they can do it. And they're a basket case. I can do it too, you know. And it gives them some hope, you know. Or maybe they get so depressed that actually it rests them up. See, whatever else depression does, when you get shut down enough by depression, in the long, in the big picture, it rests you up. And those of you who have struggled with depression know, who go in and out of depression know, that at some point in the depression, it just lifts. Like someone turns the lights on again, or someone opens the blinds and it's like, and you go, wow. I'm back, you know, and you don't know why and you don't know why you got depressed the last time or why you're going to get depressed the next time but you go in and out of it one of the things that depression does if you're too shut down to do anything it rests you up and so now the lights go on and you've got all kinds of energy now to try hard and do it so instead of coming over here and doing the negative thing you come over here and do the positive behavior which, if you're getting drunk what would that be? being sober Well, if you're getting beat up by your husband, what would this be? Leaving or calling the cops or some kind of positive behavior. Or if you're beating up your wife, what would this mean? This would mean not beating her up. So what you do is you just white knuckle it and stuff your feelings and ignore what's going on. We won't deal with all the issues that are underneath the surface that are growing this plant called wife battering. We'll just not grow the plant. and if you're overeating then this would be what? Undereating well I need to tell you that undereating is not the solution to overeating the solution to overeating is eating and all undereating does is it sets up the next overeating that's all it does and the short talk on this is that when you undereat what you're doing is you're depriving your body of what it physiologically needs in order to live. And at some point in that process, your physiological need to eat becomes stronger than your willpower not to. Because God has built us to survive. That's what he's done. And in a culture where there is no food, like on the desert, what people do during times of plenty is they store up food so that when there's a famine, they'll still have food. But what we do is we create false scenarios like that. We do false famines called dieting, okay? And then our physiological need for nourishment gets stronger than our willpower not to eat, and so we start eating like crazy, and part of our eating like crazy is just to save up food for the next famine that's coming down the road, you see? And we get in that cycle, and that is not the solution. The solution is learning how to eat and learning how to eat for the right reasons. but this person, you know, they start starving themselves or they start not eating or getting very careful about their eating as a solution to overeating and if they're undereating, then this would be overeating a lot and of course if you struggle with the problem of undereating, any eating feels like overeating to this person and if you're not reading your Bible, you start reading your Bible and you get a good streak going reading your Bible every day, daily devotions well see the problem is that then when you do this positive behavior what this says is yes to you it gives you an affirming message based on the behavior so it says yes good for you you're okay but the problem is that when this affirming message hits the shame grid it doesn't get in or it gets that twist on it that little bit of a twist that says not good enough good but not good enough not enough not enough not enough try harder try harder, try harder. Or, you know, those of you who struggle with shame know how hard it is to receive a gift. Because if someone gives you a gift, you look at it and you feel uncomfortable with it. Like, I don't know, what does this person want? If they knew me like I knew me, they wouldn't be giving me this in the first place. You just want to give it to somebody else, because it reminds you how undeserving you are of this gift. So when this good message hits the shame grid, it twists it, and it doesn't land in an affirming way. Now, there is an exception, and that is that if the affirming message does get in, and you do feel justified based on your own behavior, that's called self-righteousness. So that's not the solution either. Do you understand? So this person, now, if they do this behavior and that's not good enough, then they just have to keep doing more positive behavior, so they keep doing this positive behavior, and pretty soon they maybe one day dare to look inside and see if anything's changed and nothing's changed. Or they slip. Slip, I don't like that phrase, slip, because what that means here in Minnesota is you're walking on the lake and you slip and fall down. Going into a bar and taking a drink is called going into a bar and taking a drink. That's not really a slip, although I understand what that kind of means. But choosing to take alcohol instead of Coca-Cola is choosing to drink alcohol instead of Coca-Cola. But let's say you slip, and what that would look like is that you do the behavior that you've been trying not to do, or you miss a day of doing the behavior that you're trying to do. Or, for some people, you don't even have to actually do the behavior. All you have to do is be tempted strongly enough to do the behavior, and it feels like you did it anyway, and it wasn't good enough, and it kind of cancels this whole thing out, and then you spin back over here for a while and do the other stuff until you feel bad about feeling bad, and then you come over here and try hard again, and so then you just kind of like do this crazy eight thing here where you just spin back and forth from positive to negative behavior. Okay, let me show you what this looks like. If I'm over here and I'm involved in some sexual behavior that I feel bad about and that says I'm a bad person. And so I'm feeling yucky, gross, terrible, perverted, you know, unspiritual, whatever I'm feeling, bad, okay? And I decide to abstain from that. So here now I've abstained for a week. Well, how do I feel here compared to there? I feel better, right? So I'll abstain for another week. Well, how do I feel here compared to there? Better still. Well, I'll abstain for six weeks. Well, I feel pretty good. Well, I'll abstain for 12 weeks. Well, I feel really good. Well, let me ask you a question. If what generated or motivated my good behavior, if the place from which my good behavior came from, which would be abstaining, if the place from which my good behavior came from was feeling bad, yucky, terrible, gross, defective, shamed, you know, and now I'm over here, and I'm not feeling yucky, gross, terrible, shamed, defective anymore. I'm feeling kind of good. what's going to motivate more good behavior. In fact, when I'm over here and I'm trying to work myself out of this, I have to be very careful about everything I do and what I look at and all this kind of stuff. But see, now I'm feeling pretty good. So I don't even have to be that careful. Do you understand? I can kind of take this whole thing for granted, and then all I have to do is do the behavior one time or even be thinking about doing the behavior or tempted very strongly to do the behavior, and it's like the whole thing didn't matter, and I've got to go back over here and start the whole thing over again. All I have to do over here is eat a Snickers bar. It cancels out the whole diet like it didn't matter, like I didn't even do 12 weeks of eating right, and then I've got to start the whole 12 weeks over. It's like living your Christianity in streaks. So the goal is to get a good streak going and never break the streak. And then when you break the streak, it cancels out the whole streak, and then you've got to start a whole brand new streak all over again, and this is the victorious Christian life, right? Going back and forth. Now, I don't know if you can feel the tiredness of me just describing that, but you ought to. If you're feeling tired, that's how you should be feeling for this. And some people live their whole life over here, and they never live up to people's expectations or even their own goals or expectations because they're so stuck, you know, and we look at them, and we're frustrated by them, and they're underachievers and that kind of stuff. And then, maybe once in a while, they'll get a little burst of energy, and they'll shoot over here for just a brief moment, and then they'll crash and burn and come over here, and they live their whole lives over here. And some people live their whole lives over here, and they do it right, and they do it great, and they're great, and people are following them, and it's wonderful. And then they take off to a motel with the church secretary, and the newspapers find out about it, which would be coming over here now for sure. Do you understand this? And then they get busted, and then they say, okay, I'll never do this again, I promise, and then they come back over here and try to do it over here from now on. And we won't talk about any of the issues that generated that slip. We'll just make them promise not to do it anymore, and if they can avoid doing it for a year, we'll put them back in the ministry, and we won't talk about all the soil and issues that are underneath a person's life. So some people live over here, and then they kind of go over there once in a while, but no big deal. Most people, I think, kind of live back and forth between the two places. They're not so stuck on one side or the other. And what's unfortunate and scary is that, actually, a lot of us have been taught that doing this cycle over here is the solution to doing this one over here. See, generating the positive behaviors is the answer to this. It's the goal. And this side of the cycle, the positive behavior cycle, is not the answer to doing the negative side. That's not the answer. Theologically, doing the positive behaviors is just self-rescuing instead of self-punishing. And we are as incapable of rescuing ourselves as we are incapable of taking a big enough punishment for what we've done. Theologically speaking, Scripture does say that you can pay the price for your sins. We all know that Jesus paid the price for our sins. But theologically speaking, you can pay the price for him, but you get to pay forever. And when you're done paying forever, you're still not paid. So you get to do that if you want to do that. And living this way is just a little bit of a taste of that kind of forever. Just a little bit of a sample. And trying to rescue yourself or do enough good stuff is a little bit of a taste, too. It's a taste of what the Pharisees experienced and their self-righteousness, measuring themselves by themselves. Theologically speaking, living over here on this negative side is called walking by the what? Flesh. But see, living over here on the positive side, that's just walking by the flesh too. It's just that now you're walking by a prettier looking flesh than the flesh that you used to walk by. Actually, the flesh over here on the positive side was the flesh that they were walking by in Galatia. This group of people had been incredibly heavily involved in pagan religion and temple prostitution and child sacrifice and all kinds of rigmarole they had to do in hopes of somehow appeasing these gods they served, but they never did. And the harder they tried, it didn't help. They still had to try hard tomorrow, and they still had to try hard the next day, and the next day, and the next day. And then Paul came along and said, it's a gift. God has a gift for you, and it's by his grace, and you get it by faith. And they were so tired and beat up by this system that they went, thanks a lot. And then Paul left, And then this group of people followed behind Paul, making sure that people got the full gospel message, the real true gospel. And what they said is, yeah, this great stuff is okay, and you've got to have faith, but it's not enough. You've got to get circumcised. Two, you've got to do the religious thing. And so the Galatians went, oh, okay. And so they started doing external stuff to try to augment what God had done, and they ended up tired. And Paul says, you know, where's that sense of blessing you once had, and who hindered you from pursuing the truth, and those kinds of things. And Paul is so worried about this group that he writes things like this. In Galatians 4.8 he says, However, at that time, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those which by nature are no gods. But now that you have come to know God, or rather be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things? I told you what that was before, the elemental things, the elementary principles of the world. You turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things to which you desire to be enslaved all over again. Now you see, when he says you've turned back again to the weak and worthless elemental things, he's not accusing them of going back to temple prostitution and child sacrifice. What he's saying is that what you've done is you've come over to this system, which is still the world. It's still the elementary principles of the world, and it's just as weak and worthless as this other one, and I'm concerned about you. He says this, you observe days and months and seasons and years. I fear for you that perhaps I've labored over you in vain. And the word labor there doesn't mean I worked really hard. So Paul isn't wringing his hands and saying, you know, Galatians, I've worked so hard here and I'm afraid it didn't do any good. The word labor there is the word childbirth labor. And what he's saying is, I'm afraid that what looked like a birth really wasn't. In other words, I'm afraid that all you have done is exchange all your pagan, ugly, false gods for a bunch of spiritual Christian-looking false gods, and that the labor that we had, that we thought resulted in real life, never resulted in life at all. So you understand how serious this issue is. Then in verse 21, he says, tell me, you who want to be under the law, don't you listen to the law? You guys, you like the law. See, what the law does is the law comes and shames this person and gets them either so indicted and stuck that they can't perform, or the law comes and shames and indicts them, and then their solution isn't to hang on more tightly to Jesus and his grace. Their solution would be then to try to generate enough behaviors to live up to the law. And there's this group of people here that actually like that kind of stuff. And so Paul says, well, tell me, you who want to be under the law. Do you even listen to the law? Do you know the law? Are you sure that you really want to do the law route here? For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondwoman and one by the free woman. But the son of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh and the son of the free woman through the promise. Now, what this means is this. Remember that in the book of Genesis, Abraham had two sons. One of the sons was called who? Ishmael, and the other was Isaac. Ishmael was the son born of self-effort. Abraham and Sarah did not do Ishmael because they didn't care what God wanted. They did Ishmael because they cared what God wanted so much they couldn't wait for God to do it. So they did it. They were God's little helpers. And so Ishmael was a lack of unfaith. Do you understand? Even though they weren't saying, not to you, God, we're going to do it our way. They said, you promised us this and we want this so much, and 10 years went by, nothing happened, so they just did it themselves. Isaac was the son that you could only get by waiting for God to do something because Sarah was barren, see? So unless God does it, it's not going to happen. And the only way you can get Isaac is by believing God, that's all, and waiting for him to do it. Isaac was the son of promise. Ishmael was the son of the flesh, son of self-effort. And so here's these Galatians, and there's this group of Galatians over here that are saying, You know, we're sons, we're heirs of Abraham because we have faith like Abraham had faith. We believe like Abraham believed, and so we're sons of Abraham, we're daughters, okay? But here's this other group of people that's saying, well, we're sons of Abraham because we got circumcised like Abraham got circumcised, and God told Abraham to get circumcised, and so we did that, and that's us. And Paul says, well, you know what? You're all saying that you're sons of Abraham, And you're right, you all are sons of Abraham, but you just need to understand that Abraham had two sons. And one of the sons was the heir, and the other one wasn't. The son of self-effort, the one who generated their own, you know, their religious performance as a way of vindicating themselves, they're not heirs. They look good, they're sons, but they're not sons of the promise. The only way you can be an heir is if God did it. Because you can't do it. And so that confrontation lands real heavily once again on these people. Another confrontation that lands on this is this. In terms of these two groups of people, this person who's kind of out of control and spiraling in a negative direction and stuck and can't get out, and then this person over here who's doing it right and cranking out all kinds of good behaviors to try to vindicate themselves. Which group of people did Jesus have a harder time with, do you think? People over here on the left who were in trouble or the people over here who were in trouble, by the way, but didn't know they were in trouble? These are the group of people that Jesus had a ministry to, but they wouldn't receive his ministry because they were what he called well. They were well. Well people don't need a doctor, he said. I didn't come for well people. You well? Go be well. you know when he says in the Beatitudes when he says blessed are the broken you know he has these people in his crowd he has the prostitutes and the Samaritans and the lepers and the hungry poor people over here and then the Pharisees over here when he says blessed are the broken we've got the broken people over here that are feeling you know beat up and ashamed and they're not doing it and they're all looking over here at the Pharisees wishing that they were like them you know because that's the way to be and then the Pharisees they're all looking over here at these guys, thanking God that they're not like them. And Jesus says, well, no, see, blessed are the broken. Theirs is the kingdom of heaven. The kingdom comes to broken people. That's who the kingdom comes to. But you don't understand either, blessed are the broken. You're well, right? Well, hit the bricks. Go be well. Because I didn't come for well people. The kingdom comes to broken people. You're fine? Go be fine. Blessed are those who mourn. Mourning, in this case, there's nine Greek words for mourn in the New Testament. This one means who put out here what's on the inside. Who led on the outside what's on the inside. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall receive comfort. So here's all the mourning people. Not only are you in trouble, but you look like you're in trouble. You prostitutes, you look like prostitutes. You adulterers, we know you're adulterous. You hungry people, you look hungry. You look as bad a condition as you really are. And you, you look pretty good. You're all thanking God that you're not like them, and you're all lamenting the fact that you're not like these guys over here. And you might have sadness, but you'd never mourn. And you might have problems on the inside, but you'd never let it out because that wouldn't look good, and that's your goal is to look good. So Jesus said, no, see, you don't understand. Blessed are those who mourn. They shall get comfort. In God's kingdom, comfort comes to mourning people. It's okay to mourn. It's okay to be broken. It's okay to mourn. That's what it looks like in God's kingdom. His kingdom comes toward that. but you don't understand either. Blessed are those who mourn. You're fine, right? Well, go be fine because I didn't come for well people. I came for broken mourning. Blessed are those who are hungering and thirsting for righteousness. You guys are righteous, right? Well, go be righteous. The only way you're going to be righteous is if you get a gift and if you're hungering and thirsting, you get the gift, you see. Blessed are those who hunger and thirsting. That's what the Beatitudes are about. Now, see, later on, it says there's more joy in heaven over one sinner that would be you who repents to over 99 righteous people who need no repentance. Well, who are the 99 righteous people that need no repentance? There aren't any. There's no such thing as a righteous person who needs no repentance. There's only one unrighteous person that needs repentance and knows they need repentance and 99 unrighteous people that need repentance and don't think they do because they're well. So go be well because I didn't come from well people. I came from broken people. And I just want to close with a statement and that is that my experience in many churches has been that because we're so preoccupied with how things look and what people think and with activities and programs and external kinds of things, what has happened in these places is that we've tended to chase away all the people that look like those who Jesus ministered to and cater to the people that criticize Jesus for ministering to the people that Jesus ministered to. Our churches are filled with well people. And Jesus didn't come for well people. It came for broken, mourning, hungering, and thirsting people, and it's okay because yours is the kingdom. And with that, I want to close. Thank you. Thank you.
