I was listening to David begin this two-part series on developing a generous heart. The whole idea of development and what our kids are going through as they're developing emotionally and physically and spiritually caused me to think that maybe into the middle of this two-part series I needed to share something that's been rattling around in my head for a while. It's been a verse, it's been kind of a passionate commitment that I've been making over the last couple of years to a couple of verses that are very important. And as we listened last week, we heard that as we develop a generous heart, consistent with the life of David that we've been studying, we saw that there's a big difference, at least according to Eugene Peterson, between true compassion and sentimentality. That all too often we can get caught up in the idea of being moved. And maybe even this movie, The Passion of the Christ, is going to do that for us. It's going to cause us to go and shed a tear and be moved. and maybe even sit in our seat for 10 minutes. But if it doesn't go beyond that, if we don't press beyond that and see what has moved us, worked out into our lives so that it affects the way we live, then we've done what Peterson calls we have compassion that has been spilled out onto the ground and it hasn't had the effect it's designed to have. So we learned that last week. And as I thought about that and I said, well, that's kind of what I've been involved in for the last couple of years is trying to figure out how we take this reality of what Christ is showing us and flesh it out into our lives. So there was a couple of verses that I want to draw our attention to, and I'm going to turn to them now. You can join me if you would like. They're somewhat familiar to many of you, I'm sure. They're in the book of Hebrews, which is in the New Testament. It's just a few books from the back of the New Testament Bible. And chapter 10. And one of the things that I recognize in trying to flesh this out is that as we move from where we are to where we want to be, there's one word that is synonymous with that, and that word is change. We're going to have to change. Because, you know, last I checked, none of us are just like Jesus, and we are called to be like Jesus, and because we aren't like Jesus, but that's what we're trying to be like, then something's going to have to change. I don't think it's Jesus. Jesus isn't going to change the way he is to match us. We're going to have to change something about us to match him, and that's going to be a lifetime project. So with that in mind, let's turn to the 24th and 25th verses of the 10th chapter of Hebrews. And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds let us not give up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing but let us encourage one another and all the more as you see the day approaching as we look at this passage I want to stop on a couple of a couple of words a couple of key words the first word is consider let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. The word consider is found a couple different times in Hebrews, most specifically chapter 3, verse 1, where it says, let us consider the apostle and high priest of our faith, that is Jesus. Let us consider him. And the word means to perceive clearly or to understand fully, to reflect carefully. In other words, not just casually, but what we're talking about here is to take some time to press in and understand as fully as we can, Jesus. As fully as we can, what it's going to take to spur us on, to move us along in our journey toward love and good deeds, being like Jesus. So this generous heart that we are in the middle of a study around, I believe, is synonymous with saying a loving heart. For a loving heart is a generous heart. It's the broader umbrella under which generosity is a piece. So consider is one word. Then the next word is spur. Now, when I was a kid and I watched cowboy movies, I was really intrigued by the spurs that you wore on the back of your cowboy boots. And it was kind of fun to have until you got hit in the ribs or in the shins or some other parts of your body by those spurs. And when you did, if you can imagine it, you get an idea, You get a little bit of an idea of what this word means. In the original language, it's used in a negative context to incite or provoke. It's a strong word. It's a painful word. It also means encouragement and stimulate. But the idea is to kick us in somewhere where it's going to stimulate us or provoke us or incite us to move on from where we are to where we want to be. A pretty strong verse. The next verse helps us a little bit because it says, don't stop meeting together as some are in the habit of doing. You need to keep gathering together. And this is a verse that, out of context, without verse 24 next to it, has been used by pastors like myself to put guilt trips on people about coming to church, especially on Super Bowl Sunday when they have an evening service and he wanted to get some people back instead of in front of the TV. you use this verse, don't forget to gather together. You need to get together. Well, it may apply to large groups like this, but you have to understand the average-sized church in the Bible when we were reading the New Testament was probably about 50 people. So it wasn't this large gathering that we experienced for the most part. It was smaller groups, often met in homes. So what he's really saying is in smaller groups, twos and threes maybe applies. You need to get together because if you don't get together, you're not going to be about the business of provoking, of inciting, of spurring us on, spurring each of us on toward the goal, what we say the goal is in becoming more like Jesus. Well, there's a couple reasons why we need to gather together. I'd like to suggest. One is that left to ourselves, it's often hard for us to decide what love really looks like. I can get confused about that. I can be too close to a situation. I can be too subjective. I need somebody in my life who cares enough about me and knows enough about me to be able to challenge me and look me straight in the eye and say, you know what? I think what you're doing in being nice to your kid is enabling a behavior that needs to be confronted. Now for someone to know me well enough to say that, they've got to get close to me. We've got to gather together on a fairly regular basis. And then on another side, it may be that we need someone to say, you know, when you got angry, you thought you were justified in your anger, but as I observed you getting angry and getting in that person's face, I'm not so sure that wasn't more about you than it was about being loving to them. I think that was a way for you to be defensive, to stiff arm some people and keep them at arm's length, to push them away, to protect yourself. And then sometimes we need someone to come along and maybe not say any word at all, but just sit with us and encourage us and comfort us by just sitting with us, not even giving us an explanation when there aren't any easy ones. We need that kind of person. We need those kind of people in our life if we're to believe what the writer to Hebrews is saying. Well, that's one reason. It's because I'm not even sure in my own life. Now, sometimes I'm sure. Sometimes I know exactly what the loving thing to do is, and I need someone to hold me accountable for doing it. I say I'm going to do it. I need someone to get in my face a week later and say, did you do it? Did you follow through? Because it wasn't an easy thing. another reason I believe is because in the company of two or three people there's a dynamic that happens I'm really grateful for the fact that the Holy Spirit is in me and he brings a creativity and an inspiration he teaches me and he challenges me and he grows me but there's something unique that happens when two or three get together when two when three people get together for the purpose that we're just talking about this morning, it's more than three people. There's a fourth person who comes into our midst who's not just directly connected to me or the other two people, and it brings a spark of creativity that none of us have alone. It's an amazingly mysterious dynamic that happens over and over again, and if you've experienced it, you know what I mean. And so in trying to figure out what love looks like, sometimes we need that creative spark that doesn't come from any one person but it's accumulation of three people coming together and pulling what they feel is in their heart and all of a sudden something else emerges out of the group that is exactly what we're looking for that creative energy that the Holy Spirit brings and finally we need this we need to gather together for this purpose because it says in verse 25 there's a day coming and that day is capitalized and the reason it's capitalized is because essentially what the writer is saying is, folks, you're going to be standing before God someday and you're going to give an account for the way in which you've lived your life. Don't you understand that? And the way in which you're going to give an account for how you lived your life is based upon what the person you say you're worshiping said. And he said, if you love me, Jesus said to his disciples, if you say you love me, then you'll do what I'm telling you to do. If you really love me, you'll do what I'm telling you. And a new command I'm giving to you, that you love one another as I have loved you. And he said it again, this is my command, singular, love your neighbor. So on that day, capital D, when we have died and we stand before God, we're going to have to give an account for how we loved God by loving our neighbor, how we related to one another. And it only makes sense. You see, he loves you and me so much that he was willing to die for us. That's how valuable we are to us. And if we trample underfoot the people Jesus died for, that's an offense to him. And he's saying, don't talk to me about loving God. Don't talk to me about being religious if you don't love your brother, if you don't love your sister. This is critical stuff. This is the essence of the gospel. And someday there's going to be a day coming when we're going to stand before God and give an account to how we lived our lives in this arena. That's why the writer says, don't forget getting together and spurring each other on toward love and good deeds because that's the heart of the gospel. Well, it's going to take some change. And as I was thinking about that this week in preparation to talk, A couple of stories emerged throughout the week that I didn't plan on, but it was perfect. The first conversation I had this week resulted in me sharing this story, and it reminded me that two years into my professional baseball career, I had a sore elbow, and I was sent back to the rookie club, and it was a humiliating demotion that got my attention because I thought I was maybe hoping to survive in professional ball, but here I was being sent back to the rookie club. I had a couple of months to spend with this rookie team, and my elbow was hurting. The manager there was an old, crusty ex-pitcher himself who the rumor had it he had pitched a couple of times in the major leagues, but now he was kind of resorted to a high school teacher and a baseball coach in the summer. Now, this was the first time anybody who had had any experience pitching had ever been my coach. And so in some ways I was looking forward to it, but it was a humiliating experience. And he got me a cortisone shot from my elbow, and then he took me aside and he said, kid, you're going to have to pitch through the pain because you're on your way out. The organization's ready to give up on you, and if you don't pitch, you aren't going to be here. So I had to make a decision that I was going to have to live with the pain and pitch through it. And then he took me aside and I said, show me how you throw. and I threw, and he says, now, you're never going to get anybody out that way. He said, you're never going to blow anybody. You don't have enough speed to throw like that. He said, you're going to have to do something with your fastball, and here's what you're going to have to do. And he took me, and he showed me how to throw, how to turn the ball over, throw a sinking fastball. Well, I'd never done that before. I'd probably thrown 100,000 times. I'd never thrown a baseball that way. And here I was, my second year in professional ball, and I was going to have to change something that fundamental. And he said, now, the way you do it, I said, how do I do it? He said, every time you pick up a ball, I don't want to ever see you throw a ball the old way. I want you to throw, even when you're playing catch, whatever you're doing, I want you to just take, go over to that fence over there and just throw against the fence until you get it down to where you get the feel of what that's like. And as a result of that and taking his advice, letting him spur me, being open to the fact that I needed to change, I eventually learned how to throw a sinking fastball, which contributed significantly to me being able to go on in my professional career and eventually make it to the major leagues. Well, I shared that story with Joseph Luptak, our cellist friend from Slovakia who was with us this last week. And I need to parenthetically thank those of you who braved the horrible weather on Monday to come out to the concert. I know many of you couldn't, and I understand that. There were some crazy people who did, however, about 100 of us, and it was a wonderful concert. And I want to thank you on his behalf and on mine for taking the risk to be out here on a bad day like that. But in being with him, I had an opportunity to listen to him tell this story. And it was that he had won a number of awards, a number of competitions in Slovakia. He was kind of a rising star. And he had heard about a particular teacher that he had met at a conference. He finally met the guy, and he would love to have studied under him, but there was no way. It was way too expensive. It was in London. Only one other professional musician had ever studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London, and he thought this is a pipe dream. But he heard about a scholarship, an international competition for a scholarship, and he became one of two people who was awarded a scholarship, and he was able to go to London and study under this wonderful world-class cellist. And the first thing he did, he moved in with the family. He was going to be with him a year, living with his family. And this teacher, his professor, his mentor, his crusty old coach, the first thing he did when he sat down was he said, you're going to have to change the way you hold the bow. And Joseph told me, he says, I was confused. I was frustrated. I didn't know what to be angry. He says, I had won these competitions holding the bow the way I hold it. This is so basic. How can you challenge that? Well, he convinced him that that's what he needed to do. The problem with changing it was that it was extremely painful. He said his hand ached as he tried to hold it a new way. And he was confused as to whether this was really the right thing to do. But eventually, when he kind of worked it through, after three months it took him to get to the point where three months out of 12 months, three months of studying was just spent holding the bow differently, he began to realize that out of his cello he was creating sounds, the richness and fullness of which he had never experienced before. And in fact, by learning that new style or way of holding the bow, he was able to play pieces that he would never have been able to play otherwise. Now, the bottom line in both of these stories is for Joseph and for myself is in a very fundamental way, we had to be open to the critique of someone that was basically not only challenging us to do something different, but actually having us to take a step back, feel foolish, feel confused. And that was all part of our growth and development. Without doing that, we wouldn't have progressed to where we were. Well, as I was sharing some of these things in preparation for this weekend, I had another interesting story come up in our senior staff. I got permission to share this. Scott Bernstein, who's on our senior staff, he and his wife Sandy have been in the process of building a home. And as they were building the home, they had a scheduled move-in date. Everything was lined up for them to do that. And they are now two months over their moving date. and they're paying utilities in two places and interest in both places. And it's a crazy time for them. And it's all brought about by some miscommunication and failure to honor promises and all kinds of stuff that's happened that's caused them a tremendous amount of anxiety, frustration, and I guess we'd call it just a bad day, having a bad week, a bad month, a bad couple months. And it's been a real hard time for them. Scott was standing in his kitchen where the cabinets had been part of the problem and they still haven't moved in yet. He's standing in the kitchen and he was very frustrated and very angry and a friend of his was standing next to him who looked at Scott and he said, I wonder what love looks like in the midst of something like this. Now, that's a wonderful question that I hope we continue to learn to ask over and over again. But what was unique about this was this was a person asking Scott. In some ways, in a gentle, loving way, confronting him about his behavior. Now, this guy could have sided with Scott and, you know, sympathized with him, picked up on his anger and frustration, but no, he stopped and he challenged Scott to think about what. Now, Scott admitted there was a, first of all, he wanted to strangle the guy, but then he paused and he let it in. He realized it's not his problem, it's my problem. I need to ask this question, and I need to press into this question. And Scott's got the choice now, as the days are unfolding, to either just be sentimental about it, to feel the conviction, to feel the emotion, and then never do anything about it, or work it out into his life and become accountable for being loving, being the way God would have him to be in the midst of a difficult situation. And time will tell. We'll see. It's part of Scott's development. Well, what does love look like? What does love look like? That's a great question. And for us to be able to answer that effectively and be in the process of answering it, we're going to need each other. And so that's really, as I was sitting in the balcony last week, I thought, you know, I've got to share some of the things that I've been going through. And so if you look in your bulletin on the back of the sermon notes, I've included some five very practical points that I hope will be meaningful to you. I hope they'll be helpful to you. And what I need to tell you is these five points are not sacred. I didn't get them out of the latest book. I didn't get them out of someone's taped message. Where these five points came from was a couple of years of reflecting upon this verse. And for the last year, I've met with two guys where we have done what I've been talking about. In January of last year, we started to wonder. We checked in with each other and realized that in those relationships that are closest to us, we aren't moving and progressing in love. For me, I had my 30th wedding anniversary last year and it hadn't come yet, but I knew it was coming. And I'm thinking to myself, now people on the outside are going to look at my marriage and they're going to say, you got a great marriage, you got some good kids, you know, God's been really good. But inside I know that I've kind of settled into patterns of behavior that are just comfortable, but they're not necessarily loving. And so we all kind of checked in around that. We said we need to start holding each other accountable for moving ourselves on out of those patterns of behavior that we just have learned to accept about ourselves into something that's more proactive, more becoming like Christ, more developmental. So we created these steps, and this is what we've been doing. And what I'd like to encourage you to do is to take them and make them your own. find one or two people that you can meet with and start to do this together start to spur each other on because you know there is going to be a final exam and we've got a chance to prepare for it every single day and one of the things we've made available at 9 o'clock on Sunday mornings not communion weekends we can't use the room on communion weekends it's used for other things but in room 104 we're going to gather at 9 o'clock we've been gathering at 9 o'clock to practice this I would encourage you to bring a friend or two and part of the time is just kind of collecting and sharing some thoughts but then we're going to break up and give you time to be with your two or three people to work through this sort of in a, you know, kind of a greenhouse we're kind of practicing over here and then we want you after you've practiced a while to take it, don't come back to room 104 at nine o'clock on Sunday find those places in the rhythm of your own life where you can hook up with one or two people and do this as a matter of part of your routine. So that's what we're doing at 9 o'clock on Sunday mornings, and I'd encourage you to consider being a part of that, at least to begin with. If you're alone, you don't know somebody, come to room 104 at 9 o'clock on Sunday, and we'll get together with those of you who are alone and pray those people into your life that you need. Maybe you don't know who they are, and you just need somebody to pray with you and agree that God will show you who they are. These got to be people who you're willing to trust. You're willing to allow them to speak into your life and they know you well enough to do that. The final way that I'd like to encourage you to consider as a way of working this into your life is something that we're going to be rolling out over the next couple of weeks and that is a mentoring opportunity that we're going to be making available to our congregation. In a couple of weeks, you'll be hearing from a man by the name of Glenn Jeffrey who's going to share what it's been like for him to mentor an at-risk kid for 30 years, a different kid, different kids, but for 30 years he's been mentoring an at-risk kid, and we're going to provide that opportunity. And, you know, he told me, he says, you know, man, I'd be thrilled if you got 25 people. 25 people. I'd like to see 250, 300, 400 of us step forward and be willing to take on the challenge of mentoring an at-risk kid. These kids will come from Angel Tree, which means one of their parents is in prison. They have a 70% chance of ending up in prison themselves unless somebody steps into their life who's going to care enough to invest something in them. These are going to be kids from the Minneapolis School District that the Sanctuary Covenant Church is partnering with schools. And these kids are at risk in an at-risk school. Some of them are going to come from the suburbs. Some of them are even going to come from our own church body. But there's going to be a common denominator of these kids and that is they need to know what unconditional love is like. People who are supposed to be showing them unconditional love, giving them a taste of what God's love is like have abandoned them, have bailed on them. Everybody that has said they cared in their lives has not cared. And so they're a little cynical. They're a little skeptical. And here's what you can expect if you step forward. You can expect it's not going to be easy. You can expect that these kids are going to push you away. In fact, for three months to six months, you can expect that they won't return a phone call, that they won't show up at the meeting you've arranged to have with them. you might drive 35 minutes through the rain or the snow to get there only to have them not show up but the key is that you show up that you are persistent that you are consistent and over time over time eventually hard hearts begin to soften and a kid begins to experience what it's like to be loved unconditionally, with no strings, consistently. Now that's going to be hard for you, but you think it's going to change you? It's going to change the kid. The kid's going to change, but it's going to change us. It's going to change us as a church. If a number of us get involved, and that's going to change us. The reason it's going to change us is because there was a time, folks, when we didn't show up for appointments, when we didn't make phone calls, when we turned our back on God. And God was consistently there showing up over and over and over again until our hearts began to soften and we began to turn around and recognize that while we were still sinners, while we were still cursing at Him and turning our back on Him, He died for us. That's what this table is all about. And as you come and you delve into this table, and I hope you do, I hope you drink deeply and you eat that wafer with gusto. But I also want you to remember that the reason you can do that is because somebody didn't give up on you. Somebody kept pursuing you. And as we receive from this table, this table isn't just for us to receive from. It's for us to receive from and then recognize that that strength, that power that allowed me to receive this table is now in me, enabling me to go out and be that kind of person for somebody else. That's what this is all about. And so as we come to the table today, one of the things I'd like us to focus on is this table was costly. And through this wonderful movie, this depiction of being able to see what it was like, we're gonna get a sense of how much this cost, maybe more than we've ever known before. But it isn't just to be sentimental. It's to be affected and be changed and then begin to bring that change out into our lives. And I hope you'll join me on that journey. I'd like to invite the communion stewards and those who'll be praying at the altar if they'd come forward so we can serve you first and I'll come down and we'll pray for the elements Let's pray. elements that were common elements that were meaningful to Jewish people because they were part of a Passover meal. They had significance, but Jesus took them, and it's almost as like what happened with Joseph. He took them, and using a little different way of holding the bow, he made them richer and fuller in meaning. And as I've reflected on these elements, it's been interesting to me, especially the costliness of what this cost Jesus and what he invites us into is that, you know, to make bread, you have to have a grain of wheat, and that grain of wheat has to be added to other grains of wheat, and then it has to be crushed so that it comes together and is baked into a loaf. Same thing with grapes. You have to have a grape that is added to other grapes, and then once they're together, it has to be crushed. And what that speaks to is what happened to Jesus, but also what he invites us to happen to us. There are things in us that need to be crushed our pride our arrogance our feeling like we've arrived something needs to be crushed like our hopelessness feeling like there's no hope there is hope that needs to be crushed we need to be encouraged and stimulated and spurred on to the kinds of things that will reflect this sacrifice to the world let's pray lord jesus thank you for being willing to be faithful to your calling as you were the example to the disciples when you said, I show the love that I have for the Father because I do everything he told me to do. I'm obedient to what the Father's asking me to do. And then you turned around to us and said in the same way, demonstrate your love for me by being obedient to what I'm asking you to do. And Lord, what we hear you asking us to do today is to take the love that we have received from you and share it with others. so we pray Lord as we receive this bread and as we as we receive this wine this juice that Lord they would speak to us about the sacrifice that we have not we not only receive but have chosen to enter into a lifetime of sacrifice and of loving and giving and serving so we ask your blessing upon these now as we receive them in your name in the name of Jesus Amen Amen.
