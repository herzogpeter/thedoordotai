Turn your Bibles, if you would, back to power and pain. 2 Corinthians is a book. If you've got pain and you don't want any more, don't read this book. 2 Corinthians chapter 1, verses 3 through 7. There it is. And then put a finger there and we're going over to the end of 2 Corinthians chapter 12. And we're going to be at verses 7 through 10. 10. There. Yeah. And before I read this, I want to say, I'm going to say some words today. But the one who's speaking, I pray, is Jesus Christ. And listen for his voice and what he would say to you today through these words. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, before I read your word that you gave through Paul, as you inspired him to speak, and you gave him so many wonderful revelations of yourself, we just ask you to come and minister your presence. Come and rest on us and speak. And today if we hear your voice we would not harden our hearts and we would have ears to hear. We ask your Holy Spirit to come and do the wonderful resurrection power work of cracking us open dividing our soul, spirit, heart, mind for an inhabitation of your Spirit's new creating power in areas of pain and weakness that we never thought you could touch, but we've been holding back from you. And I ask this in Jesus' name for your glory to please you, Lord Jesus. Amen. 2 Corinthians 1, verses 3 through 7. Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion, and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we have received from God. For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows. If we're distressed, it is for your comfort in salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer. And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort. Now, before we go to chapter 12, I knew those verses, and when I had this terrible pain that came in my neck on October 5th, I woke up with this huge pain. It was debilitating. I just sat on the edge of the bed. What is this? And to make a long story short, I knew these verses, and I just prayed, Lord God, I know you can deliver. Paul got delivered from some deadly pestilence that was on him, chapter 1. He thanks God for it if you read further. And he says, you know, we were comforted, we were delivered. But through that time, he suffered a lot. And I just didn't even want it at all. So I just, I went through a real struggle, if you'll remember from my Halo talk, you know, just being angry at God for a while there until my surgery. And then, you know, I thought I was getting some peace, and then I'm right on the operating table, and I thought I was just going to have a little bit of a disc removed and a little bit of a fusion, just two bones fused together. The guy says, we've changed our minds. We need to fuse you across six with a plate that will go into C3 down to C6. Those of you people who know cervical stuff, you watch the movies, and you want an arrow going in the throat, and you go, C4, ouch, you know. It was right there, right over here. It's about a finger length that I'm fused with a metal plate, two screws of three, and this metal plate that holds it together. They cut out two vertebrae in the middle where it was very narrow. And I didn't know it wasn't an accident. It was just from birth. And they say that this is a high incidence in those who are in the Japanese culture. Do I tell you, do I look Japanese? Anyway, I believe that God can do anything, so I asked him to just take this away. I don't want to go to surgery. And then I'm on the bed, and I go, okay, Lord, into your hands. I have enough peace there. Into your hands. I told you about going into the MRI, and I was so mad at him that I was playing Pink Floyd. and got in there, and I had that heartbeat that starts that baby out with all that air guitar. I thought it was all that air guitar. I forgot all those scary noises that were in that thing. And it goes on for a minute, and I'm praying, Lord God, I repent, I repent. Overcome me with Stephen Curtis Chapman. But they can't hear you in that sound booth. They play the tape you give them. And you don't dare open your eyes and say anything because that thing's right there, right there. When I was a chicken, I took open-sided because... How many of you have been in an MRI? Okay. You know the cold-sided one? For putting me in that thing? That's like squeezing toothpaste through a toothpaste tube. No way. But I got on the table and he said, I'm sorry, we're going to have to do all that. And then we're going to have to put this halo on your head. And somebody came in and measured my head. And I just... What do we do, Lord? and then eight hours of surgery. Now, part of the thing that was really helpful for me was my daughter kind of reached me. Remember that part of the story? I've got to tell that quick so you'll know the next part of the story. My daughter, Kara, who's now a senior in high school, will be here for the second service. Those kids, they sleep pretty long. Don't tell her I said that. And she had had speech anxiety that I helped her through, and I taught her how to pray in a kind of prayer that is a moment-by-moment prayer that clients your heart. St. Ignatius says this every five minutes, and then she was able to use Stephen Perry Chaplin, which says the next five minutes, the next five minutes, that's all. And then we'd listen to his, Be still and know that I am God in the mornings, as I would drive her to school sometimes and just quiet our hearts with the music. I taught her Hesekis, which is the prayer of quiet that stills your heart and fixes it to God. And she wanted God to just take it away. And I said, you can pray for that and keep praying for that. But, you know, if he doesn't do that, you've got to learn to be listening inside that pain. And he'll take you through it. And even if you get embarrassed and you just embarrass yourself, he'll still take you through that. He'll just take you through it. You know, don't worry about it. And he'll just give you peace no matter what happens. Well, that overcame speech anxiety. So when Carol one night heard me just yelling at God, worse than ever, Job did, I think. And I didn't know she was outside my room. It was dark. I thought everybody was gone. I was in my bedroom. The next morning she said, Dad, you know, I heard you last night. Oh, I said, honey, I'm so sorry you didn't hear that. And she said, well, I've got to tell you something. She doesn't take that off yet. he's going to meet you in it you've got to be willing to let him meet you in it now I'll tell you something don't teach your kids how to pray unless you don't want that to come back and bite you it bit me good praise God because out of the mouth of babes and teenagers who know God can come incredible deliverance So I said, okay, Lord, I'm ready to meet you in this. And as you know, I said, part of this whole journey, I didn't like the fact that I was going to have this big star in the front of me that I have here. And that I would have these two big holes, because when they cut the stuff out of your head, there's dimples that remain. And I didn't like that. And Jesus told me during that whole time of I was so weird, up and down, and being driven into him, He said, you know, I'm going to remind you of this by those scars. And now some people have said to me, and so I accept those. Those would be, you know, Jesus has his scars, so if he's that tough, I can be that tough. You know, I can keep my scars too. And they're a reminder to us, aren't they? And some have said to me, well, you know, you that don't know my story, so you can get those cosmetically removed. I said, oh, no. No. But it was an especially tough time because I've been, just before that pain came on me, some of the staff will know I'd been on this six-month journey with God where I just, I was seeing Him everywhere and it was like I was caught up to the third heaven. And it was just so cool. So I didn't understand why God had all this pain to come in my life. So difficult. But He taught me a lot of stuff. But what's happened since that time is that I have had a leftover pain after the four months and going into some therapy. There's been a pain that comes sometimes up from my shoulders. Last night I had the whole thing. I was like, okay, God, all right, here I go. You want me to be weak in your strength. And my shoulders get all tight sideways, and then my back starts to get tight and goes right up my head, and it's like a cronus. It's like I'm on a cross with a chronophones. That's what it feels like. Well, I don't know what that feels like, but it's what the picture feels sometimes like to me. And it's such that the head stuff, just the muscles spasm. They just start to spasm, and there's really nothing to do about it. The surgeons don't know what it is. The neurologists don't know what it is. If you're a chiropractor, don't call me today. People hear this, and they want to fix me. But the chiropractors said that really you need, you know, there may be something that can be helped through some exercises, and I get therapy for that. But I had chiropractors say there's nothing to do for you with all this stuff, you know. But it's, there it is. And the best I can describe is if you've ever played football and they tried to get a helmet, you want your helmet tight, right? You don't want that thing loose because you're going to get in. And I played in the days, this may have been part of my neck problem, when you did what was called spearing, sticking the guy. You know what that's about? I know Dave knows what that's about. You put your head to tackle him there, right in the stomach. You use your head to knock a guy over. You need a tight helmet. Imagine the helmet had some kind of way where you could, and you do have these with water and air, where you can just pump those things to get them tight. Just think of somebody pumping and pumping and pumping until you go stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. And that's how that thing feels. or you take a bandana and twist it real tight. And that gets that way at night, 9 o'clock at night. And if I got that at 9 in the morning, I'm in real trouble the rest of the day. And I'll tell you how I've gotten through that. But having this was not fun for me because the surgeon told me that I would be as good as new before the surgery. And he believed that. He was a really good surgeon. He's one of the best. He did Brad Johnson, former quarterback, the Vikings. He did Jake Reed. He did Walter Mondale. And when I went for second opinions on him, they'd say, he's the guy we go to. Well, that's a pretty good second opinion. And he did, if you'd sit and look at the deck for his, and he'd go, my, that's a great construction. So he even knew it himself. He, you know, that whole thing. The other thing that it does is it goes, so I have good construction, but there's just this thing, and it goes sometimes down in my throat. not a lot but I've prayed it happens this week let the people understand I just go gag a little bit it looks like I'm going to retch everything up and then it just goes away and I stand back up staff have been with me like that and they go there he goes there he goes again but I'll be okay I'll be okay are you feeling really sorry for me right now? well this next scripture I'm going to read and then we're going to talk about how God meets you and then four gifts and we're going to be fine on time Four gifts that he wants to give you when you need to pick off. Listerne 2 Corinthians 12, verses 7 through 10. Paul had some kind of, they believe either physical or, some people think it was the opposition he constantly would be opposed. You know, you don't speak well enough. You don't charge, so it's not any good. You don't charge money for your thing. You don't do enough miracles, or you don't do this or that. and you don't look good. You've got an eye problem, and you have an eye problem. You've got a bad history to you, you know, all kinds of things. You always be undercut. But the words here, as you'll see, for thorn and the word for tormenting really have to do with a physical nature. And we don't know what that was, but it's a physical nature, some kind of physical pain. In fact, the word thorn means sharp pain. It's a stake, a stake, like maybe a plate that could be put in your throat and cause your throat to choke up. Something that was constant as well. The word for tormenting is hitting on the head constantly. Hitting on the head constantly. So let's read it. To keep me from being conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, my flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me, but he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, For my power is made perfect in weakness. But he said to me, no. That's a hard one, isn't it? You gotten that no? I mean, Paul, three times, they think the three times that Jesus said, let this cup pass from me. And so it's kind of the full measure of asking. It was like, okay, Lord, I'm done calling you about this. I'm just going to rest in it. You call me. If you want to deliver me, that's up to you. But right now I'm asking you to carry me. and I know that there's a lot of pain out there today everybody's got a piece of pain you all can identify it right now you can go to what that is whether it's physical, emotional, spiritual whatever it may be and you have the opportunity to go to God and ask him to deliver you of it and he's a delivering God he's a miracle working God suddenly you could raise your hand right now and say he's delivered me he's freed me and now I have used that freedom for him or those others who said yes he carries you he'll meet you in it my daughter being one, he'll meet you in that pain and he'll carry you and do incredible things through you even though you're still feeling panicky. Even if you blow it, he'll still use that even. No, my grace is sufficient for you. And the quotes there, this is the only verse that I can think of in some of the new, I think it's in St. Corinthians, there may be another place, that if you have a red letter edition Bible, those are red letters. You see, that's Jesus' personal words. He said that to help me. He said it. He just didn't think it in his thoughts. That's how much Paul needed that word. And here's what Paul says. He says, My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in your weakness. That's what Jesus said. My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in your weakness. Therefore, Paul said, I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. Oh, how wonderful. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses and insults and hardships and persecutions and difficulties, for when I am weak, then I am strong. Paul, what's the matter with you? Are you a masochist? No. He knows that no evil thing comes from God, James tells us. There's no shadow, there's not even a piece of gray that comes from God and the blackness of evil. But he's created this world where it's fallen. But he's come into that world that he created that could snap back on him, and he's taken all the pain at the cross. And now he's there for us so that we can either be delivered or carried before we let him in. Now, I had a problem. I was not about to let God in. Kara talked to me again after she heard me again angry because I was going through my angry time again last summer. And she said, Dad, you know, you just got to do it again. You got to let him in. And I said, Kara, not this time. It's just too tough. I'm afraid this is never going to stop. This pain is never going to stop. And she said, well, you know the truth. That's my daughter. I love her. I told her I was going to say this. She said, that's not strong enough, Dad. I told you, you know the truth. And then, you know, I laughed. I got to thinking about it. You know, she's right. She's right. And I put my own Halo talk sermon tape in the car and tried to listen to it to jumpstart everything. And then that didn't work. In fact, that made me angrier because I thought, God, you used me. You used me. And I don't want to be used anymore. that's what this is I knew the scripture passage I knew the potential of God meeting me in here and carrying me I didn't want it I wanted to white knuckle my way that didn't work I wanted to just get it off me and I was going to all my old wells where he'd met me trying to manufacture his healing it doesn't work that way you gotta go to him not where he met you before that's a tough word it was a true one then I went to theology I tried to figure it out God you made this world how could you make it if you knew it was going to be this painful potentially how did you make this world and then I was in and I said you know maybe I'll just go to Job and he'll have the answer to that intellectual question that will solve my heart problem right oh yeah right and he did do that Job did that all his friends tried to make him do it and I was in a room looking at x-rays for the umpteenth time and there was a Gideon Bible and I just couldn't even read the Bible it was making me more mad and mad my prayers were like like that, you know, a little rebel yell. And so I picked up a Gideon Bible. Now, picking up a Bible and cracking it open can sometimes work. Augustine, the great saint back in the 4th century, who was responsible for his confessions and just wonderful things about grace teaching, he heard a voice that said, take up and read when he was in the middle of his sexual addictions and running away from God. His mother was praying for him so dearly. and he took up the Bible and opened it to Romans 13, quote yourself of Christ and put away the lust of the flesh. And he did that. God met him. I opened up the Bible because it's dangerous to do that. Job 16, 12, it said, All was well with me, Lord, but then you took me by the neck and threw me to the ground and crushed me. So what happened there was that well of trying to figure it out didn't quite work. And I had to go to a place called the cross. That's where God's met all pain. If you're a person here today who's never heard of Jesus and you don't know about his life, all you've got to know about is one thing. He came to this earth, God in the flesh, took upon all our sorrows and all of our pain, and then went to this crucifixion place where he was nailed to a tree in a six-hour torturous death, one of the most torturous deaths men can ever take. But that wasn't the greatest torture. The greatest torture was all the sin of us that he took on himself. He took your sin, took my sin, he took all the pain of anything we'd ever done into his body. And then he took it and buried it in the deepest sea And rose again to come back and take it off of us and remove it from us until he finally removes it in heaven and we live free of it in heaven. Isn't that great? Right now we can know the freedom from its guilt, its death penalty, its hell. And we can begin to know the freedom of being formed in it to be escaping its power. And that's what this message is all about. The power of pain to get at you. You can begin to escape that. Well, I had to go to the cross. The cross is a place where God meets man, and it's a place where eternity and time met. Remember B.C.A.D.? It's a window. Because Jesus is the eternal Son of God. And through Him, eternity enters time. And through that risen Son of God, because the grave didn't keep Him down, He's alive. And through the scars that He bears, you can take your pain and press it into this cross, and press it into him, and he will bear it for you or deliver it and take it away. He'll take away the guilt and shame and the death penalty right now. But sometimes we have to wrestle. We bring the guilt back and the shame back. And then we have this sin in our bodies, so we need to continually take that sin to him so our bodies are continually transformed and changed and renewed. And the sin goes out and in comes his spirit in the new creation. That's the Christian walk. Well, God has some gifts for you if you'll go to the cross with your pain. The first gift is this. is that he will carry you. If you bring your pain to him, he will carry you. He will carry you through your pain. If he doesn't deliver you of it, he eventually will. He eventually will completely deliver you of it. If it isn't in this life today, he might today. He might today. Just to show the rest of us how wonderful he is. But if he doesn't, he will carry you through it. And I've learned that. I went over to Korea, and over in Korea, I had a terrible day. The flights, everything else was great, and I was really worried about it. An 11-hour flight, and if I'm not sitting right, my neck goes and my head goes. But I had a five-hour terrible day at Tokyo Airport. For some reason, United decides to stay there for five hours on layovers. Well, I put in my delirious day because I've learned some things about how Jesus cares you in pain. You don't get this by just, you know, today. You've got to live in this, all right, a while. Go to him, go to him. And he teaches you that he can carry pain. He sometimes takes my pain and he makes it a sweet ache. It's weird. Some of you out there have pain, you know what that's like? You take it to Jesus and you just make it a sweet ache. Yep, you raise your hand. It's weird. I carry a cross in my pocket. And I'll press that cross. I don't have it now, it's back home, I forgot it. But I'll press my pain into that cross. I needed it last night and I had it. How weird to carry around our necks like a hangman's noose or an electric chair. Well, that's because that's where God deals with pain. He'll carry you there. Now, I'm a huge guy. I've got a lot of pain in this huge body. But Jesus can lift me and this pain that might even make you sick today. He can lift your pain. He'll carry you. Secondly, the gift that he has for you that he can also carry you into. If you'll do this, if you'll go to him with your pain, as often as it stabs you, whatever it is, as often as it stabs you, and not white knuckle it, or try and escape it, or take to Satan, Satan will say to you, your pain will talk to you and say, you know what, this Christian life is a bunch of baloney. He doesn't really do anything. So you go sin, go sin, go feel good by sinning, by worrying too much, or obsessing on something, or by going and sinning sexually, whatever it may be that you what empty well cracked well that you may try to go to. But if you go to him the eternal son of God who's full of everlasting life, the abundant water of life that molds from him, that pain will be like a nail that will drive you into God. For every time it hits, every time it throbs, and you go Lord Jesus, come, come, come, teach me. And you walk through life He will create you. Here's the gift. He will create in you a hidden place with Him where He'll talk to you and teach you wonderful things. I can't tell you, in the midst of pain, I have some of the best joy, more so than before my pain I've ever had in God. More peace. More power over sin. Sin won't count. Sin cannot stand God's presence. And so if you're going to God, I found this, you go to God, The problem with us is we don't go to God with our sin. We just sit in it and mope about it or feel bad about it or ask him to take the guilt away. But if you begin to really ask him to take your sin away and you just keep going with your sin, you may have multiple addictions and be the person here that would sign up for the worst dysfunctional case in the world. But if you've got food issues or you've got alcohol issues, if you even have sexual issues, you have even a complex of those, if you let that stuff drive you into God, you'll be like St. Augustine who had sexual addiction and said to God, God, I just turn in my chains. But he began to turn to God, and God made him a powerhouse. If you're alcoholic and thirsty, take that thirst of Jesus often and always, and he will fill you. Take that hunger. Take that hunger for touch, for intimacy. Take it to him. He'll meet you. And he'll make this inner garden in you. It's just beautiful. there's this film Beautiful Mind some of you have seen it see my pain used to talk to me it would tell me that God doesn't love me and I'm sure there was an enemy around it now see God doesn't bring pain but it's interesting Paul says there was given to me and the kind of impression here is that God is standing back saying okay go ahead and allow this thing to be there and scriptures will often speak of God being around something that's evil or hurtful like he did letting his son be killed on the cross. And it is not that he does that. Sinful wicked men did that. Scripture is clear about that. Satan did that. But God is so powerful, you see. And don't you feel this? He's so powerful that if he doesn't do something, it's like he's doing something. That's called sovereign language in Scripture. And so Paul says, God allowed this to come. He allowed it to come. And he says there, he allowed it to come. Why? because my power is made perfect in weakness. And he talks earlier in chapter 1 about being perfected. That's what this inner walk with him will be. You'll be completed in your walk with Jesus, in his life. Wonderful thing. That film was a schizophrenic named, oh, John something, I can't remember his name, but he was a great mathematician, struck in his 30s with schizophrenia, so he started hearing voices and seeing people. And another reality began to become his. He thought he was the ambassador from the United States, went over to Europe, just weird stuff. They don't tell you half the story in the movie. It's a really ugly story. But through shock treatment and those things helped, but kind of treatments that I don't think, some of them do today, some they don't. But he really overcame it by his mind, by his own sheer willpower. Now, he kind of gutted it through, and there's a lot of power in the human flesh. You can do a lot of good stuff, but it won't get you to have a complete sin. But this is an amazing thing. This is something God can give you, a gift of. He took and he said, I'm going to stop talking to the voices and to the people, and I'm going to start ignoring them and believe that they're not real. And they stayed there, but he stopped talking to them. I got out of that film weeping. I said, Lord, I'm never going to let this piece of pain, this slob, tell me anything. I'm going to let it be a prayer bell that's going to just ring me to you. It's going to ring me to you and not just say anything else. The third gift he'll give you is if you live in that long enough and you're just driven into him, your world will become, your universe, this universe, your world will become God's green pastures. Whereas a sheep in Psalm 23, you can lay down and just rest and be in him. And when fear comes or enemies come, he'll prepare a table there. You'll eat right in front of somebody snarling enemies and have joy and peace. And you'll learn some incredible things from Jesus. One of the things I've struggled with and I continue to struggle with, and if you struggle with anger today, God, I believe he's going to be here for you today. You might not get it today, but if you just go with him, go to him with that. If you go to him like this and want a white knucklehead or escape and sin, you're just going to get really sick. I hope you get so sick of that, because you'll just get really angry and bitter. And if you do that, you'll talk to your pain enough. See, you're going to talk to somebody, right? You're going to talk to your pain, talk to yourself, and get really icky inside, and you maybe get sicker, or physically more sicker. Or you'll talk to somebody else and dump on somebody else. When I was getting kind of conditioned and all this stuff, there was one point in my halo where I was sitting in my halo, and I really came to an end to myself, okay? That's the stuff Jesus did. He showed me how just icky I could be when pain was on me. That's all right. It's an okay place to be. It's testing. You can see the depths of where you're at without him, and then he can fill you. But I'd sit there, and I like a big spoon, you know, from oatmeal and cereal. And Sherry would bring me a spoon that fit her mouth. And I'd, oh, I told you, I want a big spoon. You don't love me. You just, I'm in this halo, and you just can't even bring me my big spoon. Now, you know, you could become a martyr to your pain in a bad way and murder everybody else and put them on the pain of your bitterness and your anger or do it all alone and become a big black hole and everybody goes, Where are you? Is there anybody in there? But Jesus wants to invite you to see that he can make your world this wonderful green pasture where you can walk and you can enjoy people. You don't even have to know your pain's there. In fact, this prayer bell, I don't want to tell you about it a lot. It's between me and Jesus. And he could meet you. And, you know, I've had a lot of fear. The fear I've had is that I'll get rear-ended and I'll lose the last fist I got and I'm going to be this guy who's kind of, you know, going like this. And I have to have somebody drive me. By the way, Scott Bernstein drove me to and back from church when I had that halo on after about a few weeks. God bless that man. He knows how to bear somebody's pain. Cross bear. But, you know, I'm afraid of that. And I had a lot of fear when I first started driving. And fear that, what if I die a painful death? What if I have to have this surgery again? And the halo again. Well, you know, I just have taken that to Jesus. And he just said to me, you know what, just like the disciples, Jesus was in the boat, you know, and they were thinking they were going down, and Jesus was sleeping. And he said, why, why don't you have it? If we went down, where would we go? We're in God's hands, right? So the one who could calm the sea said, I'll just take you right to heaven to my Father. Right? You live in God's pasture. Marine McNeil, Marine, wrong Marine. Marine Pranghofer. Sorry, Marine. right now. We want to tell your story. But Maureen Frankhofer giving me permission to... She's had to deal with so much pain with the brittle bone disease. I think one time... I can get Dave again here. I think one time Dave was lifting or something. He broke more of her bones. Poor gal. Watch it when Dave puts his hands on you. But Maureen has brought so much of this stuff to the Lord. Those of you who have deep pain, you can really get deep in God. the way the rest of us who don't have a lot of pain can. There's some of you here, more pain than I. And she had an accident one time, and she's laying there knowing she's broken bones or anything, and she just said, okay, Jesus, just come and get me. And she waited for the ambulance. Oh, I want that kind of peace. When I die, I want to be able to say, okay, here I come. I want to lay down on your pasture. I'm just going to lay down, and the next thing I'll know is your eyes and your arms and the angels. and all those loved ones have gone ahead of me. And they're going to just pasture me, just take this sheep and walk me right into that green, green, green land flowing with water. Kim Fisk. Many of you know Kim Fisk, one of our disabled people. Just before I went to Korea and Japan, I just was there, if I really told you about that, Maureen and I have been working on a project to try and help the disabled people get to the new building in Maple Grove. We were working out what Metro Mobility would do. We found that there was no church that used to have programs that they would run themselves, but the liability is so huge that now nobody does it. So we're still working on that. Maureen and I, we're trusting God to deliver us on that one. But we were really worried about Kim Fisk, and Maureen really was, and was praying for Kim. Because she didn't know how Kim was going to get there for certain, just because of, I can't remember why, they didn't pick her up or whatever for certain times. And God said to Maureen several times as she was praying here a month ago, don't worry about Kim. I will take her to church. Leave that to me. We keep working on it, but I'll take her to church. Well, you know, Kim just died three weeks ago. Now, some of us who knew her are just missing her and just crying, and that's just you bet. There's other of us who know her as well and we're just going, she's healed. She's in the ultimate church healing service. She's jumping upside down. You know, she's doing backflips. And when I get there, I'm going to turn my neck around and, you know, go to him. Even your death will become an entryway to his presence. Last one. He will make you a crossbearer. We're going to be a little bit over time here, about two, three, four, five minutes. He will make you a crossbearer. If you, I'm having too much fun, that's the problem. I'll say, I hope my sermon was good for you, it was great for me. But, he'll make you a crossbearer. Peter says in 1 Peter, I don't want to read this verse, I'm sorry, I'm going to take time to read that verse, it's just too good. 1 Peter 4.1 says, 4.1, 4.1, 1 Peter. therefore since Christ suffered in his body listen to that therefore since Christ suffered in his body and arm yourselves also with the same attitude that's what we've been talking about here arm yourself with the same attitude because he who has suffered in his body is done with sin doesn't mean you're perfect it means you say I'm done hurting myself with that stuff I'm bringing it to Jesus as a result he does not live the rest of his earthly life for human evil desires but rather for the will of God and then he later on goes to say then if you receive insults, you're going to learn to, as Paul did, delight in weaknesses, in human insults. Because it's an opportunity for you to love somebody. Because you know how God can turn it around for you and he can love somebody. They spit at you and give the water of life back. Not your junk, you know. And they'll make you a crossbearer so that you can bear other people's pain. Because you get good at pain. Now, if he delivers you of it, you'll have the same power you'll be able to give that story. Now, God's kids sometimes fight over this stuff, you know. It's like two of God's children out in the parking lot and one says, He delivers. He always delivers. It's up to you. You're just having enough faith. And the other one goes, What do you mean? He carries, he carries, he carries. He doesn't do that stuff anymore. He didn't do it for me. And the problem is we all think that God's got to do for everybody else what he did for us. That fight is only 100 years old. The church never had that fight. If you go back to church history, they believed in both. It gives us for the glory of God. And the problem is we're in American culture. but we think he does all that stuff for our own pleasure. And so it's up to us. No, it's for his glory, folks. And you may have to just flop around for a while until you realize that. But if you come, get a deliverance today, that he'll take all of you. He doesn't want to just take and heal you of your physical sick. He wants to heal you to become a crossfire. I was over in Japan, and I asked the Japanese Christians, what in the end are Korean Christians? Japanese Christians are in a dark land. 0.7%, less than 1%, 0.7% are Christian. That doesn't even tell you who are the evangelical Christians. In Korea, 40% are Christian. But the Christian life is strong and vibrant. It's sacrificial. Many give much more than 10% of their income. The average for giving here in the United States of evangelical Christians is 3%. Over there, it's more than 10%. And they have no tax break. We've heard stories that maybe the IRS is going to take away the tax break. It might be the best thing the church ever got. We'd see how much we really give and why. But I was just, we kept hearing it. We're overwhelmed. I said, can you tell me what you think of the American church and how you're praying for it? And I said, well, we just, you know, it's cheapish. The Japanese, if you're the businessmen, you ever been over there, they don't tell you that, you know, you'll spend a whole week and they're going, yes, yes, oh, good deal, good deal. I'm in on Friday. It's a little problem. and so they're very courteous so anyways I said don't be courteous tell me what God's telling you they said well they're sheepishly they think that the American church is really stuck on itself in its own pleasure and doesn't go to God in his prayers doesn't know how to pray it's on the wrong agenda but even though there's all that stuff coming out of it all those Christian songs and all those Christian books and all those big ministries and all that activity for Jesus isn't coming up with discipleship and life, but a lot of culture, a lot of Christian culture. And after I saw you, then he'd say, but we want you to know we're praying for the church, because can you tell us something hopeful? And I'd say, well, I think there's a new generation coming on. It's a generation called the broken generation, the millennials, the experts. They are piercing themselves like crazy. I said, now that wasn't my way of wearing jewelry, but, you know, my kids, they got the same thing. And I don't get it. But you know what? I started thinking about it. There's a lot of holes in the hearts of those kids. They've grown up as the children of the 60s parents who threw off God's wonderful law and said we will not do such the way God intends. We will not obey authority. We will not seek pleasure. We will seek pleasure. We will seek money, power, and sex. And make them our gods. And depart from the God who built this country and mitigate. We have a bunch of children who live black every morning. And I said, that generation, I believe there are going to be some history makers out of there. I believe there are going to be some heroes because they know that's not the way to go. They're just mourning now and they're waiting for the spirit to land on. I'm showing you here today. I've got a word for you. God wants to make you history makers. He wants to know the heroes. And I've got a word for you. We're going to close now. The band is going to come up right now. If we would. I've got a word for those of you today who never thought. God loves the hard places. Who never thought that he'd ever deliver them. Who could ever deliver them. Today, he may have a miracle for you today. Or a miracle he wants you to step into that we'll hear about in a few weeks. Of deliverance. He asked him for that. I hate it that you didn't hear that the Paul who had the bear, the stone of the flesh. He would go around and they'd pass out handkerchiefs and people would get healed from him. Now, how frustrating is that a few times where he said, God, stop using me. And then there's some of you who are hired kids and you've never thought God could ever carry you for what you're going through. He's going to meet you today. I've got a word for you. And I've got a word for some of these first generation kids, of which my kids are from. Oh, dear God. Raise up heroes. Because, you know, those of us who are boomers, we've only got about 20 years left. We're really great. getting lentils and old and died, and they're not going to do it. God's got to do it to those kids, and then maybe some baby or some baby there that's going to have a baby that might have to go under the persecution, and they've got to learn somebody to teach them how not to hurt themselves or say, so they can bear pain for Jesus. Let's just come to him now. If the band begins to play, that song is wonderful. It talks about pain and leading him into pain. What's your plan? Why don't you just come back? Come back. Come to the cross and ask you to come back. Sit down in that river, even if it's dry right now. Just sit there with him and ask him to come. And now I'm in the dark of my father. I'll see you next time.
