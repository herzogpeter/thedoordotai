Our scripture reading today is Philippians 1, 27 through 28, and Matthew 5, 3. for you, and that too from God. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. This is the word of the Lord. Boy, I'm not sure I'm ready to be done with worship yet. I mean, I get it. We've got to have a sermon. It's church and stuff. But I think I'd rather sit my sorry self down back over there and keep singing. Well, Dave did unroll the vision for us last week. And if you weren't here or you were here and didn't quite get it all, I can try to at least give a quick synopsis or summary in three sound bites just as we get started. I would try to tweet it to all of you, but I don't really know how. So I'll give it as short as I can. One of the main points of his message and his vision and our vision as a church was to increasingly be committed to one another and not just so that we would have friends, though we want to have friends, but because we're committed with one mind as what we read from Philippians 1.27 last week, one mind for the gospel of Jesus. Standing in one spirit, not just the truncated gospel, but the fullness of the gospel with all of its requisite reconciling realities. That we would walk in the fullness of that in this world. That was soundbite number one. Number two is that in light of that, in terms of walking out this journey together in increasing ways, trying to sort out how to live together, is that we would be, among other things, radically committed to the ongoing formation of our spirits, our souls becoming more alive in God. Again, not just for our own lives, though that is a big part of it. But as we do that, then we can turn our face out towards the world and together show something about the hands and the feet and the face of Jesus to show the world there is a different kind of way. And as part of that process, we're going to be developing a center for spiritual formation, the shape of which is not yet determined by any stretch, but just a place where we can wonder about how to grow in that kind of life together. So that was the second part of the soundbite last week. And so then finally, in this hard work of formation and walking out life together, that when we think in terms of succession, we think simply in terms of that which is coming next, where we transition sort of our minds and our hearts from this idea of succession being found in a person who is capable of drawing large crowds of people, but that consistent with how the people of God have always walked out this journey, it's just simply a journey of faith stepping into the unknown together. And so succession is simply trying to follow out that which is coming next. And doing that together, and in those places, sorting out the kind of pathways down which God is leading us. So it's a brief picture of the vision that was unrolled last week. And I know I'm biased, this is my church, but there's something about that vision that struck a deep chord in me, And for many different reasons, but among them was this idea that in those spaces of walking out this life together, committed to formation, sake of the world, I kind of felt connected to all of those believers who have gone on before in this faith journey, the many generations. And then just replaying our part in the grand story of what God has always been up to and leaving then behind for those who are coming next. Don't know what it all looks like, but it's wonderful to think in terms of just increasingly sorting out life together and walking in that space. But as we take our first step into that kind of vision, because it sounds great when it's all up here and that's what the people of God are up to. What I realized this past week is we're standing on the cusp of taking our first step into this, that it's quite possible and, in fact, quite probable that the shape of that first step, however that looks, is that we may just encounter some resistance along the way. And so it's the shape of that step and wondering about the potential for resistance and what that might look like as we continue to walk out this journey together that is the point of the talk this morning. And so with that, let's go ahead and pray as we begin and just start wondering together what this might look like. God, I just have had even ringing in my ears since last night that you are so for us. And that in being for us, you call us down pathways of life. And so my prayer for me even, in the shape of this word, but for us as well, that among the many things we would see is simply the wonder of your face on the pathway of life, calling us forward as one who is so utterly for us. We ask these things in your son's name and by the power of your spirit. Amen. So last week I was walking into the service before the 11 o'clock hour, somewhere walking over there, and Terry Steinmeier just about accosted me. It was almost like a flying blitz tackle that he came with as I was walking in, just trying to get my five children oriented again to their space. And Terry grabbed onto me and he said, Peter, I was going to text you this week. I forgot, busy week, but I know you're speaking next weekend and I don't know for sure where you are going, but Dave is speaking out of Philippians 1.27 this week and it's all about standing in one mind and one spirit for the sake of the gospel. Then he said, but Peter, have you read what comes next? For in verse 28, as was read this morning, and Terry pointed it out, he said, don't be alarmed by the opposition. Don't be alarmed, church at Philippi, by the resistance. And so Terry and I chatted for about two minutes back there about the potential for opponents or resistance and what that might even look like. And sort of just noting that, well, interesting, that as soon as they started walking out this faith that there might just be some resistance. Of course, I thought about that and thought about, well, of course. Because one of the more common patterns of the New Testament is the active and ongoing resistance to the gospel. For everywhere that the early followers went, the road was difficult. God was clearly moving on one side, obviously, but resistance was clearly mounting on the other side of it. It happened all the time. I remember many years ago, and maybe if you were here, you remember this too, that Dave was walking through, yes, back then, the book of Acts, and he was discussing this dynamic from the pulpit and this pattern that we see in the New Testament. And his phrase, and again, maybe you remember this, it's one of those phrases that for some reason will stick with me till I die, and the phrase was this, that when the wind of the Spirit begins to blow. It is met with the waves of resistance. Anybody remember that? The wind and the waves? Yeah, many of you. And this pattern was so persistent and profound that the early followers of Jesus recognized that it had to be more than just flesh and blood because it was happening everywhere they went. And so Paul writes that the early followers of Jesus saw something about perhaps even this present darkness. It's not just against flesh and blood, but there will be a spiritual dimension to this that we don't always fully understand that is this present darkness. And so everywhere they went, as the wind of God blew, the waves came. Look through any page of the text and following Jesus is never all that easy. And Jesus says that, yeah, you follow me. I promise you that there will be a power of a kind in my kingdom that can actually upend the world. It can actually change the face of things. But make no mistake, if you choose to follow me, there's another dimension to this, that if you follow me, he says, I promise you that the Son of Man has no place to lay his head, and that there just may be a cross in front of you, which all of the early followers of the faith discovered, especially the 12 disciples, all of them were killed for their faith. Other than John, who I'm sure had a lovely time exiled on the island of Patmos. So thinking about this dynamic and following Jesus being difficult, it's something that, quite frankly, I don't hear a lot about in some of our Christian suburban culture. I mean, Hallie hates it when we're watching TV at night and flipping through the channels and trying to find something to watch. And inevitably, I'll flip through the channel that shows the TV preacher, you know, and I'm just enough of a nerd to go, oh, I want to see what he has to say, right? And the message that I hear over many channels and in many places, filling stadiums, is this idea. That if you have enough faith and if you have the right kind of faith, then God promises you will have your best life now. and that life that's best is defined by you and it's what you want. It makes me want to just shout at the TV, just say, have you read the Bible? I have yet to see a TV preacher work through the end of Hebrews 11, right? Where these people in this great chapter of faith certainly had enough faith, probably the right kind of faith. In fact, it says that their faith was so profound that this world was not worthy of them, and those people were torn in two, set about in caves, no place to lay their head, no clothes on their back, and it said of the profound nature of their faith, this world was not worthy, and yet following Jesus was incredibly difficult because the pattern of the text is that when the God of heaven begins to move, it is always met with some kind of resistance. I think we get that at Open Door. At least I know it's been sort of part of our DNA over the many years together. Many other churches too. I think we know and can even think about our own lives, right? Where there's this sense God is leading us into something, but we start taking steps in that way. We start moving in that way. And pretty soon it gets a little foggy or a little weird or there's some active resistance to all of that. I wonder if there really is a thief who comes to steal and kill and destroy. I wonder if that's part of the deal. So then last week, Dave gave us a history of open door, just a little window of that, of these different seasons where we've stood on the cusp of something new and God's spirit was going to blow many seasons of time in which God has led us in the spaces in which we've walked as a people. Not always easy. Quite often we haven't done it well, but there is this ongoing sense of the reconciling work of God among us. And so now we stand again, he said last week, and I agree, on the cusp of a new season. Which then, in light of my conversation with Terry, made me think, could there be potential opposition? Here, as we take our first steps into this, and if there is, would it be in a whom? Would it be in a what? Would the opposition be from without or could it be coming from within? Didn't know. I thought about it this past week and talked with the message team a little bit. Just wondered. Hard to know. Talked with Hallie at length, just wondering. But as we wondered, there were some things that began to sort of emerge, at least dial up on my radar a bit, on our radar, and just began to wonder about maybe it's not in a whom or in a place per se. but what kept coming up on my radar is just the shape of our culture today and the landscape of our world and what's all there as we step our feet out just these doors and start stepping into the space of the way our culture is moving and spinning and I thought about, I want to take a step into this but quite frankly, I don't know that I know how. Sometimes when you speak in these situations up front like this. You're bringing some dimension of the text or some word from the text, and it's something that you maybe have walked in for 10 or 15 or 20 years of your life. So you kind of just bring that word in that way, having some experience with that word in the shape of that. And one of the things I noticed in the preparation for this sermon over the last couple of weeks is that as the resistance kept coming, I thought, oh, I'm part of that resistance. I don't even know how to walk in these things. Bringing a word that I have yet to even sort of walk in myself. I can see the truth potentially of some things, but I don't really even know how to walk in it. So let me try to explain a little bit more as we wonder about this vision, because what kept coming up were two things. One is we're going to turn our face increasingly towards the culture, towards the world, offer something of God to this world. And also, we want to increasingly become a people together in this space, committed with one mind and one heart to the gospel of Jesus and started seeing some resistance. The resistance was primarily because I don't know how to do this. All right, so take just even changing the face of our culture. Again, Jesus says, you follow me. I promise there's a power available that can upend the world or change the face of the culture. As I thought about that, and even was reflecting back these last couple of weeks, I teach a course at Northwestern called Leadership in Ministry. And it is to a series of ministry majors. And most of them come in assuming that ministry means they're going to get a vocation in a church or in some kind of non-profit organization. And they don't think much in terms of ministry being working out the realities of a reconciling God who is for us into a culture that doesn't even see it anymore. Ministry is something that happens in a place with a steeple and pews and a sign, and I'm going to get a job in ministry. Even during class, they were on Google and looking up ministry, and that's what it showed. So I put up on the phrase, this idea of minister, up on the board, this phrase, this idea of ministry and thinking about leading in an organization. So I put this up. I said, all right, leadership in organizational management. I said, if this class was to prepare you to lead an organization called the church with a steeple and pews and a sign, what kind of topic should we cover in this class? And they started brainstorming together and we generated this list about what we need to do. And the first one, of course, that came up is that we would need to teach people how to do a sermon. Because church isn't church without a sermon, right? So I said, all right, we do a sermon. And one thing we need to teach about sermons is that you better start out with an introduction that really hooks the audience. And did you know that you're an audience, not a people? so once you're hooked because I only have seven seconds to hook you right and this whole thing now I've got to come up with three points I don't know why three always maybe it's Trinitarian or something but three points that are nicely alliterated so that you can remember them all no I never seem to remember them all and then I have a nice ending with a poem or a song to really drive it home now that I've created space in your heart. I can pound in with a poem. Got your sermon. So we've got to have that. Another thing we need to have is an ability to plan a service. We need to know what kind of songs we're going to sing. We need to have just the right number of songs. And there needs to be sort of this flow to these songs that is psychologically appropriate. So we sort of just kind of keep leading this way and this way. We need to know when we're going to have the offering. We need to know how much space to give to a sermon. We need to just get everything shaped just right. Now, I didn't teach him anything about benedictions, as you know, I can't do those, so we didn't even go to that space. We wondered further and we started talking about, well, we would likely need to have somebody to teach us a bit about human resources. We would need to develop a budget. We would need to have somebody to manage the staff. We would have to take personality tests to make sure everybody's fitting in their right spot. And then, once we have everything in place, we need to take the time to do a demographic analysis of the culture so we know all about you and your income levels and your stratas and what you care about so we can shape this whole service to make sure we meet the realities of what people are looking for because my budget tells me that I've got to have just enough money to fund this organization. And if I can determine how many giving units we need, I guess I looked at him when we were talking about giving units and I said, if you ever dare to call the wonderful people of God filled at the Imago Dei a giving unit, I will hunt you down. But we get just enough giving units to fund the organization to keep going so I can have a job in ministry. And then we make sure from our demographic analysis that we mark it appropriately. Big billboard, a church alive is worth the drive. Something like that. So then we sat back and looked at that list and I asked them the question. I said, does anybody see a problem here? And they wondered about it. And I looked up at the board and I said, now think about it, you're taking this class from me. Right, me. wouldn't it be better for me to just walk down the street of this university into the business department and grab a few people from the MBA program to teach you how to do some of this stuff because they'd probably be far better than me at teaching you how to do a budget how to have a staff how to do demographic analysis how to develop a marketing plan could I not go down the street a different direction and find a good speech writer for you that can do hooks far better than me? And couldn't we hire the person who did my kid's birthday to plan the service? What I realized, again, in all of this space is that there's no real resistance here to building an organization other than our own talents and our own capacities. So we just have to hire the right people, the most talented people among us, and if we do that well enough, and if we do it better than even other organizations with a steeple and pew and sign, if we do it better than them, we might just be able to grow this whole organization. So we sat in that space, and I looked at him, I said, there's nothing about this that causes me to come up short. But, and then I flipped the switch for them in class, I said, what would it be like to turn your face towards the culture. To wonder if the church is actually the people as living stones, as we've been talking about in here, in those living stones together, forming together to fill and fit the house of God so that we turn our face towards the culture. If we did that, might we begin to come up short? Then I started presenting some scenarios with them. They're just dumb, silly scenarios. Some of them started out that way, but the first one I remember time, maybe 20 years ago, Hallie and I were down in the inner city of Chicago just serving food to the community. We had distributed tickets to the community to just come for some food, just be provided for in some way. And so I was the ticket guy, you know, making sure that I get the ticket when they come in because, oh, you got to have a ticket to get your food. And as I was standing there, this huge hulk of a man, just gigantic, stood up. You could have eaten me on the spot. And I said, could I have your ticket, please? He said, when he opened up his shirt, and he revealed his chest, and there was a scar running from here all the way down to his belly, he said, this is my ticket. What do you do with that in that moment? How do I speak life? If I give him the food, somebody who doesn't have, or won't get food that does have a ticket, He goes, what do I do? I'm a silly example. I didn't know what to do. I can do demographic analysis. I didn't know what to do when confronted with flesh and blood. And I thought about Dave's example last week. I used it even, or two weeks ago, I used it with my class about his friend who attended his niece's wedding. That is a gay wedding ceremony. I was listening this last week to a pastor on the internet just briefly to try to get a shape of some of the conversation here in this. And this pastor was saying, under no circumstances should you ever, ever go to a wedding like that. You are perpetrating the moral depravity of our culture itself, and you will go down with that ship too. All right, and then you listen to the other side of this, and we're going to inspire, I know, churches, vision statements to just going to be all-inclusive, we're bringing everybody in, and it was Dave's wet grandma hug in that. And I don't know what to do. I asked my students, I said, how do you find the tension of grace and truth at the same time? It is impossible that sometimes attending the ceremony is going to create an incredible pathway of life and light, and sometimes maybe not. And how will you know? And it's coming up short, really, in this. I thought about another scenario, happened a few years ago in a conference that I was doing with my friend Becky Patton. And after one of the sessions, a man came up with tears in his eyes. And the session was a bit about abuse. Really difficult session. And so often after those sessions, there's a handful of people that come up and said, yeah, that was my story. And in that space, there is room for hope and for healing and some first steps of the journey back towards reconciliation. And that is difficult enough to figure out how to walk in as somebody who just wants to turn their face and bring Jesus into this culture. Don't know how, don't know what to say. But this guy brought something different to the table. And with tears in his eyes, he looked at me and he said, Peter, I was one of the perpetrators of the abuse. I think he had been in jail. And he desperately did not want to do that kind of thing ever again, but he wasn't even certain he could say that for sure. Could build an organization, flesh and blood, people with real things going on and real realities in this world, no idea what to say. None in that moment. Instead, this is sort of a sermon or a word that is starting to get into the pictures of this and stuff. I don't know how to walk in this stuff. Yet, what do we do with stem cell research? What do we do with the environment? Because that's not confusing or polarizing. Should we eat genetically modified food? What do we do as our children are increasingly being tethered to their technology? It's funny, this last week in class, I've been telling the story all week, and I laugh every time still that I tell it, but I don't know why it came up in class and how it came up. We were talking just about the sacredness, I think, of technology in our culture. So I grabbed my phone, my nice pretty little iPhone here. You know, it's beautiful and elegant or however else they market it all, right? And I held it up, and I just dropped it from about this height onto the ground. And the whole class just went, oh! This huge gasp, right? and I was interesting so I picked it up and I dropped it again and one girl in the front row put her hand over her heart and she shouted mercy it was from the bowels of her being it was like she was watching the end of Braveheart or something right mercy and then they're like what would you have done if it would have broke? And I said, it would have broke. It's a pile of metal. It'll be as relevant about as long as a bag of chips is in the evening for me when I'm hungry. So we've been using that. I've made it a spiritual discipline, actually, to drop my phone each day. I'm dropping it on carpet right now because it still is a little difficult. But I'll get there. what do we do with the people around us when the marriages are exploding or our marriage explodes just kind of sit there awkwardly and don't know what to say don't know how to bring the shape of reconciliation into those moments poverty injustice everything that's out there i read a article this last week from a nobel prize winning economist who was saying that in his observations of the global environment in this upcoming year, what he's seeing is that he's seeing a transition around the globe from just low levels of anxiety to outright fear. Just fear everywhere he goes. And we, again, have the audacity to say, oh, it is well with my soul. And you make me brave. And you are for us in the midst of that. That's a pretty big wave. and I don't know how to walk it out. Who do we think we are? That we might actually, again, have the audacity to connect ourselves with the bigger story and to wonder what God might be up to. So that was one part of it. The second part of it, because if that seems like it was difficult, that is a picnic compared to the other part of this vision and that is to increasingly become a people who are walking together, united with one mind and one heart and one spirit for the sake of a gospel that we're still trying to get our head around, not the truncated one, but the fullness of that and walking that out together in our culture. That's difficult. When I was doing my PhD research from the University of Edinburgh, and by the way, that's your cue to start tuning out for whenever someone says, when I was doing my PhD research, it's really a good time to just shut it down for a while. Because PhD research shows that 98% of PhD research is utterly unreadable and hideously boring. But when I was doing my PhD research, I actually ended up doing field work in about a dozen churches here in our Minneapolis area. It was qualitative field work. I was studying specifically why our youth are leaving our churches in droves. What's going on? What are the dynamics at play? And in all the interviews of the priests and the pastors and the church leaders and the lay leaders and the families and the youth, there was this common pattern that just kept emerging. And it didn't matter if it was a Catholic church or a Protestant church. It didn't matter if it was liberal or conservative. The very same dynamic was present in all of these churches as people described their life. A life of just careening around. a life in which there was no margin, filled with stress and anxiety as they were trying to keep up with everyone and everything. And even trying to get ahead in some kind of way. And so they were living in these crazy fragmented environments where they're running over here and they have their friends in church. And then they're running over here and they have their friends on their job. And they're running over here and they have environments of maybe their social clubs or their academic clubs or their traveling teams or their academic camps or whatever it is. And then they're texting over here trying to keep up and Facebooking over here and tweeting this over here and trying to live in all of these environments just in this fear that if they don't keep up, they'll be left behind socially or they won't be able to get ahead. Because it really does nothing for the resume to come to church and to say, I don't know where I'd even put it on my resume. You know what I did the last five years? I spend time with the people learning how to grow together in love for the sake of the gospel in one mind and one spirit turning our face out towards the world. That's how I spent my time. Pretty sure Carleton's not going to give us $40,000 a year for that, right? But these families are careening from play and my family too. I actually mean it when I say that for me this is bringing something to the table that is as revealing of my own life, and it kind of takes my breath away. And I don't know what to do running and fragmented and trying to keep up and wanting the best for my kids, and the best must possibly be that they have every opportunity in front of them, that that's my job. And the anxiety was growing exponentially among the people I was interviewing. Because in this fragmented life, where I'm over here and over here and over here and over here and up here and down here. And none of those environments are connected anymore. You know, when I was growing up, I grew up in the Plymouth area, and it was the sticks back then. It was like Plymouth and Dundee Nursery, and that's all that was there back then. If we made it to Medina Ballroom, it was like, wow, I think that's the edge of the earth. I'm not even sure Columbus got this far, right? And the relational environments in which I lived and moved were interconnected. I saw a lot of the same kinds of people, And some of them were just those people who are the elders of this faith journey, whether they even know they're elders or not. They create a holding place for our youth. They're walking it out in a way you can kind of smell them in some kind of way as they're just holding this together. And if you just scratch them a little bit, the wonders of some of this kingdom stuff would come out. Our youth don't live that way. Our families don't live that way. We're running frantically from place to place to place. And the only commonality in this story anymore is me. No greater story. Disconnected. I've watched my kids again at the university environment in these last 10 years that maybe one or so 10 years ago would have been struggling with anxiety and would have needed some concessions from me as a prof to help them along the way. Now, out of 100 kids any given semester, I would say probably 30 to 40 of them are struggling with anxiety. Incredible spike of that. Hard enough to turn our face towards the world. And to do that kind of work, we need to become a people united together. Oh, now I come up short. Really. I don't have what it takes to figure it out. Just 15 minutes of the landscape out there that I've tried to look into and give a window for you. And I think, guessing you could bring many more things to the table than what I'm saying this morning. But just a quick survey of the landscape. And it makes me think, I don't have what it takes. Which, actually, is a beautiful place to be. Not just for our church, but for all of life, really. for when we finally see that we can't possibly do the work that we're called to do, then maybe we actually stand a chance. Some 2,000 years ago, Jesus called out 12 followers at first. They weren't the MBAs and the psychologists that could do personality profiles. They were fishermen that couldn't even fish. Tax collectors, weird ragtag group of people, certainly didn't have what it takes. He said, we're going to change the face of things. Now, I don't know in your mind's eye what you hear, but there may have been among these young men and then eventually some of the followers of Jesus, too, men and women, both this growing sort of, yeah, maybe we can, maybe we can, maybe we can do this, and they start getting filled with all this, we can bond together and figure all this stuff out, and We're going to come up against Rowan, we're going to get really big, and we're going to be able to certainly sort it out. I had this silly picture in my mind this last week of that great scene in Les Miserables where these young men are getting all geared up, these French revolutionists, and finally they burst out, you know, read the blood of angry men. And I should never really sing, I'm really sorry. But getting really big. And there's part of me even in this last week, well, I'll just bring my full PhD to bear and this whole thing, we'll be able to sort it out. Then you start coming up short. And Jesus took these 12 men and the followers alongside of them, men and women both, and he set them on a hillside. And the very first words that he said to them, before they ever even got started with any of this, before they took their first step into the realities to which he was calling, he says, just know this. Blessed are the poor in spirit. for theirs is the kingdom of God, which literally means blessed are those that know they don't have what it takes. For to them, the wonders of the kingdom of God begin to unfold. Blessed are those who come up short. This is part again of the DNA of our church from many years ago. I remember the first time I heard that in a sweaty gymnasium. Coming up short is part of life. We don't like that with our rugged individualism here in America. We'll make a way. Coming up short is a way of life. And Jesus is saying, what I'm calling you to do, you will have no capacity in and of yourselves to do. And when that hits deep inside, then you start having a chance. Because you no longer look at what you can all do to sort it all out and bring the best and the brightest to build an organization with a sign and steeple in pews. instead from the place of bending your knee and bending my knee, we echo with the words of the psalmist. And so I lift my eyes to the hills. For where does our help come from? It comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth. And that word help there is the Hebrew word ezer, and it simply means a strong and powerful help all without which humankind will die. It's the only way. The shape of the opposition, I don't know what it looks like, but lift our eyes to the hills. I found it so interesting in my class that week, because we went through all these scenarios, and I started talking about abuse, or gay marriage, or stem cell research, and all these things, and God bless them, these young men and women, you know, we'd bring up these scenarios, and And they're all like, well, we could do this. And we could do that. And we could do this. And we could do, and yes, do those things. And we need an organization. And I get all of that. But every time they're like, we could do this. Then all of a sudden they would realize, but wait, that's, but wait, but wait. And then they were starting to come up short. And I found it fascinating that not one of the kids said, I know. Why don't we lift our eyes to the hills? Not one. I had a student come up afterwards. He's like, well, that stunk. You gave me like the Jesus juke here. The answer was Jesus the whole time. I said, yeah, it kind of was. I don't even know how to walk that bit out terribly well. So to build an organization with steeple pews and signs, lots of people can do that. But to wrestle against flesh, more than just flesh and blood, to call out life in the dead places, to speak light into the darkness, to have wisdom in the moment, to help with the words of life that come, to help shape somebody's reality moving forward into pathways that will bring healing, to not live an exhausted life. Anybody in here as tired as I am? Don't know how to do that. But together as a people, we might just bend our knees and go back to that space of knowing that in our lives alone and in our lives together, we don't have what it takes. It's an exciting first step. And so let me close with this. I think it's interesting what Paul says in Philippians 1.28. He says this weird phrase at the end. I didn't know what it meant at first before digging into it. He said, I know you will stand firm in one spirit, striving together as one for the faith of the gospel, without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. And then this is the weird phrase that he said at the end. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved. Then you know what that meant at first, as I said, but as I started investigating that further, I guess to think about it this way, is that so often, and this is a historical truth about church and culture, You can study it through any time or any place in history, even today, that so often happens is that the culture and the way things are in the culture begins to blend together with the church so that the two become almost indistinguishable from one another. It's called syncretism is actually the fancy word for that. It's when the culture and the church begin to come together, the church begins to adopt the philosophies of the culture. So to give you a quick example, if you read Asian Christian theology ever, I don't know why you would, but if we did, what we would find is that in Asian Christian theology, the theologians never really refer to Jesus as Lord or King. Not because Jesus isn't, but because within the scope of that landscape, of that culture, the lords of that culture are often the perpetrators of the oppression. And so Jesus is always the suffering brother and the suffering servant. read American Christianity and the theologians hardly ever do you get the idea of Jesus as the suffering brother or suffering servant Jesus is Lord and he is Lord they're just one of those things where church and culture come together and so we build organizations with steeples, pews, and signs just like Apple, just like Google trying to do it a little bit better than everybody else and the problem with that is as we live in that way, no longer can you see with clarity that there is a pathway of life and a pathway of destruction. You can't see that anymore. It's actually terrifying. It's like, where is that life? It all looks the same. But what Paul is saying in this verse is that if you stand united in this way in one spirit for the sake of the gospel, but with the reconciling realities of that, you will begin to unwed yourselves from the realities of what's going on. You will rend yourselves from that, and in that space, you will begin to see with greater clarity that that pathway is destruction and this pathway is life. So come to the pathway of life and walk it out that way and sort that out that way. This isn't a message about being anti-technology or anti-organization. It's none of that. It's trying to create space in our eyes and in my eyes and in our heart that there is a pathway to walk in this. And my iPhone is going to end up in the trash someday. It really will. But the eternal and everlasting kingdom of God will remain. And that's the only pathway. And I barely know how to see it in the landscape of this culture. So I invite you to stand. And just we'll lift our eyes just briefly in prayer. As we take this halting first step into what it is that we believe God has called us to as a church. now let's pray God by your spirit I ask that you would again allow us to see the pathways of life that again you are so for us as just that father figure that parent figure that mother figure on the one path just walk towards my face just learn to take those first steps towards my face let us see in the eyes of our spirit and our hearts what it is that you're calling us to to do that work so that we actually can be empowered to not just build an organization but to change the face of things we ask these things in your son's name and by the power of your spirit amen and blessings as you go Thank you.
