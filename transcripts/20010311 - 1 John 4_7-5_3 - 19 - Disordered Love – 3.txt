In one of the commentaries that I've been using for our study in 1 John over these months, David Jachman cites the first century historian Jerome. It's telling us that John, in a quote that I read to you actually a few months ago, that John, in the gathering midst of his twilight years, spoke with what he called magnificent monotony of the love of God through Christ. When he finally became so weak that he, that is John, could no longer preach, he was carried into the gathering of believers and contended himself with one singular word of exhortation, little children, love one another. When his hearers grew tired of that message and asked him why he so frequently repeated it, he said, it's what the master wanted. And if this is all you do, it would be enough. It is in that spirit that I would ask you to once again this morning, open your Bibles to 1 John chapter 4, where we will hear these simple words for the seventh week in a row. As the basis of our study, 1 John 4, verse 7, Beloved, let us love one another. For love is from God, and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. Verse 11, Beloved, since God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. Verse 21. And this is the commandment that we heard from him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also. Indeed, this is the message that we have heard from the beginning. He says in chapter 3, verse 11, that we should love one another. For the last several weeks, born of our study in 1 John 4, I've been inviting you to participate with me in the complexity and mystery of what love looks like and to struggle with me about and relative to how love looks different in different situations with different people at different times. And the reason this struggle is worth it, we have discovered, and the reason we, quite frankly, are spending so much time on it is because when love is rightly ordered, according to chapter 4, verse 12, it has the power to reveal the face of God. For no man has seen God at any time. But if we love one another, it has the power to reveal the face of God, to reflect the very image of God. But we have also discovered over these weeks, the opposite of that is true as well. For while rightly ordered love has the power to reveal the face of God, to reflect the very image of God, Few things have more power on earth to distort the face of God, disfigure the image of God, than what we've been referring to for the last couple of weeks, and again this week as disordered love. Rightly ordered love, we discovered last week, is in a word agape, the Greek word for love. There are four Greek words for love. We spoke of them last week. Eros, phileo, storge, and agape. Eros is sexual love. Phileo, friendship love. Storge, family love. But agape is the word John uses all through his epistle. And in particular as being the kind of love that has the power to reveal the face of God, the image of God. And agape love broadly defined, and we struggled last week with a definition indicating that it's really hard to just pin it down. But what works for me in terms of something that really fleshes out I can grab onto is this. That agape love is the kind of love that walks in the awareness of. It's the kind of love that is alive to the reality of the life and presence of God in other people. Agape love is at the root of what we call around here incarnational relationships. Let me throw that phrase around. If you want to know what that means, that's what it means. It means that I'm aware of Christ in you and you are aware of Christ in me. And that's how we can relate to each other in an incarnational way. And that awareness is also at the foundation of all true community in the family of God. Agape love is able to see things. And that's going to be a powerful metaphor all through this word this morning. Agape love has an ability to see what is true. And what it is able to see is not only Christ in me, but it is able also to see Christ in you. I love sermons. Hearing them, I love preaching them that talk about Christ in me. That remind me that I am the temple of the living God. That I am the dwelling place of the living God. Agape love brings me beyond recognizing what I am and who I am. Agape, you see, is not only able to recognize that I am the temple of the Holy Spirit and I am the dwelling place of God, but so are you. See, that begins to affect how I relate to you. Even if you aren't a person of faith. I mean, I can kind of get my arms around it if I'm talking about Christians, even though I sometimes have conflicts, real serious ones with Christians, and need to be reminded. But what if they aren't a person of faith? Well, even if they aren't a person of faith, even if they're not someone particularly easy to like, maybe even an enemy, this kind of love walks in the awareness that they are at least bearers of the image of God. Bearers of the image of God. Admittedly, that image is sometimes very hard to spot in people. I can promise you that if you saw me in certain contexts at certain not very nice times in my life, you would have a hard time when you looked at me seeing anything that resembled the image of God. and I'm pretty sure that I could see you in certain contexts of your life where you probably wouldn't want anybody to see you acting that particular way, then it would be very hard for me to in you at that moment see the image of God, see you as a bearer of the image of God. You see, the truth is this. We all know this instinctively somehow, that we have all been horribly disfigured by selfishness and sin, by arrogance and hate. Sometimes that arrogance and hate spewed upon us. sometimes the arrogance and hate pouring from us. In fact, I can't think of anything, quite frankly, that would have more power to obscure the image of God, making it more difficult for me to see the image of God in a person than rage. I mean, God is love, and if I see you or you see me enraged, it's really hard at that moment to see the image of God, but bearers of the image nonetheless are we, even in that awful place of rage. And relating to people, in the context of that awareness, this is again what we mean by incarnational relationships. It's at the very heart of what we call rightly ordered love. C.S. Lewis said it this way in a quote I gave you last week. That rightly ordered love is the kind of love that is able to clearly see and discern that there are no ordinary people. That you have never met a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations, these are mortal and their life is to ours as to that of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we work with, joke with, marry, snub, and exploit. Next to the blessed sacrament itself, your neighbor is the holiest object presented to your senses. Now, walking in the awareness of that reality, I said last week, brings order to all your other loves. Walking in the fullness of agape love It brings order to your eros, to my eros, to phileo, to storge. In other words, agape is not just some special occasion love that I pull out in extreme situations where superhuman, supernatural love is required, like the kind that's required when I'm loving somebody I don't like very much. Rather, I tried to frame this in a way that indicated and made clear that agape love is the kind of love I need every day in everyday life in order to rightly love my wife, my children, my friends. Agape love brings order to all my other loves. It brings order to my sexuality. It brings order to my family. It brings order to my friendships for this simple reason. It is almost impossible to use people, exploit, coerce, manipulate, disregard, or discard people if I see people as a bearer of the image. it's really hard to be trying to suck life from someone using or manipulating them if I see them really see them as the temple of the Holy Spirit the dwelling place of God His prized possession the reality is in the course of relationships we have conflict with people even with people we love and authentically love we disagree with each other we argue with each other sometimes we need to confront each other I may have issues with you and tension with someone, might even need to get to a point in a relationship where the right thing to do is to kind of even have a separation from someone for a while, to say no to someone for a while, but it doesn't have to go to contempt. It doesn't have to move into hate. I love how Dallas Willard says it in his book Divine Conspiracy. When I treasure those around me, he says, and see them as God's creatures designed for his eternal purposes, in other words, when I see them rightly, when I really do see them as God's creatures and when I really do see them as those who are designed for His eternal purposes I do not, in addition to that, need to make a special note to myself to be sure not to hate them. I don't have to make a special note to myself when I'm seeing them rightly. To not discard, use or otherwise treat them with contempt. Not doing those things is simply part of the package that comes with seeing them rightly. Now, conversely, disordered love is marked by and brings with it a horrible kind of blindness. Rightly ordered love sees things. Disordered love is blind to things. And this blindness is what allows us, believe it or not, it's what empowers us to use people. So you have to be blind to use people. It's what empowers us to enslave, manipulate, coerce people, to disregard and eventually discard people with impunity. See, if I don't see you as a bearer of the image, if I don't see you as someone in whom the very life of God dwells, as the temple of the Holy Spirit, it's just no big deal if I use, exploit, or manipulate you. In fact, if I'm bigger, stronger, smarter, faster, and richer, I kind of feel like I have a right to use you. It just doesn't matter if I discard you. It's the law of the jungle. to the survival of the fittest. To the victor goes to spoils. Grow up, Dave. It's just the way life works. In the extreme, maybe the most horrific example of this blind disregard is manifested in things, again, in the extreme, like murder and rape. I want you to think about what must be the psychology of a person. What must be the interior life of someone who is capable of committing premeditated murder or rape to, in the most literal sense of the word, discard someone by murdering them. Or to, in the literal sense of the word, degrade, humiliate, and use them, rape. What that requires, I mean, it's almost like you have to take a course before you can murder someone or rape someone. To that extreme level, use them for yourself. It requires this, that you be absolutely blind. You have to be blind to the reality that the person you are discarding, degrading, despising, using, and slandering is a bearer of the image. You couldn't possibly see them as a bearer of the image and do that. You have to be blind to the fact that they are a temple of the Holy Spirit, a dwelling place of God. now that's the extreme what I want you to get though is that disordered love is not always marked by murder, slander and rape that's not the common denominator sometimes it does go there but the common denominator and this is the place where all of us kind of can find our entry point the common denominator of disordered love is that it is marked by a kind of blindness that keeps us from seeing people rightly as bearers of the image that keeps us from loving them well. And because I can't see you rightly as a bearer of the image, as a person in whom the life of God dwells, my assessment of your value becomes based on something other than what is true about you as a bearer of the image. I see something else. Now, to get to this, let me remind you of what Paul said in 1 Philippians 1, verse 9. This is a verse that I've kind of pulled in from time to time in the course of this study. Paul said this, And this I pray, that your love would abound still more and more. In real knowledge and all discernment. In real knowledge and all discernment of what love really is and what people are really like. I still pray that your love would still abound. Next verse, and this is one I haven't gone through too in this study, is this. My prayer that your love may abound is in order that you may be able to approve that which is excellent. The word there approve means to essay, to assess, to discern. My prayer is this. That by love abounding in you, you would be able to walk through life being able to discern what matters most. What is excellent. 1 Corinthians 12 says that the excellent way is what? Love. My prayer is that abounding love in you would help you see what matters most. What matters most is love. And what love helps you do is see clearly what's true about people. That they're bearers of the image. The people who are of faith are people in whom the life of God dwells. But if you are not abounding in love, if you do not have rightly ordered love, you're blind. You won't be able to see. And you will begin to evaluate people on another level, on another basis entirely. We will begin to assess their value based on how they what? How they look. Why is that? Because you're a bad, evil person. No, that's all you can see. That's all you can see. Why? Because you're blind. And you will evaluate them on where they live and what they drive. how wealthy they may be. You're getting it wrong. There's nothing wrong with looking good. There's nothing wrong with living in a nice place, driving in... But to assess people's value on that means you're blind. You don't see that they're bearers of the image. You're blind to that. I have a daughter. I have two daughters, actually. Our second daughter is Erica. She's 23. And I think my daughter is absolutely beautiful in every conceivable way. I think my daughter, Erica, is physically beautiful. I love to look at her smile. Her face lights up. I think she has the kind of beauty that matters most as well. She has a heart for God, a laugh that's bizarre. There it was. I just heard it. And I know I'm totally biased because this is a father speaking, but I need to tell you the truth. I think I'm seeing her rightly. I really do. Now, there's a number of things, a number of ways she's like me, and a number of ways she's not like me at all. But one of the ways, there's a little passion we share, and that is we both love to work out. She just loves to sweat. She's a sweat freak, and she loves to go to the club and work out, and she's into aerobics, and she's got just a delightful group of friends around her that just love her like crazy, and she loves them. They're just this wonderful group of young people. And she's always trying to me to get to go to her aerobics class, and I never do because I think I'll die. But all of that serves as a backdrop for this strange conversation I had with her this week, middle of the week. I don't remember what day. It doesn't matter. She was sitting there, and out of the blue, she kind of said, I hate the club. I hate the club. You go to the club every day. You love the club. You go there all, what do you mean you hate the club? I poked at that. What is that about? And she was angry. There was an anger in her, but it was, yeah, you've seen this kind of thing in people, in yourself. The anger was the kind that if you poked it like a little bit, she'd start to cry. And she said, I said, why? Why do you hate the club about? She goes, I just feel like there's this image of how you have to look. And if you don't look this certain way, you just, people don't see it. It doesn't matter. You don't get valued. Apparently, she was speaking from a place that didn't feel like she had. Whatever that look was supposed to be, she didn't have it. People weren't seeing. So last week, I'm going to get back to that story. This will tie into that. But Larry Crabb was with us Friday and Saturday, and some of us were just fortunate enough to have the time to go and be with him. And he was talking about the kinds of things that the human heart desires as it relates to relating to other people. And the kind of things, even if we're not aware of it, the kind of things we really want to experience in community. And he kind of built his whole weekend around four words. And the three that I was able to be with him around were this desire to know and be known, this desire to explore people and be explored, and the desire to discover and be discovered. And he just talked about how exhilarating it is to be in a relationship with someone where you can tell they're interested enough in you to want to know you. And then to be known by them. And he started asking, what's your greatest delight? What's your greatest fear? And you start opening your soul and someone begins to explore you. And he just told a whole bunch of stories that ignited things in me. I go, yeah, I love that. And then to be discovered. And you go, aha. Because somebody asked questions. It was more than superficial stuff. They started probing. And they saw you and they knew you and they discovered you and explored you. And something comes alive in that. What dawned on me about all that as it relates to this little thing, this little interaction I had with Erica was this. If no one sees you in the first place as having some kind of value, they're never going to want to get to know you, explore you, or discover you. And so what is it that people see that make you want, that make you a person they would want to know? And this is where the blindness comes. See, Erica's lament was if you don't fit this horribly superficial type, you're not going to get seen. You're not going to get valued. You'll never get explored. You'll never be discovered. Here's the problem. People are blind. By the way, you might be thinking these health clubs are so evil. You may never go to a health club, but what I described as the context of that health club is where every one of us live. Because people are blind. And they see us and they evaluate us based on things that have nothing to do with you being a bearer of the image. And you hope to come to church and hope it's different there. Or hope it's different somewhere. one of the pet peeves I have about church and I don't mean that I'm not picking on any church I'm not even picking on our church I'm picking on us I'm picking on everybody us, me, me it's one of my pet peeves about me you have a pet peeve about yourself that's a little bizarre I need help what it is is how much more excited we become when a celebrity gets saved than just an ordinary sinner schmuck person like, you know, you. You know what I'm talking about? Like if Michael Jordan got saved. Wow, good. You know, as if somehow, if somebody who's that cool and that successful acknowledges Christ as Savior, it kind of validates Christ. Like, I mean, even Jesus is going, ah, good. Like, more excited. That's pathetic. That's pathetic. You know, you think about that for two seconds, and you go, no, that's not, no. Then why are we so God-god about that? I don't think it's that it validates God, because immediately we go, God is God, and he just recognized that God is God. Good for him. I'm glad for him. I think we go, ha, ha, ha, because it validates us. You know, if somebody that cool and that successful and that wealthy thinks that God is the thing, then maybe I'm kind of... How pathetic is that? Pretty pathetic. You know, I mean, I don't know how big this is, but I wouldn't, if you were in my family, or hung around, you would know. I do this all the time. We're watching a sports event, and somebody hits a home run. Somebody makes a nice play. Somebody scores a touchdown. And I mean, almost every time I go, did you guys hear that guy's a Christian? And anybody who's been around me long doesn't respond to this anymore. But every once in a while there's a visitor. And all my family, they just go, shut up, Dad, you just... But if there's a visitor, they go, he is? And I go, no, I just wondered if you heard that because I haven't heard that. Maybe just poking at this thing, wouldn't that be cool? Why would that be cool? I think it would be cool for them but that's not why I'm excited I'm excited because somehow in some pathetic way it validates if he thinks he's cool we must be right we don't see very well several years ago when the twins were good and they're going to be good this year I hear hope spring's eternal in the spring in those years when they were winning the world series some of you might even remember this there was a fairly well-known member of the team that got saved then in a very honest real authentic way it was transformed by the life of god in his heart it was kind of public thing people knew he made it public himself and i think a wonderful way and it's just a great thing one sunday in particular, I recall just around that whole time, I'll never forget, was there was just kind of a buzz around the church. We weren't here. We were in either the auditorium. I just remember an auditorium. It was either Cooper or here in Robbinsdale. And there was this buzz this Sunday morning backstage. And you kind of, what's going on? There's people excited about it. And I kind of poked at that and I got the news. He's here. Who? Harry? What? Bob? George? Who's who? Him. He's here. I'm not going to say his name. It was him. Really? I was very cool. I was cool. Well, that's good. I'm glad he's going to hear the gospel. Inside I'm going, oh, I hope he likes me. Hope I'm good. Why, you know, it was a little gaga. Why, why, why, why, because I loved him so much I didn't even know him because I saw him as a bearer of the image well I'd have to think about that that's not why I was reacting that way somehow by this person's presence among us they kind of validated us and without even having a word with him you know what I was doing with him? using him a second life off of him who loves that guy? you ever wonder how that you know some of us would prove we're not affected by the celebrity and be going oh those people are disgusting you don't get it either who sees them as bearers of the image who sees them as someone in whom the life of God dwell who just might need some help who might need someone who would really love him maybe not because he's a celebrity maybe not because they can use him and suck more life out of him See when love is disordered, beloved, it almost always gets it wrong It almost always gets it wrong Either valuing people or things more highly than they ought And the reason we value them is because we can use them We are consumers And devaluing other people As being less valuable than they are And the reason we generally devalue things or people is because we can't consume them. What use are you of to me? Did I say that right? Whatever. Figure it out. The grammar was bad in there somewhere. Make it right. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you. Now we go. Now there are many places in Scripture we could look to find examples of this kind of blindness. I'm talking about this disordered love. But none are more obvious or clear than in the Corinthian church that I said we would get to this week. So blinded by disordered love were the Corinthians that almost every aspect of their community life together that they could have enjoyed had been defiled. In their blindness, they almost always got it wrong, consistently valuing very highly what was of least importance, consistently discarding things and people that mattered most. In chapter 1 to 3, they had disordered phileo, disordered friendships. When I hear about you, I hear there's quarrels, factions, jealousies, and strife. In chapter 5, they had disordered eros, disordered sexuality, immorality of such a kind that does not exist even among the Gentiles. And the bottom line is not just that they were all a bunch of sexually disordered people, it's that they were users. And some people expressed that using-consuming in a sexual way. I'm going to use you to fill me. I'm going to suck you dry to fill me. And sometimes that expresses itself in disordered eros. They had disordered storge, family love. They had just lost how to love and honor each other in marriage. Chapter 10 and 11, chapter 7 was the disordered storge. Chapter 10 and 11, they had disordered worship. So much so was their worship disordered that Paul said in chapter 11 that when you come together, it's not for the better. It's for the worse. They were not coming together from a place of bowing and serving. They were coming from a place of looking to be served. They were coming to church like consumers, consuming goods and services, and their attitude toward God and toward, quite frankly, everybody else in the church was basically this. Fill me, fix me, heal me, help me now. And if you don't fix me, help me, heal me, fill me now, I'll go where I can get that because I am, at the core, a consumer. That's why I'm here. Let me tell you what happens in a community of people that is made up of consumers. You can see it in 1 Corinthians. The grabbiest, most demanding, get their needs met. The most incredible thing happened in their communion table. I'll read about it in just a minute. In their agape feast, it says that some people went away from these feasts. their services full and drunk. Now, I don't even want to go into how on earth could that happen that they would get drunk. Let that be a metaphor then for more than enough. They would walk away with more than they needed. And somebody else would be starving. They would have incredible need. Well, that's because when you have a bunch of consumers, the people who are the grabbiest, the most demanding, get their needs met, the truly needy are ignored. In chapter 13, we see disordered ministry. They had faith to move mountains. In other words, they could get the job done. They prophesied and knew all mysteries. They knew all that they knew the right answers. But they didn't walk in love, which made everything they did worthless. And they didn't have a clue that everything they did was worthless because they were big in a building, a big church. And the reason they didn't have a clue because they were blind. I don't have time to unpack all of those disorders in this church, in that church. But I want to go back and touch on a few. Especially, there's just this excessive over-evaluating and then under-evaluating. Turn with me in your Bibles to 1 Corinthians chapter 1. Just read a little introduction here. Set the tone. Paul says this, chapter 1, verse 4. I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus, that in everything you were enriched in him, in all speech and all knowledge, even as a testimony concerning Christ was confirmed in you, so you were enriched in him, you were confirmed in him, so that you are not lacking in anything, in any gift, waiting eagerly for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall also confirm you to the end, blameless, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. Several years ago I taught the book of 1 Corinthians, And when I first went into it, I kind of saw this as him just telling them who they are. And this is just this wonderful stuff about you. And he is doing that. But the truth is, I think if you hear these introductory words in the context of the whole letter, there actually is in these words a great sadness, I believe. Because these words speak of resources that were available to this Corinthian church. that this Corinthian church was not tapping and they were not tasting. They had everything they needed. Grace was given to them. Christ was given to them. They were enriched in Him, confirmed in Him. They were not lacking in any gift. Some people say they were not lacking. That means spiritual gifts. Well, it would include spiritual gifts. But what he's saying there is everything that is available from heaven to my people was available to you, Corinthians. But what I hear about you, very next verse, verse 10 and verse 11, is about the quarrels, the jealousies, and the strife. What I hear about you is disordered philel. And you know what they were divided over? What they were all fighting about? Who was the greatest teacher? That was their big debate. Who was the best at declaring with boldness the mystery, the gospel of amazing grace? Look at verse 11. It starts there. For I have been informed concerning you, my brethren, by Chloe's people, that there are quarrels among you. Now, I mean this, that each of you is saying, I am of Paul, I am of Apollos, I am of Cephas, I am of Christ. We have spiritual ones where I am of Christ. I can't live my own little spiritual life all by myself. I don't need anybody. They were just as goofy. Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? You've made idolatry. You've made us idols. You've got a new kind of spiritual-sounding idolatry. I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, that no man should say, you're baptized in my name. Let me just pick this thing apart here, try to look at it. Last week you may recall that I told you that at the root of all disordered love, whether it's disordered eros, phileos, or storge, is a kind of idolatry. Well, they had made idols of Paul. Those who were of Paul had made an idol of Paul. Those who were of Apollos had made an idol of Apollos. Those who were of Cephas had made an idol of Cephas. Idolatry, let me define it again. Is anything or anyone that I look to other than God to give me life? And my relationship to all my false gods, whether they be objects or status or person, is always the same. And you'll know if you just reflect on your relationship in the past with your false gods that come and go. On the front end, we bow to them and serve them. We adore them, revere them, and call them love. I mean, the feelings are so intense for our false gods. It couldn't be anything but love. But the reason we bow to them and serve them, adore them and revere them, is for the purpose of consuming them. Using them to fill me. Only to discover that they can't fill me. They can't fulfill me because no false God can. Guess what happens then? I mean, you give it a while, but if you're sucking life off your husband or your wife or your children or your job or some teacher like they were, and you find out it tasted good for a while, but not anymore, that adoration turns to the opposite. It just doesn't even lessen. It turns to the opposite. You begin to despise this thing you adored. And then you discard it. And that's right at the heart of I'm of Paul and I'm of Apollos. See, the people who were of Paul six months ago were of Apollos. See? I consumed him a while. He couldn't fill me, so I'm now of Paul. That's why Paul was so suspicious of the whole thing. Get away from me. Let me ask you a question. Did the people who were of Paul love Paul? Did the people who are of Apollos, some of you say you're of Apollos, did they love Apollos? Well, let's ask them, okay? All of you who are of Paul, here in the room, raise your hand. Thank you. If we could ask them, what would they say? I just know what they would say. Anyway, I wouldn't want to set them up this way. I'd want to ask them in a way that would get the real answer. But if we got the real answer, they would say, oh, yeah, I love him. Paul is just so wonderful. Okay. Let me ask you. Okay, you put your hands down. Get out of the room. Let me ask you about them. And by the way, it's much easier to see it in them. Do you think they love Paul? Okay, and when I'm looking at them, I can tell, no, they don't love Paul. They're using Paul to fill themselves. And they're using Paul to fill themselves. See, I'm quite convinced that part of Paul's energy in this text, and if you read through 1 Corinthians, and you know this paradigm, I think you can find this tension he's got all through it. Especially when he says in verse 4, I'm just glad I didn't baptize you. Isn't that a weird thing to say? I'm just glad I didn't baptize you. What's he saying? He's saying, don't glom on to me. See, all of that is born of his awareness of what will happen to him if these people make an idol of him. Here's what will happen. Because it's what happens to all of our false gods. They will adore him. They will falsely love him. Then without knowing that they're even doing it, they will attempt to suck life out of him. And when they realize they can't suck life out of him, they will hate him. And no longer be of Paul. Then they'll be of Apollos. And the whole time they're feeling these very intense feelings of what they call love, what they are experiencing is disordered love. So what I hear Paul saying here is this. Don't revere me. Appreciate and love me, but do not be glomming unto me. I am not your source. I am not your savior. I am not your hope. I am just pointing you to the one who is. Go there. Some people want you to be their source. You could be in a marriage where somebody is demanding that you give them life. And when you give them God, they get really mad at you. See, people who are blinded by disordered love are incapable of making the shift from trying to get life from a person or a thing to getting their life literally from God so they can rightly love people and things. Some never do make the shift, and it's very frustrating. Listen to Paul's frustration in chapter 3, 1 Corinthians, verse 1. My brethren, here's his frustration. I couldn't speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to babes in Christ. And you know what? There's a confrontation there. He's kind of angry. But I want you to hear the sadness of Paul. You know what the sadness of Paul in that verse is? We can never be friends. That's what he's saying. Until you grow up, we can't be friends. Because you're a babe, and I've been hoping you would grow up so we could look eye to eye and begin to do the kingdom together. Can't do it. I gave you milk to drink, not solid food. You weren't able to receive it. Indeed, even now you're not able. By the way, the milk there, you know, we think that he must have just given a mushy teaching. No, the milk was this confrontation. I mean, this is a pretty hefty confrontation, but I would love to go on to the deep things of God with you and not have to be confronting your quarrels. You know, that's what he's saying. You're still fleshy. For when one says, I am of Apollos, the other, I am of Apollos, are you not mere men? What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants, through whom you've believed, so appreciate them. Because through them you believe. But who they are is servants. Disordered love is not able to see that. He's not able to see Paul as a servant and think, Well, God bless you for Paul. Thank you, God, for Paul. Bless you for that. No, they either see him as a god or as a bum. Disordered love. Problem with disordered love is not that it always is marked by murder, rape, and slander. The common denominator is that it's blind. It keeps us from seeing people rightly. Either over-evaluating them or under-evaluating them. Let's look at the devalue thing real quickly. Pull this to a close. I already made some reference to this, but in chapter 11, we see the devaluing. Chapter 11, verse 20. This is the context of the Lord's Supper. They're having an agape feast. Here's what was happening with disordered love in their community. Therefore, when you meet together, it's not to eat at the Lord's table. For in your eating, each one of you takes his own supper first. Why is that? Because you're consumers. Because you're there to take care of you. And one is hungry. The other is drunk, meaning they got more than they need. What? Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God? By that he means the people of God. And shame those who have nothing. What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? Not today. In this I will not praise you, he says. Bottom line, here's the bottom line. In terms of what was going on there. They were not gathering to celebrate and affirm their common life of faith together. Like all disordered love, even their love for God was not a giving thing. It was a taking thing. They were users. They were consumers. I'm here for me. Even my relationship with God is that of a consumer. I'm going to try to figure out what I have to do to get you to do what I want. Not only did these Corinthians not love other people in the body, they didn't even see other people in the body. They'd walk home from church drunk with more than what they needed and not even know that others had nothing. The result of all of this disordered love was the agape feast became a mockery. Communion was defiled. Verses 28 through 29, it's that famous scary communion verse. You know, it says if you take communion in an unworthy manner. And it's that shame thing. It kind of hangs on some of you. You go, I'm going to take communion today. I had a bad thought yesterday. I'm not worthy. No. You know, if you're struggling in sin and you're like the prodigal and you're here on a communion and you want to come home, I can't think of a better Sunday for you to be here on communion. So for you to come to the table and come back home to the water, to the blood, and to the bread, and to the community of faith. What these verses say, and I don't even have time to read them. We've got to wrap this up. Is the sin was at the end of verse 29. You drink judgment to yourself because you do not judge the body rightly. The sin of the Corinthians was not just general sin. It's that they were blind to the life of God in each other. That they were each the temple of the Holy Spirit. They were all bears of the image. We're blind to the incarnational reality that we corporately and you individually are dwelling place of God. Beloved, there are no more mere mortals among us. Look around. I feel awkward doing it today maybe because it's so right there. But I'd encourage you to do it as you leave. As you walk in worship, as you come back next week and you worship, stop in your worship and just look around a little bit. Who's here? And ask God to help you see. Ask God to help you see. It is immortals that we work with, joke with. It is immortals that we worship with, marry, snub, exploit, and discard. 2 Corinthians 12, Paul has this incredible teaching on the body. He compares the body of Christ to a physical body. Remember that? And it's like, I look at that teaching, and the hand cannot say to the foot, I have no need of you. Remember that whole thing? And I look at that as like this incredible teaching. And Paul is a genius. What a wonderful, and I want to teach 1 Corinthians 12, the way I teach 1 Corinthians 13. Like 1 Corinthians 13 is this beautiful soliloquy on love. Let's talk about love. You need to understand 1 Corinthians 13, Paul is livid there. When he says love is patient, love is kind, that's a huge confrontation because none of them were patient, none of them were kind. Let's do it at a wedding. It belongs at a wedding. It does. I'm not making fun of you doing it at a wedding. But the context of 1 Corinthians 13 is he is livid. Tongues, you go speak in tongues, but without love your tongues are useless. Your prophecy is wasted. Your faith that builds the big church isn't even faith if it's not born of love. 1 Corinthians 12, let's talk about the Bible. No, no, no, no. You need to understand, if people were living with rightly ordered love and seeing each other rightly, why on earth would you have to tell people who were living in rightly ordered love that the hand can't say to the foot, I have no need of you? I mean, this is like what you have to say to kindergartners, okay? It's like the hand and the foot need each other. I don't have to tell myself that. I go, well, duh. Who do you have to tell that to? Blind people? I don't want to be condescending, and I don't want to put myself in a corner where I can't ever preach 1 Corinthians 12 without me thinking you're all blind, you know. The hand would see the foot rightly with ordered love. See, when I treasure those around me and see them as God's creatures, designed for his eternal purposes, I do not, in addition to that, need to make a special note to myself to be sure not to hate them. I don't need to make a special note to myself to be sure not to disregard or otherwise treat them with contempt. Not doing those things is simply part of the package that comes with seeing them rightly. And rightly ordered love is the kind of love that is able to clearly see and discern that there are no ordinary people. That you have never met a mere mortal. My little children. Love one another. For this is the commandment we have heard from him. This is what we have heard from the beginning. that we should love. I'm close with a question. How you doing? I hate that question. How clearly do you see? Well, you have to answer it for me. Let me answer it for me. You know, I had to spend a whole week with this sermon. How would you like that? And it brought to me a painful awareness that I don't love very well. And I don't see very clearly. that just like everybody else and see I don't think you do either I'm not picking on you I'm not but I don't think our first instinct is to see the image I'm blind and so are you another truth drawing on me around this while I don't love very well and don't see very clearly here's another truth about me and I think about you I really want to I want to rightly see and deeply love my wife and my kids and my friends and you and the cashier at Rainbow, the guy who flips me off on 169. I don't have a good report about that one. So where do you start? Well, I think I'm sharing with you where it starts. I think it starts with desire. Would you be willing to ask God to take off the blinders and help you see? I think it might result in some incredible repentance. Jan Brose, in our prayer time between services, just quietly, I don't have time to set up the context for her. She's just powerful. She said, I think we need to repent of how we consume each other. Wow. Wow. What would that look like? I don't know. I also tell you, there's a piece missing in this sermon, and I'm going to give it to you next week. See, I don't think I can rightly see you until I rightly see him and rightly see myself in him. I'm going to talk about that next week. But let me just end today with a prayer. Bow your heads. Close your eyes. and I'm going to just assume as I pray that this is your prayer too it's certainly mine so just join me in your heart Lord help us see what we don't see help us see what's true about each other bring sight to my eyes that are blind to those around me who bear the image who are the temple of God. Bring order to our love and bring glory to your church and to your holy name. And all God's people said, Amen. Amen.
