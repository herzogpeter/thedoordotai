but the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law. Let's pray. I thank you, Father, for your Spirit that fills us and dwells us, empowers us to be who it is that you are in us. I pray this morning for my own spirit that as I share these things, I will be lost in you. And that all of us as people who love you here this morning will be caught up not in the words that are said, but in the spirit of your Savior, in your spirit. Father, again I ask that eyes would see clearly and ears would hear clearly the things you need to learn. May your spirit indeed do a work among us as we open your precious word in Jesus' name, amen. As we've been going through these things in Galatians, And again, as we talk about the fruit of the Spirit, we understand that the key to this whole thing started back in verse 16 when Paul said, but I say walk by the Spirit of God. And we have come to understand, I think at a very deep level, that the distinction of our Christian life is not that we say we believe certain things, not that we say we believe that Jesus died and that he rose again, although those are things that we believe. That is not the power of our Christian faith, though. The glory of our Christian faith, That which sets us apart from every other person, that which sets Christianity apart from every other religion, is simply this, that the Spirit of God, the God of creation, the Lord of history, has come into my heart, has come into my life to live. The Spirit of God alive in me. And we use terms like being born again, and being reborn, and new birth, and I'm a new creature in Christ, and those are real appropriate terms. In fact, Peter goes as far to explain the transformation that takes place in a person's life who becomes a Christian in physical kinds of terms in 1 Peter 1.23. He says, you have been born again, not of a physical seed, but of a righteous seed. He uses that term seed, and the picture of physical birth as relating to spiritual things is very obvious and very much intended. I am a child of God. I am born of God. I am an offspring of God. I am literally born of God's seed. And when I think of things like that, I hear Paul saying in Ephesians 5.1, Be thou therefore imitators of God, just like beloved children. Do you remember when we did that in Ephesians? When we went through that text, and one of the things that I remember that just never left me was this concept of a child and a father. And when he's bringing this exhortation for them to be imitators of their father, just like a child, The thing that was very clear from our exegesis was that the reason that was possible wasn't that you were supposed to just kind of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and try to be like God, but that you were indeed born into his family. You were indeed born of that righteous seed. And the most natural thing for you to be as one who is born of a certain father would be simply this, to look like the father who bore you. We talked about on a physical level how I look like my father, whether I like that or not. The thing is this, that it is natural because I was born of his seed. The other thing is this, however, I love my Father, and I want to be just like Him. And when I think of that concept, I hear the Apostle Paul saying in Philippians 3, verses 8 and 9, I can suffer the loss of all things. I count it. I count all things a loss compared to the surpassing value of knowing Christ. My goal is that I might know Him, to walk like Him, to talk like Him, to be just like Him. I want to look like the Father who bore me. Beloved, when we talk about the fruit of the Spirit, we need to understand something that is really very simple, and that is this, that the fruit of the Spirit, as we go through these characteristics, all we're really talking about are characteristics of God. These are simply descriptions of who God is. And because the Spirit of God lives in me, as I begin to yield my life to Him, He simply expresses who He is out into my life. The fruit of the Spirit is. The character of God is love. The character of God is joy. God is a God of peace, of patience, of kindness, and on and on and on. The aspects of the fruit of the Spirit are love, joy, peace. We've Been Talking About Them. We've Been Talking About Their Carnifit. The fruit of the Spirit is love, agape love, a caring, giving love that is not dependent on mutuality. The fruit of the Spirit is joy. The fruit OF the Spirit is peace. that inner settledness that is a settledness regardless of the outside circumstances. Patience, last week. The fruit of the Spirit is patience. Makrothumia, be slow to thumas, be slow to explosive kinds of anger. And I think it was a real beneficial time we had last week as we discussed the different kinds of ways we try to develop that characteristic in our lives. We discovered that makrothumia, being slow to anger, is not developed by repressing my anger. We discovered that it is not the expression of my anger through aggression, but rather through confession to myself, to the Lord, and to others. And today we come to kindness. Kindness. I need to do something here. Before I get into this, for some reason or another, I'm feeling really bound up this morning. I feel like I'm striving. I feel like my striving meter is real high. And if I keep going like that, this is going to be of no value to anybody. Would you just take a quiet moment now and pray for me, for freedom and liberty? Just do it, okay? Okay. Lord, I hate it when I strive. It doesn't feel like you, it feels like me. I just pray for liberty. It comes by your spirit. amen thank you kindness characteristic of god is kindness a result of the spirit walk is kindness an aspect of the fruit of the spirit that we can't ignore is kindness kindness what do you think of when you think of kindness i had trouble with this folks i wanted to skip this so bad you won't even believe it you know why because kindness doesn't matter kindness is nice kindness is important. But I'll tell you what, I like sermons that are zingy. I like sermons that are zappy. I like sermons that really tell you things you didn't know before and you leave feeling like, wow, did I get blown up and that felt good to get blown up. Kindness. Kindness. He's going to talk about telling us to be kind. I mean, kindness is good and it's important, but it isn't vital. I don't even want to admit this, but I felt this last week. I was thinking, if I tell them about kindness, they're going to leave thinking that was a good sermon, but it was trite. It was trite. Be kind. I mean, that's the kind of thing you do to dumb animals. You know, you be kind to animals. We have weeks dedicated to being kind to animals. We do that to little kids. After church, my whole function with little kids is to be kind to little kids. Okay? I pat them on the head. That's what it means. Okay? In appropriate circumstances, you be kind. So I'm supposed to stand in front and even tell everybody, be kind. Do it with a great sense of authority and vigor and all these kinds of things. You should do it with sick people. You should do it with old people. You should do it with poor people. Basically, it's how I act with people who are helpless. People who are sick. people who are infirm, people who are not threatening to me, I can be very kind to them. Generally, my kindness is born of pity. Boy, I tell you, you know, if that really is true, if my kindness is born of pity and it's just the little animals and it's just the little kids and people who are sick and I'm not threatened by, my kindness is really a form of condescension, isn't it? You poor little thing, I'll be kind to you. Kindness, think on it, think on it. Kind people are nice to have around. They brighten the place up. I'm really glad we have kind people in our church. Makes the church a nicer place to be. I like to kind of go over by them and just kind of stand around them when I'm feeling a little down. But let's be honest about this whole thing. You see, somebody has got to be realistic. Maybe you can be kind and you can be gentle and you've got time for that, but somebody's got to be realistic. Somebody's got to be pragmatic. Somebody's got to do the dirty work. Kind people, kindness, that gets bowled over, folks, in the real world, and you know it, and so do I. Might fit real well out in the foyer with little kids and little animals, but kindness gets blown up out there. My wife is kind. I'm realistic. Was Paul kind? Give me a break. Kind people are naive. You ever get that impression? Kind people are naive. See, they don't have the insight that I have about people. My job is to find out what's wrong with people, right? Kind people don't see it. They just keep seeing grace, and they keep having the ability to forgive and let people off the hook. Come on, it's nice, good to have around. Glad two or three of you are like that, more than that, I'm sure. But it isn't realistic. Again, thinking of Paul. Was he kind? Listen to him in Galatians. You foolish Galatians. Who has bewitched you? I fear for you that perhaps I've labored over you in vain, a waste of time. You're not really saved. Then that incredible passage in chapter 5, verse 12. I would that those who are troubling you would even mutilate themselves. Kind old Paul. Let's just slide by this one, okay? The next one would be goodness. It sounds too much the same. Let's slide by that one. You want to do faithfulness this morning? Problem is this. You know what? As I come up with all these misinterpretations of what kindness is, I have something else ringing in my ears, written by the Apostle Paul. He said this. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speech be put away from you. And be kind. And be kind. One to another. Tender-hearted. Forgiving one another. kindness. It's a characteristic of God. It's a result of the spirit walk. It's an aspect of the fruit of the spirit that I can't ignore. And one of the reasons, I want to tell you, I tried to skip this. I really did. It wasn't that I, I'm not an unkind person, but I came under some conviction with this and I think it's important that we talk about it. First of all, a definition of the word. A definition of the word, let's look at it. Krestates is the Greek word that means kindness. And the frustration I had this week is that while we use the Greek a lot, it didn't give me a lot. Basically what krestates means is kindness. Where are you going to go with that? It means gentleness. It is synonymous with, very often, it is synonymous with goodness. By the way, we're going to kind of pair these things together. Kindness and goodness, those dimensions of the fruit of the Spirit. But the thing is this, when we are doing Bible study, one of the things we need to understand is that the Greek is not the only tool we have. Very often if you're trying to figure out the depth of the meaning of some sort of word, you can look at that word and find out how it's used in different places. And that broadens the picture. There's three focuses I want to give you this morning very quickly. Three dimensions that emerge as we find out what that word means in different places. And I want you to know something, that kindness, as these meanings emerge, means a lot more than just patting a little kid on the top of the head. The first word is this, sympathetic. Sympathetic. Kindness is sympathetic. Genesis chapter 40 verse 14, we find Joseph in the position where he had been sold into Egypt. He had that little run-in with Potiphar's wife and now he finds himself in jail. He is in a position where the cupbearer comes to him and has a dream. Remember that? And Joseph interprets the dream and tells them that he is going to be restored to his position. And Joseph says to the cupbearer, he says, just do me this one kindness. One kindness I would ask of you, and that is this, remember me, to Pharaoh. The fact is this, that that cupbearer did not remember Joseph to Pharaoh. Why did he not remember? Well, he just forgot. It slipped his mind and he just went on his way. That is not why he didn't tell Pharaoh. The reason he didn't tell Pharaoh, and maybe the reason it just slipped his mind, is because the cupbearer did not have sympathy. He did not have sympathy. He was incapable of entering into anyone else's predicament. He was incapable of understanding or putting himself into anybody else's situation. The only thing that he could understand, the only thing that he could enter into was his own pain and then his own sense of freedom. You see, sympathy would have remembered. Kindness would have remembered. Sympathy, the ability to feel with, the ability to enter into someone else's pain, someone else's joy, the ability to understand what someone is going through and sympathize. That's kindness. That's kindness. Real simple. I work with people all the time. People come in and we talk. And since I'm the pastor, you know it's my job to help them. It's my job to solve their problems. You know that's their perception and I think more than their perception, it's my perception. I'm supposed to be there and explain all the problems they're having and sort it all out and give them all sorts of wonderful things. And I try like crazy to do that. It's real important for me to be right. It's real important for me to have answers and things like that. The problem is this, and you find this out very quickly in the ministry, that very often the kinds of pain that people are going through aren't solved by answers. They aren't solved by being right. They aren't sorted through. Some of the emotional, deep, spiritual pain that people feel aren't solved by giving them a little pat answer. You see, sometimes what people need is nothing more than a little kindness. What they need is a little sympathy. Someone who will feel with them. Someone who will understand and give them a hug. You can't always solve people's problems, but you can be kind. Sympathetic. Sympathetic. Some people live in homes like that. With our wives, with our kids, with our husbands. We have this incredible need to fix people, don't we? You ever notice that? Something's wrong. Somebody's hurt. Somebody's discouraged. Somebody isn't really flowing or going with the flow of the family. we've got this incredible need to fix people. And so we give them all sorts of answers. We do that with our kids. We want to fix them. We want to fix them right now. And we give them all sorts of answers, and we clean it all up for them, and if anything's unsettled, we just can't live with them. Sympathy. Do you ever listen to your kids' pain? Do you ever listen to the frustration that's there? Sympathy. It's kindness. Jesus, when he was facing the cross, was with his disciples, And he told them, he says, I don't need a whole lot of answers. And I don't need a whole lot of things explained to me. I don't have a problem here that you can't solve. And I want to tell you something. I'm going through something right now that you can't go through with me. You can't do it. And you can't save me from it. But you know what I want from you? I want sympathy. I want kindness. I want you to be with me. That's what I want. I want you to be here with me. And then he went and prayed. And they fell asleep. And the kindness wasn't there. The sympathy wasn't there. Hebrews 4, 15 through 16 says this. We do not have a great high priest who cannot what? Sympathize with our pain. And then he says, let us draw near therefore with confidence to the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. You know what that means? Oh yeah, I know what that means. That means simply this, that God is my celestial problem solver. He sorts it all out. No, it doesn't. It means that in some situations, his ministry to me is one that my ministry to you needs to be. And that is this, sympathy. Sympathizer. I see Jesus, the Holy Spirit of God, coming alongside to help me in those times when the darkness is just coming all around me. He comes and he says, Dave, I'm going to take you right out of this situation and make it better. No, he doesn't. He says, I'm going to be here for you, and I'm going to put my arm around you. Kindness. Sympathy. It's a work of the Spirit. It's a character of God. If life to me is Christ, I can be liberated so much from myself that I can even be kind to you. Sympathetic. Another characteristic is this. Generosity, benevolence. Benevolence. This word is used in 2 Samuel 9.3, where David, having looked at the house of Saul, Saul, who was his nemesis, tried to kill him several times. Saul and all his cohorts were gone, dead. And he asked a question. He said, is anyone left from the house of Saul? The word came back to him that one was left, Mephibosheth. And he decided, I am going to be generous to him. I'm going to be benevolent to him. What he basically did was bring him into the temple, seat him at the king's table, and he lavished him with benevolence, with generosity. Mary in the vial of alabaster, giving what she couldn't afford to give, giving what wasn't reasonable, it was extravagant. Generosity, benevolence is kindness. Think about that for a little bit. Just roll that over the tongue of your mind, okay? What it means to be benevolent, what it means to be generous. Real appropriate for Christmas, got to work it in, got to have a Christmas sermon. Generosity, okay? Generosity is not to be used as an excuse to run up all your things on Visa. Think about generosity, though. You know what? I think an awful lot of us look at generosity and benevolence, and we kind of write it off in terms of something we could be. I sometimes think this way. If I had as much as they had, I could be generous. If I had all the worldly goods that they had, I could be generous, because then I would have all the things I need, and I would have a little bit left over, and then I could be generous, And it would be real easy if I knew all my needs were met and I knew everything was going to be taken care of. I could be real generous. No, you wouldn't. Any more than the people who have a lot of things are generous. When you think of generosity, when you think of benevolence, when you think of the fruit of the Spirit being kindness, and as that works itself out in generosity and benevolence, one of the things you think of is simply this, that you know people who have a lot and they aren't generous. Having things does not make you generous. It doesn't free you up. It isn't a matter of what you have. It's a matter of who you are. It's a matter of what's inside of you. The fruit of the Spirit is benevolence. The fruit of the Spirit is generosity. Why? Because I understand who the source is of everything I have, and if I really believe that, if life for me really is Christ, then I'm free to give it away. Last week we had a birthday party here at church. It was for me. It felt great. A little surprise. It was wonderful. I was sitting right over here. I didn't know a thing about it. I even understand my kids knew, and they didn't tell me. I can't believe that. But it was wonderful, and I felt really loved. I felt really cared for. And some of you gave me little cards and things like that. And one lady came up to me and handed me a package. She's a real special lady in our church. And doesn't have a lot of worldly goods. You see, benevolence doesn't have anything to do with what you have. It's who you are. And she came up to me and she gave me a package. And I felt that it was heavy. And I thought it was maybe some chocolates. And I thought, that's great. Well, praise the Lord, that's really nice. And I opened it up and it was a book, a very fine book, one that I will use in my office. It was a parallel Bible where it had all four different translations in it. And I looked at it and I was a little bit taken back. I didn't say this, obviously, but I thought, you can't afford this. This is too much. This is more than you can afford. You know, this is not in accord with what you have. You know what it was? You know what that was? That was kindness. That was benevolence. That was generosity. And when you realize who your source is for all your physical needs, you can even give things away. You can't get people under law to give like that. You can't give people under law to give like that. It was extravagant. Just the way God gives to you and to me. Ephesians speaks of his grace, which he lavished upon us. Gracious. Kindness is sympathetic. Kindness is generous, benevolent. Kindness is gracious. In the Septuagint, that's the Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament. Jeremiah 22, 4. There's all different ways that this word kindness is used. One way is in Jeremiah 24, verse 2. Kindness is used to mean very good, okay? Kindness is used to mean very good, and it's referring to figs. Who cares about figs? It doesn't matter. Okay, let's move on. That's not a good one. Exodus chapter 27, verse 22. Kindness is used to refer to something that is precious, and it is referring to precious stones. So kindness is precious. Kindness is very good. Kindness is precious. But I don't want to talk about figs, and I don't want to talk about stones. Daniel chapter 2, verse 32 says kindness is pure, but it was speaking of gold. So kindness is precious, and kindness is very good, and kindness is pure. But I don't want to talk about gold, and I don't want to talk about stones, and I don't want to talk about figs. Psalm 112, verse 5 says this, kindness is gracious toward people. Kindness is gracious toward, that's what kindness is. The verse says this, it is well with a man who is gracious and who lends to grace people. Have you ever been graced? Have you ever been graced? you know there's somebody there's people who come to mind in my in this church who grace me every time i see them every time i see those people i feel graced you know what that means it means this to me this is what it means it means that when i'm with them i never feel like i should be doing something different to get them to like me they just do and you know what they do it to you too because it isn't what they do. It isn't who you are that all of a sudden they need you to like them and so they do all these manipulations. It's just who they are. It's who they are and if it's in you, it just comes out of you. That's grace. What do you do with people who are ungrateful? What do you do with people who are ungrateful? How do you grace people? How do you be kind to people who are ungrateful for your kindness, for your graciousness? Luke chapter 6. Look it up. Luke chapter 6 verse 35 Jesus said this but love your enemies do good and lend expecting nothing in return and your reward will be great and you will be sons of the most high for he himself is kind even to ungrateful men he is kind even to ungrateful men you've been graced so be graceful you know what that could be an incredible should you've been graced so be graceful you've been forgiven so forgive you've been loved so love you know what one of the things that we understand in our church and it has become it has become the the whole theme of our ministry here it is this that we want to proclaim the good news to people that they are graced that they are forgiven that they are loved but we have also run into a problem and that is this that many people have heard that all their lives they have heard you are graced by God. You are loved by God. You are forgiven by God if you're in Christ. And you know what? We've got an awful lot of people who know that, but still feel unloved and ungraced and unforgiven and aren't living in any sense of victory at all. And so the second thing is this, it's our job as a congregation, it's our goal as a ministry to provide opportunity for people to experience God's grace, to experience God's forgiveness, to experience God's love by interaction in the body of Christ. And as I begin to let that love in and touch me, as I begin to let that grace in, realizing that there are people who like me just the way I am and I don't have to perform and I am okay because of what Jesus has done for me. I begin to let that grace in and I begin to believe that I really am forgiven. I can take that little gift that was given to me and I can give it away. I can give it away. And I can grace people. You ever let anybody off the hook? You ever let anybody off the hook? But what if you're right? What if you get in an argument and something has gone wrong in your family or with a relationship and you're in a position where you're just plain right? You see their problem. You see the thing they've done. You see it as clear as day and you're right. Where does kindness fit into that? Where does benevolence, where does sympathy, where does graciousness fit into that kind of thing? See, graciousness for some of us means just overlook it, ignore it, just let it slide, let them off the hook. Don't ever confront it. It's not true. Let me just share something that happened to me not long ago, a couple of weeks ago. A friend of mine is going through some real deep spiritual struggles. he's been going through them for a long time and it's coming to a head right now in his life and he's beginning to do a lot of things that look to me like they're real inappropriate and I have cared about this person and I have ministered with this person and I have shared with him my incredible wealth of wisdom and understanding and all the answers you know and the problem is nothing seems to work he isn't responding, he isn't commenting around it's driving me crazy, okay? and see it's real important for me to be right It's real important for me to have the right answers. And it's real important for me to have people respond to me positively. Because it affirms me, right? Life for me is giving the right answers. Something began to happen inside me that my wife helped me get a hold of because she confronted me. And that was this. I was real angry at this person. And I'll tell you, the time this came to a head for me was the day before I preached last week's sermon on anger. So it was great. I even had a good justification for why I was so angry at him. I knew just exactly why I was angry. Had all sorts of good reasons. It wasn't thumas, and it wasn't paragismas. It was orge, and I was handling it very well. Something was being violated that I was committed to. It was great. I was right. Right. I was right. Being right is a real strong place to be. You know that? Being right is a real strong place to be. I was all sorts of right. My anger was even appropriate. But you know what I didn't have at all? Sympathy. Benevolence, goodwill. Or generosity. So what do you do? Just not confront? No, I confront. In fact, when I get a hold of kindness, I can't not confront. But that affects dramatically how I confront, doesn't it? We're going to get into that in chapter 6 when it talks about how we confront and restore a brother with a spirit of what? Gentleness, kindness. the work of the spirit is kindness sympathetic benevolence graciousness point two why is it important an illustration of the need why is it important first of all because it evidences maturity kindness evidences maturity first peter 2 3 is talking about all these things and saying um like newborns babes remember that passage long for the pure milk of the word that by it they may grow with respect to salvation. And among all the things that are ingredients of a person's growth and evidence of his growth, evidence of his maturity is this characteristic of kindness that begins to emerge. So you've got point one, you've got the evidences of maturity, it evidences maturity. Secondly, this is the one I really want to grab you with. It establishes credibility. It establishes credibility. Second Corinthians 6.6. I want you to look it up. 2 Corinthians 6.6. In fact, I want to start up in verse 3. Paul is giving the establishment of his ministry and why it was supposed to be listened to. Verse 3, giving no cause for offense in anything, in order that the ministry may not be discredited. He's talking about credibility. But in everything, commending ourselves as servants of God, in much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses, in beatings, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hunger, in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love. He's talking about the credibility of his ministry. And he's saying this in the context of all sorts of negative things, in tumults, in beatings, in imprisonments, in labors, that which gave credibility to my ministry with you was my powerful preaching. No, he doesn't say that. Was the fact that I gave you Greek words and you understood them so well. He doesn't say that. He said, that which gave credibility to my ministry was that in the midst of all sorts of different life situations, kindness was there. Graciousness was there. I think that's a real word to anybody in a leadership position. Elders, teachers, staff people, parents. You want to know something? It's the same for pastors as it is for parents. It's real important for us to be right. I am right. Great. Are you kind? are you dealing with that person sympathetically are you dealing with that person with a sense of graciousness what establishes credibility for ministry i got this idea that age does i just turned 31 last week and i'm just delighted that i'm 31 everybody comes hot as a field to be 31 i'm delighted to be 31 because now you have to start listening to me a little more have more credibility i can't wait till i'm 40 it's great i mean you'll have to listen to me more i'll have credibility. No, that doesn't establish credibility. Some people think that preaching good sermons establishes credibility. Some people go to seminary and believe that if they learn how to parse Greek verbs, then they'll have credibility. And they actually come, and I see this all the time, they come out of seminary and they come out of school and they're all fired up to change the world and their credibility is based on all the wonderful knowledge they have. And they know a lot. You know what? Some of the most unkind people I know are people who know the word backwards and forwards, and they use it like a club. What do you know? Good. You know all sorts of things. Are you kind? That's what gives credibility to ministry. Benevolence, sympathy, graciousness. You know why it establishes credibility? Third, because it's related to love. It's related to love. 1 Corinthians 13, 4. Love is what? Patient. Love is what? Kind. This is so simple, isn't it? This is so simple. And you may speak with the tongue of men and of angels. You may really be able to wow them. And you may have the gift of prophecy. And you may know all mysteries. And you may know all knowledge. And you may have incredible faith and accomplish all sorts of things. And you may give your body up to be burned. And you may be all sorts of right. You may just be all sorts of right. But are you kind? I've seen this issue destroy families. a husband and a wife in some sort of tension that's going on. Maybe it's between a parent and a child, a mom and a daughter, a son and a father. And there's all sorts of tension there. And you know what? You know what? One of the characteristics of the tension that's going on, everybody's right. Everybody's right. Have you ever been in one like that? Everybody's right. Everybody's got a perspective that justifies just exactly why they're doing what they're doing. And it destroys the family. Everybody's right. but nobody's kind. Nobody's kind. I've seen churches divide over this and so have you. All sorts of right people. All sorts of right people. Everybody's right. And nobody's kind. Nobody's kind. You know what? A fruit of the Spirit is kindness. Sympathetic. What that simply means is I'm able to hear you. Benevolence. Graciousness. It establishes credibility. It's related to love. It builds the body. Ephesians 4, 31 and 32. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speech be put away. And be kind, sympathetic, benevolent, gracious. Be kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ has forgiven you. I think of the sermons I've preached in Galatians. This is probably the simplest. Real straightforward, real simple. And you may be all sorts of evangelical. and YOU may be all sorts of zealous. And you may be all sorts of Baptist or Alliance. And you might just be the most Bible-believing person in this congregation. And you may be giving like crazy. And you may be involved in all sorts of things. And you may have wonderful insights into Scripture. And you may be learning things about the Word. And you may be even growing in certain ways and you may be very correct and you may be real right. but the real simple question I want to ask you this morning is this are you sympathetic are you benevolent are you gracious are you kind are you kind a fruit of the spirit a characteristic of God one of the dimensions of the fruit that we cannot ignore is kindness the third thing is this the application to my life in your notes there's a blank space there there aren't any one two threes or anything there you know why because that's your job that's your job in your family with your kids with your husband with your wife with your parents is there sympathy is there graciousness is there the ability to hear in your work with your employees with your employers in the body of Christ all sorts of right people that's great but the fruit of the spirit the result of the the spirit's presence in my life as he works through me is love joy peace patience kindness and if kindness isn't one of the things that's flowing from your life I'm not telling you here this morning to go home and try to be kind what I want you to do is go back and look at your walking by the spirit because if you're walking by the spirit kindness will begin to flow and if kindness is not a characteristic if sympathy is not there if graciousness is not there then don't you dare claim a spirit walk through the spirit is kindness Thank you.
