No ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides you who works for those who wait for you. Let us pray. Beloved, we thank you that you are faithful to work for us who wait for you. We pray that as we share together this morning, that you will give us a new word, a new thought about what that means. For Jesus' sake, amen. Advent is the beginning of the church year, according to the seasons of the church year. Advent is the time of preparation, getting ready for the birth of the Christ child. We know the story. advent and all these seasons of the church year were established at a time at the church when most people probably didn't read people certainly didn't have access to a bible or whatever in their home most people and before the printing press you know this is something i think is very profound and i think everyone ought to think deeply on this thought that before the 14th century there was not printed Bibles in people's hands. For 1400 years, people knew God. In fact, the establishment of the church came at a time when they really didn't have Bibles. Let's think about that sometime. But today we do, and we can read, and we can read this story. The seasons of the church year still are important to us. They still invite us to reflect on our own lives and what God's invitation might be to us, new and fresh at this point in our lives. We know the story of the birth of Jesus. Sometimes on into ad nauseum, we talk and sing the songs and sing the carols and they're over the intercom and they're everywhere. It's so familiar. But Advent is a time that invites us to look at it new and fresh, to go beyond the obvious, to go beyond the simple reading of the story or telling of the story, and to listen through it to what God might be saying to us over and beyond the story. I would like to offer that the Advent story invites us to a time of waiting, that it's an example of waiting. In our consumer-driven culture, we are not accustomed to waiting. We want instant gratification for everything. We fall into this cultural trap of instant messages, instant mail, instant photos, instant pudding, instant meals. You name it, we can have it instantly. We can talk at the phone at any given moment. No need to wait to get back to the office or back to the house. Sometimes I've thought about that. Driving could at one time have been kind of a contemplative thing, but now you can answer your phone, you know, or you can try to dial while you're doing that. Everything is instant. And it's so counterculture for us to stop and to wait. And yet without learning to wait, our spiritual life will remain shallow. In order to grow into the deep things of God, we must become people who can wait. And Advent is a time of waiting. God calls us through the Advent story of Mary and Joseph to the simplicity of waiting, of emptiness, to the nothing, nothing, nothing of John of the Cross. Nada, nada, nada. John of the Cross says the spiritual life is nothing, nothing, nothing. Nothing happening. Consider Mary in our Advent story. Be with her for a moment. She had a visitation in the dark of night and then she had a long wait. I'd like you to just take a few minutes to be quiet with that story. Close your eyes if you want and reflect on this. Think of Mary, this young woman, probably going to the rooftop of her house or place that she lived for prayer. And she had a visitation from an angel. And she was told something profound would happen to her. Something I'm sure shocking and surprising. And then she had to wait. Think of Mary. and think of yourself think of what time in your life you have had some kind of wisdom or revelation from God some kind of knowing deep down inside that God is promising you something, calling you to something and then the time of waiting you can open your eyes if you want what was conceived in Mary was conceived in love and what is conceived in us is also conceived in love but Mary waited in the darkness of winter I think the image of winter is such a good one even though it's probably not as dark where she was as it is for us but she waited in the darkness of winter for the Christ child the Christ child was born at night in a cave and I think the spiritual significance of this darkness is very important for us you know if you take scripture piece by piece like this and meditate on this in your own prayer to think about this little piece that Jesus was born at night what is the spiritual significance for you in that? thinking of way ahead in the Easter story you know Jesus went into the dark of the tomb and he had this day Saturday this long waiting before Easter came the spiritual significance of this is huge and we need to let it sink in much of our own spiritual journey takes place in the dark and most often it's when we are in the deepest of our struggles, the place where we don't understand what's going on, that God is working secretly in the deep places of our hearts. Usually we fight against this. We don't like being there. We try to make something happen. We run from place to place and person to person trying to get answers. We try everything to fix it. we don't like to wait but if we wait even though we may not understand it at the time later we become conscious of the fruit of the dark time we come to new birth in the darkness if we really want to enter the deep things of God we must be willing to wait in this darkness this is what the ancients called the cloud of unknowing leaving behind our preconceived ideas our good plans our good assumptions everything we think we know under the cloud of forgetting and enter into the dark night we must enter the cave of our hearts and wait wait in whatever darkness we're in wait when nothing is happening wait for in a time when we don't understand what's going on in a time of sickness and suffering wait a time of death of a loved one wait my brother died the Sunday after Thanksgiving last year and he's just a few years older than I but we knew he was dying his kidneys shut down and the family was called well a few of you know we had such a little family but we had Thanksgiving together and he was just great and he always was one of these guys with a zinger you know good sense of humor and we had such a good time we laughed so much but you know we were waiting and we waited The next day a little less of him was available to us and the next a little less and on Sunday he was gone. The time of waiting. And this year we've had my father-in-law and a couple of aunts. I mean it's been a long time of loss of a loved one for us. But the willingness to sit with that and wait. The time of empty and dry prayer. A time when we don't understand where God is taking us or why. There's a gift in the waiting. But if we're always trying to get past it, get through it, get to the other side, get to the good stuff, if we see the good stuff is only when we feel great and we know, then we miss the gift of the waiting. To live into the waiting. Live into the questions. Live into the unknown. We must learn to wait and be vulnerable. To wait in emptiness. To be content to wait in the dark for the birthing of a new and deeper place with God. To the birthing of a new way of being in the world. A new understanding of our call to ministry. A new whatever for you. We all have our time of darkness. In fact, the ancients would say that all of life is a dark night when it comes to our spiritual life. We never fully know who God is. And we never fully know who God is creating us to be and to become. Psalm 139 says where can I flee from your spirit and it says even if I go into the dark the dark is not light to God and the sooner that we can come to grips with that to trust that the dark is not dark to God the sooner that we get that the sooner we come to peace within ourselves and often the sooner we come to peace with other people too. The sooner we come to the place where we can live in this darkness, in the moment, we will be living in what is salvation. Salvation is now, you know, this moment. And the sooner we'll be able to let go of the grasping for what is to come, for what do I have to have, what's going to become of this, what's going to happen. The grasping for what is to come. what I need to know, what I think I need to know and to be at home in the dark. We can only know God through this darkness. We can only know God through our willingness to wait and trust. We are always becoming. We are always standing at the threshold of who we were and who we are becoming. Or the threshold of what was and what is to come. That's the only place we have, is this moment on this threshold. So it's essential for us to go through this time, this waiting, in order to usher in the next phase of who God is creating us to be. As the church, the people of God, we will never usher in the next phase of who God is creating the church to become. In this time in history, until we learn to wait, to listen, and to be willing to be empty and walk through the darkness of not knowing. We will never fully know the fullness of the Trinity until we learn to wait in darkness. Mary waited in the darkness of winter for the coming of the Christ child and I want to leave you with a question what are you waiting for? what are you waiting for? what are you waiting for? let's take a few minutes of silence with that Thank you. From the book of Hosea, but as for you, return to your God, hold fast to love and justice, And wait continually for your God. Holy and gracious God, we wait for you. Amen. Amen. We've been waiting. Welcome, holy child. Welcome, holy child. Hope that you don't mind our manger. How I wish we would have known. But long awaited, holy stranger. Make yourself at home. Please make yourself at home. Bring your peace into our violence. Bid our hungry souls be filled. Word now breaking, heaven's silence. Welcome to our world. Welcome to our world. Fragile fingers sent to heal us, tender brow prepared for thorn. Tiny heart whose blood will save us Unto us is born Unto us is born So wrap our injured flesh around you Breathe our air and walk our sun Rob our sin and make us holy, perfect Son of God, perfect Son of God. Welcome to our world. This season is so full of wonder and mystery. The church has created the four weeks preceding our Christmas celebration, are remembering and celebrating the birth of the Christ child to be the season of Advent. And we have done that symbolically. Maybe some of you do things at home, and you have an Advent wreath on your dining room table, and as a family you gather round and you light a candle for the first week of Advent, and then you light two for the second week of Advent. Maybe you're already doing that. This week we celebrate the second week of Advent. And we want to give space and time to invite you into that reflection process. And so we light that second candle. The people of God waited in a very quiet place for centuries. The close of the book of Malachi until the coming of the gospel writers when they announced the birth of Christ was a long season of 400 years representing the four weeks of Advent. And we want to give you something symbolically as a congregation to do at home so that we can unite our hearts together in this season to say, Come, come, come, Lord Jesus. Come into those dark places. We know that you've already come, but there's places inside of our lives that we desire to see you more, to experience you more. Or maybe it's a time that you will, as a family, gather and say, come, Lord Jesus, into this family member's heart or to the friend or the neighbor down the street. We want to give you something symbolically to do that together. So when you come for communion this morning, there will be baskets of candles, white candles. And it's just one. And we ask that you pick one up per household. And attached to it is a very simple Advent prayer. Take that. And at least once each week. At least once. As a household. Maybe if you are a single person, you want to gather some friends with you. Or with your spouse. Or with your kids. Light the candle. And pray the prayer. and reflect on the meaning of your words together. Create some waiting space to invite yourself into the wonder and the glory of what this season is all about. So I invite you now as a congregation to stand and to give voice to this Advent prayer together. into our world as into Mary's womb come Lord Jesus into the forgotten places as into the stable come Lord Jesus into the lives of the poor bringing hope, into the lives of the powerful bringing caution, into the lives of the weary bringing rest, and into our lives and longings, whatever our state. Come quickly, Lord. Amen. O come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel, That mourns in lowly exile here Until the Son of God appear Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel shall come to thee, all Israel. O come, thou Dayspring, come and cheer our spirits by thine advent here. Dispers the gloomy clouds of night. And death's dark shadow o'er to fly. Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel. shall come to thee, O Israel. O come, thou King of David, come, and open wide our heavenly home. Make safe the way that leads on high. And close the path through misery. Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel. shall come to thee, O Israel. O come, desire of nations, bind in wonderhood of all mankind. Thou art sad, derision's cease And be thyself our King of Peace Rejoice, rejoice Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel. Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel. You may be seated. Communion stewards, if you can come forward. We wait in this season of Advent. The promise of Jesus' coming wasn't only for one time, but for two times. We wait for his coming again in the clouds in glory and in majesty. We understand that the gift that he has given is of his life, that he came to earth to live and to die, but he will also come again. And in that waiting place, it is good to gather around the table and remember his presence with us, the gift of his life, the gift of his death, the gift of his resurrection, and the hope of his coming again. We live in that place. We live in that place. And it is from that place that we as a people of God can remember that on the night our Lord Jesus was betrayed, he took bread and he gave thanks. And he broke it. And he said, this is my body. It is given for you. Give of yourself to each other. into the world. Take and eat of this and be strengthened. Have courage. Live full into your lives. And after supper, he took the cup and he said, I'm going to make this all possible for you. You don't have to live as you are. You can be free. And you can be forgiven. And you can live your life in me. I will die. So you can rise. So take this cup and drink of it. And drink full of it all your days. And remember me. remember the gift that I have given to you. Let's pray. Holy God, thank you for the gift of your son, for the gift of his life to us and in us, and for not leaving us by ourselves but sending your Holy Spirit. And God, we ask now that you would send your Holy Spirit and take these ordinary gifts of bread and the fruit of the vine and create in them a gift of your presence to us, that we might be willing to boldly wait in the dark places, inviting you in there to transform us and change us and call us out into the light of your grace and your presence. May we know you as we receive this day. In Jesus' name, amen. Beloved, after the communion stewards have received the elements, they're going to go to different stations. throughout the room. And once they are there, then you are ready. You're welcome to come to this table of life and partake. And when you do, take the cracker and dip it in the cup. If you have a child who's with you who's not ready to take communion, bring them too. And our communion stewards can speak a blessing over them. And we are going to do what we always do at communion. We're going to bathe this time in the worship and adoration and praise of our King. So I invite you now to stand as we begin this time. Thank you.
