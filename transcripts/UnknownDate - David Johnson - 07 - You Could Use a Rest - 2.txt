Open your Bibles, Exodus chapter 20. Exodus chapter 20. As we continue our series on the Ten Commandments, we are dealing, as most of you know, today with our second week of study around the Fourth Commandment, from verses 8 to 11. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy, to keep it set apart. And at its most basic level, what we discovered last week, that God is saying here is simply this. I want you to take a day off. Verse 11, for in six days God made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh he rested. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, or the seventh day, and made it holy. In blessing the Sabbath day, God was saying this about the day. It's going to be a good day. It's a blessed by me day, a happy look forward to day. And the reason that I'm giving it to you is because I know how you're built. And I know what you need to run well, to flourish and thrive, to literally stay healthy and free from things that enslave you. So it is. I give you a day a week, and I give it to you as a gift. Enjoy it. Protect it. Put a boundary around it. Make it holy. Make it set apart. And do all of that for at least three reasons. And these three reasons introduced us to the three basic purposes of Sabbath day rest. The first is this, physical restoration. The second is spiritual realignment. For when it says in verse 11 that God rested, we found out last week that he didn't rest because he was tired. He rested because he was done. Genesis chapter 2 verse 1 says this, Thus the heavens and the earth were completed. The Sabbath day, therefore, is not just a day for rest, though it is for that, but for spiritual realignment to this eternal truth. There is a God in heaven, and it's not you. So quit acting like you are God. Quit carrying on your shoulders the weight and responsibility of the whole wide world. I call you to rest. I call you to build into your life a discipline that will remind you on a weekly basis in a healthy, life-giving way that even as you work, God is in control, so you don't have to be. That doesn't mean you don't work. What it means is you're not in control. You don't have to be. That's God's job. So give it a rest. Put it down. And for those of you who have a hard time doing that, I commend you as fourth commandment. Third purpose of Sabbath day rest is that it serves as a redemptive reminder. And the reminder is not only for the Israelites to be reminded of their redemption out of Egypt, but it is to be a reminder of our redemption as well. Deuteronomy 5, verse 15 indicates that part of Sabbath day's purpose is redemptive reminder. And it says it this way. Thus saith the Lord, remember that there was a time that you were slaves in Egypt, but that the Lord your God, your great Redeemer, brought you out with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. And part of the purpose of Sabbath is to back off and remember that. Well, guess what? We were slaves as well. Not to Egypt, but to sin and death. And we were incapable at one time in our life of saving ourselves, no matter how hard we tried, just like the Israelites were incapable of saving themselves out of their bondage in Egypt. And just like they needed the mighty hand of God and his outstretched arm to deliver them from the land of Egypt, so too it took quite literally the outstretched arms of our Messiah, our Yeshua, Jesus Christ himself, on the cross to deliver us from sin and death. So here's part of what I want you to do on Sabbath day, says the Lord. I want you to remember every time you come together as God's people that there was a time that you were a slave to sin and death, but that the Lord your God, your great Redeemer, has brought you out with a mighty hand and literally, again, with his outstretched arms in the cross. I want you in a focused way once a week on this day to remember amazing grace, to remember this good news, that the work is complete, that redemption is secure, that you are already loved, already accepted, adopted, sealed, and saved. You are already complete in him. And much like the creation story when God said of it two things, it is good and it is finished, of redemption towards you. he has said the same thing. It is good and it is finished. I want you to remember when you come together as God's people and I want you to remember on a consistent basis that at one time you were dead in your trespasses and in your sins but God being rich in mercy because of the great love with which he loved us made us alive together with Christ and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places and I want you to remember that it's by grace you've been saved through faith and that not of yourselves. It's a gift of God, not as a result of works, lest any of us should boast. Humble gratitude would be the appropriate response. And I want you to remember that at one time you were separate from Christ, strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ, you who were formerly far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. And I want you to remember that he came preaching peace to you who were far away. And he came preaching peace to those who were near. And I want you to remember that through him, that is Jesus, we have access in one spirit to the Father. And I want you to remember that you are no longer a stranger or an alien, even though you might feel that very way as you're sitting here in this gymnasium. But you are, here's the truth, a fellow citizen with the saints and are of God's household. You belong in the family of God, thus saith the Lord. I want you to remember. You know why? Because that's how you stay healthy. And this is how you stay strong. And this is how you stay centered in your life with God. And that's what Sabbath rest is all about. That's why he gave us the day as a gift so we can remember. Last week, in our worship time, we sang a song called Great Redeemer. It's one of my favorite. I love it. I have a number of favorite songs. This is on the list of favorite songs. It was the last song we did in our worship set. And one of the lines is, Great Redeemer, my Redeemer, I'll forever give you all my praise. Well, why will I forever give you all my praise? Well, the song answers it. Here's why. Because I've been, remember this? Renewed, reborn, redeemed, restored. Mark got us clapping. I don't have any rhythm at all, so I'm not going to try to. But he got us clapping. Remember? Just kind of going through your memory bank. And it was really fun. And we just kicked into this thing and reminded ourselves. I got a new hope and a new peace and new love, new joy, new source, new life, new home. I got a new song, new dance, new thoughts, new plans. We just had a ball singing that song. And at the end of that song, in all three services, we erupted in applause. Why didn't we erupt? Well, I'm sure part of it was because we just like to rock out, man. And I'm sure that was, yes, that's part of it. For some. But there's some people here who erupted who don't like to rock out at all. I didn't even like that part of the song. I'll tell you why I erupted and why I think, when it's really of God, why we erupt. It's because as you're singing the song and you hear the words and you hear yourself saying the words, I have a new hope and a new peace and a new love and a new joy and a new source and a new life. You know what happens? You remember. You remember. It's not like in your brain you forgot, but somehow in the course of a week that was just life, you forgot and then you came with God's people and you put a boundary around this day and a boundary around especially the morning when you gather with God's people and as you entered into worship and you heard the word you remembered and that is what Sabbath day rest is for how on earth could that be boring dull or sleepy which often we associate with Sabbath day Lord's day stuff that's the boring day my dad used to say Dave it's a sin to be boring which probably explains a lot of things to you this is a true story my dad would sit and he'd hear a preacher droning on about something that didn't seem to be inhabiting his soul and he'd be talking about it That's kind of too large. That's like a nice guy. My dad wouldn't walk away just going, okay, maybe we won't go there again. He'd walk away mad. He'd get, and our dad liked enough. I mean, he's a good guy. He just didn't ring your chimes. It's okay. He'd get mad. Why are you getting mad? Here's why he said, because this amazing grace, this is the best news I have ever heard. How on earth can this be boring? well when I think about that there are some ways that reminding yourself of amazing grace could be boring one way that it would be boring is if you have never been seized yourself by the wonder of amazing grace you never saw the fact that you were dead in your trespasses and in your sins and God by his great mercy made you alive if you never have experienced that then that message doesn't do anything for you but if you have it gives you chills okay it could be and a message like that doesn't inhabit your soul. It could, however, be that you are really redeemed. You see, there's another reason that they can be boring, and that is this, that if it gets reduced to legalistic religious death, which leads me to what I promised you last week, we would talk about this week, point number one, how legalistic religion can ruin Sabbath's joy and turn a gift day into a joyless duty day where rather than thinking of creative ways, and by the way, this is a really neat snapshot of what Sabbath day, Lord's day should be for us, where we think of creative ways to celebrate Sabbath with family and friends that restore our body, realign our heart, remind our spirit of amazing grace. Now, if it's been infected with legalism, I almost approach this day with fear where I anxiously wonder, am I resting the right way? Am I resting the right day? Am I resting enough? Am I resting too much? I need to rest a little, but if I rest too much, I'll be lazy. And on and on and on. And I've got this. Before you know it, this gift from God day is no longer a look forward to day. It's a have to day. It's no longer an exciting day. It's a dreadfully dull day. Instead of being a restful day, it's a work day. And the work is all about making sure I'm resting right. and some of you can relate to that well whatever your story might be of exhaustion because of your rest on sabbath day you got nothing on the pharisees of jesus day who raised this to an art form let me just tell you a little bit about what this was like in jesus day the talmud just to begin with had 24 chapters devoted to sabbath day observance alone to give you some perspective on that. It took a rabbi two and a half years to study and come to a place where he honestly felt like he had a grip on one of those chapters. I'll give you some examples. One of the Sabbath day rules was that you couldn't go any further from your home than 3,000 feet. One of the ways you got around that was that on Friday you would plant some food 3,000 feet from your house. On Sabbath day you could go to the place where the food was, eat the meal, and if you have a meal that becomes a home, you could go 3,000 feet more. And so all over the country you have food scattered and you go on vacation basically. See, whenever there's this law, it steals the joy, but there's always these loopholes everybody's always finding at the same time. You could never carry a burden that weighed more than a dry fig, but you could carry something that weighed half a fig twice. Threw an object in the air and caught it with the other hand, that was a violation. If he threw it in the air and caught it with the same hand, that was okay. A tailor couldn't carry a needle lest he sew something that was ripped. A scribe couldn't carry a pen lest he write something down. A student couldn't carry a book lest he read something and learn. You could only carry enough ink for two letters. That doesn't mean two letters to two friends. That means two letters, A and B. That's it. You couldn't take a bath. I like this one. Lest, as you're getting out of the bath, you spill water on the floor, and where the water touches, it's inadvertently washing the floor there, thus violating the Sabbath. If a man was sick, you could stop him from dying, but you couldn't make him better. I didn't get that one. How you do that came to me that you could put a Band-Aid on somebody, but it couldn't be a medicated Band-Aid. That's how it works. Here's a list of commonly forbidden things. In Jesus' day, sewing, plowing, reaping, threshing, winnowing, sifting, grinding, kneading, baking, washing, dyeing, making two threads, tying a knot, untying a knot, lighting a fire, extinguishing a fire, and on and on and on. It goes on my prayer. Bottom line, Sabbath day was a pain in the neck. And isn't it ironic that this day, designed by God to lift the burden, had become, for the people of God in his day, part of the burden they had to carry? There wasn't any rest in it at all. Now, some of you don't have to go back very far in your family history to remember some of this stuff. And I spoke with a number of you last week as you told me stories of grandma or grandpa or even your parents who wouldn't or couldn't do things like read a paper, watch TV, listen to radio, play Catch in the Yard, turn on a light. And if it got dark later in the day, you just sat in the dark, and you were doing the Sabbath and honoring God, and he was pleased with you because you didn't turn on the light. My wife, upon hearing this message, told me of friends that she had when she was a kid who were not allowed to go out to eat on the Sabbath or on the Lord's Day, whichever day they chose, Saturday or Sunday. And the reason they couldn't was because if they went out to eat, it was making the waiters or waitresses and the cooks work. And even though they acknowledged they were probably going to work anyway, they didn't want that on their conscience that they were the cause. I promise you that one of the ways to ruin Sabbath's joy is to have it be overtaken by legalistic religion. Legalistic religion can drain the joy out of any dimension of your Christian life. But guess what? As I thought of this, while I do need to acknowledge that some among us still have a lot of legalism around their Sabbath or Lord's Day understanding. The truth is, I do not believe that most of us in this room are losing Sabbath day's joy because of legalism. Most of us, excuse me, most of us have to think back. We have to remember our parents or our grandparents or what it was like when we were a kid to remember how it used to be. And that is why I also wanted to talk about point number two. And that is this, how an overreaction to legalistic religion can ruin not Sabbath's joy, but ruin Sabbath's value. Ruin our sense of Sabbath's benefit. Because some of the, I know, if you're like me, it's like your freedom from the legalism around this didn't usher you into this incredible, wonderful, joyful appreciation of Sabbath day. It just set you free from Sabbath day. I mean, it's just inordinate. It's a nothing. It's a day. There's no boundaries around it, no understanding of the benefit of it. Let me try to pull all of this together by telling you a story out of Matthew chapter 12. In fact, if you have your Bibles, turn to that with me. Matthew chapter 12. Let me catch you up with what's going on here. Jesus and his disciples on the Sabbath day were walking through a grain field, which by itself is a violation of the Sabbath. I'm going to assume that's 3,000 feet or further from their home. When they got hungry, they picked the heads of grain and began to eat it, which is threshing, which is also a violation of the Sabbath. The group of Pharisees, really into doing the Sabbath right, confronted Jesus for doing what was not lawful on the Sabbath. His response starts in verse 3. But he said to them, Have you not read? Stop right there. Jesus loves to do this to these Pharisees who read the scriptures all the time. Their hearts were hard as stone, but they read the scriptures all the time. It's full of sarcasm as he kind of wonders, did you guys miss this story about David? Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, he and his companions? How they entered the house of God and they ate the consecrated bread. The show bread is what some of your Bibles say. Which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but for the priests. Now, if you were a Pharisee and you knew that story, you knew that when David did that, even though it was a technical violation of something he shouldn't have done, that because they were in desperate need of food, that it was okay for them to eat that bread. Why? Well, the answer to that question, why was it okay, is actually a principle. It's this. Because meeting needs is more important than ceremonial law. In fact, ceremonial law, when understood properly, points you to and encourages you to meet needs. Let me say it this way. The law itself exists for the purpose of meeting needs. It's what it points to. So when you have a chance to meet a need, like they did in David's case when he was hungry, even though the meeting of that need violates a technicality of ceremonial law, violating the ceremonial law to meet the need is what the ceremonial law taught you to do. You track it with me? You follow that? Nah, I don't get it either. Let's move on to verse 5. It'll hopefully become clearer. He does it again here. Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath, the priests in the temple break the Sabbath and are innocent? Stop right there. What do you mean they break the Sabbath? Well, think about what do priests do on the Sabbath? They work. I preach. It's a violation of the law. Their work was to prepare the sacrifice, to kill the sacrifice. They had to lift a knife. They had to shed blood. That's all violation of the fire. That's work. They had to light the fire. You're not supposed to light a fire. You're not supposed to extinguish a fire. They had to lift the sacrifice onto the fire. That was a violation of the Sabbath as well. But everybody knew that they were innocent. This was okay. Why? Because there's a principle that the ceremony itself speaks to, that supersedes the ceremony. And that is this. We're here to serve God. The priests were serving God. First principle that supersedes ceremonial law is we're here to meet needs. That's what the law calls us to. Second principle, we're here to serve God. That's what the law calls us to. In verse 7, my paraphrase of verse 7, what Jesus says to them is this. What you guys don't understand and never have is that what I really care about is compassion, not just sacrifice. And I emphasize the just there. The sacrifice mattered. It was a picture of something that was incredibly important. The problem is, you guys have the ceremonial law down really well. You're just missing meeting people's needs and serving God and experiencing compassion. And that means you've missed it all because what the ceremonial law speaks to is meeting needs, serving God, feeling compassion, and showing mercy. let me just kind of pull this together this way what he's saying is he gives these three illustrations of the showbread which is about meeting needs the temple which is about serving God and then this compassion which is about compassion what he's saying is he's revealing actually the ultimate intent of Sabbath day and it's this that born of your physical restoration spiritual realignment and redemptive remembering of amazing grace, there would come renewed energy and restored joy in order that you would be better able, because of your restoration and realignment, to meet needs, serve God, feel compassion, and show mercy. Show mercy. Where did that come from? Verse 10. And behold, there was a man with a withered hand. And the Pharisees questioned Jesus, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, in order that they might accuse him? Because their opinion was it wasn't. Remember, you could heal, but you couldn't make them better. Remember? And he said to them, what man shall there be among you who shall have one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more value then is a man than a sheep? So then it is lawful, here's the key, to do good on the Sabbath. See, I thought the Sabbath was just for laying around in the dark and resting and making sure I'm doing it right. You need to understand that you're resting in order to what? With renewed energy and joy, do good. And doing good on the Sabbath is really appropriate. Nothing could be more of it. Then he said to the man, stretch out your hand. He stretched it out, and it was restored to normal like the other. What Jesus is here revealing is that Sabbath day observance is not just about getting rested and sitting in the dark, feeling holy. It's about getting rested and realigned in order to do good. Now, with that in mind, you know what would be consistent with Sabbath day observance? This. Just consider this. That after church, even today, some of you would go on a picnic with family and friends. But this time, and you weren't even planning on doing this necessarily, but you You came to church, you got restored, realigned, and you remembered grace. This time, as you're walking out the door with your plans for a wonderful time of resting and enjoying the people you love, this time you invite someone who you know would otherwise spend this day by themselves. And you know, any other day, maybe, but Sabbath, you wouldn't have even thought of that. And you wouldn't have even thought, maybe you would have thought of it, but you wouldn't have thought of that person. but because you put a bracket around the day and you stopped and you used the stopping to rest and realign and and in the realignment you remembered amazing grace you found again the compassion that you lost on thursday and you didn't lose it on thursday because you're bad you lost it on thursday because you're busy and you're more than busy you're kind of beat and I don't know about you but I when I'm tired there's a thing that goes along with tired for me it's grumpy and it's not you know it's as simple as there's nothing left to give God says I know how you're wired I know what you need and you need a discipline in your life of putting a bracket around a day where you come together with God's people and you restore yourself physically and you realign your heart spiritually and you remember consistently amazing grace you need to hear it over and over you know why because we forget. And suddenly you find your compassion again. You find it on Sabbath day. So after church, I'm just giving you some examples. I'd encourage you to just be creative. Let the Spirit of God, as he restores you, stir up in you ways to do good. This day, you go home and you're just full again of an awareness of grace and alignment to kingdom values. So what happens is you end up calling that single mom down the block whose brakes went out on Friday afternoon. And you heard about it, and you kind of felt bad for it and wondered what she was going to do. Not only can't she find somebody to fix her brakes, but quite frankly, she doesn't have the money to fix her brakes. Come home from church and Saturday, so rest sit in the dark and feel holy. Something dawns on you, and you know what? You probably wouldn't have even thought of this on Thursday, not because you're bad, but because you're beat. And you say, honey, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to go down the block, And I'm going to get her car, pull it in her garage. I'm going to fix that lady's brakes. Would you just picture that? Just give a picture of that. I don't know. I said, this is the Lord's day. You can't be. And he's coming in. This guy, a big old galoot guy. I make him big. He's a big guy. And after he does that job, drives the car back over to that gal, comes back into the kitchen with his wife, and he's full of grease. And he's got a tear in his eye because he did the kingdom. He did sleep. Is that Sabbath? Oh, that is the Sabbath. That's helping somebody who can't help themselves. That's exactly what Jesus did with the man who had a withered hand. Should you do that on the Sabbath, though? Should you do that on the Lord's Day? Absolutely. What better day than that day to do good? What a great day to meet and eat. What a great day to serve God. What an incredible day to feel compassion and show mercy. And do you understand the point of the day? I've been harping away on this for two weeks. You put the boundary around the day, you have some discipline around the day, so that you do your duty that day and you're off the hook the rest of the week. No, you put some discipline around this day, so that as these things of learning to rest and realign, it bleeds into the next day. And you know what, you can't do it the whole day, but on Monday you put a bracket around a couple hours. where, you know what, I need some rest, and I need to realign, and I need to remember amazing grace so that I can find my compassion again. This is incredibly important. Are you getting the idea that this Sabbath day rest is about something bigger than a day? It's a way of life. It's called kingdom life. By the way, in case you're suspicious about this whole thing, Jesus, knowing they would be suspicious about doing things on Sabbath? Check out verse 8, where Jesus says of himself, the reason I'm doing all this is because I am the Lord of the Sabbath. It's an incredible claim. It's, by the way, a claim of deity as well as being the Lord of the Sabbath. And when he says that of himself, basically what he's saying, and it's kind of, you know, I know you guys aren't going to accept this, but I'm still giving this to you, and it's in your face. It means I initiated this whole thing. Therefore, as the Lord of the Sabbath, I have a right, I have authority to interpret the Sabbath. And I will determine its purpose and its meaning. Hear, therefore, the word of the Lord. The purpose of Sabbath day. The purpose of Sabbath rest is physical restoration, spiritual realignment, redemptive remembering. in order that you might be able to, with rediscovered joy and renewed energy, love God, love people, meet needs, serve the Lord, feel compassion, and do mercy. It's as simple as a little cliche. We've bounced around here for years. You can't give what you don't have. Well, if it's true that you can't give what you don't have, then remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Put a bracket around that day. Have some discipline around that day. Use the day to restore yourself and realign yourself and remind yourself of amazing grace. And order that with necessary joy and renewed energy, you can meet needs. Serve God. Show compassion and do mercy. So people of God, let's blow off legalism around this thing. But let's not blow off this day. Know what? It's a good day. It's a gift day. It's a happy day. It's a restoration, realignment, remembering amazing grace day. In order that we as God's people can meet needs with joy and freedom, serve God the same, feel compassion, and do mercy. Final question. But which day is the day? Is it Saturday or is it Sunday? the text is seventh day I have Jewish friends, it's seventh day I have Messianic Jewish friends it's seventh day, it's the Sabbath, it's Saturday Christians historically have chosen Sunday not Saturday there are reasons for that the historic reason for Sunday's celebration of Christian faith is because it was Sunday that our Redeemer, who brought us out of our Egypt, secured that redemption by his resurrection. That is the whole etymology, if you will, the history of Sunday celebration for Christians. And it is clear from Scripture, even, that the Church of Jesus Christ, from pretty much day one of its inception, celebrated together on Sunday. Acts 2, verse 1, the disciples were meeting together the first day of the week. Acts 20, verse 7, they met together regularly for the breaking of bread on the first day of the week. 1 Corinthians 16, 1. They were to take the collection of their offerings when they met together on the first day of the week. By that time, it had become part of their routine. First day of the week, that's when we do our come-together celebration, what we would maybe refer to as put a bracket around it today. So here's my answer to the question, is it Saturday or Sunday? pick a day it doesn't matter now I would think the vast majority of people here aren't at all affected by the fact that I just said it doesn't matter but there may be a few who go what does it mean it doesn't matter it matters a lot okay so to you I want to say this by saying it doesn't matter and pick a day I am not being glib I'm actually I think I'm pretty safe ground because I'm agreeing with Paul who said in Romans 14.5, of the Sabbath, one man regards one day above another. Another regards every day alike. Here's what you need to do. Let each man be fully convinced in his own mind. You know what that sounds like? You've got some latitude here. Colossians 2.16, he gets a little bigger about this because evidently, just like, did you remember some of the debates in the early church where, you know, it came to the Jew first and then also Gentiles were getting in and they were coming in with faith in Christ but they didn't have a lot of the religious baggage and there was a big debate about whether Gentiles could really be saved if they weren't circumcised remember that it was a huge thing and Peter at the council of Jerusalem said listen what saved them was faith in Christ not their circumcision and there was debate about Sabbath day observance and Paul had to come on pretty strong when he said this let no one act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a Sabbath day. Things which are a mere shadow of what is to come. Sabbath day, according to Paul, was a shadow of what was to come. But the substance belongs to Christ. Be concerned about the substance of the day. There's some latitude about the day. Now, I could move on at that point. I need to do, I just want to do a little bit of teaching and explain this shadow substance thing, and I think it'll help you move into this with, hopefully, a little more freedom. The shadow substance thing, and why it gives us some latitude around the day. The entire sacrificial system that God gave to Israel, I think most of you know, was to serve for them as a shadow, or a prefiguring, if you will, of what would be given substance or what would be finally fulfilled in Christ. So all their sacrificial things that were designed to forgive their sin, it was never quite enough, but it was what God gave them for that dispensation, if you will, until the fullness of redemption would be completed through Christ. He was the substance, that was the shadow. When you have the substance, you no longer need the shadow. Hebrews 10, 11 says this, that every high priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices which can never take away sin but he that is christ having offered one sacrifice for all time sat down at the right hand of the father question tie this in with our study last week of genesis 2 when he finished with creation why did jesus sit down when he was done with redemption when he when why did he sit down at the right hand of the father was he tired he was no more tired than he was when he was in the Godhead, having finished creation, looking at it and saying two things. It is good and it is what? Finished. When he was done with redemption, he our great high priest sat down. You know why? He was really tired. He wasn't tired at all. He was done. It is finished and now in Christ you have been made complete. Done deal. You belong to him. Sabbath day as originally given to the Jews was a shadow, a picture of a promise of something to come. And that something is Christ himself, the fulfillment of the promise of rest, the substance that the shadow pointed to, Hebrews 4, 9. There is now, therefore, a Sabbath rest for the people of God, for the one who enters his rest as himself also rested from his works just as God did from his. Point of it all. is that Sabbath rest is not ultimately found in a day, though we call you to a day where you can remember the substance. Sabbath, however, is about substance that's found not in a day, but in a person, Jesus Christ. And let me tell you something just in a real practical note that evidences the kind of Sabbath rest that comes to us when we understand the substance of Sabbath rest that's found in Christ. when you understand this sabbath rest you can work and rest at the same time make any sense to you oh that's that's weird let me let me tell you exactly how it's like what i'm hopefully doing right now you know i'm kind of working my head off here i'm about to lose my voice and i'm actually quite disgustingly sweaty and this is going on the radio and you know what when i'm preaching i've done this for a long time and you know what i know about myself, I know that there are times when I'm up here preaching and I'm working, but inside, I'm working too. I'm striving like crazy and it doesn't feel like it's going well and I hope you like it and I hope you like me. And you don't, you know, I still look the same. But inside, I'm going crazy. Do you know what I'm talking about? You've done that. And there are other times when I'm working my head off and I'm yelling, screaming, sweating, I'm losing my voice, but you know what? On the inside, there's this I have a rest. Not all the time, but a lot of times there's this inside this rest. You know, because I am resting in the Sabbath rest that I have found in Christ. He's the one who does the work. He's the one who's going to call you to faith. He's the one who's going to call you to holiness. I can't say it good enough to call you out. And even as I work, I rest. You know what that is? Sabbath rest. You know how you learn it? One way, it's a wonderful tool. Put a boundary around a day. Put a boundary around a day. Or with some intentionality and some purpose. You say, you know, I'm going to back off today, and I'm going to spend some time with God's people, restoring my body, realigning my heart, remembering in this place amazing grace so I can serve and I can give and I can go. So pick a day. Saturday, good choice. Some of you observe Sabbath day. and we blessed that. We had a group of people that we love dearly who live in Jerusalem and teach in Jerusalem, Ariel and Devorah Berkowitz and David and Margie Freeman who have brought some wonderful teaching to us about Sabbath day and have helped a lot of our people and hopefully this is going to spread through our church to kind of understand and experience more creatively Sabbath and Sabbath on Saturday. Saturday is a good day to do it, but you know what? So is Sunday. So is Sunday. for that is the day, beloved, that our Lord Jesus Christ, who is our Sabbath rest, secured that rest by virtue of his resurrection. And Christians since that time have gathered on the first day of the week. And you know why they do? To restore, realign, and remember that we have a great Redeemer. We have a great Redeemer and we've been saved by amazing grace. Here's the word of the Lord. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it set apart. Why? Because it's a good day. For restoration, realignment, and remembering amazing grace. In order that we can with great joy and renewed energy love God, love people, meet in need, serve the Lord, feel compassion, and show mercy. You've gotten the idea? I think you have. That Sabbath rest is not just about a day. It's about a way of living. And that way of living is called kingdom of living. I'd like you to stand as we close. let's pray father I thank you again for the reminder through this word to me that you really do know how we're wired and you love us so much give us these gifts that if we in obedience will enter into these disciplines you will meet us with restoration and you will empower us to realign and to remember amazing grace in order that we can do the life of the kingdom and live it out with our friends and our family and in our neighborhoods and workplaces. Jesus, we pray by your spirit you would release these things and grow these things among us and we ask it all in the wonderful name of our Redeemer, even Jesus and all God's people said, Amen.
