Open your Bibles with me to the book of Ephesians, the 5th chapter, the 18th verse. Ephesians chapter 5, verse 18. I think we're pretty familiar with this verse by now. Do not be drunk with wine, for that is dissipation or in which is excess, but be filled with the Spirit. We're entering our fourth week in the study of this one verse. That is a long time to be in one verse. I think you know that, and I realize that. And every time we seem to bog down, I feel some sort of strange urge to explain, especially for our visitors, why we would do this and crazy things like that. I think one of the things you need to know, if you're visiting Open Door, or if you've been at Open Door for some time and have not caught on to the fact yet, we have a fierce commitment here to the Word of God. And I want you to know that that commitment to teaching and preaching and understanding and applying the Word of God to our lives is not just my commitment, but it is our commitment. It is the commitment of our elders and our leadership. In fact, that commitment is so strong that there are times when I personally get pulled aside by one of our elders who sees me getting involved in things that are peripheral and maybe aren't nearly as important as the expositing of the Word of God and say, come on and get back. And even pulling me aside and saying, David, a little too much of your own opinion, get back to the text. And I appreciate that. But you need to know that that's the commitment from which everything we believe is going to flow. That is where we're going to find our destiny as we open the Word and take it apart and teach it and explain it and then submit to it in obedience. We also believe, and I also believe firmly and have had this reaffirmed to me over and over again by people like you, that I believe that God's people are yearning today for a voice, as it were, of the prophets of God who are coming into the pulpits and saying, Thus saith the Lord. Not interested in what I think, not interested in what I would reason, but what the Word of God is saying to us and explaining it clearly. In order to do that, we better do that. And if it takes a lot of time, so be it. These things that we are discussing these weeks are absolutely important, absolutely essential, especially this particular text, to the living of the worthy walk, the living of the Christian life. Let's pray as we get into it. Father, this morning as we break open once again your sacred text, as we look at this crucial verse that is, in fact, the key, the focus, the energizer of everything we've learned throughout this whole year in the book of Ephesians, I pray, Father, this morning for clarity. I pray even for physical strength for myself. I pray for him that we would understand the things that this text is teaching us concerning what it means to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Give strength where strength is needed and insight. And then the ability to apply these truths in the living of our lives. I ask these things in your name. Amen. We have seen in these last four weeks that this text breaks down into three very simple segments. The first segment was the contrast, do not be drunk with wine for that is dissipation. And that was being contrasted to the second segment and that was the command, be filled with the Holy Spirit. The third segment is the consequences of the Spirit-filled life. And it's amazing how much we're going to learn in the next few weeks about what the consequences or the results of a Spirit-filled life is going to go back and teach us what it means to be filled with the Spirit. How to be filled with the Spirit. We've hit it from the contrast. We've looked at the command. We're going to look at the consequences and we're still going to be teaching through the consequences what it means to be filled with the Holy Spirit. We're going to learn that the filling of the Holy Spirit infects every dimension of our lives. We're going to learn that what we need to do is get away from this idea that the filling of the Spirit is some experience and experience some wonderful, mystical, mysterious that I can't understand and never can put my finger on. We're going to understand that the evidence of the filling of the Spirit is very easy. It results in a whole lot of right relationships, submitting to one another, loving one another. It results in a husband like me learning how to love my wife. Real practical stuff. A whole lot of serving is a result of a Spirit-filled life. A whole lot of singing, verse 19, is a result of a Spirit-filled life. We're also going to notice that there's all sorts of variety in terms of the response. You know, one of the problems we have in our Christian life, and maybe it's something that isn't anything to do with our Christian life is something to do with being human. I have an experience and all of a sudden I decide that that experience is the way it has to be. Something happens to me in a worship service and we happen to sing a certain song and I just get the idea that I've got to sing that song and that's the only song that can work and if I accepted the Lord by coming forward that's the only way you can do it and I get these little things formulas and that's the only way God can work. Incredible. The variety that the Holy Spirit of God infuses into the life that is fully has. This filling of the Spirit we are discovering is not an experience, it is a lifestyle. And sometimes I sing, and sometimes I cry, and sometimes I speak psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. And sometimes I laugh, and sometimes I give thanks, and sometimes what I need to do and the result of the filling of the Spirit is I learn how to submit, and I learn how to love my wife, and then I learn how to be the dad I need to be, and I learn how to be the child I needto be. the filling of the Spirit. The new question that maybe we need to be walking around asking is have you been filled by the Spirit as evidenced by love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, right relationships? Do you love your wife? And on, and on, and on. That's next week. Let's get back to the text and run with me as we do. We spoke, we spoke, we spoke first of all of the contrast in the filling of the Spirit. Be not drunk with wine, in which is asotia, or excess. And we learned right off the bat that Paul's warning is involving two basic principles. And this is just in review very quickly, but I need to do it. The first principle was that of an external control. Don't let something outside of yourself be the source of your joy. And excess was the second principle, excess of that same external control. Wine, we discovered, that he is using here, is just a perfect illustration of both those problems, both external control and excess of the same. It's an illustration of the source of my joy and my fulfillment being an artificial one, a temporary one. Paul, we discovered, is not even making a statement here concerning whether wine is good or bad. His principle is external control and excess. We discovered and spoke together of the fact that if he had been writing to us, he probably would have used a different illustration. Most of us have this problem of wine. Many of us have this problem of wine under control. For many believers, this wine thing is just something that's taboo, and we don't deal with it, and we come to a text like this, and if we don't cut through the surface, we kind of come away saying, yeah, I got that under control. You don't understand. The principle is external control. Anything you're using outside of yourself, outside of the internal control of the Holy Spirit, is an external control. And it's wrong. An excess of sin. He would come to us and say, be not drunk on materialism. Which is excess. Something wrong with having things? No. Excess? Yes. got it? I think you remember that. Be not drunk with money. Be not drunk with position. Be not drunk with your career. Be not drunk even with your family. Don't let that be the sole source of your fulfillment. Why? Because it won't work. It won't work. Is there anything innately wrong with those things? Nothing wrong with those things until what? Until it becomes the source of my joy, the source of my joy, until it moves into excess. For the only thing that can bring real fulfillment is that internal control of the filling of the Spirit. Then we had to begin to pursue, okay, what does that mean? What is this filling of the Spirit? We went to the next segment that Paul is dealing with, and that is the command, be not drunk with wine, for that is excess. But, here's the command, be filled with the Spirit. The first thing we learned, as we continued to lay the foundation, we decided that one of the things we had to make clear right off the bat was this, that however we were going to define it, however we were going to explain it, whatever I understand the feeling of the Spirit to me, one thing was absolutely sure, was absolutely fixed in our minds, the Spirit-filled life is not an option. We cannot let ourselves get into the mentality that many of us have in the church that we can kind of have two little categories. There's the category of Christians who are really on fire and really want to go, and there's a category of the Christians who really don't give a rip about things of the Lord and really don't want to grow at all. And we understood last week that there are people like that. People who have been seen with the Holy Spirit and dwelt with the Holy Spirit, all of the promises of God are yea and amen to them, and they don't care. That is a fact. That happens. What we need to get away from the fact is that that's somehow okay. We cannot accept that as being the norm. But then our eyes were opened to the fact that the real problem is that what we see in so many of our churches is a pervasive mediocrity concerning the things of the Lord. A pervasive shallowness and lack of enthusiasm and lack of application concerning what God has really extolled us and exhorted us to be doing in our lives. Pervasive lack of commitment and shallowness and people pretending. And the real problem is that before we know it, that mediocrity is being accepted as the norm. That mediocrity is being accepted as the standard to which we all should attain. we all just kind of sit on our thumbs doing nothing and never growing and thinking this is the abundant life and the problem and this is where I come in and get even a little bit angry the problem is this is that when people who are dealing with Christianity and questioning whether they even want to have anything to do with this or not come into a church whose standard is spiritual mediocrity they say like many of us even here are saying right now is that all there is? is that all there is? I remember the time in my life when I came to that exact point and I looked at the mediocrity that was so pervasive in the church in terms of spiritual things and depth and I just asked if that is all there is then I don't want to have anything to do with it and I think if that's all there is then that's a logical conclusion and that's a valid way to go if it is just mediocre if there is no power and no life and no real spirit control producing love and joy and peace and long suffering then where is the value? Very real question. It's a hard question. Okay. We understand that the Lord has commanded us to be filled. Be filled with the Holy Spirit. And anything less than that is absolute, total, flat out disobedience to God. But again, I'm still left. I'm all stirred up to be filled with the Spirit. And I don't know how. What does that mean to be filled with the Holy Spirit? Quickly, we need to go through some of these things again. I apologize for the review, and yet I don't apologize at all. We need to know these things. I know that last week I was talking really fast. And many of you even indicated to me that I went a little too fast. And I even felt it. I know that I always talk fast. But I'll tell you something. When I notice it, we're really buzzing. these principles are important if this review is a little too redundant for me I apologize but we all need to catch them we need to know we need to understand the first thing we understood last week was that every believer is the possessor of the Holy Spirit in his fullness write that down if you didn't get it last week every single believer in Jesus Christ is a possessor of the Holy Spirit in his fullness. You will never have more of the Holy Spirit than you had at the moment you received Christ as your Savior. Romans 8, 9. If anyone does not have the Holy Spirit, he's not saved. We have people asking to receive the Holy Spirit after they're saved. That's absolutely ludicrous because when you receive Christ, you receive the Holy Spirit. 1 Corinthians 6, 19 was dealing with Christians, remember, last week, who were having a problem with carnality. They weren't being who they were. They were living in consistent claims of sin. And Paul did not say you need to receive the Holy Spirit. He said this. Don't you realize, don't you know that your body is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit who is in you? Okay, I think we've got that. Not too many people are really confused about that point, but I still think it needs to be expressed. Every believer is the possessor of the Holy Spirit in his fullness. The second thing is that we define some terms and explain them in order to get us a picture of what it means to be filled. Philippians 12, 13 says this, For by one Spirit we have already been baptized into one body and were already made to drink of one Spirit. We discuss the baptism of the Holy Spirit into the body of Christ. We discuss the fact that the baptism of the Spirit into the body of Christ is not an experience. The baptism of the Spirit is non-experiential. The baptism of the Spirit into the body of Christ is a theological reality. God did that when you received Christ as your Savior. It's the act of God whereupon at salvation He places you or baptizes you into the body. Again, referring back to 1 Corinthians 12, 13. Have already been baptized. To drink in the Spirit is not some sort of experience. It's something God does when you receive Christ. You drink in or take in the Holy Spirit. Again, reaffirming the fact that every believer is a possessor of the Holy Spirit and at salvation you were baptized or placed into the body of Christ. Nowhere in Scripture are we commanded to be baptized in the Spirit. There are seven references to the baptism of the Spirit into the body of Christ. None of them are in the imperative. We're not commanded to be baptized in the Spirit. We are not commanded to drink in the Spirit. We are not commanded to be sealed in the Spirit. We are not commanded to be indwelt with the Spirit. Those are things that God does. He has done them. The command is this, believer, be filled. Be filled. This is where man's responsibility comes in. We discovered last week that it's possible for a believer to be baptized in the Spirit, into the body of Christ, to be sealed in the Spirit, to be indwelt with the Spirit, and never, ever, ever experience what we're calling here, the filling of the Spirit, and live his entire Christian life, in what we've described earlier, as a mediocre state. And it seems like even if we would go into our own hearts, it seems that if we're honest with ourselves, the sad truth is that too often the majority of our living is in that state of mediocrity, And we never understand this filling of the Spirit. Another thing we discovered in our study, and that's what this has been and it's going to continue to be today, a study. We discovered that not only is this particular phrase be filled in the imperative mood in the Greek, but also is in the present tense. And that gives us some other meaning that we can understand and paint the picture a little more clearly concerning the filling of the Spirit. I think you ought to understand our grammar to realize what past tense means, you know. Past tense is something that happens before. Future tense is something that will happen. The present tense is something that's happening right here, right now. But in Greek, excuse me, the present tense verb is something that has a little more explanation or vitality or fullness than just something that's happening right now. It has to do with continuous action. When a verb is stated in the Word of God and it's in the present tense, it means it is continuing to happen. It isn't just happening here. It is continuous action. And so what we talked about last week, that this little phrase needs to be translated this way. Be being kept filled with the Spirit. It is not an experience. It is not the time I just walk forward and experience a filling forevermore to be filled. I need to clear something up here. Again, as we're teaching, there are times in our lives when we are broken before God and our hearts open up and I make a new kind of commitment to God and I would tie that in with Romans 12.1. I urge you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice. That is not necessarily, however, to be confused with the filling of the Spirit which is taking place every day, moment by moment, step by step, day by day, being continually filled with the Spirit. the illustration I use is kind of crude, but I like crude illustrations. We usually remember them. It's that the filling of the Holy Spirit is not like deodorant. It's not like red guard deodorant. One shot and you're good for the whole day. It doesn't work that way. My devotions this morning and the filling as I opened myself up to him and he filled me isn't good for now. It's moment by moment, step by step. In my experience last week, my experience at camp, my experience coming forward was good and valid and exciting and real. But it isn't good for now. Moment by moment, being continually kept filled. Okay, the examination continued. And we simply defined and backed off and said, okay, let's look at this little word filled. The word filled. Incredible kinds of shades of meaning. Again, looking at the Greek. The Greek word is plerao. Three shades of meaning it had. Used to speak of the wind filling the sails. The wind filling the sails. To be borne along by the Spirit of God. To be carried along by the Spirit of God. To be moved along. To have the pressure of one's life. be the Holy Spirit of God moving me from one encounter to another, from one job to another. The wind. The second use for that word was that of permeation. The function of the Holy Spirit to permeate me. And this ties in so well with some of the things we talked about in Ephesians with that new nature living in me and what I'm supposed to do is be in the process of taking off the old and putting on the new. Permeating. Letting that energy of God permeate my life so that on the outside I look like I am on the inside. Permeation. To be filled with the Spirit. This is the Christ life. Be imitators of Christ by the Holy Spirit. Permeating your life. The third use of the word plerao. Was the one that really has the most punch. And probably is the closest to what he really meant. It has to do with the simple word control. And it means this. Absolute control. We discussed the various ways in the gospel records. That this word was being used. And we talked of places where they were filled with fear. Play rao. They were play rao with fear. That meant that they were absolutely full of fear. There was no room for any other emotion. Remember? There was no balance. There was not a little bit of fear and a little bit of joy and a little bit of sorrow and a little bit of joy and a little bit of love and a little bit of hate. It was all hate, all love, all fear, all joy. Play rao. And that's exactly what he's saying here when he says be filled with the Holy Spirit. not a little bit for the flesh, a little bit for the spirit, a little bit for me, a little bit for God, kind of balancing it all off. It's all the spirit, complete, absolute control. To be born along by his power, to be permeated by his presence, to be controlled, full, filled with his presence. The million dollar question that we left with last Sunday was this, how? Wonderful. To be born along, to be filled, to be permeated. Wonderful. wonderful truth. That's what I want. How do I do it? What is it that unleashes this incredible power that you say is living, resident, dwelling within me? Again, one of the things that's kind of strange without, there is nothing cute about this. There is nothing mysterious about this. A simple study of the text and some other related texts can very clearly give us some suggestions and some directions to understand that this is not some sort of mystery, mystical thing that's really only just for a few. This is filling the Spirit just for a few people who kind of discover the secret. You know the first thing I want you to understand? And again, this is going to come right out of the text as we exegete it a little bit. The first thing I want us to see that the filling of the Spirit is not something you beg God to do. Now that runs right into the teeth of a lot of theology that's flying around today. The filling of the Spirit is not something you beg God to do. Lord, fill me. You don't sit and wait. You don't sit and kind of pray God and beg Him to fill you and then wait for something to kind of hit you on the head and all of a sudden you're filled. There's no spiritual gymnastics that you have to go through and try to see where it is that it'll hit me. Maybe if I go to that church it'll hit me there or over here it'll hit me there. People have told me and shared with me over the years, for years and years, about their search for the Holy Spirit's filling, their quest for the Holy Spirit's filling. I wanted to be filled, and I couldn't be filled, and I didn't know how to be filled, and I went and they prayed, and I got it, and I begged, and I got it, finally, after years. The error in that is real obvious. The error can simply, I can put my finger right on it right now, because this is something that God has commanded us to do. He has said, be filled. he's commanded us to do it it isn't like and what he's saying is basically this I want you to be filled I want you to be filled I want you to be filled and I'm going oh please oh I don't know how to do it what do I do I want to be filled and something's going off in two different directions here something's being misunderstood I don't want to be cruel but my experience has been that those who are begging for some experience to hit them my experience has been that one they either give up and just end up in total disillusionment or else they find out what it is that they're supposed to do or find out how they're supposed to act when they're filled with despair and they act that way. I want you to remember again, this is a command. He has said, I want you to be filled. I want you to be filled. And we just beg God to fill us. And I want you to catch what I'm going to say right now. We act as if there is some reluctance on His part to do it for us. And if I could just beg him and knock at his door and finally break down that reluctance, he would then fill me. The reason he is their believer is to fill you. That's why he came. That's his function, to fill the believer, to permeate his life. That's his greatest desire. If anything needs to be broken down, it's me. His desire is to fill me. And I have frustrated His desire all my life. Do you see that? He came and indwelt me and sealed me and lives in me. And I have frustrated His desire for me all my life. What I need to do in terms of discovering how to be filled with the Holy Spirit is discover those things in my life that is blocking or hindering Him from doing what His greatest desire is in me to do. and when those conditions are met he will fill when those conditions are met he will fill let me give you another thing in terms of just studying that gives us a feel so you understand why i'm going in this direction not only is this in the imperative a command be filled not only is it in the present tense be being continually filled but it is present imperative passive passive now what does passive mean? What passive means is I can give you the distinguishment this way. An active verb is this. I shot Eric with a gun. And that's active. I was involved in the action. Passive was I was shot by Eric. Bam. I was the recipient of the action. Okay? Passive is in this filling of the spirit is this. I don't fill myself. There's nothing I can do to fill myself. God fills. What I need to do is clear the way for him to do what he will do when I've removed those things that hinder him when I've yielded and surrendered and emptied myself and maybe all of those words can simply be wrapped up in one simple one obedience he will fill there are conditions that need to be met on my part and maybe we need to discuss those things that need to be adjusted in my life so that he can do what he's there to do the first two I want to give you are negative then comes the positive and again this is simple there is no great mysterious thing there is no elusive thing here maybe the reason I wonder sometimes we're always looking for and experience something to kind of hit me separate from my own will and my own movement toward God is that I don't want to move toward God I don't want to confess my sin I don't want to open myself to Him I want an experience and so that's what I search for simple, practical the first two are negative the first one is this you want to be filled with the spirit you want to be controlled and dominated and permeated by his very presence here's one suggestion Ephesians 4.30 grieve not the spirit of God and you know what this is in the form of a command also grieve not the spirit of God the Christian is indwelt with the Holy Spirit so that Christ can be formed in me that's why he's there that's his function and the normal flow of the Holy Spirit's existence in my life is that that life does produce love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, and on, and on, and on. That's the normal flow. That's normal Christianity, as John Stott would say. This is normal Christianity. Mediocrity may be average, but it isn't normal. It isn't right. It isn't okay. Normal Christianity is the life of God flowing through me because I've given Him access to every dimension of my life. we grieve the Holy Spirit with little word sin easy the presence of sin grieves the Holy Spirit it is the roadblock it frustrates him from doing what he came to do now I could go into all sorts of dimensions of that I'm going to need you to deal with that in your own life what sin is in your life that is keeping the Holy Spirit from functioning in you something I want you to catch right here is when we have grieved the Holy Spirit when we are frustrating the Holy Spirit's work in our life because of sin being present there, whether it be an attitude or an activity or anything, the function of the Holy Spirit in your life changes. Now this is very important. I really want you to pay attention right here. We always talk about the functions of the Holy Spirit. I could preach a sermon on the activity of the Holy Spirit and all of His different functions. Well, I want to tell you something. When we're grieving the Holy Spirit because of some sort of sin, His function in our life changes. You know what it changes from? It changes from a ministry of working through me to you, A ministry of flowing through me so that I can meet people's needs and deal with all sorts of things in the ministry. And you too, producing love, joy, peace, all those things. To the point when it's grieved and sin is present, his ministry changes from one of working through me, turning around to working on me. You see that? He can't be working through me then. Too many things are blocking the way. He's got to turn his whole function into one of a ministering ministry to me. there comes discipline and all those other things. And God isn't working through me, then He's working on me. And I think that's a sickening kind of thought. And even kind of a waste of time, when we begin to couple what we're learning here with what we're learning in the evenings concerning the coming of the Comforter, God in His fullness, alive in me, wanting to work through me, not being able to, having to work on me, sometimes all my life. no freedom you know what you don't have to plead God fill me fill me like it's some magic wand you know what you need to do you need to deal with your sin you need to deal with your sin confession repentance and you know what he'll do he'll do then what he came to do you don't even have to ask him he'll fill you a couple weeks ago I was just about to come into the pulpit and I had a sermon I wanted to preach and you know it was about the filling of the spirit and I was praying that morning real early in the morning, Lord, I just need to be filled. And it was good, it's fine. But there was something I had with a brother or sister in our church and before I could preach and be filled, I needed to go and confess and tell that person what was wrong and what was off and why I had done something the night before and it was goofy. It would be so much easier if I could have just prayed that 6.30 in the morning on Sunday morning and said, Lord, fill me. And he hit me with a, filled me, it was great. as soon as I confessed and dealt with that sin I was filled, I didn't have to ask it was done he will do what he said he would do we need to take away the obstacles that are keeping him from doing what he wants to do don't quench the spirit don't grieve the spirit the second one is don't quench the spirit and that's used to denote putting out a fire putting out a fire, putting a lid on something choking the life out of it it involves basically two things a lack of dedication and a lack of faith This is the end of side one. Do not fast forward the tape. Please turn the cassette over now to continue listening on side two. Thank you.... To not respond, let's say, to Romans 12, 1, I urge you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice. To not respond to that and give myself to Him fully as best I know how. This is not sinless perfection. Just giving myself to Him as best I know how. To not respond to that when I sense the Spirit moving me to that is to what? It's to quench the Spirit. It's to keep Him from working. It's to keep Him from moving me to different levels of commitment. I talked to a guy not long ago who came. And we talked and we prayed. And one of the things he told me, he says, Dave, if I didn't deal with this today, I don't know when I ever would. Because I've been putting a lid on this for months. Quench the spirit. And then you have the life, the resource, all of the energy and power of God living in you and never doing what he came to do. And I say, oh, I want to be filled, I want to be filled. Like some experience will hit me. Quench not the spirit. Grieve not the spirit. Another dimension is just lack of faith. every time every time I limit what I think the Spirit of God can do in our church I'm quenching the Spirit every time I say well he can work this way but it can't work that way I'm limiting, I'm quenching what the Spirit of God can do among us every time I decide to not believe God I quench the Spirit every time I decide to run the church like I run a business I quench the Spirit because it's not His anymore I'm working on my own intellect and my own ability to see things work out One of the best illustrations of this is how we deal with money in the church. I've heard people say, well, yeah, you know, yeah, we trust the Lord, but you just quench the Spirit. It's over. Every time we try to figure out all our debts and everything by just, I'm not talking about being irresponsible, but I'm talking about when God has moved us and led us, let's say, as elders and leadership into certain kinds of ministry, and all we can think about is how much does it cost. You have quenched the Spirit. you don't have to ask to be filled he's dying to fill you he is just waiting to fill your life with himself so he can permeate and blow you along and control you completely what we need to quit doing is quenching him and grieving him stop saying no to God and he'll fill you too positive two positive dimensions of the filling of the Spirit when I quit grieving Him and I deal with the sin in my life again please understand boy I could preach a sermon on each one of these things this stopping the grieving of the Holy Spirit isn't once and for all I'm going to quit grieving of the Holy Spirit and that's it no that's just like the filling it's continuous it's all the time when sin becomes known to me when the light exposes the sin in my life and then I've got that choice I either confess it filling where I decide to just play with it and leave it there, quenching, grieving. I learn all those areas of my life to not quench the Spirit, to believe God, to step out in faith. The Spirit is not quenched anymore and He begins to move through me, through us as a church. The whole dimension of faith. We'll never go any further than what our faith can take us. What we believe God for. And every time we don't believe Him, that's just quenching what he wants to do in us and among us as a church. But some real practical, just simple suggestions and understanding how to be filled with the Holy Spirit. First of all, I want to show you a fabulous parallel. Move over to Colossians 3, verse 16. This is really neat. Starting in verse 16. You know, you think this is mystical and strange and some wild experience. Let the word of Christ dwell on you richly with all wisdom. Here's the results of that. teaching and admonishing one another with what? Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God, and whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus. What? Doing what? Giving thanks through him to God the Father. Then he goes on in all these relationships. Wives, do what? Be subject to your husbands as is fitting. Husbands, love your wives, and do not be embittered against them. Children, be obedient. Fathers, don't exasperate your children. Don't frustrate them that they may not lose heart. You know what? This may come as a surprise to some of you, But did you see all those results? They're the exact same results as we saw in Ephesians 5, 19 through 6, verse 10. Now, I know what the cause of that was in Ephesians 5. It was the filling of the Spirit. What was the cause of all those wonderful things, right relationships, in Colossians 3? It was dwelling richly. Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly. You know what? The filling of the Spirit and the Word of God dwelling in you richly, friend, is exactly the same thing. Letting the Word of God dwell in you richly. People say again, this filling is so mysterious and mystical, it's an ecstatic experience. No, if you want to be filled with the Spirit, don't sit in a corner and plead God. Feed yourself on the Word of God. Study it and obey it. And as you are fed and feed yourselves on the Word of God and are filled with the Word of God, as it lives in you, it will begin to control you if you're obedient to it. It's going to infect you. This is the Spirit. This is Him speaking to us. And I fill myself with that and let it control me. I love what Spurgeon says. We need to come to a point where our blood becomes biblene. Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly. In order for me to even know how to respond to God. In order for me to even know what he's called me to do. I need to know the word. Again, that's why we're so committed to doing what we're doing right now. It's the word of God that what? Brings the knowledge of salvation. It's the word of God that brings growth. It's the milk of the word that brings growth. It's the knowledge of the word that protects us as a church against false teaching. it's obedience and yielding and submission to the word of God that brings the filling of the spirit so this filling of the spirit involves first of all grieving not the spirit quenching not the spirit and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly another fourth and this is the last one again very practical nothing mysterious or mystical about it I believe it even involves just simply and after you've dealt with so many other things something to take with you on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday as you're doing the ironing as you're driving to work as you're at your job hammering your hammer, whatever it is you do. As I've confessed my sin and I've opened myself up to him and I'm in the word, one further thing, practicing the presence of Christ. Practicing the presence of Christ. The illustration I'll use for this is Peter. I love Peter. Peter was a guy who did all the wrong things but he had such a good heart that he was continually being used by God. And Peter was the kind of guy who always just, he just wanted to be by Jesus. That's all he wanted. I have a feeling that I would picture them walking down a path together, and Peter and the other disciples were there, and Jesus was walking on ahead, and Peter would just be right behind him. And I tell you, if Jesus stopped, Peter would walk right up his back. You know, they just wanted to be right where he was. And three things stand out to me about Peter when he was with Jesus. Three things. I want you to get them. First of all, when he was with Jesus, he did the miraculous. Secondly, he said the miraculous. And thirdly, he had miraculous courage. The first place I want to see you, I want you to see him is in the boat. Remember that? The storm is going. It's tension time. And things are going wrong. And all of a sudden, it started to calm down. And I saw Jesus off in the distance. And he was walking on the water. And Peter was a fool. He only had one thought in mind. I am here. And Jesus is there. And that isn't any good. I want to close the gap. And so he got out of the boat. And I want to tell you something. Peter had been a fisherman for a long time. And his experience would tell him very quickly that every time he did that before, he lived up to his name. Peter the rock, he went right to the bottom. That was pretty good. But all he could think of was being with Jesus. And something happened. He did irrational things. He didn't do things that were well thought out. All he wanted to do was be with Jesus. And when he was connected to that source, he did the miraculous. He walked on water. The second thing that I see Peter doing is at a time when Jesus was gathering with his disciples and he asked his disciples, saying simply this, who do men say that I am? And his disciples said, well, some say that you are Elijah, others say that you are Jeremiah, others say that you are one of the prophets. And Jesus turned to Peter and says, Peter, whom do you say that I am? And Peter looked at Jesus right in the face and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. I have a feeling Peter looked around and said, Who said that anyway? Where did that come from? And Jesus looked at Peter and said, Peter, you didn't understand that. That came right directly from the Father. Flesh and blood did not reveal that. That was revealed to you by the Father. Peter had a mouth that was available to God. And when he was with Jesus, when he was connected with Jesus, his source of strength and power, He did the miraculous, and he said the miraculous. When he was disconnected from Jesus, he was a mess. Just a little while later, Satan was going to use that same mouth because it was available to any power source that was there. The third thing we see Peter doing was this. He had miraculous courage in the garden. Remember the scene? The soldiers came to get Jesus, and Jesus looked at the soldiers and said, Whom do you seek? And I don't know what it was about that. I've never exegeted that, so I'm not sure of all the ins and outs of why this happened, but that whole Roman army fell flat on their back. and wonderful Peter again connected with his source pulls out his sword and says ah this is going to be easy and he starts going and I have a feeling in my dog well I don't believe that he went like this on his ear he was going for his head whammo one at a time he ducked that's why he got his ear he was ready to go he was going to go through that whole thing one at a time and knock them all off again I'm not saying that anything that Peter did was well thought. I will say this, that when he was with Jesus, there was a glory about what he did. He had a miraculous courage. Don't forget it's that same Peter who just a few hours later being face to face with a girl, a little maiden who couldn't really hurt him at all. He denied Christ three times. One time he's ready to take on the whole Roman army. Separate from Jesus, Peter was useless. The next thing we see is Jesus is leaving and going to the Father. And if this parallel continues and if the illustration continues to work and if every time Jesus is separated, Peter is separated from Jesus, that Peter falls apart, we might as well just bury Peter right now. But the next thing we see Peter doing in Acts chapter 2 verse 14, it says this, but Peter took his stand and raised his voice and declared to them, men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you. The same Peter who denied Christ three times to the maiden. This Jesus who was nailed to the cross by sinful men, he has risen. And dear friends, since there was a resurrection, there is now forgiveness for any of you. And they said to him, Peter, what do we do? And he said, repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of sins. And you know what? They came. 3,000. And you know what Peter said? What do I do? What do I say? the answer is Peter he didn't do anything the answer is Peter the comforter has come and Peter he is not with you anymore he is not beside you anymore he does not come upon you anymore he is in you Peter he lives in you Peter the next time I see Peter he and John are going to the temple and they see a beggar by the side of the road who can't walk and he looks at this beggar and he says this silver and gold have I none but what I have I give unto thee in the name of Jesus of Nazareth rise up and walk when Peter was with Jesus he said the miraculous and he did the miraculous and he had miraculous courage Acts chapter 5 he was brought before the Sanhedrin and they said to this same Peter Peter, stop your preaching. You're turning Jerusalem upside down. You filled it with your doctrine. Stop now or it will take your life. Peter said this, Who am I to obey, God or men? The truth is this, dear friends. This Jesus whom you crucify, he is risen. And we are witnesses of these things. And so is the Holy Spirit who God has given to me. When Peter was with Jesus, he said the miraculous and he did the miraculous and he had miraculous courage. But I want to tell you something. It wasn't some sort of magical wand that hit him. Peter was open. The obstacles were gone. And Peter was just like you when he grieved the Holy Spirit. If he didn't confess his sin, God would not work through him. But I know that as Peter is doing these things, the Spirit had not been quenched. He believed him for that healing. He believed him for his life. And he was not grieved. How did Peter do all those things? Peter was strong. Peter wasn't afraid. Peter was scared to death. Peter was so weak. The difference here is that it was no longer Peter who lived, but Christ who lived in him, and he was given access to Peter's life. Who's living your life? Real profound question. Who's living your life? being filled with the Spirit it's being brought along by His power it's being permeated by His presence it's being dominated by His Word it's being filled with His presence but we grieve that work and we quench His purpose could I ask you just real gently and quietly for you to evaluate your own heart where is He being quenched in you? where is he being grieved in you and then the next question is are you ready not to ask him to fill me but are you ready to ask him to forgive you and to give you the strength to maybe see those areas the filling of the spirit please catch this you don't have to ask him to fill you he's asking you he's asking you Kenny Kenny today now I have said through this whole thing that this filling the spirit is not an experience but I know enough of myself and enough of scripture and other areas to realize that there are times in our lives that there needs to be a breaking point where I say okay I'm going to pick a new direction and I want to start giving you control. I want to start walking in the Spirit. I think you know too that I'm not big on long emotional invitations, but I want to tell you this. If God's dealing with you concerning some of these things and there may be areas in your life that you are grieving Him and quenching Him and you want to be set free from those things, I just so want you to come and we will pray and talk And maybe you need to just be with the Lord and deal with these things. We've said so many times that this is a place where you can come and meet with God. Nothing fancy. Just come and meet with Him and let Him deal with you. Please don't leave. If you're sensing the Spirit moving you in that direction, it's so much better to come than to leave and wish you had. This concludes the message on this cassette.
