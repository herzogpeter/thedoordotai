Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Well, last week, we read Paul's incredible, almost unbelievable words in Colossians 1.24. when he wrote this. I invite you to turn there in your Bibles if you have them. Incredible words that we don't hear too often. Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you. And I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regards to Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, the church. See, Paul introduced us to this idea of redemptive suffering, choosing to suffer so that someone else might have a shot to experience joy. In Paul's case, some of whom he didn't even know. And so Dave ended his talk last week by asking this question that, frankly, has been haunting, I know many of us, throughout the week. And the question was this, what would you be willing to suffer so that someone else might experience joy in your life? what would you be willing to suffer or give up go without so that someone else might not have to suffer might not have to give up and might not have to go without and if we're honest this question is really difficult for us to even get our heads around because I think we live in a culture where our secret goal no one's putting it on any billboards or anything but our secret goal is to live without struggle. See, if I have a headache, I can reach for my bottle of extra strength Tylenol, right? We live in a culture where we complain about flying coach. If our internet connection is merely slow, we act as if someone owes us an entire refund. Nervous chuckles. Well, if you pay attention, the message we really do get a thousand times a day is about saving ourselves and preserving ourselves, about taking what it is that we think we are entitled to. One of my friends told me this week that her 14-year-old son, 14-year-old son, asked her this question, Mom, isn't what everyone does ultimately for their own good and benefit anyway? So these words from Paul about suffering so that someone else, someone that you might not even know, might experience joy, sound otherworldly and saintly. They sound like such an ideal that is so impossible to live up to that we just sort of nervously, well, I guess I'll move on. This question got a lot more tangible for us this week. As you know, when the earthquake hit Port-au-Prince, And like you, I watched CNN around the clock. I got on the internet and was immediately horrified by the images that I saw. And the feelings that I had all week were a strange mixture of things. I felt sick by the scope of the devastation that I was seeing minute after minute and day after day. And I felt overwhelmed with the hopelessness that seemed to surround it. I was worried about our team there, about Steve and about Dio and Madame Dio and about the kids. at Mephibosheth house. And I wanted to help, but I didn't know what to do. So like many of you did, I donated online, but that felt like a drop in the ocean. How in the world were these people gonna get help in time? And how in the world were they ever gonna dig themselves out of this? And I felt guilty. Every time I realized that I had forgotten about it entirely for minutes or even hours as I walked through my workday. And there were times this week where I just had to shut it out and shut it off. And then I felt guilty because I had the luxury of doing that. But as the week went on, I began to see this amazing thing happen. Casting aside our political and even our religious differences, people from all over the world stopped everything to help. By Friday, $8 million had been raised for the Red Cross just by people texting into a number. and agreeing to add $10 to their cell phone bill that month. By yesterday, 5,000 to 6,000 men and women from around the world had arrived in Haiti dedicated to supporting the relief effort. I remember on Wednesday listening to a story, so early on in the week, I remember listening to a story at NPR where there was no doctors, but there were these three pharmacists who set up shop at this collapsed hotel to try to treat the wounded. And when word got out, the line heading into this collapsed hotel stretched forever. It's remarkable. When tragedies like this happen, they have the potential, the potential to bring out the best in human beings. And if one of the ways that human beings are created in the image of God is that we move toward suffering people when tragedies happen, it gives me hope that in the midst of the worst kind of suffering, the truest thing that we can say about God is that God suffers with those who suffer but there's this fear that I have and many of you have that in a few weeks when this stops being the top story on the news that the world might forget about Haiti as awful as this is right now so I can't help but think about what Haiti will look like five years from now and 10 years from now and 20 years from now. And I can't help but ask the question, who will be the people beyond the immediate needs that are so pressing and so urgent? Who will be the people that invest in the long-term future of Haiti? Who will be the people that willingly choose to suffer so that the Haitian people can rebuild their lives? I think about people like Pastor Deal and Madam Deal. And even beyond Haiti, who are the people in our culture that will decide to go against the grain, against the message that says that the secret goal of life really is to live without struggle, to save yourself, and to take what it is that you feel like you're entitled to? And what does it take, really, to become that kind of person? That doesn't take what they're entitled to. and that doesn't try to save themselves in every scenario. So what I want to do today is have an honest discussion about what it practically looks like to become that kind of person who, and this is the operative word, who learns over the course of a lifetime, who learns how to engage in redemptive suffering, choosing to suffer for someone else's joy in a place like Haiti or a place like Minneapolis or a place like Maple Grove. And I need to say on the start that the result of this talk is, or this talk is the result of conversations with many friends who came to me and just talked about their experience with suffering. So I want to get really practical, really down, nitty-gritty, and dirty. What are the questions that you will deal with if you choose to engage in a life of redemptive suffering? We're going to look at four. First question is, what does redemptive suffering really look like and feel like in my actual life? Second question, what does it look like to fight it? When I push it away, what does that look like? Question number three, what does it look like to embrace the idea of redemptive suffering? Question number four, what happens when someone chooses that? What is the result of redemptive suffering? So first question, what does redemptive suffering really look like and feel like in my actual life? Because I think we have the tendency to kind of romanticize and conceptualize the idea of suffering for someone else. Redemptive suffering. We get the picture in our minds of Mel Gibson in Braveheart. When he's being led off to his execution and people are pelting him with lettuce and rocks. And certainly that is an extreme example of redemptive suffering. But if we think that's all that it is, and the only kind of people that can engage in it are martyrs and those who are willing to do extreme things, then we'll miss the fact, and listen to this, we'll miss the fact that I think we are constantly faced thousands of times every day with the opportunities to suffer for the sake of someone else. And so our fight for every single one of those opportunities will be to embrace it or to fight it. I remember flying home a few years ago from LA and our flight was overbooked. So there was a bunch of us that were waiting to see whether we were gonna be forced to wait another three hours to catch the next flight home or whether we were gonna get on the flight that was gonna leave in a couple minutes. And I found out that I was gonna get on the flight that was gonna leave in a couple minutes. But then I overheard this single mom talking to the ticket agent at the desk just a few feet away, saying that she had to get home that night for her kids. And she was obviously very distraught about it and even beginning to panic. And so I remember the feeling in my mind, like, man, I'm getting on the plane. I'm going to go home. She's going to have to stay, so what should I do? And, man, I'm really sick of being in the airport. I mean, I'm just telling you my honest feelings. And three hours isn't that long for her to wait, so, you know. And then, perhaps the mercy of God came into my mind, and I thought, well, yeah, three hours is not even that long for me to wait, so perhaps I should see if I can exchange my ticket with this woman. So I went up to the ticket counter and kind of interrupted her as she was pleading with the ticket agent to let her get on this flight. And I said, listen, I'm on this flight, and I was just wondering if I could exchange my ticket with you so you could get on this flight and I could go on the later flight. And I mean, the look on her face was as if someone had just saved her child from a burning building. That in her life, it seemed like this kind of thing never had happened. No one had ever willingly suffered anything for her benefit. So we looked at the ticket agent and said, is this possible? She said, sure, and she made the changes. And I went and sat down, and this woman walked on that plane. And you know what? That is so not a big deal, what I did. Easy. Easy. But that's where redemptive suffering starts. At making a small decision, where you decide, my needs don't have to be the number one thing, and what I feel like I'm entitled to, which is a seat on that plane, don't have to be the most important thing. It starts with the little, tiny decisions to suffer for the sake of someone else. It's tangible and involved. It's never hypothetical. It's always in the moment, and it's willing to get a little dirty. Now, there's a picture I want to share with you, but I have to warn you, it's a little disgusting. So I'm going to share it with you anyway. This is a picture, you can't really tell, but this is a picture of my shirt after wrestling on the floor with my two youngest boys who had colds at the time. And this picture was taken early in the day. And I really wish I would have taken it later in the day. as you can tell they left their mark on me so to speak smeared all over me actually and I posted it on Facebook because that's what you do when funny things happen to you and one of my friends immediately posted back this little line she said you're trying to laugh about this but I bet a part of you is freaking out am I right? she knows I'm sort of a neat freak kind of thing some call it emo I tend to call it neat you know well she was totally right actually I was kind of disgusted but you know to be totally honest getting down on the floor and wrestling with my boys is not a sacrifice at all I love it it's for the sake of their joy but it's for the sake of my joy as well but if you use that picture that was up on the screen as a metaphor the question becomes how dirty are you willing to get for the sake of someone else how much snot so to speak are you willing to get on yourself and for how long what if i didn't have a clean shirt to change into what if i had to wear that for weeks and weeks how far would i be willing to go i have a friend who's caring for her aging parents who are needing a lot of help right now and the sad thing is the the parents are not very appreciative of her help and my friend was telling me last week how much anger and toxicity actually come from her parents. And this is what she said about redemptive suffering and what it looks like in her own life in this regard. She says, I want to be able to lay down my own angry response to their anger, and I want to love them, she said. And so I'm always asking myself when I'm not with them, what can I be doing right now? to love them so that it's Christ in me that responds to them and their anger and toxicity and not the hurting little five-year-old me that responds. What line in the grocery store is the longest so I can get behind, so I can learn how to respond to others in a way where their benefit matters? And in her question, she reflects what redemptive suffering really feels like in the moment. It's a battle and a struggle, and it's not romantic or sexy at all. Moment by moment, you're faced with a choice when it comes to laying down your rights for the sake of someone else. Will I fight the opportunity to do it, or will I embrace it? And this comes and starts in the smallest of ways. Will I be the one to take out the garbage so my spouse doesn't have to? Will I stop and listen to my child, who's actually really exhibiting all the things that push all of my buttons, and I'm going crazy? Or will I snap at her and make her shut up? Will I resist the temptation to rage at the person who cuts me off in traffic? Will I treat an annoying person at work who really bugs me with grace instead of contempt? Will I tackle the bag of cheese? I mean, if I were to write a book, I think the title would be, It All Comes Down to the Bag of Cheese. Will I be the one? But even if you embrace it, you get your hands dirty, you get your shirt dirty, you do the deal, here's the thing. You're likely not going to get some divine download like Neo in the Matrix to be able to do this in a way that it's easy for you. These moment-by-moment struggles reveal things in you that you have yet to learn. The harder it is for you to do something, the more it reveals that you have more work to do in this lifelong process of becoming like Jesus. So how am I going to learn to lay down that which I'm entitled to? How am I going to learn that sometimes I really don't have to go? I don't really have to get what it is that I think I have to get. Part of how I learned that, anything new in fact, is to be honest about what's hard about it. which leads me to the second question that a person will ask when they choose to engage in redemptive suffering and that is, what does fighting it look like? What does it look like when I say no to an opportunity that comes into my life to suffer for someone else? Now, I think people who are honestly trying to engage in redemptive suffering, especially for the long haul, might ask this question. Why would you require me to do something so hard for so long, God? I can see for a little amount of time but this has gone on for so long why would you require me to do something this hard for so long? that's a great question I frankly wonder how much Pastor Dio has asked that question over the years living in Haiti it's a great question to bring to God and I think you need to bring it to God but here's my wondering is I wonder how definitive of an answer are you ever going to get to that question? And even if you did get the answer, this is why. Would it satisfy you? Would it make that thing that you're going through any easier? It seemed like Paul had this question for God in terms of the thorn in his flesh that we read about in the scriptures that he suffered through. We read that it tormented him. And Paul asked God to remove it three different times. I mean, that is stubborn. God, please, how about now? Now, it seemed like Paul was asking the question, God, why would you require me to live with something this hard for so long? The only answer he gets is found in 2 Corinthians 12, 9. And Paul writes, But God said to me, my grace is sufficient for you. for my power is made perfect in weakness. Now, if my secret goal in life is to save myself, to avoid struggle at all costs, and to get what I'm entitled to, then that answer will not work. In my own personal experience of fighting redemptive suffering, this is where I go. I get to the place where I get angry and resentful because the person that I am currently suffering for, in my opinion, could use to do a little suffering themselves. Right? I mean, what would really be sufficient for me is if that person got a little dirty themselves. At least as dirty as I'm getting. God's grace is not sufficient for me in that moment. And that's when I know I'm fighting it. this opportunity to suffer for the sake of another. And if you're not sure if you're fighting it, here's how you know. When you find yourself banging the cupboards extra loud because someone can't read your mind that you need help. Whoa, they're right there. See, like, ah, snap. We're getting close. Or when you find yourself rolling your eyes when someone doesn't understand how much work you've already done. Or when you just angrily say, I'll do it myself when someone doesn't get it right or do it the way that you would have done it. You're fighting it. And when you find yourself doing that, and here's the newsflash, we all do, you need to ask the question, is this the kind of person that I want to become? The kind of person that bangs cupboards real loud? The kind of person that yells at their kids? The kind of person that flies off the handle at coworkers. Is this who I want to become? Another way I think that you fight it honestly is when you get to the place where you say, I can't or won't do this anymore because I simply don't have anything left to give. You ever been there? I can't, God. I am out of gas. And when you get to that place, you find yourself at the fork in the road of the human condition. And one way goes toward this question, will I trust in my own strength to get through this? And if you take that fork in the road and you say, I will trust in my own strength to do this, that road leads toward one destination and it is loneliness and bitterness and despair and isolation. That's where that goes. And perhaps this is what Jesus meant when he said, for whoever finds his life will lose it. So the other direction, at the fork in the road of the human condition, is a road you might take when you admit that you, even though you don't have the strength, you're going to take off the training wheels and you're going to pedal down that road anyway, teetering and tottering and about to fall down, trusting that God will give you the strength to deal with whatever happens next, whether you fall down or whether you keep pedaling. And the people that choose that road as hard and courageous as it is will be the kind of people that over time can honestly engage in suffering for the joy of someone else because they don't have to take that which is entitled to them. And a thousand times a day, you find yourself at that fork in the road. So the question is, which way do you want to go? What kind of person do you want to become? Which leads us to the third question. When you choose to embrace it, what does embracing redemptive suffering really look like? And there are times when it's honestly easier for me and other times when it's harder for me to embrace it. this week, I was Wednesday afternoon on the treadmill at Lifetime and I was right on the first row looking up at President Clinton talking about what Americans can do in response to this tragedy. And I was looking at the images of the devastation and the thought that kept going into my mind is what is going to happen to the little kids who lose their parents? Who's going to take care of them? And I mean, I'm turning into a mess in the middle of lifetime fitness. And it almost crushed me, this thought. I thought of my little guys and what if they were in that situation and I couldn't bear to think about it. And the honest thing about that situation and how hard it was is that even though I'd like to do something about it, I don't know what I can do right now. And so in that thing, I just need to say, God, I am going to try to be open to you inviting me into something, but I'm not sure what it is. So I'm gonna hold the tension of not knowing. But when it comes to actually engaging in redemptive suffering, I think it's really important, for the sake of our sanity even, to point out that you can only respond to that which is in front of you right now. You can only respond to that which you're being invited into right now. We can get lost in asking this sort of conceptual and hypothetical question of, would I be the kind of person that would suffer in the way that that person is suffering? Would I be that kind of person? Would I do that? And that kind of questioning can paralyze you. Redemptive suffering is always tangible. And in the moment, there's a family from Open Door who moved to Haiti four years ago to creatively find ways to help the Haitian people. And right now, they are on the ground involved in the relief efforts. And I've been following their blog all week and what's facing them right now is really not all of Haiti. Three million people who've been affected by this. It's tending to one person's needs at a time. It's asking, will I get up again today and face it? Because that's all I got in me, God. God says that you will receive strength for today. I'm not sure about tomorrow but I will get up today and that is what their journey is like and that is what the journey of redemptive suffering is like saying yes to God is always tangible in the area of redemptive suffering it's in the moment and in the small decisions that you're faced with every day here's the thing the more you say yes to the small things standing in the longest line in a grocery buying someone's coffee behind you not yelling at your kid not banging the cupboard, the more you'll find that your instinctive response is to suffer for the joy of someone else. Might never become easier, but you're going to become more and more aware of the opportunities as they come. And you're going to become more and more able to relinquish what it is that you feel like you're entitled to. And the more you do that, the more you're going to find that God's grace really is sufficient for you. and the only way to know that is to do it. That's not something you can hear and talk and just believe in your head. It's something you have to go out and experience. You have to pedal down the road, teetering and tottering without the training wheels, and even crash a few times to find out that when I crash, will God be there, and will God's strength be sufficient for me in that moment? It takes tremendous courage. It's the last thing from being romantic or fun. As a friend said to me this last week, this journey of suffering is a deeply spiritual fight, and that's why we need the grace of a mighty God if we're gonna get through it. It reminds me of something Stephan said a couple weeks ago. He said that many of us, and all of us, in fact, are afraid of getting to the end of ourselves because we're not sure what we're going to find there. But if you've ever actually found yourself at the end of yourself, what you find there is a God that is right there holding it all together, Stephan said. And the people who have experienced the God that holds all things together, even at the end of themselves, are always conspicuous by their lack of definitive answers. They sort of shrug their shoulders and say things like, I know it sounds like a cliche, but what I found at the end was that God really was there holding it all together for me. I found that God's grace actually was sufficient for me. So last question. What is the result of redemptive suffering? What happens when someone really does make the small or large choice to suffer for someone else's joy? When Jesus found himself at the end, At the end of his road, the end of his life, hanging on a cross, suffering for the joy of the world, he found a God that really was holding all things together. And an interesting story is put right in the climax of all human history. Jesus is surrounded by two criminals, and one criminal sort of sarcastically mocks him, saying, if you're God, save yourself and save us too while you're at it. You can hear the derision dripping off of his mouth as he's saying that. But the other criminal says these words found in Luke 23, starting in verse 40. Talking to the first criminal, he said, Don't you fear God since you're under the same sentence? See, we are punished justly. We're not suffering for someone else. We're suffering because of what we've done. We're getting what our deeds deserve. But this man, Jesus, has done nothing wrong, and yet he suffers anyway. Who does that? You can hear between the lines. And he turned to Jesus and said, remember me when you come into your kingdom. Another translation for that word kingdom is when you come into your kingly power. Because this criminal had never seen a king that was willing to go that low, that was willing to get that much snot on his shirt. And he, in that moment, said, this is the kingliest king I have ever seen. Jesus answered him, truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise. What's the result when someone chooses to redemptively suffer? I think the person for whom you suffer is given the opportunity to meet God. You might be mocked when you suffer. You might even die, literally or metaphorically. But hear the words of Jesus. When someone is willing to die for the sake of another, For whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. Because when you suffer for someone else, maybe in their deep suffering, you unlock a kind of part of their heart that becomes now open to receive the goodness of God in a way that perhaps they never have experienced before. but it takes someone willing to say I will lay down my rights now when earthquakes or hurricanes tragedies happen and it results in a massive tragedy like what we saw this week it really both angers and saddens me when a public Christian response has something to do with a God that is punishing the people and that that's what Christians are somehow known for in the face of tragedy is reprehensible. What if Christians were known for suffering for those who suffer? If that was the case, and I think in so many invisible ways it actually is, but if that was the case, people might experience God in a way that might bring hope. So if you want to represent God to people who are going through tragedy, please don't represent God with an argument or with a theological statement. Represent God by suffering for them. You can't argue with a person that suffers for you. This shows the heart of God and this is what Jesus means when he looks at us in the eyes and he says, you are the light of the world. You are the light of the world. See, the result of redemptive suffering is that people will meet and experience a good and gracious God. But it's not just the ones who do the suffering that experience that good and gracious, or receive the suffering. It's those who do the suffering as well. Because when you choose to suffer for the joy of someone else, that is God's home field. That is what God does. It's where God lives. So it makes sense that you will meet God there when you choose to suffer, when you choose to lay down what you're entitled to, when you choose to go against the grain of the culture that says that our massive and life-changing goal is to save ourselves. So what do you do with a message like this in the face of what we're going through? It can be overwhelming. My encouragement is that you engage in it with a few others, with all of your questions, all of your pain, and all of your hopelessness and despair. You can use the message tool that I think is a good help in terms of how to do that with a few others. Because God will begin to invite you into the areas that you need to suffer. God really will invite you in the moment to do it. But mostly as we close. I'd like to share a blessing to the many of you who I know are already engaged in redemptive suffering in small ways and large ways. There are many of you who have done it for years and years and years and you're tired and you're weary and you wonder if it's worth it. You wonder if God has forgotten you. Well, if that's you, I want to read three different verses right back to back. Galatians 6, 9, 2 Corinthians 9, 8, and Philippians. 2.13, and I want to give this to you as a benediction or a blessing, and so I want to invite you to stand as you receive this. So if you are in the middle of suffering for the sake of another, and you need the strength of God to make it today, I want to invite you to just put your hands out like this. This is where it gets beyond words. It goes into the power of God moving into you to do that which you cannot do. So receive these words from God. Let us not become weary in doing good. For at the proper time, we will reap a harvest if we don't give up. for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose. And this is the great news. And God is able to make all grace abound to you so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, You will abound in every good work. Receive the word of the Lord to you and for you. And go in peace, everybody. Thank you.
