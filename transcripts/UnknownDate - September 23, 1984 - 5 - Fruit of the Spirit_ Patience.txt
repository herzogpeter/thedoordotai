Open your Bibles with me to the book of Galatians chapter 5, Galatians 5, verses 22 and 23. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law. Would you join me in praying that the Spirit of God would do a work of liberation in our hearts? There are some things this morning that I think are real important to say, and some things I think are real important that we understand with our minds. But again, as I approach this, I believe the things we're going to be talking about this morning are so profound that the message itself will be an illustration of how messages don't change people. But the Spirit of God, as He takes these things and injects His life, can. Dear Father, we pray by the authority of Your Spirit that You will work the work of ministry among us. For some, my heart, because of what we're going to be talking about this morning, is real heavy because there needs to be a liberation, and for many it could be painful. I pray for insight. I pray for understanding, and I pray for courage to believe you enough to be set free. In Jesus' name, amen. We're speaking these last several weeks and for some weeks to come, I suppose, on the fruit of the Spirit as we go through our systematic study in the book of Galatians. The fruit of the Spirit is being defined for us as that overall quality of life that Christians exhibit at an ever-increasing level as they walk according to the Spirit. We've been very careful to note that these are not the fruits of the Spirit. It is not a plural thing. It is a singular thing. All of these aspects, love, joy, peace, come together to make one singular fruit. That is why we're calling it a quality of life that is evidenced increasingly in a believer's life as he learns what it means to walk according to the Spirit. As we've been taking each one of them apart separately, one of the things that we have been recognizing or discovering is the importance of defining these terms and defining these aspects because that while we understand that these demonstrations, these aspects like love, joy, peace, patience, etc., are indeed demonstrations of the Spirit's work in me, we have discovered that right along with that, it is very possible to counterfeit at the same time these characteristics. In other words, there is the kind of love that looks very giving and looks very caring and looks very warm, but it isn't free at all. There are those kinds of relationships we find ourselves involved in where we feel like the person is giving to us and they are very nice. But basically what they are doing is taking from us. Everything they're doing has an agenda. Everything they're doing has a hook. The reason I'm giving you to this is because I want something in return. It isn't free at all. That is not at all a work of the Spirit. That is indeed a work of the flesh. The work of the Spirit is a love that gives and cares and sacrifices without strings. That's a work of the Spirit. We went on to joy. Remember joy bright, shining, leaping, jumping, running around in circles, joy. But if our joy we discovered is contingent on external circumstances being just the way I want them to be, then my joy is going to be up and down all the time. A fruit of the Spirit was found in relinquishing all those things that are to me life. even some good things, and finding my life in nothing but Christ. And the result is joy, regardless of the circumstances. Last week we talked about peace, and we called it that inner settledness in the midst of unsettling situations. And we discovered that we have a counterfeit of that as well. The counterfeit is this, that I trade in an inner settledness and a real realization that the things in my life are in order and before the Lord, honest and open. I trade that in for an external peace. You see, I'm so afraid of confrontation, and I'm so afraid of any kind of negative experience in my family or in our church, that when a negative experience comes up that might create some external hostility, I pretend it isn't there. And we just put the lid on it. And we call that peace. It isn't peace. External peace, where people aren't yelling and screaming, and yet there is an internal strife, is not a peace at all. That is indeed the peace of the flesh. The peace that the world offers. Jesus said, I came to bring peace. And I give you peace. But it's my peace. Not as the world gives peace, give I unto you. I would like to offer to you a work of the Spirit. And that is an internal settledness that gives me the courage to confront any kind of situation I'm in with courage and directness. We come this morning to patience. And again, as we begin to delineate the meaning of this word and really get into it a little bit. And the meaning will crystallize for you, I believe. I think what we're going to see as well as what it really means we're going to see the counterfeit right next to it. I'm going to break this sermon down into two very simple parts. First of all a definition of patience and second of all an application of patience. I want you to just get a side note here. I really believe it's important that we define words clearly. And this again this sermon is going to be an illustration of why that's important. You see I think an awful lot of times our study gets real lazy. and we look at certain words and we just assume we know what they mean and without really understanding the meaning of the word or the meaning of the text, we start making applications to our lives. But what we need to understand is this, that if I don't really know what this text means, what the word says, there is no way in the world I'm going to make healthy, appropriate applications. It is impossible. So it is that we spend time discovering the theology, understanding the doctrine, taking the word apart and talking in the Greek so that we really do understand. You see, when we understand, the application begins to flow. That's the easy part. So let's do the work. First of all, the definition. Patience. What is patience? What comes to your mind? It's easy enough when you just think of the word and look at it on its surface level. Patience is a virtue. That's something we all know. When I think of patience, I think of my ability to wait, and it isn't very good. I look to my kids and I'm always yelling at my kids, Andrea, Erica, whatever else your names are, Caleb and Christopher, there you are. Oh my goodness. Be patient. You guys, be patient. You're always so impatient. You're just like your father. And most of us would readily admit as we come to a topic like this, patience, that boy, I'll tell you, I'm really glad we're talking about patience this morning because I don't have enough patience. Lord, we say this, Lord, help me be patient and help me be patient right now. You know, that's a big joke, and that's the little phrase we're expected to hear when we talk about patience. And so today's sermon, we're going to hear the pastor tell us to slow down and take it easy and wait on the Lord and be patient. And it'll be good, after all. You know, who doesn't need some more patience? And the fruit of the Spirit is patience. It'll be good, and it would be good except for one thing. You see, the word here in the Greek, when we look at the original language and really begin to dig a little bit and don't just go on the surface, we begin to find out that that word doesn't mean my ability to wait for the train. It means something a lot more profound than that. It means more than my ability to sit through one of Dave's sermons and walk out with a smile on my face. Wouldn't that be the fruit of the Spirit? If you could legitimately sit through 45 minutes of me talking and walk out with a smile on your face that isn't fake. That's a fruit of the Spirit because nothing else could do that. One of the glorious things about the Greek is that it's very graphic. And sometimes we get a picture of it. This is really a plug for Craig's class. And they're discovering this. I know even they went through this word this morning and discovered this way before you. So if you want to get in on the sermons beforehand, you've got to go to this class. But there are four words in the Greek for patience. There are four words. I don't want to go into all of them and go deeply, but one is anekome. It means to endure. Another word is kartereo. It means to persist in. Another word is hupomeno. It means to stand your ground. And another word for patience is makrothumia. Makrothumia is the word that is in verse 22. It is different than all the other words. It does not mean to stand firm. It does not mean to just persist in. It does not mean to endure. The significance of this word is one that we need to catch. And I'll tell you why we need to catch it. Because the Holy Spirit of God, when he inspired Paul to write these words, gave him this word and not the other ones. Therefore, again, if I'm going to make appropriate application, I've got to know what the word is that I'm talking about. Makrothumia. Let's get to it. I want you to take notes if you're interested in that. And I want you to write this word down. Because of the meaning, and it doesn't translate well, at least I don't get the real meaning of it by just saying patience. I'm going to use makrothumia. So you've got to know what it means. Write it out phonetically if you want. M-A-K-R-O-T-H-U-M-I-A. Makrothumia. M-A-K-R-O-T-H-U-M-I-A. It's a compound word. It breaks down into two parts. First, makro means long in or slow to. Thumos is the second part of that word, and it means this. Explosive anger. Explosive anger. Wrath. Clearly then, the word simply means this. Long in anger, slow to wrath. You know what we're dealing with this morning? Not just your ability to be patient. We are dealing this morning with how you handle anger. And you know what it says here? It tells you how to handle it. It tells you to be slow to it. But I want to tell you something else about the language that, as we go a little bit even deeper, reveals something even more profound in terms of our meaning of the word before we can make one application. And that is this. Not only does it tell me to be slow to anger, that's what I'm supposed to do, but this text tells me what kind of anger it is that I'm to be slow to. What are you talking about? You see, again, in the word of God, in the English language, we have this word, it is anger. And I can think of anger, and I can think of why anger would be bad. The problem is this, that in the Greek there are three words for anger, and every one of them have a different shade of meaning, and it is very significant which word is used here. One of the words used for anger in the Word of God is a word called paragismas. Paragismas. It is this kind of anger, a seething, boiling, lingering resentment. Can you get into that a little bit? A lingering resentment, seething, boiling, bubbling. Generally, it is under the surface. Almost always it is a result, paragismas, anger, is always a result of my not dealing honestly and openly with the things I feel. And instead of dealing with them openly and honestly where the Holy Spirit of God can heal them, I stuff them inside and they go away, right? No, they don't. They seethe there and they boil and they bubble. Paragismas, anger. It is always regarded and it is always put in a context in Scripture as being evil and destructive, not only of other people, but most of all of yourself, it eats you alive. Paragasmath, sin. Another kind of anger is thumas. Thumas anger is boiling fury. Explosive anger. One of the characteristics of thumas anger is that it is unpredictable. You never know when it's going to come. All of a sudden, boom, the guy explodes. We say that about people. Man alive, you wouldn't believe it. He just exploded. Didn't know where it came from. One of the characteristics of thumas is also this, that it is always destructive, not only of yourself, but of other people, because it is a lashing out kind of thing. It is always referred to, generally referred to, as sin. Matthew 5 uses this word and calls it the first step to murder, thumas, explosive anger. Third word for anger is very interesting, and I want you to get this. This is very interesting. It's called orge. Orge. Defined simply, it would say this. Orge anger is the natural feelings that come when things I'm committed to are threatened or destroyed. We went through this in Ephesians. You might even remember that. Orge is the natural feelings that come to me when things that I am committed to are threatened or destroyed. Write that down if you're taking notes. The natural feelings are one of the things I want you to stress. There is no one in this room who does not feel orge anger. In fact, orge anger is a good thing. It is a gift from God. It first of all tells me something about myself It is a revealing kind of thing It is a gift from God that says David I'm going to put you in a situation With certain kinds of people And grease is going to fall on the floor Remember last week And when that grease falls on the floor How you react to that Is going to tell you a lot about yourself It's going to tell you what you're committed to It's going to tell you what you care about It's going to tell you whether you're mature or whether you're not And then what you do with that Is whether or determines whether or not you grow or gay anger, first of all, reveals to me what I'm really committed to, what I get my life from. Example, if life to me is physical things, then if you scratch my car, I go berserk. It's just natural. And when someone scratches my car and I go berserk, what I should do is not be angry. Not don't be angry. Pastor said, don't be angry. No, you will be angry if you're committed to things. You will. There's nothing you can do. It's going to be there. What you need to do is when that anger comes, say, listen, Lord, you just gave me a message. The message is this, that I'm committed to things that don't matter. And then begin to deal. If I'm committed to sports, I go berserk if we lose. If I'm committed to sports, if I'm committed to looking good, then if I hit a lazy fly ball with bases loaded in the bottom in the ninth and we're down by one run, I go berserk. I got to smash my bed on the floor. And I've done it. Where did that come from? He's such a competitor. That's a message to me that says, David, this is real out of perspective for you. And it's a gift I'm giving you to deal with something in your life. Not me. I'm not angry. I wasn't angry. I was just expressing, we're angry. If life to me is me, if life to me is my interest, if life to me is being noticed, if life to me is being liked, then anything that you do that would attack in any way my self-esteem is going to stir up in me a wrath against you that you wouldn't believe. It's a gift. It says, David, you're committed to some things that don't matter. It's pretty shallow stuff. And it isn't them, it's you. But I deny it and I shove it. It turns into paragus moss and maybe thumas somewhere down the line. You want to know something else about this or gay anger? One thing, it reveals to me what I'm committed to. So it's a real good thing. It's a gift. The second thing is this anger is manageable. It is always manageable. It is. It's when it turns into paragismas and thumas that it isn't. I lose control completely. But orge is manageable. You see, orge anger comes to me and I feel it. If I acknowledge it and don't let it control me or don't try to push it underneath and deny it, I can acknowledge it. And if I can acknowledge it, I can confess it and I can say, Lord, you've just revealed some things to me about me that I need to deal with. And I can go to that person and apologize. Or I can go and just really before the Lord begin to deal with some of the things in my life that have taken preeminence over him. And I can confess it and I can express it. And that thing that I held on to, I can just put it down. I can put it down. Leave it there. There is no seething in that. There is no inner boiling in that because I looked at the anger. I acknowledged the anger. I let it in. I looked at it square in the face and I said, you know what? That doesn't tell me something about you. You made me angry. It tells me something about me and I'm willing to deal with it. And I let that go. You know what else there isn't in that kind of dealing with my anger? There is no explosion. You know why? There's no need for explosion. I've already put it down. Galatians 5.22 says, be slow to thumas. Be slow to thumas is the explosion. Be slow to thumas. Explosive kinds of anger. That's the definition. That's the definition. I even snuck in a little bit of application without you looking. But now we're going to go to the application. And this is where it gets exciting. Okay? Ready? Now we know the virtue. The virtue isn't just being able to wait for a train or telling my kids to be patient. although you can see the shade of meaning in even that. If I get all angry because the train isn't coming, you see the shade of meaning. But specifically, we are speaking here of my ability to not explode. That's the virtue. How do I accomplish it? It's called application of the truth. How do I not explode? I'd like to share with you three ways, real quickly, that people generally go about the business of making sure they are slow to anger. Your two are very destructive, totally destructive. In fact, I'd use words like diseased if I could. And I would, so I did. One is healthy. One is biblical. And I think very helpful in building to you this morning. First way we deal with it is one I've already mentioned briefly, and that is repression. The orge comes, okay? I'm going to use these Greek terms, so I hope you got notes. If you didn't, you're going to be left behind. You'll have to get the tape, okay? The orge comes. That is the natural response to something I'm committed to. gets violated, and I begin to realize that my commitments are maybe a little bit off, okay? The or-gay comes. And it works like this. I get these feelings stirring up in me, and I get a message. It's this. Good Christians don't get angry. Good little girls don't get angry. And good little boys don't get angry. Even or-gay. But see, I never knew that there was any distinction, so I just put it all in the same basket. And good little moms don't get angry at their kids or their husbands, especially submissive moms, they never get angry. Never happens. And good dads never get angry, especially if they're Christians. Anger in any form in my mind is always negative, always. In fact, for some of us, anger is extremely terrifying, even to think about it. The reason is simple. Well, it's not that simple, but here are some reasons. If you're angry at me, what that means real clearly is that you don't love me. You see, every time I have an angry confrontation, it's from somebody who's coming at me with a lot of thumas, explosive anger that is the result of a lot of paragasmas, seething, I always hated you. You know what that means? You got an explosion there that goes back and says, that's been seething in me for years. So every time I get a confrontation, it is terribly frightening. I am not loved. I am not cared for. I am a valueless person. You know what I do if that's the case? If I'm living with someone who sees and comes out with thumas every once in a while, I'm going to do everything in my life to avoid an angry confrontation. That means I'm going to be the nicest person you ever saw. And every time I feel violated and every time I feel hurt, I'm going to come out and say, Dad, Mom, that really hurt. No, no way. You'll stuff it right down. And smile. And they'll think you're the nicest kid. And you got anger. Could have dealt with it. But you weren't in an atmosphere where you could. couldn't come out. You would have got blown out of the water. The other thing is this. Not only am I afraid that if you're angry at me, I'm not loved. The other, the flip side of that is this. Any expression of anger from me to you will definitely sever our relationship. Any expression of anger from me to you will definitely sever our relationship. So, no matter what I feel, I won't communicate it. No matter how much I'm hurting, you won't know. No matter how much, and it might, you know, so many of the things that tear us apart are things that are not that big until they go inside. So what do we do when those things come that do stir up or gay in me? That healthy, natural anger. What do I do? Oh, I deal with it, and I acknowledge it, and I confess it, and I express it, and I grow. No, not generally. Very often what we do is we repress it, and we stuff it, and we bury it, and we smile. I'm okay. How are you? Oh, I'm okay. And then with a pious satisfaction, we call that makrothumia. Don't you dare. Don't you dare ever again call that kind of dealing with your anger makrothumia. I'm slow to anger. I just stuff it. It's not makrothumia. That is not a work of the Spirit. That is not. Not dealing with your things that are going on inside of you is not something God prompts you to do. It's something your flesh does. It's something Satan does because it'll destroy you, and I'll explain that in just a minute too. You see, that kind of stuffing and repressing of the things that I feel, even the natural, good, healthy things that come to me and reveal things to me about what I'm committed to, if I stuff them and bury them, that will invariably result in not makrothumia, slow to anger, it will result in for sure paragismas, seething, boiling, angry resentment, and eventually thumas every time. So, ironic, isn't it? The very thing I'm doing to avoid this explosion will produce the explosion. interesting let me explain you see anger that I shove inside anger that I deny and pretend isn't there has one little problem connected with it and that is this that even though I deny it and repress it and pretend it isn't there it is surprise oh I'm not angry and I deny it the problem is that you are angry and instead of acknowledging it and evaluating it and confessing it, it goes underground. And when it goes underground, what happens to it? It goes away. Right? It just goes away. For some of you, that's how you live. And you know what? The feeling that almost got you to nail them does go away. Doesn't it? That feeling that you're just ready to rid them the riot act, boy, it just goes away and you don't do anything with it and it goes away. The feeling goes away. and then you call it makrothumia. It's not a fruit of the Spirit. Because you know what? That very incident, that specific incident that produced something in you that you need to deal with, with that person or with yourself, goes underground. It goes underground. But after I let that feeling subside, my connection with that incident that produced something in me I need to deal with, my connection between that feeling I have and what I need to do does go away. It does go away. But you know what? I still got the anger. I still got the anger. It's right there. I pick it up. I want to give it to you. I want to share with it. I want the Spirit of God to deal with it. I don't. I stick it in here. I stick it in here. And you know what? I start living like that. It goes like this. Situation comes, makes me angry. I feel uncomfortable. I need to confess it. But nice Christians don't get angry. Nice Christians don't have thoughts like that so I pretend I don't. I hold on to it. Okay? I do. Another situation comes up. I do the same thing. I pick it up. Would I deal with it? No, I don't deal with it. I hang on to it. It's really good. I got two things now. But now I've gone down underneath, and I don't feel it anymore. Haven't made a connection, but I still got the feeling. I still got something heavy in me. It's right here. Two little books. It's wonderful. Is this somebody's book important? Okay. I pick up another one. I pick up another one. Instead of dealing with it, instead of confessing it, I just pick up another one. Goes underneath the feeling, goes away. I feel great, right? Only I'm carrying it. And it's starting to feel heavy. interesting that word heavy starting to feel heavy doesn't feel like anger see I've lost the connection between that incident that I needed to deal with in a healthy way between that and the feeling I have all I know is I feel heavy okay the connection's gone something else comes up I've developed this wonderful Christian way of dealing with my anger calling it macrothumia of just hanging on to it so another thing comes up and I got this it's starting to get a little unmanageable I wish I had more I do got more great these aren't bibles these are hymbals it's starting to get a little unmanageable but you know what i still haven't made a connection between these things and the anger that i needed to deal with i haven't made a connection because all it feels like now is heavy it just feels heavy i'm starting to get depressed now i go home and i'm with my wife my loving wife and my kids my loving kids who act like five-year-old kids because they are not all of them okay and I go home and something happens something happens and it needs to be dealt with it ought to make me angry it ought to be dealt with they've disobeyed they need to be disciplined I will discipline them all of a sudden I'm feeling heavy I'm making no connection with this and all my lack of dealing with my anger anywhere else all I know is I feel heavy I feel real unmanageable and something happens that's real little needs to be dealt with but I don't deal with it in an irrational way at all what happens is my little kid comes to me and he says something to me I don't like and I give him the whole thing. Boom. And that kid is sitting there wondering what in the world just hit him. What in the world just hit him. And I feel better. And I even call it macrothamia because it took such a long time. And I wanted to throw those on the floor on purpose to make some noise and to get those things to scatter. I wish the papers were flying all over the place because that's how it looks when you explode. It's disoriented. I'm making no connection with the real issue I needed to deal with. The very thing I was doing to keep me from blowing up into anger is what produced it. And my kid can't figure it out. The other thing is this. I don't have time to go pick those over, but I hold on to him like this. And since I am really a good Christian, a good mom, I never do unload it. I never do give it away. So what I do is I just hold on to it, and hold on to it and hold on to it and hold on to it. And you know what I get? Depressed. Depressed. I want you to know something clinical. It's right out of the book. Anger that you haven't dealt with is the number one classic cause of severe kinds of depression. Don't call stuffing your anger macrothumia. That is not a work of the Spirit. God does not call you to do things that make you sick. You know what else happens when I hang on to it and don't deal with it? Some people blow up. Some people get depressed. Some people get so depressed that they move toward suicide. And you know what? Again, the same thing is true. When I got all this bundle, I'm not making any connection with specific incidents of anger. I've lost the connection. When I needed to deal with it, God gave me the gift, And I could have really honestly grown from that. I've lost the connection. All I feel is down. You know what some people do? They eat. What? What do you mean they eat? Yeah, absolutely. They eat. Classic symptom. You want to know something? Anger that you stuff inside. The glory of anger that you stuff inside is that it never comes out, right? It never comes into thumas, so it never hurts anybody and it doesn't hurt me. I just stuff it. So that's the best way all the way around, right? No, anger, stuffed feelings always get vented someplace. The problem is that when you don't deal with it honestly before the Lord, with other people, with yourself, it'll come out in a way that doesn't look at all like anger, but it's tremendously destructive. Feels real demonic to me. It's a jolly old fat guy, you know, happy, jovial, nice. Can't make him mad for anything. I'll tell you something about that old guy. You can't do anything to make him mad. He's just the nicest guy, always smiling. Funny thing about that old guy, when things happen to him that make normal people angry, he smiles. He doesn't get angry. That's a lie. Yes, he does. Yes, he does. He just doesn't admit it. He keeps a smile on his face, and he stuffs it inside, and it gets vented. He goes and eats for three straight days, whatever. Some people stop eating. this weight of stuff which includes guilt feelings get this one this will connect guilt feelings for crimes that you committed either real or imagined just guilt feelings just begin to weigh and weigh and they get vague again you don't know the source anymore it just feels heavy and sometimes sometimes when you're dealing with all these heavy feelings sometimes you try like crazy to focus because I know I don't want to blow up because that's not Christian and I don't want to keep this because I'm dying I'm dying so what I do is I try to focus and I'll find someone to focus on it is my wife that's my problem it is my husband that's my problem it is our church the church is what's wrong I get it all out on something outside I blame, I start to blame doesn't work doesn't work because it isn't true the connection's been lost folks and you're still left there with heavy feelings and you know what those things turn into real easily self-hate self-hate some people can't sleep some people do nothing but sleep becomes a kind of a an anesthetic some people have an incredible preoccupation with past events that can't be undone can't do anything with them they just live with them obsessions compulsions irrational fears are very often the venting of buried rage. And you see, what happens is when I bury it, it turns into rage. It turns into rage. What comes to me, that orge that came to me at one time in my life and I could have dealt with it maybe even as a child. My parents just kind of, you don't do that, you know. So I bury it. It turns into rage, friends. Smiling face and all, rage. Self-hate, self-hate. Brings itself out this way. People, it's incredible. some people wanting surgery for some disease that they don't really have going from doctor to doctor to doctor to finally get the appendix out the gallbladder out whatever it is they got to have out just going from other people actually getting diseases because they're so consumed with all these things inside of them have lost the connection so they can't deal with the real anger that's driving them crazy so it just turns in on themselves and the irony of this is with all these things going on inside of them they smile and they're just so sweet you'd never in a million years make a connection with that and buried feelings. Never make a connection, ever. People who've done this very often find themselves sabotaging their own success. Sabotaging their self-hate. Self-hate. They begin to go and when things are rough and when things are grueling and things are tough, they're great. They're real performers. It's great. All of a sudden success comes and out of the blue they quit. They leave their job. They can't handle the promotion. It's incredible. They sabotage it. Self-hate. some people have an incredible knack for moving into relationships that are totally destructive disastrous abusive women who who consistently get married and divorced and every guy they marry is a wife beater i wonder if there's a connection there self-hate every man they marry is an alcoholic goes the other way too just as well sometimes people do sweet talk to deal with what's inside of them. So afraid of any kind of anger at all that the victim of this kind of behavior just gets sweeter and sweeter the more angry they get. I don't know if that connects with anybody. I think that's a particular dilemma for some Christians. The more angry they get, the sweeter they look. It's just building inside them. In fact, one of the problems with this kind of person is that they are particularly sweet to the person that they are angriest at. Think on that one? Particularly sweet to the person they're angriest at. Why would that be like that? Because they're so frightened that anybody would be angry at them because anger is always connected with something evil and negative and destructive that if somebody is angry at me, I couldn't be loved. So that person almost invariably eventually develops relationships where you know what he does in a destructive way. He begins even to ignore people who support him and love him and care about him and begin to spend all his time sweetening up people that he knows doesn't like him and he doesn't like him he's sweetest to people he's most afraid of what do you want him to do dave just go around blasting people no no no no confess it acknowledge it evaluate it and release it i could go on and on some people talk on and on and on and some people never talk something happens and you can't get them to talk. They just go in their room, shut the door, that's it. Makrothumia, baloney. Some people gossip. This is another good one Christians get involved in. Don't gossip. The word of God says, don't, so that's what we preach. Don't gossip. I'll tell you what, if you have got things inside of you that are fuming and you have not dealt with the anger that God gave you as a gift to reveal things about you that you need to deal with and you stuffed it instead, you are an angry person. And I want to tell you something, all the sermons on not gossiping will never get you to do it because it's going to come out some way. And gossip about people that I maybe even love. That's another irony. Sometimes people gossip about people that they really care about, but they get it out that way because it's safe. It'll come out some way. If it doesn't come out in a healthy way, it'll come out in a diseased way. And it'll disease the people in your family and it'll disease you as well. Some people gossip. Some people play the martyr and smile piously. Some people use the truth to hurt. They get you a zinger and they go, what's the truth? What's the truth? Some people tell jokes. The point is this. Repressing anger should never be confused with makrothumia, a fruit of the Spirit. The Spirit of God does not lead you into diseased kinds of behavior. Every one of them I mentioned are diseased. In fact, every one of the things that I mentioned, that repression results in paragasmas, seething, and results in thumas every time. As I was going through this, my heart broke because I think of how we do that to our kids, how I do that to my kids. In Ephesians 6.4, I never read it this way because I never looked for this Greek word before. I never knew there were more than one word for anger. It says, provoke not your children to wrath. That means don't make them do things they don't want to do. It doesn't mean that. It means don't discipline them. It doesn't mean that you should discipline your kids and sometimes they got to do things they don't want to do. You know what the word there is? It's paragasmus. You know what that means? It means don't cause your children to seethe with anger. What would make them seethe with anger? What would make them seethe with anger is every time they came to a situation where Orge was there and maybe God wanted to teach them something about the feelings they were having and could deal with it in a healthy way and confess it and acknowledge it and evaluate it. Shut up. You can't talk like that. No way. Paragasmus, seething. They just learn real quick. one way we deal with it is repression another way we deal with it is aggression aggression the reason I want to mention this and I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this but the reason I want to mention it is because it's the flip side of repression aggression in terms of dealing with my behavior by expressing it with aggression is just all the rage today get it? rage? it's all the rage forget it it's a real easy one to forget. The spirit of the age is this. Don't repress your anger. Because even secular people realize what repressed anger does. It kills you. So what we want people to do is express your anger. Get it out. If that means you throw the lamp across a room, fine. If you need to scream, you scream. If you need to punch that lady out, you punch her out. Just great. Just get it out. Oh, he's the most healthy person I know. Every time he gets angry, he punches somebody in the mouth. It's great. He always gets it out. You can just see the therapist there. Don Notchers. I'm going to get it out. It's great. That kind of getting it out, that kind of aggression that is angry and hostile is thumas. And we have a word from the Lord right here that says, Be slow to thumas. Repression isn't the way I get a personality, or not a personality, but a work in my life that gives me slowness to thumas. But aggression is not the answer. aggression is not the answer men especially have a problem with this I don't want to sound sexist or anything like that but I think we do as a little boy we grow up with certain virtues placed in front of us and that is this little boys are strong, little boys are tough little boys are aggressive, they're never weak I grew up with that tried like crazy to be all those things anger isn't good either though even for little boys little boys shouldn't be angry either But they should be strong, and they should be tough, and they should be aggressive, and those are all good kinds of things. Therefore, what does this little boy named David Johnson do? When he doesn't feel particularly strong, he doesn't feel particularly aggressive, and he looks kind of humiliated, and in fact, he feels just plain sad, and he feels bad, and he feels like maybe he needs to cry. Little boys don't cry, and little boys are strong. So what do you do when you're hurt and when you're sad? You act like you're mad. You know why? Because anger is good. No, not because anger is good. Anger is bad. I was told that too. But at least anger is strong. Anger is at least strong. And the worst thing for me to do is to look weak. So even though anger is wrong, and I know it, and everybody in society and everybody in my church tells me anger is wrong, I'd rather look wrong than weak. And so when I hit the pop-up and I'm playing softball, I throw the bat. And when that's the athlete who goes in the locker room at halftime and they're losing, instead of dealing with the things he's feeling and using it to motivate himself to do better, he's got to tear the locker room apart. And everybody writes in the paper the next day how competitive he is. You ever trip on a curb, guys? It goes like this. Stupid curb! You break your toe and it'll look tough, you know. You can't look weak. Whatever you do, you can't look weak. anger's okay you ever smash your head on a door on a cabinet jeff was telling me this week he had a problem in his life it was this he couldn't figure out how how to open a cabinet and leave it and then close it before he moved his head up and smashed his head i mean this happened all the time and he would smash his head on this cabinet all the time just just agony you know and after a while you know what he did he did what you would do he smashed his head he goes he just beat the tire out of that thing. He went around the house in a tire. You know why? Because he was humiliated and he looked like a jerk and he knew he was really being ignorant because he couldn't figure out how to close that cabinet without hitting himself in the head. Instead of letting himself feel sad and feel humiliated, anger was a lot better, even though he knew that was wrong. We do that all the time. Is it really so bad? Is it really so weak just to feel sad when you feel sad and bad when you feel bad and humiliated when you feel humiliated. If life for you is looking tough, if life for you is looking strong, if life for you is looking competent and looking capable, then looking sad is unthinkable, even when you are. And you're doomed to disease like this. And you'll beat your wife and you'll beat your kids and it'll never be disciplined. It'll be because you got to get it out somehow. Sick people. God doesn't call you to that. If that's how you're living, don't you dare call it a walk of the spirit. I don't care how it's coming out. there's a third way to deal with it we got repression leads to paragasmus and it leads to thumas we got aggression which is just plain thumas and we got a third it's called confession confession oh that's priceless dave confession i'll do that dave right after church i'm going to come up to you and i need to confess something dave i don't like you i never have i never will I don't like how you talk I don't like how long you talk I don't like how you walk I don't like how you raise your kids I don't like how you handle your money I don't like how you dress I just don't like you and thank you so much for giving me the liberty to share that with you I feel better I want to tell you something everybody laughs because you know that's silly I'm not talking about a confession that is fundamentally vindictive that kind of confession when I come to you and say you know you really make me sick and I need to deal with it and get it out and you know when you did all these things you just it was so stupid but I had to share it with you to let it go and to kind of get rid of it that is so that is so twisted and so evident that what I'm really doing with my anger is not at all dealing with it it is not at all confessing it to myself and to the Lord and asking Him what needs to change in me I'm just taking my anger and I'm giving it to you see you're the problem here it is I'll give it to you and I confess you're the problem or if you would get fixed or if you would come to me then I'd be okay. The problem is inside me. It is nowhere else. People say, you make me angry. Nobody has that power unless you give it to them. Think on that. Confess. Confess. To who? What am I supposed to confess? First of all, I confess it to myself. When I spill that grease on the floor and I feel it coming on and I start getting irrational and I'm grabbing the kids by the hair and all this kind of stuff. First of all, I wasn't angry. I was like, what do you expect from me? That's just normal, natural. Acknowledge it. It was out of line. It was way out of line. And it simply demonstrates that your little schedule and your little life, if it doesn't go just the way your little plan is, then you're going to go berserk and you just got a gift from God to tell you that. And you can grow if you do it. Acknowledge it. evaluate it why did I get angry why did I react that way what was it that they did that resulted in the kind of overwhelming response they got from me it really tells me something about me not them and use it use it when it comes to me when that or gay anger comes to me use it let it talk to you let it tell you and reveal to you what it is that you're committed to because it will every time it will every time I don't have time to develop this theologically but there are certain things you ought to get angry about I think you know that when we were in Ephesians we dealt with that Jesus, Orge, came to him and you know what it was? when he was dealing with the Pharisees and they were religious hypocrites that stirred up anger you know why? because he was committed to the truth and if you're committed to the truth lies are going to make you angry and you're going to deal with it and you're going to expose it He said, you guys are whitewashed sepulchers full of dead men's bones. The second thing is this. I confess it not only to myself. I acknowledge it. I evaluate it. I bring it to the Lord and I ask him to deal not just with the anger, but that which caused it. Secondly, I acknowledge it to the Lord. I confess it to the Lord. Lord, I'm hurt and I'm sad and I'm angry and I find myself all day long today reacting to everything. everything. And I'm frustrated and I feel like I'm not going to make it. And I'm angry. And Lord, it may be that that thing in my life or that activity or their opinion has, even without my knowing it, taken a place in my life that it doesn't, that it shouldn't have. That it has for some reason become so important to me that if my car is scratched or if my lawn is torn up or the flowers are wrecked or my floor or my carpet gets dirty that I just go berserk. All of a sudden things are more important than people. Something's wrong with me. Lord, deal with me on that. To admit you're sad, to admit you're mad, and then to ask God to deal with the source and then take that thing and let it go. Lord, carpets don't matter. People matter. I'll let it go. Vases that cost $2,000 that got broke because of little kids. Don't matter, kids. Matter. Let it go. Relationships matter and I just blow them up. Something's wrong in me. Let it go. Let it go. I don't mean repress it when I say let it go. I think you know that. That kind of dealing with my orge results in macrothumia. That is a work of the Spirit. be slow to anger if you're dealing with your orge you will be slow to anger you'll keep putting it down you'll keep getting it out you'll keep dealing with it you'll keep confessing it I gotta give a caution right here if I'm not realistic with this I won't help you for some of you what I just talked about confessing it looking at it acknowledging it getting it out will not be easy because I'm afraid that some of you have for so long stored it and you have so much junk in there that you, again, you're that person who isn't making the connection anymore. All you do is feel heavy. All you do is feel heavy and hurt. And you're not even making the connection anymore between that heavy, hurt, depressed feeling and stores and stores of anger at parents, at sisters, at brothers, at friends. But all your life, see, you were the good kid. You were the good kid and you always had this smile. And you could never say, that hurt me, that hurt me. You could never say that. so you stuffed it and now it's big and it's ugly and it's messy and it's hurting and it's directionless and Dave if I were to let that out it would spill all over everybody and it would ruin my nice little girl image and it would ruin my nice little boy image and maybe from now on I'll do it from now on I'll deal with it it needs to come out if it's there and it's not acknowledged it will eat you alive it is eating you alive big smile on your face if the smile is from Jesus let it go let it shine but if it's put on to hide something inside then you're dying and it's not a work of the spirit and I want to tell you something as ugly and as and as venomous as it may feel while it's right here just ready to come out I want to tell you something if people who are around you love you they'll help it come out and they'll be there when it does and they'll love you right through it the sad truth is this I can't give you a little pill here and say okay go and be okay do it right from now on because the longer it's been there the harder and more painful it will be to come out what do I do? I would say just this. Start by asking the Lord to help you get it out. Lord, I'm angry, and I don't know why, and I don't know where it's coming from, but I do know this. I don't want to blow anybody up, but I know this too. I don't want myself to be blown up either. Help me get it out where I can see it, and you can heal it. He can't heal it until it does. And when it begins to come, for some of you, if it's been frozen for years and years and years, you may not like this, but for some of you, when it begins to come, where you can see it and God can heal it, it might come out screaming like a demon. That doesn't look real pretty. That doesn't sound real churchy. It might come out screaming like a demon. But I want to tell you something, in case you find that offensive, I want to tell you something. I can't think of anything more demonic than one who has been set free by the blood of Jesus to deal with all the things I feel and everything I am in the light of his forgiveness and the light of his love to take all those things that he gave to me as gifts to help me grow, even the orge, to stuff them where they kill me. That is not a work of the Spirit. That is a demonic work of Satan. I was with Dwight Martin this last week for breakfast, and we were talking about his experience on the mission field with demonic kinds of influences. And he saw them firsthand, and he said, Dave, you just wouldn't believe it. People would take spears and stick them through their cheeks, and they wouldn't cry a word of pain. Demons, the Satan world had so dominated their lives that they would stick that in their cheek, and then he shocked me because he said, then they'd pull it out and it wouldn't bleed, and the mark wouldn't be there. But we don't see that. basically that's not happening. I want to tell you something. People have had the work of Satan in their lives do these kinds of things that are absolutely destroying their lives. Sometimes when it comes out, it comes out screaming like a demon. I confess it to myself. I confess it to the Lord. And then I confess it to others. I confess it to others. Not you make me angry. Again, that's just, you haven't dealt with it if that's what you're doing. If that's what you're doing, you haven't dealt with your anger yet. You're just giving it away. People are not responsible for how you feel. You are. Rather, coming to people having dealt with the things I feel. Can you imagine going to some of the people in your life? Some of you need to go to your parents. Some of you need to go to your kids. Some of you need to go to your best friend. Your best friend. Shocked. And say, I've been angry at you for six months, for a year. because... No. I've been angry at you for six months and I'm sorry. It was all in me. And the walls come down and there's a sense of release and suddenly when I start to deal with it, there's an ability to be patient, work of the Spirit. You know what? You can't do that in the flesh. What I just described to you cannot be done by your trying hard. What I just described to you is a supernatural work of the Spirit of God as you begin to say, life for me is Christ. Nothing else. Not what people think. Not what my parents think. Not what my kids think. Not what my husband thinks. Not what my wife thinks. And I'm going to deal with these things in a healthy way. And that's why it says the fruit of the Spirit is macro through me and not repression. not stuffing it not aggression but confession to myself to God and to my brothers and sisters who I love. I think that was good. I think that was healthy and I think some of you need to be set free and I've found some areas of my life just this last week where I had to let go and go in deep and look. Would you do that? I don't know what kind of invitation to give today. except that if some of you feel like you need to deal with something, you need to talk, you need to feel the freedom after hearing something like that to come and talk. So that's my invitation. If you need to do it, you come and we'll talk. you
