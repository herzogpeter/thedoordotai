Take your Bibles with me to the book of Galatians in our continuing study in that most exciting book, Galatians chapter 3, verses 1 through 5. Starting in verse 1, you foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you? Before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified? This is the only thing I want to find out from you. Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? Did you suffer so many things in vain, if indeed it was in vain? Does he then, who provides you with the Spirit and works miracles among you, do it by works of the law or by hearing with faith? Let's look to the Lord as we begin. father as we break open your word once again once again we call upon the power of your spirit to communicate what words cannot and lord jesus you know the condition of my heart this morning and you know the condition of me emotionally and spiritually and my ability this morning to deliver something that has value but lord there is no ability there saved by the energizing of your spirit and I pray that even as I speak, I would hear and listen and be going slow enough to let you work through me. I feel an impulse in my spirit this morning to move ahead of you and to try to stir things up and I pray for the control of your spirit in that area. Jesus, I ask for this, that Satan would be bound in every way in our midst, that we may hear clearly your word to us this morning. I ask this in your name, believing that you will do it and work among us. Amen. Right at the very top of your bulletin, I began my theme for this morning's sermon by saying this. Defection is an ugly word. So is the word deserter. Someone who, having taken a position at one time, seeing something or being distracted somehow, moves away from the position that they assumed. Certainly there is nothing more bewildering and maybe nothing more sorrowing than a Christian who defects from the purity and simplicity and power and joy of a simple faith in Jesus Christ that came when he realized that it was by grace through faith and that not of himself, it was a gift. And we move back to mushy commitments and mediocre living. We call it backsliding. We call it backsliding. The sad truth is this, that while that is a hard thing to handle, many Christians do it. We find that they begin well, they receive the grace that Christ extended in salvation, their life is changed, they experience joy and a humble faith in Jesus. But for some reason or another, it seems that they fall into a system of legalism, they fall into a system of ritual, a system of form, again, that focuses on external things. And all of a sudden the joy and the power and the glory that they once felt begins to diminish. And after a while it's just totally gone. It's a thing that they remember in their past. For example, I wonder how many Christians have come to a knowledge of Jesus Christ in a very personal and powerful way. And then they got involved possibly in a church that focused on the liturgical pattern. That was the focus. Or the denominational niceties were the message that they constantly heard. Or dressing a certain way and talking a certain way and learning the language. was the prerequisite for being loved or accepted in that particular church and wanting to be loved and accepted. They started wearing the right kinds of clothes and they started talking the right kind of way and they learned the language and they focused on the liturgical pattern and they determined in their minds that what the denominations and all those little niceties that they were getting really was the message and they bought it and they said this is where the depth is. This is the real power. They picked up on the rules. and they jumped through the hoops and they felt finally I'm part of the body of Christ because I'm learning how to do it. But all of a sudden, not all of a sudden, very subtly and very slowly this process takes place that they're finding themselves looking back on the time when there was joy and power and freedom and glory. They kind of caught a glimpse of it when they were first saved. The Spirit came into their lives and gave them life and joy. And now they've gotten religious. Their hearts were so full, and now they're going through the motions. They're going through the motions. This, beloved, is the issue that comes to full force in the book of Galatians, and Paul confronts it. What we know about our study so far is that the apostle Paul had been called of God, and he did it well, to go into all sorts of different areas and preach the gospel of grace, not according to works, but according to grace, energized by faith. And we know from our study already that he went into this Galatian province, Galatians is not one city it was four cities that he evangelized and he came into these cities with a message of grace and these people received it with great joy and at the beginning their experience was glorious and it was full and it was being energized by faith but since that time that Paul had come to these people and brought that message the Judaizers had come in and sowed all sorts of seeds of legalism and works that were the way to get a right relationship with God. There's nothing wrong with works. We've gone over that several times. But if you're doing good works in order to kind of maintain a standing before God, that's absolute heresy. These Judaizers came in, and these Galatians defected and began to backslide from the grace gospel and substitute for the freedom that a grace gospel brings a form of religion inferior to grace, impotent to deal with sin, Full of hypocrisy. And the reason it was full of hypocrisy was because it was all external. It focused on things we do. And people ended up going through the motions. And again, I constantly feel like I need to reaffirm that there's nothing wrong with doing good things. My goodness, that is always the characteristic of one who is truly born of God. But if we're doing those good things to try to earn something, it doesn't work. And they had begun to do that. this is not to say beloved that they had lost their salvation it is to say this that they had substituted for the fullness of life in christ a form of religion that had no power joy and it also had no testimony to anyone who was looking at them wondering what christianity really was they had no testimony if you want to think about that a different way you could say it a different way the fact is this that they really did have a testimony we've said this many times before we're supposed to have a witness we need to testify for christ we need to have a testimony The fact is this. You have a testimony. You have a witness. The question is not for us, do I have a testimony or do I have a witness? The answer to that is absolutely true. Yes, you do. The question is this. Does the witness that I portray, does the testimony that I give reflect accurately who Jesus is and what his message is? Or does my witness, does my life muddy the waters? I want to tell you this. If your walk with Christ is an external thing, if you are going through the motions and it isn't internal, I guarantee you, what you do, no matter how much you know, no matter how right your doctrine is, no matter how good your act is, your witness muddies the water. It confuses people because if what matters to you is saying the right words, performing the right way, looking the part, people are going to conclude that that's what Christianity is and nothing could be further from the truth. So Paul, in writing the book of Galatians, is deeply concerned about their defection because of two reasons. One, it robbed the Galatians of their own joy in Jesus, the freedom that they had. And secondly, it robbed the world of a clear picture of salvation by grace. And all was caused because they began to go through the motions rather than focus on what was going on inside of them. Going through the motions. Going through the motions. Oh, boy. How does that happen? how do you get into that has ever happened to you how many is raise your hand yeah all of you i was just halfway kidding but you all could raise your hand because every one of you do it and every one of you have fallen into it and and when we fall into it we're not always sure why it happens sometimes it happens and it's just a day you know i have a day and you know oh boy i shouldn't say this but i'm gonna anyway every once in a while i've shared with you many times that the roughest day of the week for one reason or another seems to be Wednesday. And I just go through a real spiritual struggle that day. And I almost got into a point where I thought I was bringing that on myself because I just started looking for it all the time. And I would be studying and things like that. And I'd go into prayer meeting and more than once I have hidden behind a lesson that I knew was right and I knew it was safe and I knew it wouldn't really stir anything up, but I kind of hid behind it. You know what I mean? And I wasn't. And it was a day that just felt lousy because I was going through the motions. It feels like death. We've done it. Sometimes you've gotten into it and it's gone a week. Sometimes you've gotten into it and it's gotten so deep it went a whole month. Maybe some of you can look back on a period of your life where it was literally years, where you were just going through the motions and the act you were putting on in front of your parents and in front of your peers and in front of the church was just tremendous, but you knew in your heart, you were playing a game. And it wasn't real. There wasn't any life. There wasn't any joy. There wasn't any power. And you even got to wonder if this Christianity thing was real because it just didn't do anything for you. Sometimes it does indeed begin to be a lifestyle. It begins to be a lifestyle to such an extent that even the fact that you're going through the motions is lost on you. You've gotten so used to just playing the game that you're not even aware anymore that that's exactly what you're doing. But how do you get into that? How do people fall into that? If the gospel is being preached, and if the message is clear, and if the body is functioning, how is it that people kind of still, even when everything is clear, kind of filter into that kind of pretending lifestyle? Well, I think there's a lot of answers to that question. We could make a big, long list. But because of the text we're in, I want you to consider one that I think is reflection of the text. Picture it this way, and maybe this is just kind of a reflection of what happens to me, but I think it's a pretty good reflection of what possibly happens to you. Let's say you're just kind of moving along. You love the Lord. Everything is going well, and you're at a particular point in your life where you're sensing the presence of God. You're sensing the fullness of God. Maybe some of you right now are feeling a little bit dry, and in order to recall the sense of his presence, you're going to have to think back a couple weeks. Maybe you have to do that. Well, go ahead and do that. A time when you just sense this presence and his power and the filling of the spirit and you're just cruising along. It's great. You've got lots to give. You've got lots to say. You've got lots to contribute. And that's exactly what you're doing in every dimension of church life. You're giving your money. You're giving your time. You've got lots to say just. And in fact, there's wisdom there even. You remember the whole time in your life when you'd say things and people go, yeah, that's really neat. And it was just because you're We're really connected with the Lord at that time. And lots to contribute. You're involved. You find yourself getting involved. You start singing in the choir. You start seeing a hole for a teaching class, and you fill it. You get involved in a wanna. All of a sudden, you get on the board, and oh, man, you're on your way. It's incredible. Great. And it's not the flesh. You can really sense the Spirit working in you, and all of a sudden, you hit a snag. It's called the spiritual dries, the spiritual blahs. You ever have the spiritual dries? The blase. What in the world causes that? You know, you just get frantic. You know, again, here you are, you're cruising along, and everything's going great, and all of a sudden, whammo, you wake up one morning, and spiritually, you just got cotton mouth. Nothing's flowing. Nothing's working. There's nothing to say. There's nothing to draw on. Did I sin? What did I do? Did I not read my Bible? What is wrong? You start going through this big long list, trying to make everything right, and it's just that way. One of the things I'd like to say is that those spiritual dry times are absolutely normal. Maybe it's that you're tired. Sometimes it's just that you get physically tired. Maybe it is that you got your eyes off the goal. And this is a little lesson to make sure you keep focusing on the Lord rather than your own performance and needing to be seen. Maybe God's deepening you. Maybe it is conviction. Maybe God is moving upon your heart to settle some things in terms of sin. But I want you to know something as I go on here, that there's nothing wrong with having a spiritual dry time. It's normal. It just happens to people. How we react to that time very often determines whether or not we start pretending, though. Determines whether or not we start going through the motions. The spiritual dry times do not cause me to go through the motions unless, unless what? Unless I am in a legalistic structure and I'm surrounded by legalistic people. Now, I want you to get this structure in your mind. Why is it that a legalistic church or legalistic people who surround me, whether it be family or church people or friends, why is it that if I go into the spiritual dries and I'm around those kind of people, it'll set me off into going through the motions? It is because of this Because in a legalistic structure Being real and being open And being vulnerable And disclosing the way I really feel Is not what you get the prize for That is not the goal How things look is the goal Among legalistic people How things appear is the goal Among legalistic people How people are performing And making sure that everybody is always smiling Is what you get the prize for Among legalistic people and if that's the structure I find myself in picture it put yourself right in the middle of it if you can with your mind if that's the kind of structure I find myself in what do I do and what do I say when I'm feeling hurt and I'm feeling weak and I'm feeling like I'm failing and stumbling all over the place it's easy what I do when I'm around that kind of people and what I do when I'm in that kind of church when I'm hurt and failing I say listen folks I want you to know I just love the Lord like crazy and and boy yesterday I just felt full and everything was great but now I'm hurt and I'm weak and I feel like I'm failing and I got to be real honest with you I'm beginning to doubt if the whole thing is real could you come and support me and advise me and love me and pray for me would you do that would you say those kinds of things in the teeth of a how things look atmosphere I don't believe you would not a chance not a chance if what matters is how things look and i'm hurting there's no way in the world i'm going to tell you that i'm hurting because i'm going to try to make you think i'm not so what do we do when i'm in that kind of atmosphere and i'm in that kind of church and or in that kind of family or around those kind of people when something is wrong inside of me and i'm just not feeling up to snuff what do i do you know what you do you pretend you pretend that what you feel you don't feel you put on a happy face along with your three piece suit your bible under your arm you go to Sunday school ready with the answers hoping like crazy that they don't call on you to pray but if they do you're ready for that too because you know how to do that you can just kind of flip into something fire it off and it looks good it looks good and guess what in a legalistic system that's what matters that's what matters looking good nobody asks any questions and you are allowed to drift into a whole lifestyle of pretending. Hypocrisy, looking good, but there is no life. And you know what? You know it. You know it. You know it so much. You know it to the depths of your soul so much that there are times, even though when you really assess it, you know you're a Christian and you know at the depths of your heart, You'll love the Lord with all your heart. This pretending is so pervasive that sometimes when you hear a certain kind of sermon or read a certain kind of verse, you really do begin to wonder, am I saved or not? But the game just goes on. And every once in a while, by the grace of God, God breaks through that, and someone discloses himself in a congregation like that. Someone just tells other people how they really feel. One of the places I think we see this is in our communion service. One of the reasons I love our communion time is that we have a time to share. And you can't contrive this or anything like that, but every once in a while the Spirit of God just moves upon us. You've seen it in a special way. And somehow God has been dealing with someone, and they will stand, and they will share, and they will just say, hey, I'm struggling. I'm really dealing with some things in my life, and I need you to support me. And we go around that person and pray for them. Or they stand and they say, hey, I've been pretending for a long time, and I want to get it right, and I want to let it go, and I want to be real, and I want to have joy. And we feel wonderful when that happens. And all sorts of neat things happen. One of the things we notice is that it almost kind of starts a chain reaction. Other people start to share too. Because one of our responses when we hear someone disclose how they really feel and what they're going through is you all of a sudden feel this incredible release. I'm not the only one who feels like that. People disclose things like that. I just look across our congregation and there's tears. and people are just sensing the presence of the Lord, sometimes those tears are just because of unmitigated joy. You see somebody who's just been released from pretending, my brother or sister has been released from that bondage. I sometimes think, though, and I don't want to read a lot into this, but I sometimes think as well that part of the breaking that we feel when we see somebody else disclose themselves and confess and deal with something and be set free, I think part of the tears among some people is that they look at that person and think, oh man, I wish I could do what they just did. I wish I could be free like they just got set free. But what would my parents think? Or what would my husband think? I'm supposed to be together. I got my act together. You know, I'm an elder. I'm a pastor. How in the world am I supposed to disclose the things that are really going on inside of me? What would the church think? What you discover is grace. What you discover is forgiveness. What you discover is freedom. But instead, if we're in that kind of atmosphere where how things look is what matters, not being real is what matters, what you're going to do is you're going to backslide. You're going to backslide. Into what? Into pretending. When we always talk about backsliding, it's always moral decay, right? Well, he's backsliding. It means he's smoking and drinking and those things, you know, all those things. That's what it means. Backsliding here was that these people started pretending instead of being real. They backslid. Their defection was from freedom. Their defection, their backsliding was from honesty. Their backsliding was from joy. Their backsliding was from self-disclosure. They started hiding everything, and they ended up being hypocrites right now. And so it is that Paul rips into them with a fury in Galatians chapter 3, verse 1 and says, you foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you? Diving right into the text, the attitude that is picked up here in this very first verse is a mingling of anger, a mingling of love. He just doesn't understand why they're doing this. And also surprise. I'm amazed, he says in verse 1, chapter 1, verse 6, I'm amazed that you are so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of God to a different gospel. I want you to, I want to take apart these words a little bit. In fact, most of our message is going to come right out of this first verse. The three points that I have for the sermon is really going to be the conclusion. We're going to just nail those real quick at the end. The things I want to sink your teeth into is right here at the beginning. The first word is bewitched that I want you to look at. Who has bewitched you? He's saying this, who has put a spell on you? The picture is that of a zombie just kind of breathing and his eyes are open and he's going through the motions. That's what zombies do. They go through the motions of life, but they're really dead. And he says, you guys are like zombies. Who's bewitched you? It also betrays the meaning of fascination, being fascinated by something. It's the picture of a little child who is sitting in the safety of his yard and he looks across the street. Now our street in our house is real busy and our kids are not allowed to go into the street. If they do, they die. One way or the other, they're going to die. They either meet me or they meet a car. They're in a lot of trouble if they go out there. But it would be the picture of a little child being fascinated, like my little guy Caleb, by a little glittering thing across the street, a piece of candy, or just some little toy. And without thinking, without doing any examining, without remembering anything that he'd been taught, he just kind of wanders across that street, gets into all sorts of trouble. Who has bewitched you? You're not thinking about what's going on. around you. It's as if they're under some sort of power that they cannot control. They are not thinking. And what they need right now is a severe jolt to wake them up and say, get back together. Paul gives that jolt. Whammo, you foolish Galatians. That word foolish is powerful. J.B. Phillips translates it this way. I couldn't believe it when I saw it. Oh, you dear idiots. Oh, you dear idiots. that's a jolt this word here is loaded with insights foolish it's incredible i i love it every once in a while something like this comes up and you can just dive into some some of the depths of the meaning of the greek gives so much literally the word foolish refers to foolishness it refers to thoughtlessness now i want to paint a picture here for you so come along with me it refers to thoughtlessness the thoughtlessness that comes from dullness of thinking You got that? That's the foolishness he's talking about. The thoughtlessness that comes from dullness of thinking. Galatians, for you to regress into a lifestyle of pretending, demanded something of you. You know what it demanded? It demanded for you to quit thinking. You had to be dull in your thinking to move back into that lifestyle of pretense. You couldn't have thought it through. If you would have thought it through, you would have kept being real. You would have kept disclosing yourself. you would have never fallen for that legalistic garbage Charlie Brown seems to be the popular person the philosopher of the age at least today because I've got a quote from him too no I don't, it's from his film strip it's Lucy this is when he says fool you know you foolish Galatians you remember Lucy? she always talked to Charlie Brown you blackhead exactly what Paul is saying you blackheads now listen I want you to know what this does not mean he is not saying they are imbeciles he is not saying they are incapable of thinking they are capable of thinking they have minds to think they have an ability to reason their problem is that they just weren't using it much like us we have the ability to think we have the ability to evaluate and assess we have spiritual capabilities to discern spiritual things but there are times that we get lazy and it's when we get lazy that we fall into all sorts of mushy teaching and mushy living. These Judaizers come along. They lay this big external trip on you, you Galatians. You know better. You've heard the gospel of grace, but you don't think it through, and now you're sitting there wondering where the joy went. You blockheads. You know what else, though? That word also indicates a heart condition, a heart problem. One of the reasons that people don't think it through is very often not just an intellectual laziness. It's that the heart has grown a little bit cold. The same word is found in Luke chapter 24, verse 25. Jesus, in a resurrected body, is walking down the road of Emmaus, to Emmaus, the road to Emmaus with the disciples. And they didn't recognize him, remember? And he had told them all about the resurrection, and they should have recognized him. But they didn't. And Jesus said to them, you foolish men, same word, dull-thinking people. You're not thinking it through. Slow of heart, he says, to believe. Synonym. Same word. You foolish men, slow of heart to believe. When a believing heart grows cold, when a believing heart grows lazy, when a believing heart grows cynical, I want to guarantee something. Right now, legalistic externals will follow. Legalistic externals will follow. Maybe to the Galatians he was saying this, Galatians, don't you care enough about the gospel to think it through and not swallow everything you hear? Their problem was not a problem of mental inability. Their problem was a problem of sinful neglect. They didn't think it through. They put their brains in neutral and they bought a lie. Christians walking around like this, you know, just kind of getting flowed with anything that comes along. I get real tired of that. You know, when I was growing up, and maybe you kind of dealt with that too, there was always this, everybody, a lot of philosophers are saying, boy, I'll tell you, if you're going to be a Christian, you just got to blow your brains right out the window. I say this, that if you blow your brains out the window and don't think, I don't think you can be a Christian. Thank you. I missed you last week. I really don't. We're called to be alert people. We are called to think it through. We are called to evaluate. And I want to tell you something. When you don't, I'm not asking for geniuses. You're not all geniuses. None of us are. But when we don't, you are going to get suckered somewhere. And if you aren't one who thinks it through and evaluates and takes that very seriously, I would wager that you are being suckered by something right now in your life. Mushy commitment. False, mushy teaching. It's just easy to buy. You know what I believe? I believe that right here in this little word, this little phrase as he begins, we have tremendous insight into why people get suckered into mushy theology, flimsy commitment, defeated Christian living, and ultimately false teaching. I'd like to think that you couldn't fall into false teaching, but the only thing that is protecting you, maybe, from falling into false teaching is that you happen to be in a church where a teaching is going to be pretty solid, where the teaching is going to be the Word of God. could you stand alone and fight against the false teaching do you think it through enough could somebody else come in go a whole different direction and you just kind of go okay we're going to go that way now it's important it's important to consider that the reason very often we get blown to and fro is that because instead of thinking it through we get carried away by emotions we follow whims and fancies we put ourselves in a position of letting other people do our thinking for us. And too often we come to church and go through life even, like little birds with their mouths open waiting for someone to just pour it in. And if it's coming from a position, if what's being poured into us is coming from a position that looks authoritative, whether it be a parent or a pastor or a teacher or an elder or just someone who's older than us in the church, we just assume automatically that it must be right. You know what? Think it through. Everything. Everything. No matter where it comes from. One of the joys of my ministry, I was talking to someone this week, and they were talking to me. We were coming home from a softball game. I'll mention her. No, I won't. It'll embarrass her. I won't mention her name. But she was telling me how every sermon I preach, she goes home and you know what she does? She thinks it through. She thinks it through. And she prays about it. And after she prays about it, and after she thinks about it, she goes, Aha! That was good. That's wonderful. That's wonderful. constantly amazed and sometimes bewildered by people's lack of practical scriptural knowledge a lot of us knows bible stories a lot of us know bible verses but in terms of practical application of biblical knowledge into how we run things as a church and to what kind of things we confront and what kind of things we don't. Just a real hard time very often with people understanding the practical application of Scripture. And I think we're growing in this area a lot. I think I'm growing in this area a lot. But in areas like church structure, church policy, what kinds of things we discipline, church doctrine, Very often for some people, if the information concerning those things, church policy, church doctrine, church structure, church discipline, if the information about those kinds of issues that need to really be here, and we need to understand the direction and what kind of things we're going to emphasize, is coming from the denomination, or it's coming from tradition. We've always done it that way, and that's why we're going to do it from now on. That's just the way it is. Or if it's coming because that's what it says in our bylaws, and it must be right because it's in our bylaws, and it's the way we've always done it. Or that's the way the denomination says. You're setting yourself up to be a blackhead, to move into areas that you don't really know the Word of God is teaching in that area. Think it through. Think it through. If we don't, we'll be deceived. If we don't, we'll be deceived. every time, every time. I've been in churches and I know of people who, and this is, I think this is a real problem in the evangelical church today, especially as denominations, and they're good. I'm not just totally down on denominations, but what happens is all of a sudden the focus moves and all of a sudden these edicts start coming down and all of a sudden there are bylaws. You know, I know people who know their bylaws better than they know their Bible. If we want to know what we should do in a church, well, look up the bylaws. What about the Bible? If they conflict, who wins? think it through think it through the christian life is not a bunch of floating whims and fancies based on high charged emotional pitches you need to think it through you know we even do this sometimes in in evangelism we do this sometimes in discipleship and wanting people to come to christ rather than and many of you grew up on this and some and to some degree I did too. Rather than going to the text, which I believe has power to change a life. I don't need a lot of gimmicks. We don't need a lot of that stuff to just kind of manipulate people and just kind of draw them and get them to do things they're really not feeling they want to do. They haven't had the time to think it through. Rather than just going to the text and let the Spirit of God teach. Evangelicals, I'm sure you can replay it in your mind, have just gotten into all sorts of manipulative emotional kinds of appeals to get people to come forward. The problem with that is this, that very often if people are responding strictly by emotion, strictly following a whim, strictly because they got manipulated that day, nine times out of the ten, the commitment that that person made that day isn't a commitment that's going to last. Why? Because they didn't think it through. You know, Jesus himself said that in Luke chapter 7. Remember, there would be thousands of people there and they were all following because they thought, oh, this is great. I love this. What a miracle worker. I want to be part of this. He turned around to them and he said, listen, this is what it's going to mean to follow me. Take up your cross and follow me. Hate your mother and father in comparison to your love for me. And then as he was just about to give the invitation, he should have just gotten real manipulative and get a big emotional appeal. He said this, before you come, before you come, I want you to stop. I want you to think it through. I want you to count the cross. Don't you dare come without counting the cross. Don't you dare come without thinking it through first. When people think it through and then they make a commitment, now you've got a commitment. The use of the mind for spiritual growth and integrity and protection against pretense is replete throughout Scripture. Romans 12, verses 1 and 2. Be transformed. Be not conformed. Be transformed. How? By the renewing of your what? Your mind. Think it through. Spiritual dullness. Lacking the discipline to think it through leads to spiritual disease. Paul says to them, the time has come for you to wake up out of your stupor to come alive to some truth that you have lost to quit pretending to wake up and remember and think it through and just in concluding I want to nail these little three things right now there's three things you want him to get three things I want you to remember I want you to remember first of all your experience with Christ verse 1 I want you to remember your experience with the Holy Spirit verses 2 through 4 and I want you to remember your experience with the Father say it a different way I want you to remember the message you heard I want you to remember, same verse as your experience with Christ, verse 1. I want you to remember the freedom you felt, and I want you to remember the power you saw. First of all, the message you heard. I want you to remember the message you heard. I want you to think through what Jesus Christ did. Read the verse, verse 1 at the end. Before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. It's as if he says here to these Galatians, listen folks, you don't have any excuse for your legalism. None whatsoever. Why? Because before your eyes, Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. I want to explain that for you. Does that mean that they saw him physically? They saw Jesus Christ crucified? Obviously, that is not what it means. The word publicly portrayed there is progapo. It refers to a public placard. In those days when an announcement was being made, the city mayor, the official, would take these great big placards and nail them onto a post so everyone in the village would see it and everyone would know what that message was. Today we would have billboards. You had Christ plastered up on billboards. I think of the theater, what do they call it? The marquee. Okay, up on a marquee. You heard the message. And what was the message? It was grace. It was faith. It was not works. You don't have any excuse. Every once in a while you look at a church and you see something really going wrong or you see people who are real shallow. And I've done this myself. And I look at that and I think, I see shallow people and I see lack of commitment and I see them going off in all sorts of wacko ways and it's really crazy. They must have really had lousy teaching. That explains it. Not necessarily. Not necessarily. These people had the best teaching. They had Jesus publicly portrayed just right up on a placard, right up on a billboard. There's no excuse for your falling back into legalism. Remember the message. Jesus Christ, through grace, extends grace, you get it energized by faith. Think through your experience with Christ. Secondly, remember the freedom you felt. Remember the freedom you felt. Think through your experience with the Holy Spirit. Verse 2. This is the only thing I want to find out from you. Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? That's a stinger. That's a stinger for somebody who's a legalist. Just think for a minute back to when you were saved. How did that happen? How did that happen? Do you remember your attitude? Do you remember your heart condition when it happened? Did you come to him all puffed up with your self-righteous doing and say here i am god lucky you oh boy boy you got a good one this time look at all the things i'm doing for you you didn't come that way at all if you came if you came you didn't go that way at all you came broken in spirit you said lord i realized that i cannot do this myself i can't keep it up and lord i'm going to have to depend on you giving grace guess what that's supposed to be a little clue when we come that way that's how we're supposed to live how you came is how we're supposed to live we end up saying Lord thank you for your spirit I thank you that you saved me and now I'm going to take over I'm going to do it my own way you block it you block it are you so foolish verse 3 having begun by the spirit are you now being perfected by the flesh that is a rhetorical question that is just an obvious question that there's just no way that can happen verse 4 he says this did you suffer so many things in vain the word suffer there is a neutral word and what it means is basically this did you experience did you experience all this did you get saved did you feel the freedom and the power of the Holy Spirit in your life and now is that all in vain softens just a little bit when it comes off and it says if indeed it was in vain I hope it's not true I hope it wasn't in vain I hope you're going to come back to grace right now remember the work of Christ remember the work of the Holy Spirit remember finally the power that you saw experience the experience you had with the father does he that's god the father does he then who provides you with the spirit and works miracles among you did he work those miracles among you by the law or by the hearing of faith obviously by the hearing of faith the miracles there can have to do with external miracles that they saw god work in their midst. But it's the word dunamis, which also means power. And it is meaning basically this, you saw God at power in you. You even experienced in your being the power of God when you were first saved. The freedom that came before all this legalistic external junk got added on to you. You experienced all that. And when you were experiencing that power and you were seeing the miracles brought before you, how were those things coming about? Was it because you did something right? Was it because you did it enough? No, it was because you believed and God worked and you were sharing your faith and people were getting saved and it was sweet and it was simple and it was pure and it was free and it was fun. Who bewitched you? Going through the motions, pretending. It happens so easy. In ways that we don't even know we're doing it, we start doing it. We lose our joy. We lose our power. You foolish Galatians think it through. An awful lot of spiritual defection takes place just from forgetting. Revelation 2, the church in Ephesus, remember them? They left the basics. They left the basics, but they were still doing it right. All the externals were there. It's incredible. In verse 2 of chapter 2, it says this, I know your deeds. Oh, you guys are performing. You're doing it right. You'll look good. I know your toil. I know your perseverance. You guys discipline sin. You don't tolerate sinful men. You guys are keeping it up real well. But you have left your first love. I have this against you. You have left your first love. There was no more joy. You know what they were doing? They were going through the motions. Guess what? That church died. What do you do when that happens? What do you do when you backslide from those things that matter most? Verse 5 of that chapter says this. First thing you do is you remember. First thing you do is you remember. You go back and you remember the things that you knew. Remember your experience with Christ. Remember your experience with the Holy Spirit. Remember the power of God in you. Who did that? You? No. Why are you trying to perfect yourself in the flesh now then? Repent. That verse goes on to say, turn around and then repeat. Do the deeds you did at first. Go back to your freedom. Go back to your joy. Go back to being real and disclosing yourself and quit pretending and stop it right now. Let's pray. Lord, sometimes we get so deeply ingrained in pretending and going through the motions that it requires far more than a sermon, far more than being called foolish to snap us out of that. And Lord Jesus, for those who just need to hear it and say, oh Lord, I can see it, I've been doing it, I'm just pretending and I need to get back on the track. Father, I thank you for that. I thank you that your spirit can just correct that right now, just where they sit. But Father, for some, this lifestyle has become so ingrained that it is possible that some aren't even aware that they do it. I pray by your Spirit that you would keep moving and keep prodding and keep exposing by your word and by your Spirit that which is pretense and false, that which needs to be done away with. Help us to remember that everything that is done is a work of the Spirit. Everything that is of value is a work of the Spirit. Teach us that in our living. In Jesus' name, amen. Thank you.
