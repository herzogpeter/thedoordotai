I'd like you to open your Bibles with me, if you have them, to the book of Exodus, the 20th chapter we are entering this morning, our fourth week of study on the Ten Commandments, what we've been referring to as the ten great words from God for life. Our first two weeks, we devoted to the laying of a foundation for understanding so that we could make appropriate application of these words. Today marks the second week of study examining the first great commandment of the law. It begins in verse 3 of chapter 20 with these words. You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth. You shall not worship them, which speaks of loving them, or serve them, which speaks of devotion to them. Here's why. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God. Let's pray as we begin. Father, in Jesus' name, I ask again this service that by the power of your Spirit, you would do what no words I have will have power to do, And that is to woo your bride to yourself, to reveal to us the ways in which we erect for ourselves false gods that are our construction, not the true you, and by your spirits. Woo us away from those things to your true heart. Pray this work be done by your spirit's power in Jesus' name. Amen. it is worth noting says Donald McCullough a book I referenced a couple of weeks ago called The Trivialization of God that God gave the commandment against other gods not to pagans but to Israel to the very people of God being saved he says never guarantees worship of the true God it's a rather provocative statement it goes on to say this even as Moses was on the mountain receiving these commandments the people were turning from God why? because they lost their patience where was this God who had led them into such a God forsaken wilderness they wanted a God who would stay put so they imaged a different deity and making their imagination concrete they fashioned a golden calf when they did that they did not think that they were abandoning the God who would save them, they simply refashioned God to fit their expectations and to service their desires. God, he says, can sometimes seem far too distant, too slow in appearing, too unaccommodating to individual desires. The consequent longings easily seduce us into adulterous liaisons with more immediately satisfying gods. But when the afternoon's diversion has passed, the unfulfillment comes roaring back with even greater intensity. By then, though, the marriage has been defiled, and the God of our salvation has been destroyed. The history of saved ones, from ancient Israel until the present-day church, shows a continual capitulation to the temptation to forsake God for other lovers. End quote. if you were with us two weeks ago you know that what first captured my attention in this text was not just what God says here not to do and what he says is to not have other gods before him but the energy with which he says it for I the Lord your God am a jealous God we're jealous has a lot of energy we're jealous is emotionally charged and it doesn't seem to soften at all in the second part of the fifth verse, which I did not read yet, visiting the iniquity of the fathers and the children on the third and fourth generations, which simply means this, that your attachment to false gods or other lovers will be passed on. It will have a ripple effect. Indeed, your adulterous liaisons with false lovers or false gods will literally produce children, as it were. Just like physically you pass on genetic similarities, the same thing is true spiritually. That spiritually the things that God is doing in us get passed on from generation to generation. As I kind of reflect on that myself, both physically and spiritually, I'm aware of the fact that genetically I've been given certain things, and so have you, that both enable me to do certain things and limit me from doing other things because of the genetics. You work out, you do certain things, and you try to overcome some of that, and you can to some degree. Spiritually, it is the same. There are spiritual genetics that I have been given, and I'm very grateful for some of the spiritual genetics that have come my way from generation to generation from godly people, but I, like you, also have a lot of spiritual garbage in my life for these idolatries that are part of my family's past, get passed on And the good news, however, around that frightening thing, which would make us all possibly take the posture of a victim, it's not my fault, is this, that the cycle can be broken, that the trend can be reversed. For as we continually, keyword continually, I'm not talking about just when we get saved, but as we, God's people, continually, our whole life long, continually turn to God in faith, We continually break the cycle of sin and death. And that broken cycle gets passed on as well. Verse 6, showing loving kindness to thousands, to those who love him. Back to the word jealous and the energy that's around it. That word is significant, as I indicated a couple of weeks ago, because it reveals somewhat uncomfortably the intensity of God's feelings for us. For I am not willing, it's as if God is saying here, by this word revealed, I am not willing to relate to you only as creator. I am your creator, but I am not willing to relate to you only as redeemer or healer or provider. For I am, among other things, lover. Indeed, I am jealous lover. so that the commandment we see in these verses could accurately be read this way. You shall have no other lovers but me. You shall not worship them or serve them, for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous lover. John Eldridge, in the wonderful book that I, again, mentioned two weeks ago, I understand that the bookstore ordered it. A bunch came in. They were sold last night. There's more coming. If you want to get it, you can do that. I'm not sure where else it might be available. called the Sacred Romance, kind of pulls what I'm trying to say here all together and gives us the big picture with these words. Kind of like a story. Very exciting. God created us, he says, for intimacy with him. When we turned our back on him, he continued to pursue us. All through history, God has sent personal messengers to woo us back to him, prophets, priests, and kings. Sometimes he used beauty to recapture our hearts, and by beauty we would fall in love again. Sometimes he would use affliction to recapture our hearts. Sometimes it worked, often not for long. After all else failed, he conceived the most daring of plans. Under the cover of night, he stole into the enemy camp incognito, the ancient of days disguised as a newborn, while the whole world lay under the power of the evil one. And while we were held in dungeons of darkness to our own idolatry, God risked it all to rescue us. Why? What is it that he sees in us that causes him to act the jealous lover? To lay siege both of the kingdoms of darkness and on our own idolatries. Not to annihilate us, but to win us once again to himself. This fierce intention, this reckless ambition that throws all convention aside, begs a further question. Not just what is it that he sees in us, but what is it that he wants from us? That's the scary question. For a lover who has invested this much may just want something from me. So what does he want? Depends who you ask. Some say that what God wants most is obedience. He certainly does want that. what God wants most is sacrifice, morality, adherence to right doctrine. I certainly think it can be argued that God wants those things. Others, more therapeutic, would argue that what God wants most is our contentment. What he really is after is our happiness and self-actualization. And once again, I do believe that those are things God cares about and is after relative to us, but they are not his primary concern. What he is primarily after, believe it or not, understand it or not, is simply us. Our laughter, our tears, our dreams, our fears, our heart of hearts. God's lament through the prophet Isaiah directed to people who were called his people was this. These people honor me with their lips, meaning they do their duty. They go to church, they read the Bible, they do the religious thing, but their hearts are far from me. And what I wanted from the beginning, from before the beginning, was their hearts. Eldred says about that this, again I quote, how few of us truly believe this. Because we've never been wanted for our heart. Not really. Not for long. never been wanted for our heart. Think about that. I could just kind of buzz on with that and we could act as if we understand. I truly, as I've even grappled with that statement, wonder if we know what that means, to be wanted for our heart. Have you ever wanted anybody else just for their heart, not for what they could do for you or how you felt when you, just for their heart, like you pursued them because you were overwhelmed. You just wanted to know their heart. Have you ever been pursued that way? The fact is most of us have not done it or had it done to us. We get pursued for maybe how we look or what we can do, how we perform. And when you don't look that way, you are discarded. When you can't perform this function anymore for the person who's using you, you're no more use to them. To be pursued for your heart, the thought that God wants our heart seems too good to be true and maybe too frightening to allow. You see, doing my duty, I would be able to do without my heart. That he wants my heart is frightening. Frightening because if God really is what I'm describing here, if God really wants that, if God really is what I described last week as the wild lover, then he is going to want more from me, as I said two weeks ago, than a date once a week on Sunday morning. And he's going to want more than a peck on the cheek. This God is incapable of passively tolerating a rival love. This God is going to call me in love to abandon most of what makes me comfortable. Not for the sake of making me uncomfortable, like God just kind of enjoys watching you squirm. Not for that purpose. But he will call you to abandon what makes you comfortable because most of what makes me comfortable are my idols. Most of what makes us comfortable are our false gods that fit my expectations, that accommodate my desires. See, my false gods that I have fashioned to meet my needs have become my false safe place. And if you were able to, and I'm hoping you're doing your own work on this, identifying in your own life what your false gods are. In fact, I've even hesitated from listing the possibilities because I'd probably miss yours and you'd think, yeah, it wasn't me. It was him. This is your work. This is my work. But whatever your idols are, they are your false safe place. It's where you go to go, I guess I am after all. Other than God. We need to understand at the very beginning, And by that I mean at the very first commandment. That God's desire for a relationship with us and with him involves something more intimate and therefore something more dangerous than clay simply complying to a potter. Something more intimate and dangerous than sheep just following a shepherd, servants obeying a master, children feeling secure in the presence of the Father. We are called in the word of God, ultimately, the bride. Being called as the bride to do something that can be very frightening. And that is this. To open ourselves fully. The imagery is graphic. To open ourselves fully to the life and the love and the power and the sometimes frightening strength of the groom. Who is God. We are lovers who are being called by God to know and to be fully known. Now let me give you some perspective on this, especially this issue of being known and to fully know and to be fully known. While that intimacy will not be fully consummated, knowing and fully knowing, until we see him face to face. 1 Corinthians 13 says that at the marriage supper of the Lamb. Revelation talks about that. The courtship, the engagement has begun. I am my beloved's, and he is mine. In fact, this is another kind of analogy I need you to enter into as you kind of get the whole wonder of this redemptive story. It's really what we're talking about these last couple of weeks is the story of God with us. Ephesians chapter 1 talks about the Aroban of the Spirit. The Aroban is the seal or the engagement ring. And do you know what the engagement ring is? That promises we're going to be married, we're going to have this relationship fully consummated. The engagement ring is the Holy Spirit. The presence, the life of the Holy Spirit within you means he's already invaded you. It's the engagement. Now, another thing you need to understand is that in biblical days, people who were engaged were not married, but they were as good as married. The promise was secure. They weren't going to break up. When Mary and Joseph were with child with Jesus, remember that? Mary was betrothed to Jesus. Betrothed to Joseph. Just fix all these mistakes by yourself. I'm going to keep going. get the characters right yourself I'm just actually I'm just checking to see if you're paying attention they were as good as married there was a covenant that took place between them that was not going to be broken our relationship as the bride of Christ is this right now that we are the betrothed he is my beloved and I am his one day that will be fully consummated at the marriage supper of the Lamb. And even that analogy is amazing. It's a marriage supper. It's the reception, and it's going to be consummated, and then we will know and be fully known. But until then, the bride, you and I, are preparing ourselves to live as the bride, to become more and more aware that he is the center of my life, so that when that face-to-face thing comes, I'm really ready for that. I've been kind of living as the bride already. all of that that I just said to you explains not just what God says here not to do don't have other lovers what I just explained what I just explained explains the energy with which he says it because from before the foundation of the world this has been for God a love affair a tumultuous love affair quite frankly Philip Yancey pointing out the tumultuous nature of God's love affair with his people says this and I quote reading the prophets is like hearing a lover's quarrel through an apartment wall have you ever heard that kind of thing going on like if you're in a hotel or through an apartment wall you just hear they're just kind of going they're really going at it and it's A little embarrassing. I don't want to hear that, but it's very revealing. Hear the heart of God for his bride, his people revealed in Jeremiah chapter 2. I long to be gracious to you. You are honored and precious in my sight. But you're like a swift she-camel running here and there. You're like a wild donkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing the wind in your craving. In your heat, how on earth can I restrain you? Any male pursuing you need not tire themselves. You're easy. This is God talking. He's really angry. Here then is hard again. Right after that, yet I delight in you. I delight in you. As a bridegroom rejoices over his bride. If you return, if you come back, I will receive you. I will heal you. I will love you. And I will love you better than those other lovers. but I will not share you. And what's really amazing, as we listen to that quarrel, if you will, between the apartment one from the apartment next, as it were, what's really amazing is that not only in that word can you hear the anger of a jealous lover, but you can also hear the pain. For idolatry is not just the breaking of a rule. don't break that rule make sure you don't have any statues it's much bigger than that idolatry is the wounding of God's heart it is the betrayal of love why don't you think about that that the God of the universe desired and therefore designed a relationship with his creation wherein the possibility existed for his love to be betrayed for his heart to be wounded here's my question around that why on earth would an all-powerful God put himself in that position of vulnerability? Why would he do that? Why would he allow himself, this all-powerful God to be so affected by me? By you? Here's why. Because from before the foundation of the earth what he wanted was a love affair and for the romance to be real The possibility had to exist for us to reject him. And so he made us free. And his giving us freedom to reject him is one of the first glimpses we get of God's heart being good. Philip Yancey, once again, in a wonderful book called Disappointment with God, put this helpful spin on what I'm trying to say right now by saying this. Power can do everything but the most important thing. It cannot control love. In a concentration camp, the guards possess almost unlimited power. By applying force, they can make you curse your family. They can make you renounce your God, work without pay, eat human excrement, make you kill and then bury your closest friend. All this is within their power. Only one thing is not. They cannot force you to love them and to then, by love, serve them. Stop right there and think about that. God's design is that we serve him, but not by force, by love, and you can't force love. He goes on to say this. This fact may help explain why God sometimes seems so shy to use his power, even when secretly we wish he would. For his most impressive and frightening displays of power do nothing to foster love, only compliance. God's problem is not that God is unable to do certain things. God's problem is that he loves. Love has complicated the life of God. The reason he doesn't make puppets is because he wanted lovers. Last time I concluded my talk with a question that I would like to raise again. The question is this. Are you ready for a relationship with a God like this? Ready is the wrong word. Because there's a way in which if you really hear this, the answer might even be, no, this is a little too scary for me. I'd rather he just be the master, I'd be the slave, I'll keep the rules. But this kind of intimacy and opening of myself to this wild love of God is a bit much. Let me change the word in. Do you have anything in you that would desire this? Even as we've talked about this over the last couple of weeks, Has anything come into your nostrils that you've smelled of intimacy and passion that has at least piqued your interest? That maybe there's more than I've known about or experienced. Past the relationship of clay to potter. Maybe there's something past the relationship of sheep to shepherd and I'm just supposed to follow. Maybe there's something more than servant to master and I'm just supposed to obey. Maybe there is, in fact, something more than child to parent, and I'm just supposed to feel good in his accepting presence. Although all those things are incredible. Maybe there really is this bride and groom thing. Any taste that you've experienced for that? The answer in your spirit is yes. Understand that the groom who is calling you as his bride is going to want more again than a date on the weekend. and a peck on the cheek. This groom is going to call you from everything false that you take comfort in. This groom is a groom who is going to come on really strong, having had you in his heart from before the foundation of the world. But that produces a problem, introduces a problem, this coming on strong thing. If you have ever been hurt or betrayed by someone who, like this, is coming on really strong or came on really strong with promises of love and life, but didn't love you. They just wanted to use you to fill their needs, so they promised you all sorts of things. If you've experienced that at any level, and I don't know a person in this room who hasn't at some level, then this kind of call scares you a little bit. and if you are afraid of this then two issues need to be settled for you before you can fully open your heart to the wild love of God there are two issues I mentioned last time but did not elaborate on them the two issues are these can God really be trusted and is God really good I've got to settle those things if I'm going to open up to this kind of call. Now, even as I ask those two questions, is God good and can he be trusted? Understand this, that God's primary rival for your affection, Satan, has a ready answer to that question and he's whispering it to some of you right now. In fact, you may not even need to be whispering anymore. It's just inside of you. The answer to the questions is this, no. God can't be trusted. No, he isn't good. If God was good, would that have happened? If he was trustworthy, would you be sad? Would you feel pain? And believing him, out of woundedness, we close our hearts to the wild love of God and settle for something more tame, like maybe religion. Eldridge, again, in this book, Sacred Romance, says this about that. The core of Satan's plan is not found in tempting us with obvious sins like shoplifting or illicit sex. Those things are things he uses as maintenance strategies. His grand tactic is to separate us from our heart of trust. Through wounds we have received, he calls life's arrows. I don't have to explain the arrows. The arrows are simply painful situations in your life, and every person here has arrows in their heart. Some of the arrows you have, you have identified. Some of the arrows you have are there, and you don't even know where they came from anymore. But every time a certain thing happens, You, involuntarily, you react. Most of all, you cover up. Satan's job is to accuse God to us and us to God. He weaves a story, and he reinterprets our pain to make God our enemy. He calls good evil and evil good, and constantly helps us question whether God has anything good in mind at all for us. Among his greatest victories is when he can replace the wild love affair with a religious system of do's and don'ts. Which, by the way, is simply another form of idolatry. A religious system that is limited to do's and don'ts is simply my false safe place. As long as I do the do's and don't do the don'ts, I'm okay. What God's calling you to is bigger than that. That is not God. His greatest victory is when we will lend to that, and that system of do's and don'ts parches our hearts, reduces worship to entertainment. Satan convinces us that good is synonymous with nice. Like the required behavior at Aunt Susie's parlor on a summer afternoon. when you'd rather be swinging from a rope at your favorite swimming pool. Satan convinces us that there's nothing really good. There's nothing wildly good at all. And if there is anything wildly good, it's deadly dull. So don't go there. Our experience of life then deteriorates from the passion of a grand love affair to my endless series of chores and errands, duty and busyness that separates me from God, from other people, and even from my own thirst. As I think about that last statement, separating me from my own thirst, what occurs to me about me is I spend a lot of energy making sure I don't feel any thirst. And one of the best ways to avoid your own thirst is just to stay, really, really, busy. Maybe even doing things for God. You won't ever get thirsty. Just keep going. I have a dear friend recently spoke to her. She had tears in her eyes and she had quit a job that she had. And big deal. It was the second job. She had a career kind of job and she had this other job on the side. And it was a fun job. She just loved this job. And she, with tears in her eyes, said, I quit that thing. And I said, why? She goes, well, it finally dawned on me that the real reason I had that job was that its value to me was that it just kept me frantically busy. And I loved being busy because I never had to face my stuff. She did something incredibly heroic. She quit on purpose doing something that she knew she was doing to make sure she never felt her thirst, knowing that when she quit doing it, she would start to feel her thirst. Who does that? Heroes do that. She entered into what is called the hero's journey, where when she gets in touch with her thirst because she's even slowed down enough and walked away from a source of life that has no life, Her heart will begin to be able to respond now in a deeper way to the groom. Most of us do one of two things to deal with our pain. Both of them are sins of the heart. The first is this. We anesthetize our heart. And there are many men and women in this room who know exactly what I'm talking about because that is kind of your way. And by the way, it's not just with God that you find your heart kind of shut down, but if it's your way, basically it's affected your whole life. You have not only anesthetized your heart to God, but it's pretty well anesthetized to your wife and to your husband and to your kids and to the world. The value of anesthetizing your heart is that it protects you. But while you may feel less pain, at least the searing kind of pain, you'll also feel very little passion. You've settled for control. You've settled for competence. You've settled for order. And quite frankly, if this is the way you've chosen to go, not because you're a bad person, but this is how you've decided to handle the, quote, arrows of your life, Did you shut your heart down? You've probably even fashioned a God. You didn't know you did it. You didn't do it on purpose. God's just calling you out from this, however. You've probably fashioned a God who highly values your competence. Pat you on the back for it. You've got a God who highly values your control. A clean desk. A perfect house, a spotless garage. People like this embrace formulaic religion that has a three-step solution to every problem. You do your duty, the faithful wife. But your heart is unavailable for a love affair that requires engagement. But in this marriage with God or with even somebody else. You can't be confronted. You know why? Because you do your duty. What do you mean? What do you mean you want more? I went to church. I went to church. I read my Bible again today. I read it every way. I read it every day. You mean you want more? That's all I got. You did your duty. These people honor me with their lips. They did their duty. They just didn't give me their heart. others choose another method to deal with the pain of their life and it's exactly the opposite of anesthetizing your heart others indulge the heart resulting often in some form of addiction this person often feels themselves superior to the one who anesthetizes that anesthetized person is dead, they just don't feel anything I got a zest for life but you're still not going to the source and in your zest for life to have some sort of relief from the parched reality of your tongue you'll drink anything and you go after this and that and this. Again, quote out of the sacred romance. We put our hope in meeting a lover who will give us some immediate form of gratification, some taste of transcendence. Stop right there. There's nothing wrong with wanting a taste of transcendence. You need to know that you were created with a desire by God for transcendence. but we look for a taste of transcendence that will put just a drop of cold water on our parched tongue this taste of transcendence however coming as it does from a non-transcendent source whether it be an affair a drug an obsession with sports pornography or simply living off your giftedness which would be your false safe place has the same effect on our souls as crack cocaine Why? Because the gratification touches us in that heart place that's made for transcendent communion. Without itself being transcended, it attaches itself to our desire with chains that render us captive. End quote. What he's talking about there is addiction, which is just another word for idolatry, which is just another word for spiritual adultery. The problem with indulgent hearts is this, that our indulgence, as anyone in this room who does this knows, leaves you empty. Not only empty, but then primed for the next round of thirst-quenching activity in an endless cycle that Solomon called vanity. And the reason he called it vanity was because he experienced it. I will refuse myself nothing that I see. And he ate it all. And he drank it all. And after he did it all, it's empty. It's vanity. There is no life here. False safe places. I want you to do some work with me around this issue. And imagine just for a moment something that may strike you as very odd. But imagine this, what it must feel like to God to be married to you. To be married to me. Well, sometimes, undoubtedly, his experience of being married to us must be like being married to a legalistic controller who's anesthetized her heart. And one of the things that occurred to me about thinking of what it would feel like to be married to someone like that, I had the oddest feeling toward God. It was like, how sad for God. How lonely it must be to be passionately in love with someone who's shut their heart down and they are either incapable of or unwilling to open themselves up. How lonely to be in a marriage like that. And the wife, the bride in this context who's shut it all down would get defensive. I'm quite sure I would. I'd do my duty. I go to church, I read the Bible, I behave well I recognize that there are certain duties required of marriage And I will do them But let me tell you what I will never do These words never come, but this is the reality of life Let me tell you what I will never do I will never expose or open my soul To the life and the love and the strength And the sometimes frightening power of the groom Why? Because in my heart of hearts, I'm still not sure I trust that he's good. And I'll sing the song, Trust and Obey. I'll sing the song, and I'll even preach a sermon on trust. But when this closed-off thing simply means, you know, and you know what? It's not a shame thing. This is not, yes, so stop. If you're shut down, it's because you've had pain. The same bride would say, I love him. I can't even imagine living without him. But I'm still afraid. And the heart of God says to that bride, I'm going to continue to pursue you. And I want you to come. I want you to exert some courage to believe that maybe, just maybe, I am good and I can be trusted. other times sad to say God's experience of being married to us must feel like being married to a harlot whose heart is seduced from God by every scent in the evening breeze and we become as it were the exotic dancer on one hand or the religious fanatic on the other wouldn't God like the religious fanatic another false safe place. We become the alcoholic or the adrenaline freak or we become the prostitute with a man or the man with a prostitute or we become the eloquent pastor who can seduce with words or the beautiful woman who can seduce with her looks. Beloved, I hope you've caught this. And I hope, quite frankly, that this word hasn't helped you. identify all your idols, but it has invited you into a process where you can do that work. For this call by God from idolatry is a call to life. To take the risk and begin the journey, as it were, of releasing all your false protections that anesthetize your heart. And I need to even back off all your false protections. You'd probably die if you released them all. You don't even know what they all are. I'm inviting you into a journey of a love affair. How many of you have been married 20 years? Five of you. No, a bunch, a few of you. I've been married 24 years. I can honestly say that my wife and I have experienced a love affair. After 24 years, however, and we're even doing some things right now in our marriage that is intentionally driving us deeper into intimacy and therefore facing some yucky things about our previous 24 years. When I married her, I loved her. I loved her with all my heart. And we started on this journey. So 24 years later, I look back on how I loved her 24 years ago, and I honestly wonder if I loved her at all. It was all about me, I promise you. Not hard to believe. It was all about me. It was all about me. The ways I've had to come to grips with how I've used her and she me has been painful. But every time we noticed that and repented of that, we went to a deeper level of intimacy. Can I invite you into that process in your love affair with God? All of your faults, you don't even know what all of them are. To enter into risking false protection and then to abandon the futility of an indulged heart. And in the middle of it all, begin the journey because you're just beginning to believe that maybe God really is good. And maybe he can be trusted. And maybe in him there is fullness of joy. This call from idolatry is more, I think you've heard, than a call to fidelity. it's more than a call to one God it is that but in fact it is a call to intimacy intimacy that will produce fidelity wherein you and I begin more and more to fully open our heart and open our soul to the life and love and strength and sometimes frightening power of the groom even Christ. Here's the bottom line. For this kind of adventure and this kind of experience of love, you and I have been created. And I even, I'm going to go on, I think that for most of you, if you're following me, there's something stirring in you that even if you don't believe it right now, and even if you're a little scared of it right now, there's something stirring, if this guy's right, it is what I would want. Frederick Buechner says it this way and I close with this repent and believe that the gospel is true turn around and believe that the good news that you are loved by God is better news than we have ever dared to hope and that to believe in that good news to live out of it and to be in love with it and to be in love with the author of it is of all glad things in this world, the gladdest thing of all. Every time I preach, I ask God for a word in terms of closing. What do you want to do? Sometimes I don't know, and so you just preach and God does what he does. Significant things, I think. I didn't know last night this morning what I got was that what I think God wants to do for some of you is to bring some healing to some anesthetized hearts hearts that have become anesthetized not because you're bad or evil but because you like all of us have been wounded and what you chose to do with that is to just shut it down what you need is some healing you know what else you need though? and I can't just give you need some courage you need some courage to risk beginning to release the false protections that you know what they are another thing God said to my heart that he wants to do is offer forgiveness to some indulged hearts because for some of you who struggle with addictions and have run to false safe places through indulgence the problem you will have in returning to the groom is wondering if the groom even wants you I've been the prodigal, some would say I've been eating with pigs and I can't imagine the groom would take me back if you're wondering about that, go read the book of Hosea go read the book of Hosea and hear the heart of God through Hosea, speak to Gomer I want you back, I want you back I'm not going to accept this behavior but I want you back. He receives you with amazing grace and he washes you clean. There is healing for anesthetized hearts. There is forgiveness for indulged hearts. I'd like you to stand as we close. I'm going to pray and we will dismiss. I'm going to ask the altar team to come even as I pray. Lord, I ask, as I close, what I asked when I began, that by the power of your spirit, you would do what my words have no power to do, and that is to call your bride to yourself. I pray that anesthetized hearts among us would by your spirit be awakened. I pray that indulgent hearts would by your spirit be called back from their false safe place to the groom who for them has forgiveness and grace and cleansing and life. I thank you that you love us and that you are ceaseless in your pursuit of us. Empower us to be your bride. Set us free to be your bride. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
