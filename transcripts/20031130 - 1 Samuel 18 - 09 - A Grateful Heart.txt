Let's pray. May your praise be continually in my mouth, in our mouths. I thank you for the spirit that has been on this weekend of gratitude. reflected in the worship, reflected now in the word as we go to this place of a grateful heart. Do that work of gratitude deep in us and help us partner with you in it. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen. Last week, in what we've been referring to for several weeks as a journey of the heart, we visited a place on that journey, unpleasant, that we identified, in fact, as dangerous, even evil. It was the dangerous reality of a shriveled heart that manifested itself, according to 1 Samuel 18 in a hate-filled, murderous heart, born of an envious, jealous heart, embodied in a man named Saul, who was in 1 Samuel 18 the king of Israel, whose bitter jealousy and envy of David that we examined in detail last week brought a kind of madness to his soul. Saul, having started well, he was a great warrior in his youth. He was a great and humble, actually, king. But in the end, he was tormented by depression, driven by a pathological jealousy, alienated from his family and his friends. His envy had devoured him. But that's what envy does. It devours people. Peter Kreeft in his book, Back to Virtue of Envy, says this, that envy, though not necessarily the greatest sin, may be the only sin that gives the sinner no pleasure at all, at least on the surface of things. Indeed, envy may be more dangerous to the envier than the envied, for it consumes their life and devours their soul. We saw that in Saul last week. Ultimately, removing all capacity for joy. Here's why. Because envy is the opposite of gratitude. And gratitude is the seedbed of joy. Really? Really, Craith says. In fact, a person without gratitude is an ex-human, a proto-demon, which means that every moment of our lives is an invitation to humanity. That is, to gratitude. Every day we are confronted, he says, with the half-full, half-empty glass. For the fact is this, our lives are finite, never fully filled, never fully empty. So we daily get invitations to be grateful for the glass half-full or resentful, ungrateful, and bitter for the glass half-empty. End quote. making this issue of gratitude or ingratitude and its connection to envy that we visited last week much more significant than I knew last week. I want to talk this Thanksgiving weekend about gratitude and ingratitude. Apostle Paul in Romans 1 goes so far as to say this, that ingratitude is a sign of apostasy. Sounds a bit extreme. Romans 1 verse 21. For though they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks. Whatever else they were in their apostasy, in their journey to apostasy, they were ungrateful. That's why the writer of the book of Hebrews in chapter 13 verse 5 says this. Let your character, stop right there, the word character is significant. The Greek word is tropos. We get the word tropics. It speaks to climate, environment, temperature. Now rendering the verse this way. Let the environment, climate, or temperature of your life, of your heart, be free from covetousness, be free from envy, be free from ingratitude. Why? Because of what those kind of environments, those kind of climates and temperatures have a tendency in people's hearts to grow. and what those kinds of temperatures, covetousness, envy, and ingratitude has a tendency in the human heart to kill. Climates create environments where things can grow, where things will die. We understand that. We live in Minnesota. There are certain things in Minnesota that cannot grow. Not too many palm trees here. Do you know why? It's too cold. They die. We have a climate that kills those things. But there are other things in Minnesota that grow quite well. Do you know why? Because the climate here in Minnesota is just right. It is absolutely perfect for mosquitoes the size of small birds to grow. The temperature of your heart has capacity to grow things. The temperature of your heart right now has capacity to kill things. Never heard of a cold heart? You know what a cold heart does? It kills things. It kills relationships. It kills marriages. I want to talk this morning about what an ungrateful, envious heart can grow in you. I want to talk about what an ungrateful, envious heart can kill in you. I want to talk about how ingratitude can blind your eyes to what you have, How it can sour your spirit, steal your joy, destroy your life, much like it did Saul, who we studied last week. But I want to talk about all that stuff by bringing you to a different place than Saul. I want to remind you this morning of a story and a people that I'm assuming is a story and a people that you're quite familiar with, even if vaguely so. You know about the people of God and the wilderness wandering in Exodus chapter 14. These are a people, and I'll tell you the story, who had a lot of reasons to be grateful, but they weren't. Because no matter what God did for them, how he provided for them or protected them, it was never enough. It was never enough. creating in them a kind of blindness to what they had and who they were, who God was, a kind of blindness that stole their joy. It soured their spirit. Eventually, it cost them their life. Pretty extreme. I'm going to tell you, this ingratitude cost them their lives. It killed them. Let's pick up the story in Exodus chapter 14. If you have your Bibles, you can turn to that and follow along. Exodus 14, where the people of God, to set the context, had just gotten what they'd always wanted, what they'd been praying for for years. They got freedom from Egypt, and they were very happy, full of joy, and grateful to. We are so grateful, they said, as they left Egypt. But whatever gratitude they had, it didn't last long. Because Pharaoh changed his mind about letting the people go and began to chase them down, intending to recapture them and kill them if he could. And with Pharaoh behind them, the Red Sea in front of them, their first response to this dilemma was angry sarcasm and bitter complaint. There was not a trace of faith or hope or love or confidence that the God who did would. Instead, they came to Moses with these words in chapter 14, verse 11. is it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us here to die why have you dealt with us this way bringing us out of Egypt we told you we didn't want to leave it would have been better to have served the Egyptians as slaves than to die here in the desert then Moses said to the people in verse 13 I think with amazing patience don't be afraid he said stand by and see the salvation of the Lord which he will accomplish for you today for the Egyptians who you see today, you will never see again forever. Verse 21, then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the waters parted. And then in subsequent verses, the people walk across on dry land. Pharaoh chases after them. The waters return and cover the chariots and all of his army is dead. Verse 30 then says this, thus the Lord saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians and all of Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. Chapter 15, verse 1, their response. Then Moses and the people were so grateful and they began to sing and speak this song to the Lord saying, we will sing unto the Lord for he has triumphed gloriously, the horse and rider, everybody. Scary, isn't it? They were so happy. They were so grateful. for having been delivered, for participating in this incredible provision and protection from God. They were so grateful for about 10 minutes. Actually, it was three days, to be fair to them. For three days later, in chapter 15, verse 23, there was trouble with the water. The water was bitter, and immediately, that's the key, immediately, verse 24, the people grumbled at Moses. Wouldn't you love to be Moses? The people grumble, Moses, this is your fault. What's the deal? Where's God? Where are we going to drink? We're all going to die. So Moses cried out to God in verse 25, and the Lord said, see that tree Moses, throw it into the water. So he threw the tree into the water. Very weird story. You ought to study it sometime. I have no idea what it means. the point of the story is this God turned the bitter water sweet and they were so grateful for about 10 minutes you know this cycle of thinking you'll be grateful if you get this and you are but not for long that cycle reminds me of a story John Orper tells two parents of a 7 year old kid who pester his parents A seven-year-old kid pastors his parents for the toy of his dreams, promising, Mom and Dad, if you buy this toy for me, I will never ask for anything again, and I will be grateful for the rest of my life. That sounds like a good deal to the parents. They kind of do the math there. Okay, if we give him this toy, he'll never ask for anything again. We're going to save a lot of money, and he'll be grateful for the rest of his life. And like any wise parent would do, they buy the toy. Sounds like a good deal. Amazingly, when they buy the toy, it works. This little boy is grateful for the rest of his life, in spite of the fact that some very problematic things come into his life, especially later in his life, including his wife leaving him and his kids blaming him for his wife leaving him and his boss firing him and his best friend swindling him out of his retirement money. But it's incredible. He never complains. He never does. He is grateful for the rest of his life because when he was seven, he got that toy. How many of you know it doesn't work that way? We all know that. Because all of us know, don't we? That gratitude has very little to do with external circumstance. We all know that. We all know that gratitude has very little to do with what we have accomplished or what we have acquired. Right? All of us know that. I mean, you have to be a kid not to. I mean, Saul himself was exhibit A of that very reality. He was the king of Israel. That's pretty good. It wasn't enough. So power isn't going to be enough. We all know that. Saul stood head and shoulders above the rest of Israel. If I was physically strong and bigger than everyone else, that would be enough. I would be grateful for the rest of mine. That wasn't enough for him. He accomplished a lot. He killed his thousands. It was never enough. We all know this. But in terms of how we live, many of us, maybe I should say most of us, operate with what I would call the when-then lie. The when-then lie goes like this. It's when I believe this, that when I can change this circumstance or when I acquire this possession or accomplish that goal, then I will be happy and then I will be content and then I will be grateful for the rest of my life. But it doesn't work that way. Back to the people of God, Exodus chapter 15. Let me put together the picture. God had broken the power of Pharaoh. He brought them out of Egypt. He pushed back the water so the people of God could walk across on dry land. He brought the water together, defeated utterly Pharaoh and all of his army. He brought provision. He brought protection. He brought the promise that he would never leave them or forsake them. I will be with you. In a pillar of cloud by day, in a pillar of fire by night, he turned their bitter waters sweet. You'd think they'd be grateful for the rest of their lives. But three verses after, three verses after, he turned the bitter waters sweet. We read these words in chapter 16, verse 2 of Exodus. and the whole congregation, take that in, the whole congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron and said, would that we had died in the land of Egypt when we sat by the pots of meat, when we ate bread to the full, you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger. Verse four, then the Lord said, it's amazing what the Lord says here. Then the Lord said, and you need to know, notice what he didn't say. He didn't say go to hell all of you. He didn't. Listen to what he said. He said I will rain bread down from heaven on you and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every single day. Every single day. And I will do this whether they walk in my instruction or not. No strings on this. I'm just going to provide for you one way or another. and they were so grateful. They really were. They did dances in the streets. When that manna came, they were so grateful. It says it tasted like wafers and honey. They were so grateful for about 10 minutes when they got bored with the manna. You can sympathize with this. I would get bored of it. All they had was manna burgers and manna cotti and manna cream pie. You know, I mean, after a while. I'm sorry yeah yeah yeah it's kind of a groan not good? no I think it was fine whatever you know often you get to use these stupid pastor jokes like that not often actually you're sitting there going you do them all the time it's really something to react to other people's ingratitude it's irritating I hear their story and I go what does the matter with those people I don't, I like doing that and I can spot it in other people I hate looking in the mirror I got some advice, don't look in the mirror because it's all over us this ingratitude it blinds us to what we have it sours our spirit it steals our joy in fact as i think all of us would acknowledge and agree that ingratitude grumbling and complaining is a bad thing in fact i think most of us would put it in the category of an irritating thing again what also especially when we're seeing it in other people i think parents can can really relate to kids who are grumbling and complaining and it's like it just it just drives you crazy some of you have in your workstation at work. I've seen it and there's a little piece of paper and there's a word whine, W-H-I-N-E, with a circle and a line through it, like no whining zone. If you're a whiner, get away from me. I think we see it as irritating. We recognize it as a bad thing. I don't think we fully grasp, however, how beyond irritating, dangerous it is, or the capacity that it really does have, an ungrateful spirit really does have to blind your eyes, to sour your spirit, to steal your joy, to literally, I'm not kidding, destroy your life. Destroy your relationships, your marriage, your career, kill you. The Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 10, speaking a corrective to the Corinthians was using these people in Exodus as an example to them of what not to do, of what they needed to be called from. And Paul in 1 Corinthians 10 verses 6 to 10 identifies the five great sins of the people in the wilderness. And he identifies these five things as the things that laid them low in the desert. The five are these. They were craving evil things, Sexual immorality, idolatry. Fourth was willful defiance to God and grumbling. As being among the reasons that they died in the desert. Here's why they died, Paul said. These five things. What's amazing to me, and this is going back to this ingratitude. We see it as irritating. A grumbling spirit is irritating. I'm telling you it's dangerous unto death. Because Paul himself puts this ungrateful grumbling right up there with idolatry, sexual immorality, willful defiance to God. Why? Because it leads to death. Where do you get the death thing? Exodus 16, verse 34. It says they died in graves of craving. I mean, I'm a very visual person, so I literally see somebody in a grave, and even as they're dying, they want more. the craving thing, no matter what God did, no matter what they had, it was never, ever, ever enough. Their cravings blinded their eyes to what they had, to what God had done. Their cravings soured their spirit, stole their joy, destroyed their lives. they died in graves of craving. We're not much different. Robert Hughes, in his book entitled The Culture of Complaint, says this, we live in a society where people perceive themselves as to be, where people perceive themselves to be entitled to have all of their desires fulfilled and fulfilled right now. When that doesn't happen, they view themselves as victims, he says. We live in a culture of complaints and it has formed and shaped our minds and hearts, end quote. And if we slip into that mode, this culture of complaint, which is very easy to do because we live in a culture that encourages it, if we slip into that mode, we run the risk of spending our entire lives waiting for some circumstance, something, or someone to come along who can finally give us a good enough reason to finally be grateful. But I have a word for you. If you're in that mode, it will never come. It will never happen. And you will die in a grave of craving. Devouring your whole life long. Devouring things and people. I'll devour you. You didn't meet my need. You're not satisfied. I'll get rid of you. I'll devour someone else. Mad at God, never enough. The time I have left, let me give you four things about gratitude or ingratitude that we need to know or be reminded of because some of these things are not new at all. Actually, there are four questions that can be summarized in four words. The four words are these. Who, when, what, how? The first is who. Who do I, do you believe is responsible for the gratitude level of your heart? The reason I ask that question is this, because if the answer to that question for you is someone or something other than you, I can pretty much promise you that you're going to have a very, very long wait before you have a heart that is characterized by gratitude or joy. sad fact is this that many people live as though the circumstance or person responsible for their gratitude or joy is someone else or something else it's their boss or their spouse or their teacher or their kids or their friends or their career or their finances here's the deal because gratitude and joy are so important to life we cannot afford to put our gratitude and our joy into the hands of another person you can't do it we cannot afford to put our gratitude and joy into the hands of some fickle circumstance even a tragic circumstance do you know that it really is possible it really is possible to suffer loss to be disappointed to deeply grieve and still be grateful it is possible in fact if you reflect on that just a little bit sometimes it is by suffering loss and going into grief that we become grateful now I don't know about you but I can just this whole journey of the heart it's about journey it's about my journey it's about your journey and I notice seasons in my journey where I just find myself acquiring and I'm getting and I'm accomplishing and I'm kind of winning you know when I get into that I have a tendency to sometimes want more I just like this a lot, more and then I'll run into a season where that stuff just starts getting cut off where you lose this or you lose that or you can't manipulate that or you can't control that and you lose it and all of a sudden you get brought up and it's not until then that you see that you were trying to get your life from something that never had a chance to give it and all of a sudden you look around and you start noticing the things that really matter to you and you come up grateful in the loss I wish you could have all been here Thursday morning here at Open Door for our Thanksgiving service I'd invite you to come back next year for our Thanksgiving service we had a wonderful time among the things we did at one point we opened up the mic and people came and they were told to keep it short and they all did so that a lot of people could share but you know typical for Thanksgiving it was come and share what you're grateful for come and talk about what you're thankful for. I sat right over here and as I saw these people come, I don't think I'm exaggerating, significantly over half the people began to talk of things they were grateful for in the middle of great loss. They well over half talked about the worst year that they had ever had. And in the middle of the worst year that they'd ever had and the worst news that they ever got, with tears streaming down their cheeks, they spoke authentically of gratitude. As I sat over there, the pastor of this church, this may sound corny, but I was so proud of you. We're becoming a people of substance. As they spoke of their gratitude in the middle of loss, of things not going their way, they spoke of a gratitude that transcended circumstance. this time of year for me and my family is a strange time we revisit some hurtful things it was between november and december about six years ago the three people very dear to me and to my family all died within weeks of each other my father uh my best friend and a friend of our family dave busby and a another very dear friend of ours in chicago that very few of you know but they were She was very dear to us. And so this season, we just kind of get reminded of all those things. And as I think back on that season in our life, when those three people died within weeks of each other, one of the things I remember and our family remembers about that time was this, that right in the middle of that soul-searing pain of separation and loss and death, what really was the unmistakable aroma of gratitude. We weren't grateful that anybody died. But we were grateful, really grateful, for friends who stick around, for a community of faith, for lives well-lived embodied in those three people that we lost, and for a God who at moments like this was hanging on to our hearts so he eventually could heal them. Here's the deal. You can't, we can't afford to put into the hands of a circumstance our gratitude or joy. It's too important. So somewhere along the line, I am responsible for the gratitude level of my heart. It's something inside here as I remember and identify the things that matter most. Second question, when? When is it a good time to be grateful? Well, the scripture says that today would be a good day. Psalm 118 verse 24 says this, This is the day that the Lord has made. I will rejoice and be glad in it. When I was growing up in church, we sang that song. This is the day, right? I never knew it was a verse. I don't want to press this beyond what it should be pressed but I just would do it anyway the verse doesn't say yesterday you know that was a good day we were happy back then and we had reason to be grateful then it doesn't say that and it doesn't say tomorrow you know tomorrow will be better and we'll have reason tomorrow to be grateful So we'll be grateful tomorrow. The problem, again, for many of us, beloved, is that we're waiting for our circumstance to change, and when it does, we will be grateful, but it just doesn't work that way. Two of the most grateful people I know are people who sit right over here, usually on Saturday night. If you know them, you know that I'm not exaggerating when I say that they're two of the most grateful people we know as a church, Paul and Maureen Pranghofer. They sit right over there and they come in wheelchairs, both of them. They've been in our fellowship for many, many years and we enjoy just watching their lives and listening to them and having them part of our community of faith. Maureen has brittle bone disease. It's a disease that we have watched progress in her. I remember when she could walk. I remember when she could see. She can't walk or see anymore. She's in a wheelchair every waking moment of her day. Paul, her husband, was born with no arms and one leg, but he's a wild man in a wheelchair, and if I were you, I'd get out of his way. And I'm not just blowing smoke, and I'm not just trying to exploit them. I just would never do that. If you know them, you know they live a life of grateful joy. it's a confrontation on the culture it's a confrontation on our grumbling let it confront us so let me ask you when is it a good time to be grateful answer today would be a really good day third question what what should we be grateful for Well, the answer to that is going to bug you. It bugs me. Ephesians 5.20 says, Give thanks to God the Father at all times for everything. For everything. Told you it would bug you. Can I just clarify what that means, what it doesn't mean? Everything there does not mean give thanks for a car wreck, give thanks for a disease or a pain or sin. Actually, it's much deeper than that, what Paul is going for here. Because what Paul is after here in this verse, in my opinion, is this, a perspective on life that learns to experience as a gift and to appreciate with wonder what other people take for granted. I'm going to say that again. Giving thanks for everything as a perspective on life that learns to experience as a gift and appreciate with wonder what other people take for granted. It's this season of life when I'm thinking of these people in my life who've died, when I think of someone who lived with a sense of wonder, I think of my dad. My dad was grateful for everything. He wasn't grateful for sin, and he wasn't grateful for a car wreck, and he wasn't grateful. He was grateful for everything. He had a sense of wonder about everything. As kids, he embarrassed us. He did. I'm not making this up. I hope I'm not exaggerating it too much, though I probably am a little bit. But we would go to restaurants, and we were little kids. We would go to restaurants, and my dad would act like this cup of coffee is the best cup of coffee that was ever made. He'd ask the waitress, I'm not kidding, he would ask the waitress, how'd you make this coffee? Is there some special blend? Do you have some special process? What kind of beans do you use? And these eggs, these eggs, they're eggs. when he retired my mom and my mom and dad bought a townhouse in florida because like jerry seinfeld pointed out it's the law when you retire you move to florida so so they moved to florida and they bought a little townhouse and it was nice it was nice and it was in one of those neighborhoods where every single townhouse is the same and theirs was like everyone else's it was nice my brother actually told me the story he was down there my brother and his family was down there and they had moved in fairly recently and he was with my dad out in the front, out in the road, right in front of the townhouse, talking to a neighbor, a couple of neighbors actually, and he was so excited about their new townhouse and he was saying, we have this and we have that and it's so amazing, it's so incredible. And he was so grateful that after a while, neighbors, neighbors in these townhouses that all were the same began to come to my mom and dad's townhouse to try to figure out what they had that none of them else, none of them had. Christmas is coming in just a few weeks, and I can just promise you, in my family, when we open gifts, pretty much, I don't know, everybody is going to begin to open their gifts, and the whole family is going to start doing what my dad did whenever he opened a gift. He'd start opening it, and he'd go, oh, he was grateful before he knew what he got. In my adolescence, you can imagine a 15-year-old boy, good for God, he's the best, you know. We thought he was crazy. In time I've come to discover that he wasn't crazy, he was just grateful for everything. I remember when he died, I have a picture of it in my mind right now, of him lying on the bed, and we weren't sure he was going to die yet, but he was getting sicker and sicker, and instead of better and better, and he would walk in, the nurse would come in, he would take the oxygen mask off, lift his hand, grab their hand and say, thank you for taking care. He would. He was dead. They're supposed to thank him when you're healed. He wasn't grateful for being sick. He wasn't grateful for dying. He was just grateful for everything. Last question. How? How can I be grateful, especially in the light of fill in the blank, of some great loss or some great pain. Well, here's where the practice of what Karl Barth refers to as defiant gratitude comes into play. I think it's best described in Habakkuk 3, verse 17 to 19. You don't have to look that up. It'll be on the screen. It says this. Though the fig tree should not blossom, And there be no fruits on the vines. Though the yield of the olives should fail and the fields produce no fruit. Though the flock should be cut off from the fold and there be no cattle in the stalls. Yet I will exalt in the Lord. And I will rejoice in the God of my salvation. And that is what's called defiant gratitude. Let me just say something to you. important. Understand this. Gratitude in this life will always be in spite of something. How many of you know that worship at times is an act of defiant gratitude where you stand here in the congregation of people who are attempting to know God and love him and serve him. You stand and you sing this kind of song. Though the fig tree should not blossom, though no fruits be on the vine, though my heart today is broken and my future is unclear, on this day, in the company of these people, I will exult in the Lord. And I will declare his faithfulness to generations. And I will rejoice in the God of my salvation. Oh, yes, I will. That is defiant gratitude. And it takes a bit of fight to do it. It's called a battle for your heart. and so this battle for the heart sometimes includes a battle to remember and to declare the things that really matter the things we really love the things we really have to have for life for joy for gratitude and the reason we're going to fight for this and I want to call you to this fight is this, because an ungrateful heart, which by the way requires no fight at all, anybody can do an ungrateful heart. It's real easy. The reason I'm calling you to this fight of a grateful heart is because an ungrateful heart will blind your eyes, will blind your eyes to what you have. An ungrateful heart will sour your spirit. It will steal your joy, it will destroy your life, which makes this a battle of life and death for this grateful heart. And so we say, God, help us here. Let's pray as we close. and so I pray God help us me here I'm affected by how easily ingratitude rises in me a sourness of spirit a blindness of I to who I have, to what you've done. Maybe an appropriate response would be to repent, to remember, to fight to remember. Lord, we desire as we continue this journey of the heart that we've been on for quite a while, as we visit this place of gratefulness, that it would be more than just this place we take pictures of on our way to something else, but that, Father, by your Spirit, you would build in us, you would call us to this spirit of gratitude that allows your people to live in joy, allows even the gospel to look as attractive as it is. do these things among us by the power of your spirit and our cooperation with it in Jesus name Amen as is always the case the altar team is here for anyone who needs prayer for anything at all God bless you as you leave and if the Vikings lose don't complain God bless you Thank you.
