We are entering our fourth and final week in a study of 1 Corinthians chapter 14, but it is specifically a study of the gift of tongues as it is to be functioning in the body of Christ. And let's just read the text and then get to it. What is the outcome then? He's gathering his thoughts together after he's rebuked them for their misuse. When you assemble, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification. If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two or at the most three, and each in turn, and let one interpret. But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the church, and let him speak to himself and to God. And let two or three prophets speak, and let the others pass judgment. But if a revelation is made to another who is seated, let the first keep silent. For you can all prophesy, but one by one, so that all may learn and all may be exhorted. And the spirits of the prophets, by the way, are subject to the prophets. I'll explain that by the way later. For God is not a God of confusion, but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints. Let the women keep silent in the church. I'll skip this and just, no. I'll tell you what we're going to do here. I'll tell you what we're going to do here. This is an important passage of scripture. and I'm going to deal with that not today. I just, come on, give me a break. The reason it's so important, the reason I'm going to deal with it next time is because it's so important and I don't want there to be misunderstanding. The title of the sermon this morning is chaos in the congregation. If I would have tried to have dealt with everything that's here, there would have been chaos in the message. There might be anyway, but to tie it in 34 through 36 almost feels like a separate thought. Come down to verse 37 for today. If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you about the order of the gifts in the body, that's what he's dealing with, they are the Lord's commandment. But if anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized. Therefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy and do not forbid to speak in tongues, but let all things be done properly and in an orderly manner. Let's pray as we begin. father this worship time has been for me a real nourishing time quiet and soothing and it's enabled me to break through some things that have been clouding my vision of you and i thank you for it as we come to your word now i pray for the continued work of your spirit lord we are mindful of and i think it's important that when we do this every time we make ourselves mindful of the fact that your spirit does ministry in your body that isn't always connected with even the exact songs we sing or the words that are spoken. And so we invite your spirit to do your work among us as it relates to the text, but God in ways that go beyond the text as well. Do your work among us. Set us free to hear from you. In Jesus' name, amen. As we do enter this fourth and final week, there's some things I want us to be mindful of. One thing in particular. It is simply this. We are dealing with this 14th chapter and we might be coming away with a lot of facts, a lot of information after a long period of time, just kind of pounding away at the need to think and work through this text. But there's something I want us to understand and come away with, and that is this. The real issue that the Apostle Paul is dealing with in the church of Corinth relative to their problem of tongues was not a theological debate as to whether tongues were valid or not. That was not what was going on and that was not what Paul was addressing when he came to this church. I believe, when he came to this issue, I believe that in the church in Corinth and in the mind of Paul, it was already assumed that the gift of tongues was indeed a legitimate gift. When we hear things like, now I wish that you all spoke in tongues, verse 18, that was verse 5, verse 18, I thank God I speak in tongues more than you all, we get the very clear impression, at least I do, that that was not something that they were struggling with. We need to be mindful of that because we also need to be mindful of the fact that that is what we struggle with. When we come to this text, we bring things to it that I don't think the Corinthians ever did. And that is a theological debate before we ever get here as to whether tongues are valid or not. We need to realize that what Paul was addressing here when he came to confront them was deeper than a theology. The issue in Corinth was not tongues. It was a spirit of infancy and carnality, rank immaturity. They were a group of people who were helplessly selfish, totally absorbed in themselves. And if it made them feel good, and if it met their need, that's all they care about. So it was that way back in chapter 11, verse 17, we heard the beginning of this confrontation. The beginning of the confrontation was when Paul said this, When you come together, Corinthians, it is not for the better, it is for the worse. And the evidence of all the things that happen in your midst that evidence the fact that it isn't better when you come together but it's for the worse are some of these things. The Lord's table is defiled among you. The agape feast that was designed by you to be a celebration of your union with Christ and with each other is something that now leaves some people drunk and filled with food so they can't take anymore, and other people hungry and needing some sort of ministry. Another evidence that when you come together, it's not for the better but for the worst, is the fact that in chapter 12, gifts are terribly misunderstood and misused. Not only that, love is neglected among you in chapter 13, and not only that, tongues are exalted to the point where they're almost a little play thing for you, and they make you feel real warm and gooey in your spirit, but there isn't any substance at all. And you add all of that together, Corinthians, and when you come together, it isn't for the better, but it is for the worse. Chapter 14, verse 4 says something very confrontive, I think, to them. One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself. Now, in and of itself, there's nothing wrong with that. You remember that that told us something about the prayer language, that a prayer language does indeed edify me. The problem in the church in Corinth was this. That's all they cared about. Me being edified. You see, when they came together, many things happened, but one of the things, and he's dealing with it here, is that they would kick into their prayer language, have a grand old time, not really give a rip what anybody else thought. And that's what Paul is addressing when he comes to this. You think you're so spiritual, Corinthians, but I think you're acting like spoiled little children. Verse 12, So also you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts, what I really wish you were zealous for was the edification or abounding for the edification of the church. The issue is not a theological debate over whether tongues are valid or not. The issue is over the spiritual infancy that used tongues in a way that did not build anybody up. That is the issue. Let's get back to our study. being that this is the last and final week in this thing and also being that uh this is not the kind of topic we're going to talk about real often we kind of come along this just in the course of our study of the book of first corinthians i want to leave you knowing some things the first thing i want you to remember and make sure you bring with yourself from this study is that we have indeed accepted a foundation and have been building on one and working with one. The first element of that foundation is this. We are operating from a foundation that accepts tongues as a legitimate gift. I'd like you to remember that. That's the foundation from which we are operating. The reason we do that is because the text says it is a legitimate gift. Chapter 12, verse 10. Chapter 12, verse 30. God has placed by the Spirit into the body the gift of tongues for its edification. We are also affirming that that gift will cease. The reason we affirm that is because the text says so. That gift will cease. Chapter 13, verse 8 says that. We also affirm that we even know when that gift will cease. That gift will cease according to the text in chapter 13, verse 10, when the perfect comes. And the perfect is not the finishing of scripture. The perfect that is to come is when I go to be with the Lord or Jesus comes back and brings his church with him and we will then see face to face and it's at that point that none of the gifts will be functional anymore. They won't be needed. Why? Because we will know in full then and we will see face to face and all of the supernatural works will not be needed in order to equip us to do the work of the ministry. We've also been affirming and operating on a foundation that states that we believe there are variety or various forms of tongues. The reason we believe that is because, again, the text says so. In chapter 12, verse 10, and chapter 12, verse 30, it says literally various kinds of tongues in relating the whole issue of tongues. Now, we have been able in the last several weeks to identify two kinds of tongues. One was found in the book of Acts, chapter 2. We've been calling it dialecto. The reason we're calling it dialecto is that's what the text says. It is a discernible language, one that could be understood by those who were hearing it and understanding the language, just as if someone were speaking Russian and a Russian would be able to understand it. We learned last week that the purpose of that particular gift was for a sign to unbelieving Jews that judgment had come. We'll go into that again just very quickly. But there is another kind or variety that we have discovered in the course of our study. and again affirming it now. And that is in chapter 14, where we hear mention of or reference to praying in a tongue, whatever that is. Chapter 14, verse 14. For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. Now you remember the fact that he is confronting them for praying in a tongue, but it wasn't that praying in a tongue was wrong. The problem that the Corinthians had was that they were bringing that language, that prayer language, prayer tongue, into the congregation without interpretation. And the problem was delineated in verse 16, otherwise if you bless in the spirit only, how will the one who fills the place of the ungifted be able to join in with you and say amen? For you are giving thanks well enough, that's a valid thing you're doing, but nobody else is edified by it. So there is a variety. We've also affirmed the fact that there are counterfeits, and we need to be aware of that. We can't be naive concerning that. As we got to the text, we saw the text itself, break into three parts. The first was this, the place of tongues. The place of tongues is clearly, in the first 19 verses, placed by the Apostle Paul in the context of corporate worship into a secondary position. Do you remember that? It is clearly secondary. The reason, or the reasons, were threefold. First, it is secondary because it is limited in its ability to edify. Why is that? The reason it is limited to edify or build the house, is what edification means, to build a house, is because it does not speak to men, it speaks to God. That's a good thing to speak to God and to give that prayer exaltation to God, but it doesn't necessarily edify the church. Prophecy, on the other hand, does do that. So we established that, spent a lot of time. Another reason that it is placed in a secondary position in the context of the body is because tongues are unintelligible. You cannot understand them. And the principle we came away from, by the way, that was verses 6 through 13. The principle we came away from with that is this, that people are not built. People are not made stable by things they don't understand. Verse 8. For if a bugle produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare himself for battle? You might be in the context of worship where everybody's speaking in tongues and it's all sorts of noise. And you might think, wow, isn't this something? God's really moving here. Paul is saying this, that is not God moving. That is chaos. It's a bugle blasting off and it has no value to build the house of God. It's limited to edify. It's unintelligible. And the last one we came to was that it hinders worship. Again, verse 16, the reason that it hinders worship is that if someone who is ungifted and there is no interpreter of what it is that you're saying, giving an interpretation. The one who is not gifted and does not understand what you say can't say amen with you, can't join in with it. And you remember how important that is from our studies before. Amen? Amen. Okay. I was hoping I wouldn't have to go through that again. You didn't forget. Last week was something that was tough. It was a tough study, the purpose of tongues. And if you felt a little bit lost, don't feel like the Lone Ranger. Me too. That was a hard thing to go through. But basically, I believe that when we came to verse 20 through 25, Paul was dealing there with the dialecto kind of tongue. He was dealing with the tongues that were evidenced at Pentecost. The reason I believe that, first of all, was because of verse 20, where he's exhorting them to put their thinking cap on because there's something they need to understand. But then we had this reference to the Old Testament prophet Isaiah speaking to the people of Israel. By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people, even so they will not listen to me, says the Lord. So then, on the basis of that Old Testament teaching, tongues are for a sign. Now, what we discovered was that Isaiah 28 is something right out of Jewish history. In fact, we cited three incidents where God dealt with his people Israel on the basis of judgment. They did not obey. They had been apostate. He warned them that judgment would come, and then he told them something kind of strange. And that is this. The sign that what I warned you about what happened has happened will be when you hear the tongues of strange people. The strange people, the strange tongues, would obviously be the invading forces of another country. But Paul here is tying in this whole thing of strange tongues being a sign of judgment right in, I believe, to Pentecost. And so it was that with Pentecost happening at the Passover in Jerusalem with Jews from every part of the world coming to that point, when they heard the expression of various kinds of tongues, Paul says here, that was for a sign to them. And Gentiles in Corinth, you might not have understood it, But Jews would have, and the sign was simply this, judgment has come to the house of Israel. And that's one of the things that Pentecost was all about. It was a sign of judgment to the unbelieving Israel. The judgment, you remember, was this. Israel, you are no longer God's chosen people. You are no longer the exclusive channel through which I'm going to reach the world. That does not, however, I think you remember, mean that Israel is cut off from the gospel. In fact, at Pentecost, it was 3,000 who? Jews who were saved on that day. It is a sign, first of all, of judgment. It is a sign also of blessing. How is that? Because when God cut off the Jews, he opened the door to the gospel to all of the Gentiles, and that's the whole meaning, and the Corinthians did not understand it. So it is. Now back off of that and just let me give you the thing. The impact of tongues, Corinthians, in your congregation should have an impact on believers of conviction. They should sense judgment. Tongues in the congregation should have another impact on believers, and that is a sense of blessing, that the gospel has been open to us. Corinthians, what happens in your congregation is neither. Why? Because you don't understand its purpose, you don't understand its function, And you don't, when you do it, have any sense of order whatsoever. In fact, in the Corinthian church, when tongues of any kind were evidenced, the impact on both believers who were ungifted and unbelievers who didn't understand what was going on was no work of God at all. Their conclusion was this. Verse 23, I think they're nuts. Get the picture. Back off the whole thing. The picture is you've got a church full of selfish, immature people who got a little gift and they're playing with it like it's a little toy. But instead of understanding its purpose and using it appropriately, they have kind of made it their little god. And as they see themselves functioning that way, they think they're real spiritual. The problem is unbelievers and ungifted believers look at them and think they're mad. Paul looks at them and says, I think you're children. I think you're little bitty babies. And don't be children in your thinking, verse 20. You add all that up and what you have is chaos. How in the world do we work through all that junk and come to something that has some stability and some strength so that we can make some semblance of the mess in Corinth? Let me ask you a question. How would you deal with it? If you saw that kind of stuff going on, how would you deal with it? Let me tell you my answer, what I would deal with it. Stop it. Over. No more tongues. No more prophecy. No more nothing. Sit down. Shut up. I don't want to have any more of that stuff anymore in here. In fact, I'm going to get a theology that says these things don't even exist anymore. I feel real comfortable with that. I don't have to deal with it. I don't have to have any discernment. I don't have to sense or test the spirits to see if someone who might be speaking in tongues in our congregation is indeed doing it born of the Spirit. I don't have to wait for interpretation. I just slam the door on the whole thing. Much to my dismay, Paul didn't do that. Really ticks me off too, because he's made it very difficult for me. Let's look at what he does. Let's look at what he does. Point number three in our outline. Again, this outline, for those of you who are visiting, has taken four weeks to go through. The first point was the place of tongues. The second point was the purpose of tongues. The third one today is the procedure of tongues, verses 26 through 40. Now that breaks down into two things. First of all, in giving the procedure, he first of all restates the problem. And I think that's what he's doing, by the way, in verse 26. This is open for debate. Some people don't think he's doing this, but I do. I think in verse 26, he's restating the problem. Listen to it. What is the out-of-the-day outcome then, brethren, of all this chaos. What the outcome is in your congregation is this, that when you assemble, each one has a psalm. Now, in the Greek, the each one is in the emphatic. Each one, every single one of you, all at the same time, has a different psalm. Now, a psalm is not a psalm like Psalm 32. A psalm is a song. So each one of them would come to church and they'd have a song. And so can you imagine it? They start singing, oh, happy day, and over here, oh, how great they are and over here you know jesus loves me this i know and they're all kind of singing it's really neat all born of the spirit and you boy you can't stop me because the spirit's just moving in me and i got to do what the spirit promised me to do that's bad enough but it's not just that each one of you has a song but each one of you has a teaching too so you got a whole bunch of people singing 150 different songs and then you got a bunch of would-be teachers coming gathering little groups getting whoever it is that they they could get to listen to them telling them all their teaching. On top of that, you got a bunch of people over here who are coming with a revelation. And so you got a whole bunch of people singing different songs, a whole bunch of other would-be teachers grabbing people off and teaching them all these different things. And then right in the middle of all that, every once in a while, somebody's standing up saying this, the word of the Lord came to me saying this to us, and on and on and on. And on top of that, you got tongues happening, and on top of that, you got somebody right behind him standing up saying, I know what he meant. and the unbeliever and the ungifted come into that kind of thing and go you're mad this is chaos and paul says no it's not that they're mad it is that they're children and after he restates the problem he says let all things be done for edification i want to emphasize something here as i start he says this let all things be done let all things be done i like revelation, and I want psalms, and I want tongues, and I want interpretation, but let it be done in a way that is a building way, and not a chaotic way. Let me explain what I mean. And he starts to do that in verse 27. He regulates the use. After he restates the problem, he regulates the use. Again, I just need to make a note of this and put words on this. When we come to verse 27, through the end of this chapter, what he has done, again much to my chagrin, is not eliminated. He has not eliminated tongues. He regulates it. Let's look at how he does it. Verse 27, if anyone speaks in tongues, in a tongue, it should be by two or at the most three in each in turn, and let one interpret. Stop right there. Little nuances to grasp right off the bat. If anyone speaks, one of the little subtle things I want you to get there is this. it isn't necessary that anyone does speak. You can have a powerful time of worship without tongues, believe it or not. But if anyone should speak in tongues, here's how it should happen. He gives three real simple, very clear, easy to understand principles. Principle number one, only two, at the most three. Only two, at the most three. And them in turn. So never, Corinthians, do you have this chaos of everybody doing tongues thinking that's God. If you have everybody doing tongues, it isn't God. Principle number two, them in turn. Okay, I gave you that. Principle number three, and always an interpretation. Now, just giving you all those three principles gives us an ability to confront some things, and it also reveals to us some very helpful things in determining when a tongue is a legitimate thing or not. The first thing I'll draw from those principles I gave you is this. A legitimate gift of the Spirit that is a tongue that is functioning in the congregation can be controlled. Write that down if you're taking notes. It can be controlled. The reason I think that's significant to say is this. Every once in a while, you'll hear somebody come to you and say, oh, the Spirit just moved on me, and maybe they were even confronted because it seemed out of order what they did. And they'll just say, oh, you don't understand. The Spirit just came on me, and I couldn't help but speak, and it just came pouring forth, and I just couldn't have stopped it if I wanted to. And you know, when somebody talks like that, it almost sounds like that must really be a spiritual thing. Boy, when God comes on you, you can't stop it. The problem is this, that if you can't stop it, It doesn't prove that it's God, it proves that it isn't. Think on that. This gift, like any gift, is subject to the control of the possessor. Legitimate tongues are not like pagan ecstasies that are out of control. Not long ago I was watching TV. I don't remember when it was, but I kind of get the feeling I could turn the TV on any time of the day and get something like this. But a TV evangelist was dealing with this crowd of people, and he was getting that crowd of people into what I would call a hallelujah hysteria. You know, they were just going, wham, wham, back and forth, and on and on. And he was really getting fired up. And he began to come to a point where he was talking about the night before, and he was going, Lord, bless it anyway. It's just so wonderful. Last night we had 1,500 people here all speaking in tongues at the same time. The Spirit of God came down and did a work in our midst. 1,500 people. And if the Spirit comes down again tonight, it's going to happen tonight. And everybody's going, Hallelujah! And I'm watching going, Holy cow! This is crazy. Now, I know that Hallelujah is a lot more spiritual than Holy cow. But if my Bible is right, what you've got there is 1,497 people, too many, speaking in tongues all at the same time. well what are you going to do Dave I mean what if the spirit really did move and he did it are you going to limit God to a little box where he doesn't do that you're going to just write that whole thing off as illegitimate yeah I am verse 37 and if you think yourself a prophet or if you think yourself spiritual and you really got a handle on this tongues you just make sure you make sure that you recognize that the things I'm saying to you are not my opinion. They are the Lord's commandment. What is the commandment here then? Two, at the most three, and them in turn, and then with an interpretation. Never chaos. And if you see chaos, and they're trying to say, oh, it's really God, you know it really isn't. You know for sure if there's chaos, it isn't God. I've heard of another group of believers who in an effort to regulate it, in a real sincere effort to regulate it, kind of had it right in the bulletin with everything else. You know, there'd be special music, and Matilda would come and sing accompanied by Henrietta. And right after that, Matilda would speak in tongues interpreted by Henrietta. You know, that kind of thing. It feels a little contrived. But there was an effort there to regulate it. How is it that we regulate it? We eliminate it. See? That's the confrontation on us. Our problem is not the chaos. Our problem that it is, and what I'm saying, if it scares you, join the club because that scares me too. But I and I fought like crazy to try to get this text to just never so we don't have to deal with that. I think we need to deal with that because the gift is not eliminated by Paul it is regulated by Paul and we have to have the courage that if that happens among us and when that happens among us that we find the biblical way to regulate it so that the body can be edified by it. He regulates first of all tongues he regulates second of all prophecy prophecy verse 29 through 33 prophecy is another thing that makes us a little nervous again you know i'm giving you a lot of my nervousness some of you might at all but i kind of come from a background that makes me nervous about this and the way we deal with our nervousness about prophecy and things like this is that we give them very very controllable definitions do you remember when we went through the gifts of the spirit in chapter 12 and we came to the speaking gifts the word of knowledge the word of wisdom and the word of prophecy. And one of the things I shared with you was the gift of the Spirit to the body is this, that the Spirit of God will come to the body and will minister through people to people gifts that they need when they need them. And sometimes it'll come through you, and sometimes it'll come through you, but the dynamic is that we will get what we need. And sometimes it will be a word of knowledge, and sometimes it will be a word of wisdom, and sometimes it will be a word of prophecy. But in our effort to kind of make it controllable and get away from weird stuff, like what I just said even sounds a little weird, we'll give it real natural definitions. Like the word of knowledge everybody knows is a gift that theology professors have. Now, some of you chuckle, but that is something that is taught relative to the gifts in many, many schools of thought. It's a gift that theology professors, and they have knowledge. Problem, knowledge can be acquired. Knowledge is not a bad thing. The gift of the Spirit to the body that is supernatural is the other thing I explain, though. It is the gift that comes when you are involved in ministry and He can give to you words of knowledge, insight into something, just when you need it to help me to need. That's a supernatural gift. And you don't own it. But sometimes it might come through you, sometimes it might come to you. Same thing with the word of wisdom. Wisdom is something you can acquire. Some of you are old and you're wise because you've had experience with God for many, many years. But a word of wisdom, not just insight into a problem, but what to do about it, that's what wisdom is, can come to people who are not particularly wise. That's supernatural. That's a gift to the body. And it happens when we're involved in ministering to each other. Word of prophecy is the same way. You see, some would take the word of prophecy or the regulation of prophecy and make it nothing more than the office of a prophet who is kind of the pastor-teacher and the one who prophesies is the one who teaches all of you what you need to know. You need to explain something. I don't think this passage here is a passage of Scripture that is regulating the office of a prophet or telling pastor-teachers how they ought to teach. Let me say something. Let me explain something. When I teach or when I preach, there is a sense in which what I do is prophetic. A strong sense in which what I do is prophetic. If I am clearly delineating the word of God, then you are hearing God's words to you. That is prophetic. What it is, however, is reiteration. It is reiteration of old truth applied to us so that we know how to respond to it. And it is indeed prophetic. There is, however, another aspect of prophecy. Not just reiteration, but revelation. Now, when I say revelation, we freak out again. Revelation. The Bible is closed. It is already. We don't have any new revelation. There is no new revelation. I agree. When you're talking about doctrine. The problem is this. We went through this when we studied the gift of prophecy. The function of a prophet, Old Testament or New Testament, was never to have revealed to him new doctrine. They never got revelations like that. Doctrine was always established by someone else. In the New Testament, it was the apostles. The revelation that a prophet would get would be a revelation concerning a specific people who needed to hear a specific word from God, the word already being established, what was being brought, was not a new doctrine, but the revelation was that this people needs to hear this message this day. That's prophetic. Get it? When John the Baptist came with his message of prophecy, repent, that was not a new doctrine. That's an old doctrine. The newness of it, the revelation of it, was that this people needed to hear that message at that time. You know what I believe? I believe that God speaks through prophets, sometimes pastor teachers, by the teaching of the Word of God. I also believe that the gift of prophecy is one that functions in the body, and that God can and will, when we let him, speak to his people through his people, and that's you. So what are we supposed to do then if we accept prophecy as something that happens in people? You know, we have pictures of people standing up and saying, Lord told me that you're supposed to do this. What are we supposed to do? Just say, okay, okay, that's what we'll do. No, you're not supposed to do that. That's why prophecy is regulated. That's why Paul regulates prophecy. You don't just accept everything carte blanche. What's the regulation? Well, again, two or three. You don't just do it all at once. And there is a limit on it. You don't spend the whole time with prophecy. Two or three. And then let others pass judgment. What does that mean? That simply means this. If a prophecy comes and the body doesn't affirm it by saying that is exactly what God is saying to us collectively, then it's not a true prophecy. Then it's not from God. And you need to assess it. but see that requires discernment it's easier to just close the door on the whole thing and say this doesn't exist it's not for us first thessalonians 5 19 to 21 says this despise not prophetic utterances and if you do despise them the fact that god can speak through people to us you will quench the spirit so you just accept them when they say them no it goes on in verse 21, and says this, examine everything carefully and then hold fast to what is good. Eliminate the rest. I'll never forget Steve Valentine. He's here this morning. I didn't tell him I was going to do this. I hope I don't embarrass him too bad, but that's tough. When he was about to marry his wife, Cindy, a woman came up to him and told him that she had a word from the Lord. And the word from the Lord was that he wasn't supposed to marry Cindy. He was supposed to marry her daughter. Oh boy, you know, if you're really tied into prophecy, oh, it came from God, we'll have to do it. You don't just accept it. It needs to be tested. It needs to be examined. And if it sets well with how God is leading, then you know it is an affirmation. And I don't think God's ever going to lead you through a prophecy in a direction that he hasn't already been doing. I think, by the way, one of the functions of prophecy in the body is to affirm or to agree with the things we already sense among us. I think we've seen that happen here, where people have stood up and given what we would call prophecies. And there have been, I would say, the majority of them were ones that sat very well with my spirit. Some of them I didn't even understand. And maybe what we need to learn to do is to confront that when we see that and say that's not of God and have the courage to do that. let me say it this way prophecy anytime you hear a sermon anytime you hear a word anytime someone shares something or even you read a book and when you're done hearing the word that was said or the book that was read or the thing that was shared and when you're done with it you think what I just heard was God that was God that's prophecy that's prophecy God speaking through people see I think it happens all the time we just don't always recognize it let me get back to the point of this whole thing paul does not eliminate tongues and he does not eliminate prophecy he regulates it verse 29 just walk through two or three prophets let the others pass judgment if a revelation is made this is not new doctrine okay we're not nobody's standing up and giving new doctrine but if a revelation is made someone has a word from the lord specifically to our body for us, then it just follows through from the one who's been speaking. He would sit down, the other one would give his. For you can all prophesy, but it'll be one by one. Again, confronting their chaos so that all may learn and all be exhorted. I don't want all prophesying at the same time. Nobody gets anything. You might as well all be speaking in tongues. And the reason is because God is not a God of confusion, but of peace as in all the churches of the saints. And by the way, verse 32, the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. So don't you ever tell me that you stood up in church, gave a prophecy, and just kind of come back and say, I just couldn't help it. It just came pouring out. I couldn't control it. Baloney. If you couldn't control it, it does not prove it was from God. It proves that it wasn't. Why? Because the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophet. You can't control it. Verse 39. Therefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and don't forbid to speak in tongues, but let all things be done properly and in an orderly manner. And I will add again what I started with at the beginning, but let all things be done. Let all things be done. If we were speaking this to Corinth, the thing we would emphasize would be in an orderly manner. Here, we need to emphasize, let all things be done. let's pray would you stand with me as we pray one of the things we're learning more and more is that the spirit of God ministers to people in ways that aren't connected with what we said and we just want to leave time open for ministry we also believe that the gifts of the spirit begin to be dispensed when we do ministry and so if people come we're going to invite other people to come and pray believing that as you come and pray God will give you wisdom and knowledge and gifts to minister the spirit of god is speaking to you in any way whether it be for salvation maybe for you're dealing with sin in your life and you need to confess and just deal with that we want you to come could be for healing as well we want the altar to be open let's pray and then dan will will lead us father we just ask that even now as we close your spirit would continue to move among us maybe in another direction not so much in terms of information so that we don't move into abuses of gifts but God that that we would be open and hearing your spirit's voice concerning where we are with you God it could be that some are just so stale this morning and need a fresh touch I pray that they would have courage even to come and and receive gifts from you of encouragement and faith as people would come and pray with them it could be that some are here and they just don't know you at all and you have been working on them and in them for a long time and today is the day to make the commitment and receive their new life in Christ. Give them the courage. Some do need healing and need to be prayed for. And Lord, we just ask that you would give courage to people who need to come to do it. And then people who would come and minister to them in Jesus name. Amen..
