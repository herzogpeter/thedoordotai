Matthew 23, verses 1 through 12. As we return to our study, I want to remind you that we find ourselves at the tail end of an argument that's been going on for an entire day. The argument began early in the morning on Wednesday of the final week in the life of Christ. On Friday, he's going to die. That gives us some perspective. But it happened when Jesus began to return to the temple where he had cleansed it just the day before. And it was because of his return to this scene of the crime, as we've been referring to it, that the leadership of the temple were enraged and indignant. And for about a chapter and a half, they have been literally assaulting Jesus from every conceivable angle in an effort to somehow alienate him from the people and discredit him. In the end, however, he silenced all of them. Verse 46 of chapter 22 says, No one was able, after his answer, to speak a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask him even any more questions at all. But while verse 46 makes it clear that they are finished, chapter 23 makes it clear that Jesus is not. The scene opens for us in verse 1. Picture in your mind that in the courtyard of the Gentiles, the Pharisees are still there. The object of Jesus' teaching in this chapter, at least until verse 12, is the multitude of people who are standing there and the disciples who he is preparing for ministry. And using the Pharisees literally as an object lesson, he begins to teach the disciples and the multitudes what a false spiritual leader looks like. With that in mind, let's read our text. Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to the disciples, again with the Pharisees standing there, saying this, the scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses. Therefore, all that they tell you do and observe, but do not according to their deeds, for they say things and do not do them. And they tie up heavy loads and they lay them on men's shoulders, but they themselves are unwilling to move them with so much as a finger. But they do all of their deeds to be noticed by men, for they broaden their phylacteries and they lengthen the tassels of their garments. And they love the place of honor at banquets and the chief seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplace and being called by men, Rabbi, very important to these guys. Don't let that be important to you, verse 8. But do not be called rabbi, for one is your teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth your father, for one is your father, he who is in heaven. And do not be called leaders. Some of your Bibles say master, for one is your master, that is Christ. But the greatest among you shall be your servant. And whoever exalts himself will be brought down, will be humbled by God, and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted. Verse 13 is then going to be the words of Jesus directed to the scribes and Pharisees. But this first phase is simply to the disciples and the multitudes. Let's pray as we begin. Father, we thank you for your truth. We thank you that there are places where your truth so intersects our lives that we know that we are hearing you. God, I thank you for passages like this where you speak to us directly. You are speaking to your church through passages like this. And this ministry to us is a ministry of protection because your sheep do need to be protected. We all need to be protected from those who would come to lead us into falsehood, those who would come to shear the sheep, to destroy the flock of God, to scatter the people of God. And Father, as we come under the authority of your word, we thank you that it is coming to us for our protection and our nurture and our spiritual life and health. I pray, God, that there would be a freedom to receive it and understand it. We pray that you would indeed would be our master, our leader, our teacher, especially during this time of teaching. In Jesus' name, amen. We established last week the fact that while this problem of false spiritual leaders is a frighteningly current problem, it is not a new problem. The reason I want to bring that up right from the beginning is this, that when we find out about false spiritual leaders, even in an evangelical context, when we find out about people who have a double life, it really shouldn't surprise us tremendously. It should sadden us. It should cause us to grieve. But it shouldn't necessarily surprise us because this has been going on for centuries. Talked about the fact last week that Moses had to deal with people like this in Egypt. Jeremiah had to deal with it in Judah. All through the New Testament, false leaders and false shepherds were being identified with a variety of different titles. They were called wells without water. They were called empty talkers. They were called prophets who follow their own spirit and don't really see anything at all from God, though they pretend to. Jesus had names for them. He called them whited walls full of dead men's bones. He called them graves that are covered with grass. He called them broken pots, but they're covered with silver dross, so you can't tell. He called them wolves in sheep's clothing. One of the constant and consistent images that are created with all of those descriptions is an element of deception. What I mean by that is this. When you talk about a whited wall, a whited wall looks good. It looks white. It looks clean. It looks nice. You would never know that there's dead men's bones on the inside of that whited wall because it looks good. When you come to a well, you expect refreshment. You expect water. You expect a place to rest. You'd never know that it was going to be a well without water. And at the bottom of this well is not water but rocks that you can get injured on. When you talk about someone in a sheep's clothing, a few months ago when we talked about this concept of a wolf in sheep's clothing, we discovered that that is not a sheep who is trying to act like, that is not a wolf who is trying to masquerade as a fellow Christian, a wolf who is trying to masquerade as a fellow sheep. That is a shepherd. That is a wolf who is masquerading as a shepherd. It was the shepherd who would wear the garment of the sheep. It wasn't a phony sheep, it was a phony shepherd. And the result of that is this particular wolf that began to devour the sheep, never had to chase the sheep to get him, because the sheep were going toward this particular wolf. They thought it was a shepherd. Never ran in terror. We went toward him. We thought he was safe. When we begin to consider the realities of false shepherds, when we begin to consider the reality that these false shepherds are deceptive and they look like whited walls, they look like wells with water, they look like real shepherds, and the fact that we go toward them, it stirs in us fear. And it raises in us questions. Who can we trust? How can we tell who is true and who is not? What about you, Dave? What about our church? What happens is we begin to get suspicious and we begin to get a little bit skittish. The good news in the text that we're dealing with last week and again this week is that we are not in the dark as it relates to being able to identify what a false teacher looks like. This is not a complete mystery. We are not left clueless. Our text makes it powerfully apparent that there are indicators, there are signs, They are observable. They are objective. They are clearly visible. There are ways in which we can spot what a well without water looks like before we fall in the well. There are ways that you can spot a wolf that's wearing sheep's clothing. Jesus gives us five ways to do that. Last week we had two. We're going to finish off today with three more. The first indicator of a well without water or an empty talker is that they will have a false basis of authority, verse 2. The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses. The chair of Moses, as you recall, was that place of authority. The problem with these particular people was that they seated themselves in that position. They took it for themselves. I am in the place of authority. The final problem with this scenario in verse 2 was the basis for the authority that they assumed over people's lives was not necessarily because they were wise, not because they were listening to the Spirit of God, not because they were speaking the truth, not because they knew God or were mature in things of the Spirit. They were assuming their position because of their rank. They were assuming that position of authority because of their office. I am a scribe. I am a Pharisee. Therefore, on the basis of that alone, I sit myself in a position of authority. I am the pastor. I am the elder. I am the chairman of the board. On the basis of that, I have authority. No, you don't. That is a false basis of authority. Authority is there when you speak the truth. We went over that in detail last week. It's one of the ways to spot a false shepherd. They have a false basis of authority. The second thing is this. They lack congruity. They lack integrity in their lives. They say and do not. Verse 3. They do not according to their deeds, for they say things and do not do them. And very often what we discover after a period of time is that these people who have been inconsistent lack integrity and congruity in terms of what they say and what they do. we find out, sadly, that they've been living a double life and that that double life has been happening for some time. Dealt with some of the ways in which that manifests itself, some of the reasons that that sometimes happens. Dealt with that last week. Let's get into the new stuff. Verse 4. This is the third way to spot a false shepherd, a false teacher. They tie up heavy loads, lay them on men's shoulders. they themselves are unwilling to move them with so much as a finger. A false leader is easy to spot. They weigh people down. You know, I'm going to give you a lot of ways to kind of see that applied, but if you forget everything I'm going to say in terms of application, all you've got to do to be able to have your antenna working and know it's working is that when you're in a ministry that weighs you down with guilt and shame, and that becomes the motivator for your ministry and the motivator for your spiritual life and the mover of your life, you are having an indicator that you're in a ministry that's got a false leader. You tie up heavy loads, don't do a thing to lift it off. The picture here is that of a guy loading up a donkey. It would be a common sight in Palestine. They use donkeys to carry all their things. It would be like a modern-day pickup truck. And in the research I did, it was even kind of funny because the pictures they painted were of animals being piled so high with stuff, way up high, and then all the way around the side so that it would go to the ground. These animals are kind of listening to the right, you know, and then the animals are going like this. And they talked about the fact that they would load these donkeys so far down that literally the animal would disappear. You just wouldn't be able to see what it was. All you'd see in the road is this pile of stuff, no discernible animal. They're just kind of moving down the road. And there's this guy next to it with a switch in his hand, carrying nothing, kind of poking it along, and it's kind of keeping it moving. I don't know about you, but that creates some interesting imagery for me where people, in terms of their religious experience, has never been a wonderful experience of God and His grace and His love, but it's been a horrific, horrifying kind of experience where under a load of guilt and religious performance, they have literally lost their identity. They have no idea who they are. They're lost under this load of guilt and shame and religious performance, walking down the road like this, hoping somehow, by carrying this load, they'll get to God. Again, I could go on and on with the images I get with stuff like this, but just imagine the evangelistic appeal of a lifestyle like that. You're kind of walking around, oh, yeah, come on, this is great. I want to meet God like I am. It's kind of frightening. I think there's at least three ways. I'm probably nowhere near all of the ways we could put loads on people, but there are three very obvious ones come right out of the text, right out of the Word of God, that clearly false leaders put on people. Let me share them with you. The most obvious load that is put on people's backs is the load that the Pharisees themselves are doing to these people at the time of Christ. Their load would be technically what we would call a works righteousness theology. A works righteousness theology. Works righteousness theology in its basic form says fundamentally this. God is counting up all of your bad behavior and he's counting up all of your good behavior. And your only hope for salvation is that your good behavior somehow outweigh your bad behavior. Now, I want you to catch the language there, that your good behavior outweigh your bad behavior. The weight is still there. You know what's interesting about a strict works righteousness theology is this. They put the load of sin on you. They're real good about the depravity of man. They got that down. You are sin. You are sinful. You are terrible. You got the weight of sin. They never do anything to lift the load of sin. They never talk about the strong arm of grace. They never talk about the work of God to remove the sin and the stain of sin in my life, you got the load of sin. Your only hope is to carry more righteousness than you carry sin, but you carry both. You follow that? You got the load of your sin. Your hope is to get more righteousness than you have sin, and you carry them both your whole life. I got all my sin. I'm going to do a little more, and you do a little more, hoping that that good stuff outweighs the bad, but you carry both. So you do carry the load, hoping that someday, someway, somehow, you will do enough to somehow outweigh the bad. But it's never enough. So what you do is you keep on piling on top of that load expectations. They are usually other people's expectations. They are usually religious expectations. Those expectations keep changing, so you keep having to pile new things on the pile. And you keep piling up new regulations, and they keep changing, and new rituals, and those are religious rituals, and they kind of keep changing. And you keep on piling rules on top of that, and the rules keep changing depending on what church you go to, and it's never enough, and you keep on doing it, and the load gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. And if you're in a system where the method for salvation is a works righteousness salvation, and you begin to stumble under the load you're carrying, the load of your sin, the load of your own righteousness, you will never hear, come unto me all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I'll give you rest. You'll never even hear. That's what you need to hear to get rid of the load of sin, But you'll never even hear what they said in the Old Testament. I'm talking Old Testament. Before the work of Christ, Isaiah is saying, what you need to understand is even your righteousness is as filthy rags. You need to get rid of both of those things and find a redeemer. You'll never hear that. When you stumble under the load of your sin and under the load of your trying hard, and you're tired from carrying that, the ministry to you from a works righteousness theologist will be to shame you for not doing enough, shame you for not really caring. You don't really care. If you really cared, you'd carry this load of not really being committed. You're not committed enough. And then they might try to get a little more positive with you if you haven't responded well to the shame. They'll encourage you. Just try a little harder and do a little more. And there you are, sitting like a donkey under this load of sin and your own self-righteous performance. And you're tired and you're beat up and you get back up on your leg and you start carrying it again because you went to camp and now you're all charged up again. In a false system, nothing's done to lift a load. The strong arm of grace is never extended. There is no talk of forgiveness, no talk of mercy. And again, we desperately need to contrast that approach, religious approach to God with Matthew 11 where Jesus said, Come unto me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you what? Rest. I have come. Jesus, the chief shepherd, the true shepherd, came with what message? A message that said this. I have come to lift the load. There's another form of load that's being put on people. This is a load that happens after you realize the truth of verses like Ephesians 2, 8, and 9. It says, For by grace you've been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, you can't carry the load. Not of yourselves, it's a gift, it's grace. Not of works, lest any man should boast. If you could carry the load yourself of your sin and you could get more righteousness than your sin, you'd be able to boast and you'd be the most self-righteous of all. You need to understand you can't carry the load. It's by grace we've been saved. Sometimes people come to the point that for salvation, they realize they cannot carry the load. But then another load gets put on. It's a load that is given after salvation. and what we do is we just give people the load right back. For sanctification and for service, it's up to you. We understand for salvation, our only hope is Jesus. But if you're going to be holy, if you're going to serve God, it's up to you. Try hard, do more, just do it, it's up to you. And we pile on top of them all sorts of expectations. They're usually people's expectations. They're usually religious expectations. We pile on top of them regulations. They're usually church's regulations, traditions, rituals, rules that keep on changing. We're not really sure what they are. But because we want to feel like we're really spiritual, because we really do love God, we take it all on, we load it all up, and we look like the donkey walking down the road, lost our identity. Whatever happened to joy in Christ? I forgot about that. That exact thing happened to the church in Galatia. where a group of Judaizers came in and said, hey, you bet, sure, salvation by grace through faith, but that's not enough. If you really want to fit in, you've got to get circumcised, and you've got to do this, and you've got to do that, and all of a sudden, all sorts of rituals, regulations, expectations got piled up on top of that. They lost their joy. Mark of a false teacher, beloved, is that they will point to you as the bearer of the burden. they will point to you as the source of your salvation if they can get past that and realize well no no you can't get saved by yourself you've got to have Jesus for that but then they will after that point to you as the source of their your sanctification and they will point to you as the source of your service you need to know that's a mark of a false shepherd true shepherd does one thing all the time he points to the chief shepherd you need to understand something that our only hope for salvation is him our only hope for sanctification is the life of the spirit in you you can try all you want if you knew if knowing what was wrong kept you from sin nobody would do anything wrong you needed a power in you you need to be pointed to the chief shepherd to empower you to be sanctified and live a holy life you need to be empowered by the spirit and anointed by the spirit and filled with the spirit in order to serve you don't necessarily need a phd phds are nice but that's not what empowers you to serve. You've got to keep pointing people to Jesus as their only source. That's what a true shepherd does. A false shepherd will constantly offer you you. False shepherds keep the load on people. And the load is a load of guilt and shame. And the message is that it's never enough, it's never enough, it's never enough. And the question I have about that is why. Why do you think people do that? Why do you think people's methodology to keep people moving down a path toward holiness, pursuing God. Why do you think that some people use this method of just putting the load of guilt and shame on people? I have a theory about that. My theory is this, that at least in part the reason for that is that it's an issue of control. It's an issue of control. See, I think it's absolutely true. If I could make you feel guilty, or if I could make you accept a load of shame from me, I could control your life. I could. You could do the same to me. If you could make me feel guilty, if you could give me baggage, and I took it, and I received it, if you could shame me, you could get me to do whatever you wanted. Because you know what? When I get loaded with guilt, when you get loaded with guilt, when you get loaded with shame, and it's not legitimate, I'll do anything to get out from under that. I'll do anything to get out from under that. I might even start agreeing with you when I don't agree with you. I might start giving when I don't want to give. I might start serving when I don't want to serve, when God hasn't even told me to serve. I'll start doing things that has nothing to do with God moving in me or directing me. I'll start doing things because you're manipulating me, because you've put a load on me, and you've made it very clear if I'm going to be accepted by you, I've got to jump through this hoop and this hoop and this hoop. And the key is, you'll be doing what I want you to do, not what the Spirit of God is telling you to do. It has nothing to do with listening to God. It has nothing to do with walking by the Spirit. True shepherd lifts the burden off. Galatians 5.1, Paul came to the Galatians. He was somewhat mad at the sheep. He was kind of angry. I mean, it was a polemic epistle. You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you? Did you think that having... Let me ask you a question. How did you get saved? Did you get saved by the Spirit or by works of the flesh? By the Spirit. Did you think having been saved by the Spirit, Now you're going to be sanctified by the flesh, by your cranking it out and taking his big load on you? What are you guys? Nuts what is with you? Who bewitched you? Galatians 5, verse 1, he says, with some militant strength. It was for freedom that Christ has set us free. Keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery. Don't let people put the load back on you. Some people would respond to that and say, oh, Dave, if we take off the weight, if we take off the load of shame on people, what's going to restrain sin? What's going to get them to walk down the path of righteousness? How are we going to get people to obey? How are we going to get people to give? How are we going to get people to serve if you take the load off? You might have to believe in God. You might have to believe that God could work in people's lives. I've got a word for you. If you're dealing with an unredeemed person and you take the load off of them, I have no hope of any restraint. I have no hope of them moving in obedience and moving in love and moving in the life of God. Why? Because they don't have the Spirit of God in them, but a redeemed person, by definition, has been given a new heart. They've been given a new life. The life of Christ is in them. You take the load off of them, and they begin to walk by the means of the Spirit that they have. And I will cause them, Exodus 36, Ezekiel 36 says, I will cause them by my spirit in them to walk in my statutes. Take the load off my people. I think we keep the load on them because we think if we take that off, what's going to get them to move down the path? And we have Christians even walking down the path, no different than they were before they were saved, in terms of their life of God they're experiencing. Carrying the load, hoping it's enough, take the load off. and when you do it they're going to be beginning to move but you know what's weird when you say this to people who've never heard it before they think you're talking a foreign language they just they look what is this I remember when I first came here and we began to talk like this I had people come to me and say oh Dave if you take the load off if we strip away all the external things and we start doing things like teaching Sunday school just because God's telling them What a joke. I mean, what do you mean? We've got to tell them, if you don't do it, oh, we're going to die. And just make them feel guilty. If we just let them off and say, follow what the Spirit's telling you. Look inside. Everything's going to fall apart. Well, we had some interesting times nine years ago, and we had about 160 people. And some people began to hear this message, and they began to take the day. They said, I'm going to quit doing what I do because somebody put a load on me. I'm going to stop and see if I can discover God. And people began to take the layers off. And they took the load off, and they looked around, and they looked kind of stupid at the beginning. What is this new feeling? You know? You know what we discovered? The people who really had the Spirit of God in them, they kept walking down the path. But they didn't walk like this anymore. They walked like this. And they just walked in the Spirit, and they walked in life, and they walked in love, and they did it because the Spirit of God was moving in them. And all of a sudden, they started teaching Sunday school because the Spirit of God laid a burden on them. The Spirit of God began to speak to them, And they began to give, and they began to serve, and it wasn't because they had a load on them, hoping that by serving and giving, they'd get the load off. The load was already off. Get it? I have come to give you life, an abundant life. I have come to lift the burden. Walk by the Spirit, and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh. Take the load off. Another way that false teachers put a load on people is when there is what I call role reversal. Role reversal. What that means is the shepherd, instead of being there for the sheep, it gets turned around and all of a sudden the sheep are there for the shepherd. Let me explain that. In 2 Peter 2.3, it says this. Peter is speaking of false shepherds and it says they malign the way of truth and because of their greed, they make merchandise of the sheep. They make merchandise of the sheep. They begin to use the sheep for their own gain. Zechariah 11.16, I'm using that passage because it's good, but also because it's in the Old Testament. gives us a perspective again. This has been a long-standing problem. It says of the false shepherds, they don't care for the perishing. They don't seek the scattered. They don't heal the broken. They don't sustain the one that's standing. What they do is they devour the flesh of the fat sheep, the fat sheep that they can kind of suck life off of. They devour that guy. They tear their hooves off. And the reason for that is that the roles are reversed. See, this shepherd views the sheep as being there for him. And I'm going to suck the life out of you to make me feel better and get ahead. Build my kingdom off the sheep. Mark 12 describes them as people who devour widows' houses. I heard that verse when I was a little kid. I used to think, what in the world would that look like? What would somebody look like who was devouring widows' houses? What a despicable thing. And my view was like he looked like Snidely Whiplash. You know, and he'd go, coming in there, and here's the deed, and you owe me now. Dudley Do-Right would come and that was God and that was great. And he would tear the furniture up and steal all the food and the widow's sitting there. And I think, well, I guess that doesn't happen today. It must have just happened then. It's a terrible thing that happened then. I think devouring widows' houses is when we take money and manipulate money from vulnerable people. And a widow would be a metaphor of vulnerable person and build million-dollar mansions with it. I think that's devouring widow's houses. Ezekiel 34, verses 1 through 10. I don't usually just read Scripture, but this says it so much better than I ever could. Again, it gives a perspective of history here. It's happened for years. The word of the Lord came to me saying, Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and say to those shepherds, Thus says the Lord God, Woe, shepherds of Israel, who have been feeding themselves. Should you not shepherds feed the flock? What a concept. The roles have been reversed. And because the roles have been reversed, you put a load on people. You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool. You slaughter the fat sheep without feeding the flock. Those who are sickly, you have not strengthened. The diseased, you have not healed. The broken, you have not bound up. The scattered, you have not brought back. Nor have you sought for the lost. But with force and severity, you have dominated them. You have dominated them. When you see that style, get out of there. and they were scattered for lack of a shepherd hear that they were scattered for lack of a shepherd they became food for every beast of the field and were scattered that's a weird image how would that translate to now I'll give you that in a minute my flock wandered through all the mountains on every high hill my flock was scattered over all the surface of the earth and there was no one there to search or seek for them became food for every you know what I don't know if this is the only episode but what came to my mind I'll just share it. It's when people that grew up in some Christian church went to Bethel College, Wheaton College, we find out later they got involved in a cult. What? I think it's because of this. They get scattered, they became prey and food for every beast. Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord as I live. Strong words. As I live, declares the Lord God, surely because my flock has become a prey, my flock has even become food for all the beasts of the field for lack of a shepherd. And my shepherds did not search for my flock, but rather the shepherds fed themselves and did not feed the flock. Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord God, Behold, I am against the shepherds. Oof. See, that's why Jesus said in Matthew 9, 36, seeing the multitude, he felt compassion. For they were distressed and downcast like sheep without a shepherd. There was no strong arm of grace to come and help to lift the load. That's why he said in Matthew 10 to the disciples at the initial sending, he said, don't go to the Gentiles right away. Don't go to the Samaritans first. First of all, bring the message of grace and bring the message of kingdom, life, and healing to the lost sheep of the house of Israel because they need a shepherd. They need someone to come and lift the load for them. That's why he said in Matthew 11, come unto me all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest. That kind of leadership is in stark contrast to Paul who in 1 Thessalonians 2, verse 5 says, We did not come to you with flattering speech. We confronted you. We confronted sin. We said things straight. But you also need to know and remember that we did not come to you with a pretext of greed. God is our witness. We didn't see glory from men, either from you or others, even though as apostles we might have asserted our authority. It was a false basis of authority. We didn't do that. But we proved to be gentle among you as a nursing mother tenderly cares for her children. Having thus a fond affection for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but we were well pleased to impart our very lives with you because you have become dear to us. What's interesting, with that style of leadership, it says in verse 13 that the response of the people was that they received the word of God's message. You accepted it, not as the word of men, but for what it really was, the word of God. The sheep received the word in that kind of situation. Fourth thing is this. They wear their religion for show. They wear their religion for show. It is literally a performance they put on. They get tremendous ego satisfaction from posturing and parading. They are very careful to project an image. And once they project an image of spirituality, they are very careful to protect that image. But all it is is an image. It's a performance. Verse 5, They do all their deeds to be noticed by men. Great ego satisfaction. Here's two of the things they do to get the notice for men to look spiritual. They broaden their phylacteries. They lengthen their garments. We don't have phylacteries today. What are they? Well, they didn't exist in the Old Testament. They came to be in the intertestamental period of time between the New and the Old Testament. The origin or the basis of the thinking on what a phylactery is came out of Deuteronomy 6, 8 and Deuteronomy 11, 16, where it says, Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind. And then it goes on to say, take these laws and bind them upon your hand and bind them as frontals on your head. Now the Jews who originally heard that knew what it meant. What it meant was this, love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind. And let that be bound on your hand. Meaning, let that be the controlling influence in what you do with your hands. In your activities and in your actions, let your love of God indicate or dictate what you do. And let it be as a frontal to your forehead. Let your love of God be the controlling factor in what you think. but as is always when the heart grows cold the things that are meant for the heart begin to crawl to the outside it began to be something that people could parade on the outside to show their piety literally what they did was that they wrote down these commandments in Deuteronomy 6.8 and Deuteronomy 11.16 wrote them on a piece of paper, put them in a little box put them on their wrist and then strapped them on did it very elaborately, threw the fingers in fact they strapped it on in such a way that it formed certain letters and the letters kind of combined together to form the word Shaddai and they would do the same thing on their forehead. Little box and they would tie it together. The word phylactery literally means a means of protection. A means of protection. Where in the world did that come from? Actually, the whole concept was borrowed from the Egyptians, the pagans. What the Egyptians had done was they wore charms. They wore little religious medallions, little necklaces and earrings and little statues in their house. And what they were designed to do by the pagan Egyptians were they believed that they would ward off evil spirits. So these little phylacteries became little superstitious religious charms to protect us from sin and ward off the evil one. And what it really does is just give you something other than God to have your confidence in. To broaden them simply meant to make them big. Make them big so people saw. Make them big so people thought you were spiritual. A Pharisee, a scribe, wouldn't be seen in public without their flack trees on. All the way up their arm it would be, looking very spiritual. It was an image, it was a performance, it looked very good. And what it did was that by my dress, it set me apart as being a cut above everybody else. Lengthening the tassels was simply the same kind of concept. Numbers 15, 37 to 41 indicates that there was, worn by Jews and some believe even Jesus wore this, It's a very subtle and small hem around the bottom of the robe. And what it did was it marked him off as a Jew. It marked him as one who is set apart as unto God. To lengthen the tassel meant to make that hem huge, really big. I'm more set apart than you, aren't I something? And we would posture and parade and project this image of spirituality. So here they are. With their boxes of elaborately strapped leather, long fringes and thinking that by the clothing they wear and how they appear and the image they project, People will think them to be utterly devoted to God. That happens today. We project an image. We want to protect the image. How things look is what matters. I'm so thankful that I grew up in a home of a man who was a pastor who communicated to me in a variety of ways that, Dave, if you want to go into the ministry, the key is you need to be who you are. If God's called you, you need to be who you are. If you're Dave, you don't have to act like somebody else. You just be who Dave is, and God, if he's called you, is going to use you the way you are. I went to seminary and got all sorts of messages, and if you've gone, and not every seminary is like this, but in my experience, it was the energy was spent learning how to act like a pastor, not be a pastor. Does that ring any? You learn how to act like it. Here's how you act. Here's how you project. I think that filters down to people, beloved, Because if we got our pastors acting like pastors and not just being who they are, you're going to have a whole bunch of people who are acting like Christians, have no idea what it means to be a Christian. We need to adorn the gospel well. In here, let's let the beauty of our garment be what's going on inside. It'll show out here. You know, posture and parade. False teachers do that. False teachers promote that. I had a delightfully embarrassing experience a couple weeks ago you weren't all there were you? you must have told went to Baker Square I think it was my day off you know I don't always dress like this in fact once a week went to Baker Square it's no big deal I went there with my wife. We were with another couple. We wanted to get a piece of pie. I'd been doing something around the house. I don't know what. I was wearing a Bethel football t-shirt, gray thing with Bethel on it, and kind of grubby jeans. They weren't dirty, but they didn't look very pastoral, I'll tell you that much. I was wearing this little white hat. I collect white hats. I wear them all the time around the house, a little baseball hat. We went into this place, and as we were leaving, I saw this couple that we know pretty well. They've been to our church in a long time, and we think we're pretty good friends with them, Dean and Darlene. They're right down here. I'm embarrassing the daylights out And I see them, you know, in the restaurant. And honestly, when I saw them, the thought went through my mind was, I want to say hi to them. And I said, oh, you look like a grub. I'll embarrass you. I want to say hi to them. So I walked over and I said, how are you doing? And I'm in there with my hat and there's this other couple. I didn't know where they were. I didn't know anything about it. I saw them on Wednesday. I asked them about it. And Dean's laughing his head off. He goes, ah, we give them your tape. We give them your tape. And then they've heard about you. And we were talking about our pastor more than once with them. And then you show up with this hat. It was great. And his t-shirt, it was wonderful. And I'm sitting there, oh, man, that's wonderful. And I said, well, did it blow it for you? Like now he's going to burn his tapes or what? What's the deal? And what Dean's friend, at least what Dean said to me, was that his response was that, well, yeah, he's kind of regular. And I was okay with that. yeah, it's time to get regular. It's time to be regular. It's time to quit wearing our spirituality like an image we're projecting and if you start projecting this image that now you've got to protect it and that's a bunch of baloney. I believe that being utterly devoted to God is not an issue of wearing broadened phylacteries and looking like a pastor, whatever that looks like, or looking like whatever that looks like, a Christian, what does that look like? What does that look like? being utterly devoted to God is not about projecting an image. It's in here. It adorns the gospel well when it's real in here. False teachers, pretenders, are going to wear their religion. They're going to wear it. It's going to be real important. Not only will they wear it, it's going to be important that you notice. That's the next point. They require and demand the accolades of men. You know what? This is a major confrontation on the church. It's a major confrontation on the evangelical church. But what always surprises me is how these confrontations are like, how can he be saying that? Because it's in the text. That's how you can say it. Listen to this. They love the place of honor at banquets, chief seats at the synagogues, and they require respectful greetings in the marketplaces and love being called by men rabbi. They love the place of honor at banquets. First thing about that, there's nothing wrong with having a place of honor at a banquet. You know what I hope? I hope that everyone, I really mean this, I hope every one of you at some time in your life get to sit in the place of honor at some banquet. 25 years of faithful service. I don't know. Maybe it'll never even get that big. Maybe it's in the context of your family. We love Dad, and today is Dad's day. And Dad, you got the place of honor at the banquet. It's only the four of us, but you got it. And Mom, it's your day. Our kids, it's your day. I hope everybody sometime along the way gets the place of honor at the banquet. And you know what? When you're sitting at the place of honor at the banquet, I hope you sit there like this. I hope you love it it's wonderful the problem with these guys was not that they sat at the place of honor that's an okay thing they needed it they lobbied to get it they got into politics and maneuvered and got close to the right people so they could get it not so among you chief seats they love the place of the chief seats in the synagogue interesting thing the greek reveals a little subtle things the chief seats meant a seat of elevation it was like on the stage nothing wrong with sitting on the stage if you've got something to do up here sit there come up do your thing go back go downstairs they needed it they needed to sit up hello you ever notice on some churches there's the seats up there look like thrones you know what's that i don't know i'm not here to meddle but i'm doing it anyway i know that but i don't want it's not with my purpose i i honestly and there's nothing wrong with sitting in that seat unless you need to but i think we should do everything we can to get away from that kind of thing they love the place of honor they need it they love the chief seat they need it and they love respectful greetings in the marketplace i'm all for being respectful but these people needed to be called by men rabbi they needed their title they needed to be called reverend interesting thing the word rabbi here as it translates into the into the latin the latin equivalent is docere and it means doctor and it is not a medical doctor it's a doctor a man of letters a man or a woman of of great education and to one who is a false leader all of a sudden their falseness and part of what they're projecting and part of their image that they're bringing to you is this image that I know everything. And it's very important that you think I know everything. And I want to put myself above and I want to stand as an authority in your life. And I want to be referred to as doctor or rabbi or reverend. So bizarre. They had instructions. The rabbis had instructions as to how you were to greet them. If you were in a public place, you were to say this. If you were in a private place, you were to say this. And if you didn't say it, you got fired. I don't know what happened to you. Something bad happened to you. There was a consequence. If you didn't address them just right. Now, this isn't an issue here anymore. In our church, I remember when I first came, I remember when I candidated for this job nine years ago. In fact, nine years ago this month, one of the questions was, what do you want to call me? What do you want us to call you? There we go. I had to get right here. And I knew what they meant. I try to act like I don't, but I knew what they meant. It was this reverend pastor thing. And I said, well, my name is Dave. I introduced myself as Dave. When people say Dave, I go like that. my friends all call me Dave my good friends call me John you know my really good friends call me weird my wife calls me all sorts of things just bizarre things I'll never forget this story it was again early on in our time here Jessie Van Vonderen was in the nursery she was just a toddler at the time again eight, nine years ago and at the time the message would kind of get piped into the nursery so it would come over a loud speaker so the people in the nursery could hear and one day she was up there listening to this thing in the nursery looking at the speaker and going that's Dave and bless her heart the real sweet lady with little Jessie kind of put her up on her knee and said no, that's Pastor Johnson that was okay I mean she just wanted to you know just kind of teach her some respect or something I don't know that's Pastor Johnson and Jesse you'd have to know Jesse but Jesse looks up at the thing goes nah that's safe the bishop in the Church of England is called the right reverend father in God great great call him doctor, you know, it's nicer to call somebody, I'd like you to introduce you to my friend, Dr. Joseph, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, that's better than saying, I'd like to introduce you to my friend, Joe, hey, Joe, yo, what it is, you know, Dr. Joseph, good. On one hand, I don't want to get weird about this and like feel spiritual because we don't do that, you know, and if you feel uncomfortable being that informal, that's fine. The point here is these people needed that. These people needed that. And it's not to be that way. But you do not be called rabbi, source of knowledge, because you're not the source of knowledge. One is the source of knowledge, that is Jesus. He is your teacher. The one capital one is God. You're all brothers. And all you are, David, and all you are, Paul, and all you are, Peter, are stewards. Remember that, 1 Corinthians 4? And your job is to be a faithful steward. We are just stewards. We go into the kitchen where God has prepared the food. That's the food. I just bring out the food and give it to you. That's all we are. He is the teacher. And don't let him call you leader. And don't let him call you father. Because one is your father and one is your leader and one is your master. Those three terms speak to three different things. Again, I've already given you the one about rabbi. That speaks to knowledge. The inference there is source of knowledge. Leader or master speaks of authority or guidance. And the key there is source of guidance, source of authority. And Father speaks of one who is the source of life. A father is one who gives life in some sense. Don't let people look at you and do not put yourself in a position of being the source of knowledge, rabbi. You are not the source of knowledge. God is. Do not put yourself in a position of being the source of authority. You are not the source of authority. God is the source of authority. Do not put yourself in a position of being the source of life to people. Come to me, I'll solve all your problems. I can't solve your problems. God is the only one who can solve your problems. If you come to a true shepherd, what he's going to do is go, I will solve your problems. That's a false shepherd. You come to a true shepherd with your problems, he's going to point you to Jesus. I can't do anything, let me give you to Jesus. Mark of a true shepherd. You know what, it's not that hard, is it? It's not that hard to spot. A false shepherd will point to himself or herself, will present her or himself as the source of knowledge. They will present themselves as the source of authority. and they will present themselves as the source of life. True shepherds, so easy to spot, will always, always, always point you and offer you to Jesus. He is our only source of knowledge, our only source of authority, our only source of guidance, and our only source of life. And if you ever begin to get the idea that I am any of that, or any of our staff, or any of our elders, or your husband or your wife or your friend is the source of knowledge, authority, and life. I can tell you if you do that to me, you know what, I guarantee you're going to be real disappointed in me. In fact, you're going to be more than disappointed. You're going to be real angry with me because you're going to find out real fast that I am the source of nothing. I cannot give you life. I cannot solve your problems. I am not the source of authority. I will point you to Jesus. I will point you to Jesus. I will point you to Jesus ends with a divine paradox but the greatest among you shall be your servant whoever exalts himself shall be humbled and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted the greatest among you shall be your servant and I will call you the right reverend father slave let me close with this one passage 1 Peter it's a word specifically to elders 1 Peter 5 but I think it translates right down to people it says this therefore I exhort the elders among you as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed here's what I want you to do shepherd the flock exercise oversight not under the compulsion don't do it because you have to in fact if you're doing it because you have to get out don't do it anymore but voluntarily according to the will of God and not for sordid gain don't do it to fleece the flock you're there to feed the sheep but do it with eagerness and don't do it lording it over those allotted to your charge you have authority there you have a charge to fulfill but prove yourselves an example to the flock and when the chief shepherd appears you will receive the unfading crown of glory you younger men likewise be subject to your elders and all of you all of you let's all of us clothe ourselves with humility toward one another. And then this verse is incredible for all of us. The reason we want to clothe ourselves with humility toward each other is because God is opposed to the proud. God stands against the proud, but he gives grace to the humble. Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, and he will exalt you at the proper time. Don't worry about it. He'll exalt you at the proper time. Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you. How do you spot a false leader? It's really not a mystery. they operate with the false basis of authority they lack congruity and very often you'll find out after a period of time there was a double life they keep the load on they weigh people down in a variety of ways never extend the strong arm of grace they wear their spirituality on the outside it's a performance they put on, it's an image they project and once they begin to project the image they need very desperately to protect the image that they've projected they require desperately the recognition of men when they don't get it. They'll call you on a lack of respect. They'll call it respect, but letters, degrees, and titles matter to them a lot. And ultimately, they will begin to point to themselves and present themselves as the source of knowledge, truth, authority, and life. And when that whole thing begins to happen at a leadership level, and we begin to wear our spirituality as this big performance, it filters down to people. And if the leaders are walking around broadening their phylacteries and pompously parading their spirituality, people start to do that. And people who do it well get away with it. And they feel real self-righteous because I broaden my phylactery well too. I wear it just like the rabbi. I don't know if we're something. See, some people can carry the load well and they have the physical ability to look really good. And then there's other people, I would kind of put them in a rank just kind of beneath that group who look so wonderful, who are trying to look wonderful. And they're broadening their phylacteries too, but they just don't do it right. They're more like you and me. It's like there's something always dangling. You know, I didn't tie it right. I just can't ever get this stupid thing right. It's just always hanging, it's dirty, and it's all messed up, and I'm crooked. But you feel kind of stupid because you didn't get it. But you keep trying, and you keep trying, and you spend your Christian life carrying the load, hoping you're as spiritual as them, never feeling joy, never feeling... You're like the donkey with the load on you the whole time. And then there are some people who under that load of performance and looking good and all that stuff, like the donkey who has lost its identity, just falls flat on the ground and thinks that they are beyond hope. And the glory of the gospel that we hear over and over again is that it's almost as if we hear the word of God coming ringing down the quarters of history, looking at that donkey that everybody else is walking by because he doesn't look very good. In fact, he's broken down. And all of a sudden we hear the gospel coming through, blessed are the broken, for theirs is the kingdom. Because this person here has come to the point where they realize, I can't carry the load. I cannot carry the load of my sin and I cannot carry the load of my trying to undo my sin I can't carry the load of my righteousness and blessed are the broken blessed are those who mourn blessed are those who say it out loud blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness that they can't crank out themselves because they're the ones who look for grace and they're the ones who get it and I also hear the words of Jesus ringing down the quarters of history come unto me all you who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you what? Rest. My yoke is easy. You see, when you get life in me, I'll take off the load and I'll call you to obedience, but you're going to love to obey. Obeying is going to be, you're going to love to do that. Anybody here carry a load? I can't lift it up. But I'll tell you, I know somebody who can. It's the one who said, come unto me, and I'll give you rest. See, if we're going to be consistent here, I've just got to take you this morning and point you to Jesus. And I think some of you are carrying a load. I don't even know what it might be. A load of sin? A load of inconsistency in your life? A load of bitterness and anger? A load of pain? Maybe you've been a victim of this kind of system, and you're still under the load, and you need a miracle of God to lift that load off. Because you are so under indictment from the lies of the enemy, from systems like this, that you don't have any idea how to get free. I want you to know that there are people, we'll call them shepherds today, who are going to be up here, their altar ministry. If you come, they'll pray for you. And they are not going to present themselves as the source of authority. They won't present themselves as the source of knowledge. And they won't present themselves as the source of life. They just know who is. And they'll get you down here and they'll pray for you and point you right to the source of life, the one who can lift the burden and heal the pain and heal the body and break the bondage of sin and death. let's pray Jesus do your work here for those who got a load and need it lifted by you I pray that people would be drawn to you some for salvation they're in that very first group of people who are in works righteousness they're carrying the load of their sin and their righteousness I pray that they would hear this call from you come into me, I'll give you rest I'll give you grace, I'll give you forgiveness I'll lift a load of your sin and I'll remove it and I'll lift a load of your trying hard to do good and I'll remove it and I'll fill you with my spirit. But I thank God there's Christians here who are living with a load too. Same kind of performance thing. God, I pray that you would call them to hear the same message. I'll give you rest. I'll fill you with my spirit. I'll empower you by my spirit, not your effort and external manipulation to live a life that's worthy of your calling. I pray for your healing. Give us courage to come, those who need to do it, in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
