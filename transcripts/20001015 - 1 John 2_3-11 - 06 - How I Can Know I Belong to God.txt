1 John 2, picking our study up in the third verse where we are being introduced this morning to a marvelous new section of teaching and thought that I've entitled, How We Can Know That We Belong to God. That's an interesting thing to know, a pretty important thing to know, how I can know I belong to God. That theme is introduced in the opening line of verse 3 with these words, By this we know that we belong to God. I'm pretty curious what that this refers to, aren't you? A little teaching here. The word this is pivotal. Actually, it sends us in two directions at the same time. First of all, it sends us back to what was previously spoken of in chapter 1. It sends us also forward to what is about to be said in chapter 2. In other words, by walking in the truth of what is revealed in chapter 1 that we spent four weeks on, by walking in the truth of that, you can know that you belong to God. In the same fashion, by walking in the truth of what's about to be revealed in chapter 2, you can know that you belong to God. Remember what we've been talking about for several weeks? For several weeks, we have been responding to an invitation extended to us by John under the influence of the Holy Spirit in chapter 1 to walk in the light of what is real and true about life and about ourselves. We've been invited to be a people who are resisting the instinct that all of us have and have had since the Garden of Eden to live in the dark, to cover and hide and deny. We've been invited to be a people who are routinely agreeing with God about what the light of His truth reveals in our lives. We've been invited to be a confessing people. That invitation, I think, wonderfully culminated last week as we gathered around the Lord's table. Tom, you remember, if you were here, spoke, and we opened the altar specifically for confession. We always do that around communion, have people here, people come for prayer. but this time the designation was clear, come this time only for confession. The key verse was right out of the text that we'd been studying, 1 John 1.9. If we confess our sin, if we agree with God about what He's shining His light on, He will forgive our sin and He will cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If you were here, you know the response was amazing, overwhelming. In fact, we had to call unscheduled prayer team people out of the congregation to help deal with the people who were coming because of their sheer number. And as you came, many of you experienced firsthand what I had been promising for three weeks you would experience if you brought out into the light what you're hiding in the dark. What you experience is this, freedom, cleansing. You know you're forgiven. You experience joy. In third service, Bonnie, my wife, and I were privileged to serve at the table ministering the cup and the bread. And near the end of the communion time, if you know how it goes, there's kind of a crush of people. And then it kind of thins out and one or two people come near the end. Near the end, one dear young woman came, having obviously gone first to prayer for confession. As she approached Bonnie and I, it was clear she was crying. In fact, it was pretty strong crying. She was shaking physically a bit. And even though she would have liked to have spoken, I think, she couldn't speak. But what was also clear was this. while she was crying, she wasn't sad. Indeed, her smile and her eyes radiated light. And what both Bonnie and I knew was that she was free. She felt clean. And you know what? She knew. She might have known this before, but I'm telling you, at that moment, she knew that she belonged to God. By this, verse 3, you will know that you belong to God. If you start bringing out into the light the things you hide in the dark. Some of you might be saying, well, Dave, I mean, all of us hide from time to time. Are you telling us that if we hide from time to time, we're not Christians? No, I'm not telling you that at all. I'm not saying you're not saved if you hide from time to time. I'm telling you, however, that what John is talking about is how we can know this stuff, how we can experience and taste the reality of kingdom life. Here's how. Bring into the light what you hide in the dark, and you will know that you belong to God. This, in verse 3, sends us backward to chapter 1, it also sends us forward to chapter 2. Let's look at verse 3, the rest of verse 3 to begin with, and by this we know that we have come to know Him, John says, if we keep His commandments. We'll just explain that second phrase a little bit, His commandments. His modifies Christ, so it's Christ's commandments. The commandments are the precepts of Christ. The word keep there is very significant, and this will help you understand this and move fully into it. It means clearly obedience, but in the original form in the Greek, it involves more than mechanical compliance to a list of behaviors or rules. This word keep brings with it the nuance of watchful, careful observance. In other words, what John has in mind when he's speaking of keeping the precepts of Christ is not just the act of obedience, though that is certainly in view. He is talking also, however, of the spirit of obedience, not just compliance to the letter of the law, but an engagement to the spirit of the law. What he's saying is this, to really keep the commandments or the precepts of Christ is a heart thing. I think it's best expressed in Alfred's Greek Testament when he renders it this way, that to keep the precepts of Christ is to guard, to watch, and to hold as a precious thing the precepts of Christ. Okay, that's verse 3, and I've kind of got some understanding now, but in verse 4, John sounds a little testy. Let's read verse 4 to the rest of this section through verse 11 and then begin to do our work with the text. The one who says, I have come to know him and does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him. That sounds kind of testing to me. Whoever keeps his word in him, the love of God has truly been perfected. By this we know that we are in him. The one who says he abides in him ought himself also to walk in a manner as he walked, in the same manner as he walked. Beloved, I'm not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard already. On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. What's he talking about? Here's what he's talking about. The one who says he is in light and yet hates his brother is in the darkness until now. The one who loves his brother abides in the light and there is no cause for stumbling in him. The one who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness and does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes. Well, I believe that this passage can be a source of great encouragement and clarifying assurance. I also believe, because I've experienced the passage this way, that at first blush, this can be quite intimidating. John says some, at first blush, almost frightening things. I mean, how many of you felt a bit of a shiver when I read verse 4? If you say you know God and don't keep his commandments, you're a liar. You're a liar is kind of strong. And he doesn't seem to leave a lot of room for the possibility of another explanation, like you're a stumbler. He doesn't say, you're a stumbler. He says, no, you're a liar. And he doesn't seem to qualify, although I've qualified what it means to keep his commandments already in verse 3, but he doesn't do that. If all I do is read verse 4, he doesn't qualify what he means by keep his commandments. So I'm left to question, does he mean all of the commandments, all of the time. Who can say they keep all the commandments all the time? I can't say that, and neither are you. And it's almost as if, if I just can't keep this verse out of context, that he is eliminating the possibility that anyone could confidently say that I have come to know him because who could possibly say I've kept the commandments all the time, all the commandments all the time. What's really confusing about this, however, is this, that for the last four weeks in chapter 1, John seemed to be saying exactly the opposite of what he seems to be saying in verse 4. My paraphrase, for instance, of chapter 1 verse 8, we dealt with this last week, was this, that if someone would claim to be keeping all his commandments all the time, in other words, if any of you say you are without sin, he calls that person a liar. And now in chapter 2 verse 4, He says, but if you don't keep all his commandments all the time, it seems to say, you're a liar. So everybody's a liar. I'm kind of stuck. I'm very confused. What on earth is going on? I am officially middle of the week. It was not an easy week studying. Middle of the week, I called my wife. I am officially confused. It's official. Well, to the list of things in 1 John that might confuse you, add this. And there are a few things I haven't given to you yet in our journey through this book so far. Have any of you noticed in the last few weeks, even though I've not drawn attention to any of it, that sometimes John speaks in this epistle with incredible warmth and inclusiveness, as if he's writing to members of his own family, literally to his children. Well, he uses that terminology. Chapter 2, verse 1, my little children. Chapter 2, verse 18, dear children, it is the last hour. Chapter 2, verse 28, and now little children abide in him. There's this gentleness and patience in that terminology. Over and over, again, he calls them beloved, and then he calls them brethren. But the problem is that sometimes in the very next verse or a couple verses later, the same warm guy starts using language that sounds almost hostile, at least cold. He seems to speak at times with a kind of either-or rigidity. He uses language of extreme polar opposites, not a lot of middle ground. It's dark or light, love or hate, righteousness or sin, truth or lies, and you're kind of made to feel like you're in or you're out. If you say you love God and hate your brother, you're not struggling with sin. You're a liar. Lighten up, I'm thinking. Gee, lookers. I mean, I have to study this stuff. I have to preach it. So I'm thinking, this raises questions. a couple for me. One question that we've got to deal with is this, how do I reconcile the, my little children, dearly beloved John, with the, you're a liar and the truth is not in you, John? They're both here. Another question I need to deal with is, how do I explain, how do we explain what John means when he seems to be saying opposite things, almost contradictory things. Like he says in chapter 1, if you say you're without sin, if you say, claim that you're keeping all the commandments all the time, you're a liar. And then the very next chapter he seems to be saying, but if you don't keep the commandments all the time, you're a liar. Put that together. Here's the deal. To reconcile these tensions and answer these questions, I need to tell you some things about this epistle that I have not yet told you. Vital information, historic background that helps us understand not just what John is saying. What he is saying is apparent enough. You can just read verse 4 to find out what he is saying. What we need to find out is why is he saying that? Why did he write this epistle? Who is his audience? What's going on at the time that would cause him to say what he's saying? Some parts of the epistle, so gentle, my little children. Other parts of the epistle, you're a liar. Who's he talking to? Or is he just nuts? Providing this information, answering these questions is absolutely critical to the right dividing of the word of truth, to the resolving of these tensions. So let me begin with this. First thing that we really need to understand about 1 John, if you hope to make sense of it and even stick with us in the rest of this study, is that it is what is known as a polemic epistle. That word is spelled the way it sounds, polemic, P-O-L-E-M-I-C. Polemic means to be against. It's an argumentative, disputatious epistle. Bottom line, John is fighting against something here, something that was posing a threat to the life and the light of the gospel, something that if allowed to take root and grow, could do great damage not only to the cause of Christ and His kingdom purposes in the world, but to His dearly beloved little children who are deeply desiring to live in the kingdom of God reality. In a word, he is fighting heresy. In fact, chapter 2, verse 26, John reveals quite plainly why he wrote the epistle to begin with. These things I have written to you, my dear little children, because of those among you who are trying to deceive you. In chapter 4, verse 1, he calls them false prophets. Chapter 2, verse 26, he calls them deceivers. Chapter 2, verse 18, he calls them antichrists. And every time he calls somebody a liar, you need to understand he is not addressing my dear little children. He is addressing the false prophets, the false teachers, the antichrists. And in chapter 2, verse 18, it says, By the time that this epistle was being written, there were many of them. You know, there are things that kind of blow through the church from time to time, and they may just kind of be off-centered just a little bit, but there really is a wonderful dynamic. When the Word of God is being proclaimed and it's clear and people are seeking to do what God tells them to do, there's kind of a self-corrective along the way. You don't have to make a big thing of it. But every once in a while, something begins to, for whatever reason, to take root, and then it gets momentum. This is something that had gotten momentum. There were many antichrist false teachers, and it was a tremendous problem in the church. Let me tell you the story. In the latter part of the first century, there were scattered throughout Asia Minor several groups of believers meeting in house churches in various places. Most of them had begun their journey of faith in the kingdom of God under the ministry of this same apostle John. They were by and large a simple people with a simple but authentic faith. Not many wise, not many mighty, not many noble. There were some wise, mighty, and noble, but not many. As is the case for all truly redeemed people, this faith thing was for them a love affair with Jesus. Obedience to His precepts, abiding in His truth, walking in a manner even as He walked were all things that they quite naturally and eagerly lived in and aspired to. So, for instance, when he says in verse 5 that our love for God is perfected perfected or brought into full form in our obedience, they would have understood that. And basically what that means is our obedience to God is not being done because we're afraid He's going to hit us with a stick if we don't obey. Our obedience is born, first of all, from love. This whole thing is a love affair. And love, however, is perfected in obedience. It comes to full form, to full fruit in our obedience. So these people would have gotten that. Wouldn't have even had to, you know, teach them. Yeah, they did that. Why? Because they loved Jesus. And out of their love for God, they issued a lifestyle of obeying and abiding and believing and loving and confessing when they blew it and they did. All of that was normative to them. But at the time of this writing, all of that simple, wonderful, love-born faith was up for grabs. See, these scattered groups of simple believers were facing a crisis. It was a crisis precipitated by a group of people from within the church calling themselves Christians who had begun to despise what I would call the simplicity and purity of love and devotion to Christ. And the reason they despised it was simply this, it was too simple. They'd begun to look down their spiritually superior noses at people of simple faith, people who just loved Jesus, people who just held precious His precepts and confessed their sin and loved their brethren from the heart. How sappy, how sappy is that? thought this group of spiritually superior people. You see, this group of people that was gaining momentum by the time this epistle had been written had ascended, they thought, to a higher level of spiritual knowledge and insight. And over time, they had developed very subtly at first. And by the way, these things also always begin in a subtle way. They don't look like heresy when they begin, but they developed an entirely new version of Christianity. In their minds, it was a superior version of Christianity. We understand some things that no one, you know, this is simple people. They just don't get this thing. We are the enlightened ones. It was available in their minds only to a select few, to the elite, the enlightened, the enlightened, the intelligentsia. They were, in a word, the knowers. Indeed, some of these people became known as a group later on as the Gnostics. The word Gnostic comes from the Greek word gnosis, which means to know. So that now instead of simple obedience, holding precious the precepts of Christ, loving your brethren from the heart as being what was revered and treasured among the believers and the believing community, now what was revered was what you know. And how well you could say it. Enlightened knowledge was now revered. And it effectively created two classes of Christians in the church. In fact, they had specific words. That was, first of all, the sukekoi. The sukekoi was the group. That's a Greek word. And it just meant kind of the ordinary believer, the simple believer, not very advanced. And the superior ones would look at them. And this word I'm using, they were just kind of the saps. You know, they were that goofy ones who just loved Jesus. Yeah, right. I just loved Jesus. But I don't want to hear that anymore. And then there was the second category, the pneumatoi. The pneumatoi. Pneuma. Pneumas. The spirit. They were the spiritual ones. And their spiritual ascendance was not born of simple purity, love, devotion to Christ. Their ascendance was because of how much they knew. they were again the enlightened the advanced now the practical effect of this on your everyday simple believer had begun to go deeper than just feeling like a second-class citizen now just stop and think about the second-class citizen i i think you can possibly relate to how that would feel if you were let's say a simple believer and and bottom line for you was i mean you didn't know a lot about this or that and you kind of got nervous around people who talked about deep things of theology not that deep things of theology was wrong or anything, but all you just love Jesus. And then these little philosophical debates would start bouncing back and forth in the church and even in the broader church. And it just kind of felt like someone's ability to play theological volleyball back and forth was the real deal. And they'd ask you a question and you'd go, I don't know, I just love Jesus. You'd just feel like the stupidest person on earth. I just love Jesus. Go away. The problem in these churches is that it had gone past that problem. You see, these simple believers that John is writing to had actually begun to wonder if they were the real deal. How can we know that we have come to know him? They had begun to question of themselves, the operative word there being what? Know. The knowers seem to know. And these knowers, these intelligentsia types, these enlightened ones, are telling us we don't know. In fact, it says that they were leaving, these enlightened ones, these spiritually superior ones, were leaving the simple fellowship. And as they left, the simple believers were left feeling they're leaving us. And it seems like they have it and we don't. And they were left wondering if they were in the faith at all. Here's the deal. Pull it together. For the first time in their Christian life, these dearly beloved little children who John loved had begun to struggle with an issue that they had never faced before. Assurance. How can I know that I have come to know him? How do I know that I belong to God? These knowers say we don't. All through the epistle. In fact, this is what the epistle is about. John is saying, in effect, you guys, you dear children, you who I love so much, dearly beloved, It's just not that complicated. I need to remind you of some things. Let me ask you some questions. Do you love Jesus? Do you hold precious His precepts? I don't even ask you if you did them every time. Do you hold them precious? Do you keep them, guard them, watch them? Do you abide in His life? Do you love the brethren from the heart? Do you confess out loud when you blow it? Are you willing and consistently able and willing to bring into the light the things you hide in the dark? Yeah, that's how you know. That's how you know. Don't, here's the word, don't you dare let these spiritually superior people who think they're in because of what they know intimidate you. They went out from us because they were never of us. You're thinking you don't fit in with them. They don't fit in with you. You are the real deal, John said. That's what he's fighting for here. Very important you get that. here verse 4 now this verse that I said earlier gave me a chill my paraphrase with this understanding now involved my paraphrase is this anyone who claims an ascendant superior version of Christianity because of what they claim to know but doesn't hold as precious simple obedience to his precepts is a liar get this what John is saying is this what you know in your head is not how you know that you belong to God you love Christ you hold precious his precepts you love the brethren from the heart you confessing your sin I'm here to tell you says John it's just not that complicated see that's how you know it's not about ascendant knowledge you don't have to be smart isn't that good news You can be smart. I mean, God uses some smart people. Are you grateful for minds like C.S. Lewis? Minds, sharp, humble before God, who are able to use words to expound great truth and allow us to enter in because of their ability to use their mind. Deep levels of spirit life, but they're humble before God. You can be smart. Isn't it good news to you that you don't have to be? See, anybody can love Jesus. Even you can do it. Even I can do it. My kid can do it. We can do this. Don't let anybody intimidate you. Says John, he is fighting for you, simple believer. Let me tell you a little bit more about these false teachers. Don't have a lot of time. I want you to just get a little glimpse of this. Beyond false teachers, they had some very specific names. I mean, all that John calls them is liars, there's a name calling, but they had history records that there were some groups of people, three that we know of historically. There was a group called the Cerinthians, the followers of Cerinthus, another group called the Docetists, which comes from the Greek word tussim, dokeo, tussim, I'll explain that in a second. Third group are the Gnostics. Most scholars that I read in terms of recent scholarship believed that the Gnostics were not fully formed or developed until about the second century. So the Cerinthians and the Docetists kind of became eventually the Gnostics. And I told you all of that, not so much that you need to know it, but I just wanted you to know that I knew who these guys were. So I just wanted you to know all that. I don't have time to get into all of their stuff. I did want you to know that, that this is a historical fact, these people's existence. But I do want to give you enough of their teaching to illustrate to you how what they taught undermined three foundational realities of Christian faith. Their teaching, first of all, undermined the belief and confidence in Christ as being truly God. They attacked the deity of Christ, first of all. And that's going to be a major theme later on in chapter 2, and we'll get to that later. So I'll address that out a little bit more. The docetists, for instance, taught what was called the philosophical dualism, which believed that only spirit was good and all physical was bad. And what that did with the deity of Christ was simply this. If only spirit is good and all physical is bad and evil, they could not conceive that God would incarnate himself inside a physical body. Therefore, Jesus wasn't God. Because God wouldn't do that. Evil or physical things are evil. They're bad. They're corrupt. And so any manifestation people saw of Christ, they only seemed to see it. the docetist, to seem. Jesus only seemed to be God. He was a phantom. He was a vapor, which, by the way, is part of why John began this epistle the way he did. Remember how he started? The things which we have what? Seen and what? Heard and handled with our hands. Part of what he's doing there, we didn't know this at the beginning, was he was arguing with and confronting the docetists who said he was just a vapor. He wasn't a vapor. He was real. That leads to the second thing that they're teaching undermined, and undermined obedience is necessary and normative. Now, their teaching undermine this a couple of ways. First of all, when they undermine Jesus as being God, the bottom line is this. If Jesus really isn't God, if He isn't Lord, if He isn't King, why on earth would I care that much what He thinks about how I should do my life? See, you may not be a docetist. You may not even know what a docetist is or what they teach. But if you have a faulty Christology, if in your mind and in your heart you do not see Jesus as King of kings and Lord of lords. Let me ask you, why on earth would you care what he says about how you do your life? I promise you, if you have a faulty Christology, it affects your obedience. Why would you obey? You obey who you believe this morning is king, and it may not be Jesus. Okay, that's one way that their teaching undermined obedience. Another way was back to this philosophical dualism. Philosophical dualism. Spirit is good, flesh is evil. What it allowed them to do is what many of us do. In fact, I confronted a couple of weeks ago, we live this split-off life. I have my spiritual life, and then I have my real life, and they're just kind of separate. And I go to church, and I sing my songs, and I do my little spiritual deal, and I say my little creed, but it has no effect on my real life because they're separate. They were able to see themselves as saved, holy, righteous, because spiritual is good, and I can live my real physical life any way I want without seeing a disconnect. They would see themselves as secure because they prayed the little prayer and they know the little creed. It had no effect on their physical life. This is the person who goes to church, sings the songs, raises their hands, all excited, gets a tear in their eye, rah, rah, rah, goes home and sleeps with someone who's not their spouse, and never in that behavior sees a disconnect. John says this to that person, you're not only deceived, chapter 1, but when you say you know God and you live in such a way that totally ignores everything Jesus says about how to do your life, but you say you know Him, but you ignore everything He says, you're a liar. Because if you really knew Him, you wouldn't be perfect. He made that clear in chapter 1. If you say you've never sinned or you don't sin, you're a liar. So I'm not saying you'd be perfect, but if you really knew him, you would hold precious his precepts. Divide in his truth, confess your sin, and love the people of God, which leads to the final thing that they're teaching undermined. It undermined love. You see this in verses 8 through 11. See, in their perception of themselves as the elite, they eliminated love. They separated themselves from people that they thought beneath them. And who was beneath them? Simple believers. You know, these sappy people who just loved God, who held precious His precepts, who were careful to do all that He said and taught, who desired to walk even as He walked, who routinely confessed sin, loved the brethren from the heart. What losers they are, these elite people thought. See, these simple believers couldn't keep up. when the debate would start and the theological or philosophical volleyball would be batted back and forth. And oh, what fun that was. You'd hit one of these theological volleyballs to a simple believer, and they would drop it. Have you ever played volleyball? And somebody on your team, every time the ball comes to them, they go, oh, and they just miss the ball. Get off our team. What's happening here? I was happy to throw the volleyball around, theological truth, philosophical stuff. The ball comes to them, they drop it. I mean they didn't know what the soteriological ramifications of the ontological view had to do with the juxtaposition of the redactionist theory and neither do I see all they knew was that they loved Jesus and all they knew was that they held precious his precepts. And all they knew is that they routinely confessed their sin and all they knew is they loved the brethren from the heart and when they didn't they confessed it and did what they could to remedy it. What saps. We wrapped this up with a story. A guy by the name of Jim Roberts, a family therapist in Kansas City, was visiting the fourth grade class of his son. They'd organized at one point in the day's events what was called a balloon stomp. You might have seen this game or played this game. Each child has a balloon tied to their ankle with a string. The object of the game is to stamp out all the balloons in the room until one is left and the one who's left is the winner. It's a delightful little game where basically what you learn to do is guard your balloon from everybody else at the same time stomping out theirs. Teaching all sorts of values, everybody for themselves and each against all. It's kind of teaching little 10th to 4th grade kids how to survive the corporate world that's to come, you know. That's a kid's game. Lots of running, noise, laughter, all the balloons are shredded. The winner is presented and everybody's excited about the winner. At least the winner is excited about the winner. Not many other people. But then a disturbing thing happens, according to Roberts. Another class joined them. A class of mentally handicapped children was brought in and prepared to play the same game. He says, my heart sank. As I saw what was happening, and I wanted to spare these kids from the brawl that was about to take place. See, these kids didn't have the foggiest notion what they were supposed to do. Finally, a few began to figure out that the balloons were supposed to be stomped, and gradually it caught on and began to spread. But as the game got underway, it was clear these kids had missed the spirit of the game. You see, they went about methodically and intentionally getting their own balloons stomped. One little boy held his balloon carefully in place. Here you go. so his best friend could pop it. And then his best friend did the same thing, held his balloon for him so he could pop it. And when all of the balloons were popped, the entire class cheered in unison. We win! Let me tie that in with this text. You see, those dearly beloved little children, they didn't know much, did they? They didn't know how to play the game. All they knew how to do was what? Was love. That's all they knew how to do. Hear the word of the Lord. By this we know that we have come to know Him. If we hold precious His precepts, if we abide in this life, if we're confessing our sin, and if we love one another from the heart. The last Wednesday afternoon when we met with Dan and Sandy, many things were said that were wonderful and healing and profound. Among them was something Sandy said, and one of the reasons it stuck out in my mind, because it fits so well with this text. What she said was this, as we were kind of explaining how we finally came to this, and all of us lamenting why it took so long, But she said this. This is pretty much a quote. She said, you know, it really came down to this for us. Obey God and love the brethren. By this we know that we have come to know him. When it all comes down to this for us, obey God and love the brethren. And all God's people said, amen. Let's pray. Oh, Father, make us like children. These little children who just didn't get it. They didn't know how to play the game. Lord, a few weeks ago, I prayed that we would become afraid of the dark. That we would become afraid of living in the dark and bring our things out into the light. I pray, Father, that you would make us a people who don't know how to play the game. that all we know how to do is love. Hold precious your precepts. Love one another from the heart. Courageously bring into the light what we tend to hide in the dark, to be continually confessing our sin. And I just know that as we live that out, we will know, not only will we know, but the whole world will know that we have come to know you. By this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one for another. Pray these things upon us in Jesus' name. Amen.
