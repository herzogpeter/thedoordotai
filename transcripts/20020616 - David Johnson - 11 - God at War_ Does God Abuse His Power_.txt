Let's pray as we go to the Word. Assist me to proclaim is my request. I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. It was three weeks ago that we discovered in our study of the book of Joshua and the crossing of the Jordan River that the path to power and the kingdom of God often involves a willingness to follow God into the deep water of a risky obedience, but that it is precisely then, when we take that first step, often a very frightening step, that the power of God is released and the waters begin to part, providing dry ground on which to walk, not only for us, but for future generations. The principle was this, That when we step into the deep water of a risky obedience, God will make a way. But what we also discovered three weeks ago was this, that this call to a risky obedience was not a one-time thing. For as the people of God began to move into and possess the land, the question was always the same. Will the people of God continue to trust, believe, and obey God, even when it's risky to do so? Even when they do not understand? Well, the answer to that question in the early going is yes. So they crossed the Jordan River, and in obedience to God, they built the altar with stones of remembrance, and the sons of Israel were circumcised, and the walls of Jericho came tumbling down. And when they came tumbling down, we read these words in Joshua 6, verse 21, where we kind of pick up the action this morning. that they utterly destroyed everything in the city, did the Israelites. Both man and woman, young and old, the ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword, all were killed, verse 24, and they burned the city with fire and all that was in it. Quick question before we move on through this story. Does any of that stuff bother you? Every man, every woman, young and old, even the animals, killed them all. Well, it bothers me. It has for years. What's up with that? Why did they do that? Well, actually, if it bothers you that they did it, the answer to why they did it will bother you even more. Because the answer is this. They were told to. Deuteronomy chapter 7 verse 1 says this. God is talking to Moses here, just to set the context a bit, In preparation for the people of God crossing the Jordan River and entering the promised land. Something they never did. But he's speaking to them of preparation for how to do it. When the Lord your God shall bring you, verse 1 of chapter 7, into the land where you are entering to possess it. And so clear away many nations before you. The Hittites, the Girgisites, Samurites, well, Parasites, all those people. The Canaanites is who they are. Seven nations greater and stronger than you. And when the Lord your God shall deliver them before you, and you shall defeat them. Then you shall utterly destroy them. These are my instructions, says God. You shall make no covenant with them and show no favor to them. Furthermore, you shall not intermarry with them. You shall not give your daughters to their sons. You shall not take your daughters for their sons, for they will turn your sons away from following me to serve other gods. Then the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you, and he will quickly destroy you. Whoa! But thus you shall do to them. You shall tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars and shoo down their asherim and burn their graven images with fire. For you are a holy people, set apart people to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people of his own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. Now, all of that stuff reveals to us an aspect of the character and face of God that, quite frankly, we do not understand. And would in many cases just as soon ignore. Pretend it isn't there. In the second century a guy by the name of Marcion saying that there was an irreconcilable difference. Between the loving God revealed to us through Jesus in the New Testament. And the cruel violent God of the Old Testament suggested removing all such references of God and violence. In the Old Testament from scripture. And that certainly is one solution. That would take care of the problem. Another solution would be to ignore these passages altogether, which I have managed to do for several years, and quite effectively, I might add, but not anymore for a variety of reasons. Chief among them is this, that it's staring us in the face. I mean, it's hard to go through Joshua and not notice this somewhere along the line. It was actually a few months ago when we began to kind of dabble in Joshua that I personally became curious and began to wonder and do some study on my own, not intending to preach it. I was intending to ignore it. But in the study, just kind of did it on my own, I discovered some big picture things that speak to and reveal. Indeed, more than just reveal or speak to, they underline and emphasize some very important aspects of what we have been examining for several weeks relative to this path to power. But to get to all of that, to connect the dots and see the connection with this and the rightly ordered power, we have to do some work. I had to do some work. And I invite you into some thinking this morning, thinking and work that I believe will pay off for things we need to know and understand about the kingdom of God, about the ways of God, and that the God of the Old Testament is the same God that Jesus revealed as being first and foremost a God who is love. So what I'm going to give you this morning are four observations, four things we need to know to somehow begin at least to make sense of all of this. Number one, in a day that we have been hearing a lot about holy war on TV and in the paper, You need to know, first thing, right out of the chute, kind of bottom level stuff, is that the term holy war is never found in Scripture, because among other reasons, there's nothing very holy about war. Indeed, again, to just kind of give you some place to start, it's important to note that the very first mention or episode of violence of any kind in Scripture does not occur until after the fall, after sin enters in, after things are defiled, meaning that violence was never to be part of the pattern, never to be part of the plan when Cain killed Abel. It's the first place we see it. This, by the way, is in stark contrast to virtually every other religion in ancient Israel's day whose gods were violent by nature. In other words, they were initiators of violence. It was their desire, it was their intent to do violence. Now, there's a little thing here. I need to kind of just clarify some things as we move through this. When I refer to their gods, other gods, you need to know this, that their gods, false gods, are real gods. And some of us struggle with that. We are monotheists. We believe in one true God. But the operative word there is true. There are, in fact, many gods. In fact, if you just need some biblical perspective on this, the Bible talks about the God of this world who is what? Who is who? Satan. There are real gods, false gods. They are not the one true God, but these real gods have real power to do real damage. Ultimately, their deepest desire is to bring the souls of men and women to ruin. In fact, it's interesting, you know, in terms of spiritual warfare context, Many of us are kind of familiar with the idea that we have an enemy. It's the enemy of our souls, Satan, and he wants to destroy us. You need to know something. Satan wants to destroy the people who think Satan's cool. Do you know that Satan is a destroyer? That is what he does. And even people who would maybe in a conscious way bow and give allegiance to the enemy, to a false god, Satan's desire is to kill them too. Satan hates you and has a horrible plan for your life. By the way, you want to know a place this gets panned out in front of us every day? It's on the news. Terrorist bombers who go in, strapped onto themselves, killing as many innocent people as they possibly can. Guess who else gets killed? They do. And they think it's a big God thing. Here's the God. It is a God thing. It's a false God thing whose design is to kill everybody, even the people who serve them. What do you mean? They go to paradise. That's what they say. They go to paradise. And you heard a thing about 72 virgins. They get 70, whoa. What kind of heaven is that? Especially for the 72 virgins. I mean, you know what they do. It's probably heaven for them and hell for them, and, you know, it's the same place. I know you're laughing, and I was hoping you would, but... You think about the messages from a false god about women. Think about living in that culture and even if they're not conscious of the messages they're getting. That message is like that. What heaven is. What women are for. How they can be used. It just goes on. Satan. See here's the deal. Get this historical perspective. While in different cultures at different times in history these gods go by different names. We've spoken of Baal and we'll speak of some others today. They all come down. False gods all come down and emanate from one entity. the God of this world, the enemy of men's souls, even Satan himself, whose primary task and deepest desire is to what? Steal, kill, and destroy. It is his nature. The point I'm making is that is not God's nature. And that is precisely why no violence occurs in Scripture until the deceiver has deceived. And sin has entered in. That's when Cain kills Abel. And from that moment on, from that original violent expression, the primary indicator of the fallenness of man is violence. And people's attraction to violence, two most popular kinds of movies, are sex and violence. Indeed, violence is what disturbed God most from the very beginning. In Genesis 6, in the days of Noah, it says, the earth was already corrupt, beyond belief corrupt, in God's sight. His creation had kind of spun out of control and the primary characteristic is this. It was full of violence. So God said in effect it's beyond the pale. I'm starting this whole thing over with Noah. And the rains came down and the floods came up. And in his restart everything changed. No it didn't. It didn't change. In fact, if we're going to understand the Old Testament world and these issues we're trying to decipher this morning, if we're going to try to understand why God does what he does in the Old Testament relative to war, why he says what he says, we need to understand the extent to which life in those days was dominated by violence and war. It was in fact a culture of war. And while we live with a lot of violence, it's on TV, it's maybe in our neighborhoods, living in a culture of war, you just need to know, it is not something we understand. It's not something we live with. Give me an example. 2 Corinthians 11.1. It's the story of David and Bathsheba. It's introduced with these words. In the spring, when kings go off to war, stop right there. A little perspective. We live in Minnesota. Because of that, we experience four distinct seasons. Every year, winter, spring, summer, fall. Winter being the toughest. Most Minnesotans I know spend the entire winter, after they're done with their snowmobiling and their skiing, spend the entire rest of the winter praying for spring. I pray that global warming is true. May it be. I buy aerosol cans, hand them out to my children. We spray them. Poke a hole. Please. Some of you are groaning. My daughter was here last night at the dinner table. We had a wonderful fight. Dad, some people don't think you're kidding. Heard a wonderful speech about the environment. She's right. I still pray for global warming to be true. We're ever searching for signs of spring, which for Minnesotans are actually signs of hope. Now you may or may not know this But there are actually regions in our country Where a sure sign of spring Is the changing of the weather It gets nicer Not here You were here this spring and most of you were Winter came just in time for spring No true Minnesota 9-0 counts on the weather To tell them spring is coming So we look for other things for me it's baseball and not just baseball but spring training it could be 20 below zero there could be 6 feet of snow on the ground but if I'm in my car and I turn on the radio and I hear that the twins are in Fort Myers hope rises because spring is coming so it's in the spring you know when the twins go off to train that's our culture, that's what I live in the Old Testament is a different culture in the spring, you know, when kings go off to war and kill, and are killed. It's just the way life was. It's who they were, it's what they did, it's how they lived. Now, there are places in the world right now that are that way, a war culture. I saw a picture in the paper not too long ago of a man in Afghanistan holding a bloody axe with a toothless smile, boasting that he had decapitated 1,300 people with this axe, infidels, he called them. While things like that horrify us and shock us, as well they should, life in ancient Israel was just that way. Which leads to the second observation, second thing we need to know, if we're going to decipher this, understand this war kind of language. It's this, that war was one of the unfortunate evil realities, much like polygamy, slavery, concubines, misogyny, divorce, that pervaded the world into which Israel was born, from which Israel was being called. Get this. None of that. Polygamy, slavery, concubines, misogyny, divorce, war. None of that was God's desire or design. But at this time in human history, it was what he had to work with. It was where he had to start to call his lost creation back to himself to somehow redeem this thing that he had created that had spun out of control. So what's the plan? To call this thing back. The plan was this, to call out a people of his own. To form a nation. And then to move one step at a time all the way to and through Jesus, all the way to and through the cross and resurrection, which would culminate that plan by showing the human race, or at least those who would pay attention, a better way. Which leads to the third observation, the third thing we need to know. It's this. The words we read about in the Old Testament as commanded by God are all expressions of God's judgment on the very evil that was destroying the creation that he loved. Which at that time, by the way, was in ways that defied description embodied in the Canaanite culture that Joshua and the people of God were moving into. Note also this, however, that even when we're dealing with the kind of evil that is embodied in the Canaanite culture that I'll describe in a minute, God is very slow to bring judgment, Especially finality kinds of judgment And when you say wipe them all out That's a final judgment That's a final thing God is very slow to do that Patient always For the possibility of repentance Well where do you get that Dave? Well there's a number of places The easiest, the best place is Genesis 15-16 Where we see a very important passage in this regard In Genesis 15 God is speaking to Abraham promising a land for his people. But what he said to Abraham was this. You cannot occupy this land yet. And the land, guess what it was? It was the promised land. It was Canaan, which is where Joshua is now. But way before that, it's Abraham. You can't occupy it now for one important reason. Here's the reason. Because the sin of the Amorites, who were the Canaanites, has not yet reached full measure. But in the fourth generation, they will return here. they being the people of God who will return to the promised land. The sin of the Amorites has not yet reached full measure. I'm going to talk about the full measure for a second, but before that, I want you to get this. What God is saying there is this, that even in Abraham's day, this culture was defiled, but it wasn't yet past what we would call the point of no return. And such a point for people exists. I don't know where it is. God's in charge of discerning that. So in the spirit of God is not willing that any should perish, 2 Peter 3, 9, God in Genesis 15 is offering mercy to the Canaanites in the form of time to repent. In fact, he gave them a lot of time. He gave them to the fourth generation. He gave them to the time of Joshua. A word about the measure of evil. How far gone? were the Canaanites really? Well, it turns out, if you've been here at Open Door for a while, you know maybe a little bit more about the Canaanite culture than you thought. First of all, Canaan was the center of the worship for Baal, and we have referred to Baal worship several times, and all that is involved in Baal worship relative to three things. Remember, money, sex, and power. In fact, it was our understanding of Baal worship and how Canaan was involved in that that got us into this whole series on money, sex, and power. At the beginning of the series, we also noted that Baal, even by a different name, is still Baal. Remember that? And that we identified the fact that we live in a culture that worships three things, money, sex, and power. And I don't care what you call it, that's Baal worship. And much like the primary God, false God, that the people of Israel continually were seduced by was Baal. Am I going way out on a limb here to say that the primary God that the church of Jesus Christ gets seduced by in this day and age is the same false God. Money, sex, power. Guess what that is? Baal. He also worshipped a God called Molech who demanded among other things human sacrifice. It was an awful thing where people were never sure when they were going to go or be sacrificed and horribly killed. But particularly, their human sacrifice was directed toward children, often firstborn children. Today, I think millions of little children in our culture are sacrificed to the god Molech through abortion. These children in Canaan weren't in the womb. They were alive when they were eradicated. I don't think actually we can imagine what it felt like to live in a Canaan culture. To live there, to grow up there, to be a child there, wondering if your sister or brother would be next. So let me explain it this way, with a more contemporary example. Consider in your mind Nazi Germany as being a place that maybe just began to approach what I'm describing here as the full measure of sin. And I don't think Nazi Germany reached the full measure of sin. They would have had to at least go longer. But just use this as a way for us to go, Oh, okay, why do we have done that? One instance, one child, recorded for us by historian Philip Friedman, is quoted by Greg Boyd in his book, God at War. And by the way, if you're interested in pursuing the things I'm talking about today, especially as warfare in the Old Testament, physical warfare corresponds to spiritual warfare, I really recommend Greg's book called God at War. An eyewitness account of what happened to one Jewish girl living in the Warsaw Ghetto during Nazi occupation. Greg writes this, quoting this Philip Friedman. So she was a little girl, the daughter of a physician. During an action, one of the German soldiers became aware of her beautiful diamond-like dark eyes. I could make two rings of them, he said. one for myself and one for my wife his colleague is holding the little girl let's see whether they really are so beautiful better yet, let's examine them in our hands one of the wittiest proposes to take the eyes out what happens next is that the fainting child is lying on the floor instead of eyes, two wounds are staring the mother, driven mad is held by other women later, both are executed being deemed by the Nazis useless. Now that is a horrifying story. But as horrifying as it is, now what you need to do is multiply that horror of that one child and add it to another and another and another and another and another and another. And when you do that, you get Nazi Germany. Now add a child to a child to a child for generation after generation after generation and now you're close to Canaan. and now you're close to what it means for a culture to reach the full measure of sin and when you begin to get a handle on what it means to reach the full measure of sin you know what happens? it's already happening inside of some of you maybe your question changes remember the driving question of the whole talk the question was this how could God bring this kind of judgment when you get this full measure of sin thing in your mind the question changes from how on earth could God bring this kind of judgment to how on earth could God wait so what long fourth observation that in these Old Testament wars commanded by God more is involved and more is at stake than the military conquests of physical land Greg's book once again God at War is helpful to us here quoting Greg he says this God's various commands that the Israelites go to war against other nations must be understood against the backdrop of God's cosmic warfare what's at stake in such wars is not simply earthly territories or the dominion of earthly governments from the perspective of the Old Testament keep that in mind this is from the perspective of the Old Testament what's at stake is the kingly rule of the one true God. The struggle of nations to dominate or at least resist Israel in the Old Testament is also and even more fundamentally a struggle of other gods with whom these nations are in league. That's why, by the way, many do in fact view these Old Testament battles as being symbolic of spiritual warfare. Spiritual warfare, which is just as real, though not as physically apparent as the battles we see in the Old Testament. It's also why, by the way, according to Greg, and I fully agree with this, that when the Israelites break their covenant vows with God and align themselves with other gods like Baal, for instance, God goes to battle against Israel. See, that's another thing that we struggle with. How could God fight against his own people? Here's the picture you need to get. there is this war going on. And God is warring against evil. And when his people, he loves his people, but when his people go and they find themselves in the enemy camp, making friends with the enemy, and that's where God is shooting, you might just get shot. We call them natural consequences. It's just natural consequences of sin. That's a kind of judgment right there. I mean, I don't want to make this too simplistic and miss something maybe, but the picture I have is of God coming against evil, coming against evil, and then we join ourselves with Baal. We suffer some incredible consequences. We go, how come I'm suffering like this? And God says, what were you doing there? I'm firing as hard as I can against that. You don't want to get nailed. Don't go there. Let me give some perspective on that. Earlier in the book of Joshua, chapter 5, this is after they've crossed the Jordan, but it's just before they defeat Jericho. It says this, that Joshua lifted up his eyes, had an amazing experience. A man was standing in front of him with his sword drawn, and Joshua said to him, so the sword drawn means he's ready for battle, and so Joshua wants to know this. Here's my question. Are you for us, or are you for our adversaries? And the man said, no. And Joshua said, what? I mean it wasn't a yes no question it was an either or question. If you read further in the text it becomes very clear however that what this guy was doing was changing the question and this guy was what's called a theophany an appearance of God. So God is talking to Joshua and he changes the question. Joshua the question isn't is God on your side? Joshua I've been telling you since chapter 1 that God's on your side. Every place you put your feet, I will give it. So be strong and courageous, for I will be with you. I will be with you. I will be with you. I am on your side. I can't tell you how much I'm on your side. But right now today, the question is not, is God on your side? Today the question is this, Joshua. Are you on God's side? Joshua fell on his face and worshipped God and said, I'm on your side. as I reflect on that story and let it into my own heart it dawns on me that I have spent years of my ministry life doing a very important thing over and over and over again doing a very important thing reminding you and everyone I come in contact with when I go places to speak I just right at the top of my agenda I want to tell people how much God loves them You know why? Because he does. And I want to tell people how much he's for you. And how much he's on your side. You know why? Because he is. But sometimes God changes the question. And I am absolutely convinced that there are some in this room, men and women, boys and girls, who need this morning to hear from God. God changed the question. You see, the question is not always, is God on your side? Sometimes the question is this, are you on God's side? So choose now this day who you will serve. You will never answer a more important question. Well, most of the other battles in Joshua can be summarized quite quickly in chapter 9. And by the way, just because they can be summarized quickly doesn't mean I'll do that. Anyway, just a little joke. It's a little joke. Yes, they can be quickly. Chapter 9, Israel does not inquire of God. Allows the Gibeonites to stay in the land. The result is they lead them into Baal worship. Chapter 10, Israel repents. Comes back. God graciously receives them. Everything's back to normal. Israel inquires of the Lord. Obeys the Lord. Defeats five Amorite kings. By chapter 12, 31 kings are defeated. So the score is this. Israel 31. Canaanites nothing. But, as you fast forward the videotape, we discover that this is not, in fact, a happily ever after story. The era of the judges is up and down. Because that's true, there came a desire in the hearts of people that they brought to God, God, if we only had a king. So they asked God for a king. And they get a king. Their first king was Abimelech, the son of Gideon. One of 70 brothers. I didn't say that wrong. 70 brothers. They didn't have much to do. Ha! First thing Abimelech does is kill all 70 of his brothers. The cycle of violence continues. But they still want a king. The prophet Samuel warns them, God will give you a king, but you need to know this, that if you have a king, he'll make your boys soldiers. He'll march them in front of his chariots. We don't care, said the people. We want a king to lead us in the battle so we can be what again? Powerful. It's all about power. So we can be powerful again. We love those conquest days when the walls came down. So give us the power again. Well, God gave them kings, three. Saul, David, and Solomon. And there's violence between Saul and David. There's violence between David and his sons. But the truth is, even in that, those ended up being the glory days for Israel. The ascendant days, the conquering days, and here's an incredible word for you, those were the kingdom days. They had a kingdom. David was the king of the kingdoms. It was a united kingdom. Soon after that, however, the kingdom soon after Solomon, The kingdom was divided to the northern and the southern kingdom. Soon after that, the northern kingdom was defeated by the Assyrians. And soon after that, the southern kingdom was defeated by the Babylonians. And the people of God were in exile and in bondage to Babylon, which means finally this. It's an incredible picture. That the people of God have ended up exactly where they started. Isn't that incredible? In subjugation to another power. It's a picture of people of God in the Old Testament. Would I be way off guard to say it's a picture of the church as well? Who want to serve God and love God, but want to worship Baal too. By the way, that's what Israel did. They never, they never turned their, oh, we love God. Just want to do Baal on the side. And ended up in subjugation. Still God's people. But not living free. And wondering, where are the provinces of God? We thought it was even. I'm wondering if it's real. This then, beloved, is the great spiritual and theological crisis in the nation's history in the Old Testament. Because now they are asking the question, is this real? Is the covenant true? Is it over? Are the promises of God still available to us? And some, as you can imagine, continue to dream and keep the dream alive of, here's that word again, the kingdom. And hope for the return of the glory days. The days of deliverance and conquest. Like we yearn for those days of Pentecost. And for most of them, however, the fulfillment of that dream of the kingdom returning and being an everyday experience, the returning could only be imagined by them through raw, physical, military power. So their prayer was this. God, give us again a deliverer like Moses a warrior like Joshua, a king like David. But then something began to happen. Something began to shift. Something began to move. Imperceptively at first, right in the middle of this crisis point in history, a prophet of God arose with a new and better vision. Something that no human being had ever conceived before. For what dawned on him through revelation of God was this, that what Israel needed and what the world needed was not another shot at the old way. Was not the capacity to wage war with greater violence. But what was needed was a whole new kind of person. A recreated person. We're going to start from scratch a different way. Saw the prophet and the prophet's name was Jeremiah. And this is what he saw. And this is what he said in Jeremiah 31, beginning in verse 31. Behold, days are coming, declares the Lord. So get your hopes up, people of God, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, the northern and the southern kingdom. Not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them, declares the Lord. but this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days declares the Lord I will put my law within them and on their heart I will write it and I will be their God and they shall be my people and they shall not teach again each man his neighbor and each man his brother saying know the Lord for they shall know the Lord for they shall all know me from the least to the greatest declares the Lord for I will forgive their iniquity and their sin I will remember no more. And then came another prophet. His name was Zechariah. And this is what he saw. And this is what he said. Zechariah chapter 9 verse 9. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion. Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem. Behold, your king is coming. Stop right there. Everything we've prayed for is about to happen. We're getting David back. We're getting Joshua back. Get your hopes up. He is just and endowed with salvation. That's the one we want. But he's humbled and mounted on a donkey. And all God's people said, And the prophet, maybe knowing that would be their response, said, it's worse than a donkey. It's not even a full-sized donkey. like a Geo Metro donkey. That's what it says. Well, it doesn't say Geo Metro. Even on a colt. It's not even a full-grown donkey. All of which raises a very good question. What kind of king rides into the occupied city, the occupied capital city, Jerusalem, is where he rode, on a donkey? well one king did and this is what he came to do says it in verse 10 he came to take away the chariots of Ephraim he came to stop the war horses of Jerusalem and to break the bow of battle and he came with a whole new message he came preaching peace see it took this long in human history beloved for at least a few to understand and it only started with two. A little prophet here, by the way, that nobody listened to. Jeremiah was the weeping prophet, not only because he saw the pain of his people, but because nobody listened to him. But a few did. And what they were listening to and coming to realize was that the old way did not work. That violence and force, which seemed to be, and still seems to be today, go read your paper today, it still seems to be today the strongest force on earth was not nearly strong enough to usher in God's kingdom. Was not nearly strong enough to transform the hearts of men and women. See, ushering the kingdom of God and transforming the hearts of men and women would take a king riding on a donkey. would take a king not driven by the love of power. It would take a king who is driven by the power of love. Who defeats a system of death, which is the Canaanite culture. Not with more killing. Not with getting bigger and killing. He would defeat it, but he would defeat it by dying himself. and coming out alive. And a few were ready to listen 2,000 years ago. It started so small, just a handful of disciples sitting down on a hillside in Galilee. And they were drawn to what he said, but they didn't get it at first. They wanted to, and eventually they did, but he confused them because he said things like this. In fact, he didn't say, blessed are the warriors and blessed are the conquerors. He said, blessed are the peacemakers. And then it confounded him even more because he said things like this. You've heard it said, love your neighbor and hate your enemy. I say, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you and pray for them while they're persecuting you. For now at last it will be clear. that the people of God will not be a political nation wielding political or military power armed with swords and chariots or armed with slogans and power plays but a church the kind of church Tom Johnson talked about last week how many of you were here last week we'll insert Tom's tape right here the kind of church Tom talked about and if you didn't want to hear us we'd get the tape see he talked about a church he talked about our church marching in full regalia to Maple Grove ready he did talk about our church marching to Maple Grove armed with not much more than love and prayer. And boxes of donuts. Eager to serve. In fact, going to the heads of Maple Grove days and saying, how can we help and give us the jobs nobody wants? What a puny little thing. Every time you think you're doing a puny little thing, just put it in the category of a king who came on a donkey. Would you? Between services, somebody came up to me and said, you know, they just heard a story of these two missionaries in the Philippines, and one was killed by these Islamic rebels. And the story came out that these Islamic rebels who held this couple were kids. They were just kids. They'd been kind of brainwashed and influenced and pulled into this thing that normal kids, and under normal circumstances, those same kids wouldn't have done this. And one of the stories that came out was that these kids were starving to death. And this missionary would share his rights with them. And they all got saved. They all got saved. Such a little thing. He came riding on a donkey. To confound this violent perpetuation. remember the crusades you read about them in school Christians are embarrassed by them or Christians were going to win the world for God by just killing everybody else see what I'm talking about today is why events like the crusades or anything that smacks of power to get our way political, that happens in the church and I don't want to go there go there, I just don't have time go there in your mind, but I don't have time it's why those kinds of approaches are so beyond belief misguided because they completely missed the point of the gospel that the crusaders were trying to defend you see it was as if Jesus had never come and the church had never been born you see they totally missed the central message of the gospel and the central message of the gospel was this that Jesus did not come to kill the infidels he came to die for them and then to make the infidels his people, you and me. A people armed with not much more than love and power. Don't pick anything else up. And we have picked other things up. A people armed with not much more than love and power, Eager love and prayer. Did I say love and power the first time? That's not good. And I'm glad I noticed it, because that's not what I meant. I meant love and prayer. And don't pick up anything else. Eager to serve. Ready to endure suffering, if need be, so the lights can come on in the middle of a culture that is walking in darkness. Did I tell you about a vision I have of a church? Full of light. Full of people. Full of light. Are you feeling the stirrings of the Spirit among us? Are you hearing the call of God calling out his people at this time in history? I am too. Let's pray. Would you just be silent for a moment and listen to the Spirit of God speak whatever he wants to speak to you. Thank you. I want to thank you God for assisting me to proclaim. As you call your people out, I pray that we would hear your voice and ever respond with obedience and faith. so the lights can go on. I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen.
