See, Jesus is just the sweetest name we know. And that's why, Father, as we move now into the ministry of the Word, my request is this, that you would release the power of your spirits among us in giving us assistance to reveal the glory and the wonder of your Son, Jesus. And I pray that in the name of your Son, Jesus. Amen. Last week, if you were here, you know we began a new series of sermons that we're referring to as the way of the rabbi, our rabbi being Jesus. I ended the sermon last week with a question that I said I'd begin with today. The question is this, who's your rabbi? Because you have one, you know. Someone to whom you have given authority, who you believe at some level is the master of life. Because you've seen how maybe they do life, how they treat people, how they do their marriage, their business, how they handle their money, their sexuality, their issues of power and control, even how they deal with their anger. And because you're impressed by how they do those things, you follow them. Maybe at a distance, you may not even know them closely. And you may not even be conscious that you're doing it. But at some level, because you admire how they do their life, you want to be like them. Thus this question, who's your? Rabbi, to whom have you given authority? From whom do you get your information about life and how it works? Because the fact is this, if you don't decide things like that on purpose, you will decide things like that inadvertently by accident without much thought. So before you know it or think much about it, you'll be getting your information about life from the spirit of the age. You'll be getting your information about life or healthy sexuality, for instance, from somebody like Hugh Hefner or MTV. You'll be getting your information about healthy relationships from television soap operas or Jerry Springer or your buddies at school or your colleagues at work. Or maybe it's just what you think. You're your own kind of rabbi. You are the wonder wisdom guy. So who's your rabbi? Really important question. Really important life question. Needs to be, in fact, revisited from time to time. To whom have you given authority? From whom do you get your information about life and how it works? Last week, if you were here, I'm sure you recall that we began to learn about and tried to get a picture of the rabbinic tradition that was embodied in the educational system of Jesus' day, the educational system within which Jesus grew up, by which he was formed, where rabbis in Jesus' day were seen as masters of sorts. They were masters of Scripture because of their mastery of the Torah, the entire Word of God, Old Testament in that day from Genesis to Malachi, and because they were seen as masters of Scripture and spent their lives helping people learn how to live the Scriptures, they were also seen in some sense as masters of life to whom people would go. And among the things we learned last week about them was also this, that when a rabbi in Jesus' day would choose his talmudim, his disciples, and remember it was in those days the disciples who applied to be accepted by a rabbi, rabbis in Jesus' day never recruited disciples. And the process of approval to be accepted as a Talmudim, as a Talmid of a rabbi was grueling. We talked about it last week. And the reason it was grueling, this process to be accepted by a rabbi, was because what the rabbi was actually looking for in his disciples, his Talmudim, was not just a student who was smart. Because at this level, by the time you got to the place where you actually could come to a rabbi and said, could I please follow you? Do I have what it takes? At this level, if you got to that, these people were all smart. Having memorized the Torah by the time they were 10 years old in Beth Sefer, the entire Old Testament memorized by the time they were 15 in Beth Talmud, trained in the rabbinic art of answering questions with questions. They had been taught. They had learned how to think. So what the rabbi was looking for at this level, beyond whether they kind of had the information just in their head, was someone who they believed had the capacity to perpetuate their legacy as a rabbi. His interpretation of the Torah, which they referred to as their yoke. And Talmudim would be willing to take the yoke, or this rabbi's way of interpreting the text and the belief or the hope of the rabbi, and this was why he was picky, was that this young Talmud would be able to take my yoke, my way of interpreting Scripture, into the next generation. Indeed, what these rabbis were looking for when they were approving or either disqualifying these potential students was someone who they believed had what it took to become just like them, because they believed that's what it took. to perpetuate their cause into the next generation, their yoke, their way of interpreting Scripture. And when they found such a person that they believed it did in fact have what it took to do all that, they would speak to them these words, words that literally in Jesus' day would change this young person's life forever. Lechacharai. You are qualified to come and follow me. Come, follow me. and follow the rabbi, they would. Talked about it last week, sometimes to ridiculous extremes because they wanted not just to know what the rabbi knew, they wanted to be just like their rabbi. So they walked like him and talked like him. Sometimes they did it on purpose, but sometimes they just picked up things without even knowing that they were picking it up, mannerisms and ways of being. They'd study, memorize, and pray like their rabbi because the whole point was this. Everybody knew it was to be like him. But all of that was reserved for a very small group of people, for those who made the cut. Because the fact is this, most didn't make the cut. So most people in Jesus' day never heard those life-changing words, lechachorai, come follow me, because most in Jesus' day didn't have what it took to become a powerful rabbi's talmud. That is until one day a rabbi named Jesus showed up on the scene and walking by the Sea of Galilee in Matthew 4.18. It says that he saw two brothers, Simon, who was called Peter and Andrew, his brother. And they were casting a net into the sea for they were fishermen. And we dialed into what that meant last week. Because whatever else it means that they were fishermen, it means this, that they didn't make the cuts. They probably went to Bet Sefer and maybe even Bet Talmud. But if they're fishermen, it's because the rabbi said, no, son, you know the Torah. You love God. You need to go home and learn the family trade. And so they were fishermen. They didn't make the cut. And Jesus said to them, verse 19, Come follow me. And immediately, verse 20, they left their nets and followed him. Why? Remember we talked about that. It's always kind of odd. Why would they just leave? And I kind of speculated as I was a kid, I kind of thought them coming under some force. I would follow it like that. Here's why they immediately left. Because a rabbi, a great rabbi, Believes that we, if we choose to follow him, put our confidence in him, this rabbi believes that we have what it takes to be his talmudim, to carry his yoke, to perpetuate his cause into the next generation and into the next generation and into the next generation. He believes that we have what it takes, if we do indeed follow him, to become just like him. I recently heard a story by John Ortberg about a friend of his named Nick Coletti that I think fits here very well. Nick Coletti is actually the vice president of the San Francisco Giants baseball team. And Nick had gone with some scouts from the Giants to the Dominican Republic to check out some of their prospects there. I think some of you know that the Dominican Republic has produced a number of professional baseball players. guys like Sammy Sosa, Moiseis Alou, all the Alou brothers and all their relations. Alou is a big name from the Dominican Republican in baseball. What I noticed, said Coletti, first of all, was that most of these kids in the Dominican lived with their mothers and had never met their earthly fathers. Indeed, most had never been educated past the sixth grade. But there was this one young player in particular who really stood out and their coaching staff thought had tremendous ability, but he was timid because he was always afraid of making a mistake. So he played tentatively and far below his potential. So I asked one of the scouts who spoke Spanish to help me speak with him. And through this interpreter, I said, Listen, son, failure is part of the game. Failure, indeed, is part of life. You're going to blow it sometimes and make mistakes. Sosa does it. Alou does it. You're no different. You're going to do it, but you have a special gift that you need to use as best you can because we believe that you have what it takes to play this game of baseball at the professional level. Coletti then says, I wasn't sure if I was getting through to him. His head was down. He wouldn't look me in the eye until finally he looked up at me with tears streaming down his cheeks. I guess he heard I left two days later. As I was saying my goodbyes to the staff on this makeshift baseball field, in the middle of nowhere, I saw this kid waiting for me. I walked over to him. We shook hands, and I told him, I will be back from now until the earthly end of me. I will be back, and not just for baseball. I want to see you again. My heart yearns to help you and kids like you. Now, think about that story in relation to what we're talking about this morning, these weeks. You're a 16-year-old kid, which is about the age we think of the disciples when Jesus said to them, come follow me, a 16-year-old kid. You're living in the Dominican Republic or you're fishing because you've been told you didn't have what it takes. You got no father, no money, no education, no prospects, no future. You are destined to live a life of poverty that in all likelihood will be pretty brief. And then one day, a great rabbi, embodied in Nick Colletti, the vice president of the San Francisco Giants, comes to your God-forsaken little town and says, Kid, we think you have what it takes to be what you've always wanted to be if you put your confidence in me, if you pay attention to me, if you follow me, do you think if it was you, you'd leave your nets and follow a guy like that? How long do you think it would take you to leave your nets and follow? And immediately, Matthew chapter 4, they left their nets and followed him, believing if they put their confidence in him and began to follow him, pressed into him they could become just just takes my breath away, just like him Peter certainly believed that remember Matthew 14, I'm sure you do it's a well known and often told story of Peter and often what it's used to speak of is how brash and impulsive Peter was the disciples are in a storm on the Sea of Galilee, one in the fourth watch of the night. It says in Matthew 14, 25, Jesus came to them walking on the sea. At first, they were terrified, and that's understandable. It was night. It was storming. People normally don't walk on the water. They thought it was ghosts. But when it became clear that Jesus, their rabbi, was the one who was coming to them, And Peter says to him, verse 28, Lord, bid me come. This feels very weird. I'm not sure I should get out of the boat. But if you say it's okay, I'll come. Jesus says, come. So Peter does. Why? Well, I think it's pretty obvious Peter's nuts. Why does he get out of the boat? Because he's impulsive and brash. He doesn't think before he acts. But what if that's not it at all? What if at the root of this story is simply this rabbinic thing where the Talmud would, in relationship to the rabbi, always be saying to himself and always be thinking, whatever you do, I want to do. wherever you go, I want to go. Lord, bid me come. And the rabbi said, come, follow me, even into this impossible place. As if to say, yes, Peter, you have to ask, and you're not real sure, but I am here to tell you that you can do what I do. You can go where I go. You can walk like me and talk like me. You can become like me. That's not a pipe dream. Peter, if you follow me, put your confidence in me, press into me. If you listen to me. So the rabbi says, come, lehacharai. But then you know the story. The wind kicks up and the waves become apparent. Once again in verse 30, Peter becomes afraid, begins to sink, and Jesus rebukes him. And you're even familiar with the rebuke, I'm pretty sure. Oh, you have little faith, he says. Why did you doubt? It's interesting, Ray Vanderlin, who I revealed last week as one of the sources I've been using and have commended him to you as well, has kind of an interesting take on this. suggests that the faith that Peter lacked in this story and the doubt that he had wasn't a lack of faith in Jesus, which is most often what we assume, but kind of dial into the picture, says Vanderland. See, the truth is this. Jesus wasn't the one who was sinking. Peter, I think, believed Jesus could walk on water. There he is, walking on water. I believe he can. He didn't believe he could walk on water, which means Peter, somewhere in this scene, lost faith, lost faith in himself, which, if true, puts just a little bit of a different spin on the rebuke. It's the same as you've always thought, a little bit different. It sounds a little bit more like this, though, if this kind of scene is true. Jesus is saying, Peter, why did you quit believing that what I said you could do, you could do? It's as if, says Vanderland, that our rabbi, in some sense, calls us to believe in him, but we need to know he believes in us. All of which is why I told you last week that Sometimes Jesus, particularly when his Talmudim, his disciples weren't doing very well, he would say things like this. You need to remember that I am not like other rabbis who don't recruit their Talmudim. I do recruit my Talmudim. I go to people and ask them to follow me. Indeed, you have not chosen me, but I have chosen you. and in my choosing of you, Peter, whoever the Talmud might be at the time, in my choosing of you, particularly in my choosing of you before you proved yourself to me, I am saying something to you in the rabbinic tradition that you cannot afford to ever forget. It's this, that I believe that you, if you put confidence in me, press into me, leave your nets and follow me, If you listen to me, I believe that you have what it takes to become like me, to carry my yoke, to perpetuate my cause into the next generation. It's actually kind of odd to say. I remember when Vanderlund said it this way, and even when it's coming out, it feels kind of weird to say that our rabbi believes in us. It kind of sounds like, isn't that a nice thought? But I think it's at least part of why Jesus delighted in choosing fishermen, going to prostitutes and drunkards and tax collectors, what I called last week the not good enoughs, the people who didn't make the cuts. It's why he delighted in going to people like that and calling them, because in that is a message. And the message is this. Anybody can be my tell me. all they have to do is follow me lechakarai but here's the rub because while our Rabbi Jesus believes that anyone who chooses to follow him can in fact become like him the question is this will you follow him put confidence in him for how you do your life it's just kind of weird to me this different way to look at it because in some sense he believes in you, the question is, do you believe in him? So who's your rabbi? To whom have you given authority? Maybe without even thinking. From whom do you get your information about life and how it works? Well, before you answer that question by saying either, it's Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, or no, it's not Jesus, before you answer at all. Let me tell you a little bit more about this rabbi. Because he's like other rabbis in many ways that we discussed last week, but he's not like other rabbis in a number of other ways that even go beyond what I've been talking about here, how he chooses his Talmudim. So let me talk a little bit this morning about authority, for instance. Because that's one of the ways he was different from other rabbis in his day. See, one of the things in Jesus' day that amazed people about him and drew people to him was that when he spoke, he spoke as one having what? Remember the word? Authority, which apparently not everyone did. At least not the kind of authority that Jesus had. Matthew 7, verses 28 and 29. The crowds were amazed at his teaching, it says, because he taught as one who had authority and not as their teachers of the law. Now, I always thought with that phrase, not as their teachers of the law, that that was a big put-down on their rabbis, as if to say he taught with authority, not like these other idiots who don't know what they're talking about. That's not what it means. Let me explain this a little bit. You need, again, some history here. When rabbis or teachers in Jesus' day would teach, what they would teach is what their rabbi taught them, obviously. but this fits in with this whole educational system that I talked about last week, and even some more this week, about how a Talmud would become a disciple. A disciple would become actually a rabbi. They would teach what their rabbi taught, and what their rabbi taught them before they became rabbis was his yoke, his way of interpreting the Scriptures and deeds they would tell people. When they became a rabbi, I actually teach the yoke of Rabbi Shimon Lakish or Rabbi Simon Bar somebody or Rabbi Gamaliel. And they would tell people that. And the fact that they taught this rabbi's yoke was kind of, they were borrowing authority from this other rabbi. And so they were always citing precedent of how other rabbis interpreted the Torah. And their authority came from the fact that they were able to do that. So their authority was kind of a borrowed authority. They were always quoting these other rabbis. And it was actually, it was not a bad thing. It wasn't because they were stupid. It was actually a kind of protection. You just can't have people come along and making stuff up, you know, like that. In fact, if you want to get into an analogy that kind of fits for us, it's what lawyers do. When they argue a case, many times they will cite precedent. And they're just not making some new law up. You can't do that. They would cite precedent. Supreme Court justices, when they're being interviewed, they don't come along and say things like this. Well, you know, in the Constitution of the United States, it says this. But, you know, I don't really buy into that. You're toast now. But every once in a while, a rabbi would come along with his own yoke, with what felt like a new yoke, a new interpretation, a new slant on the text, another way to look at the text. The fact is this didn't happen very often, but when it did, If that rabbi, if what the rabbi said made sense, if it was consistent with the text and all of them knew the text, then that rabbi was said to have authority. And the Hebrew word for authority is shmicha. That's the word I told you last week I would tell you about this week. All of that in mind coming back now to Matthew 7, 28. The people marveled because Jesus spoke as one having shmicha, not like their teachers of the law, who were always quoting someone else, saying things like, Rabbi Shimon Lachish says thus and such. But when Jesus taught, he would say things like this. You've heard it said by the ancients. You've heard it said by other rabbis thus and such, but I say. And when he would kick into that, but I say, whatever it was he said, that was shmeha, authority. Now, whether people bought it or not is another thing, but he was exercising it whenever he did that. Matthew chapter 5, chapter 6, chapter 7, all through there he says things like this. You've heard it said from rabbis, good rabbis, who know what they're talking about, who know the text and the heart of God. You've heard it said from them, don't commit murder. But I say, it's really about anger. So let's talk about anger. You have heard it said from rabbis of old, really good rabbis of old, don't commit adultery. And that's really good advice. But I say it's really about lust. So let's talk about lust. You've heard it said love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say love your enemy. Let's talk about that. And on and on this rabbi went. Through what we refer to now as the Sermon on the Mount, Matthew 5, 6, and 7. You'd think it might be a good idea if, as we're learning the way of the rabbi, somewhere in our journey, we maybe teach the Sermon on the Mount and hear it from the heart of our rabbi. That's why this series might take a while. And when he was done with the Sermon on the Mount, it says in verse 28, the people were amazed because he spoke as one having shmihah. He wasn't rewriting Scripture, but the way he was looking at it and what he was pulling from it, it was a new way to look at the text. It was a life-giving way, and the people just couldn't get enough. By the way, this concept of shmeha is not entirely foreign to us at all, actually. In fact, I think we've all experienced shmeha and even exercised it on a number of levels, and there are levels of shmeha. And when you get shmihah, it's not like a magic wand. It's called finding your own voice where, you know, when you're younger, you kind of, well, you know, the reason I think that is because this person thinks it and that person thinks it. And you read a book over here and you're always quoting them. And after a while, you get to this point where you go, you know, those are really good books. And I got this and this. But, you know, here's what I think. That's shmihah. I mean, it was weird because I do that. You've heard me do this. I say things like this from time to time. You know, when I grew up in a church as a kid, I used to hear this, and I used to think this, but now, and when I do whatever now I think, I'm just kind of out on my own, and that's shmicha. That's what it is. Sometimes I'll say things like this. You know, people who teach this particular text often say it means this, but I say, and how dare you? Who do you think you are? Well, whenever I do that, I'm at a different level than we're talking about in Jesus, but whenever you do that, you're exercising shmicha. You've done the same thing. Parents, parents, do this, okay? Okay, here's a parent. It's when they say things like this to their kids. I know what all your friends say, and I know what all your parents' friends say about what's okay and what's not okay. I know what all your parents' parents say about how late you can be out and how early you need to be home, but I say, and whenever you say that, you're exercising, you got shmeha. Now, just a little word, side note to parents. If you don't have that kind of shmeha with your teenage kids, better get some really fast. Now, when a rabbi like this came along, people would come from miles around to hear his teaching, sometimes because they were curious. You know, there was not much to do. There was something going on. Who's the flavor of the month? I mean, we have that in churches. Churches, what's the flavor of the month? You know what I'm talking about. Sometimes they would come to hear someone who had a new yoke, a new interpretation of Scripture, because they were hungry for a different yoke, for a life-giving yoke. And the word began to spread that this rabbi, Jesus, was saying some strange things about his yoke. He said things like this, My yoke is easy, and my burden is light. He said the craziest things, If you're weary, come. Come unto me, all you who are weary. No rabbi talked like that. How did the rabbis and Jesus, they talked? They talked, come unto me, all you who are getting straight A's, who are the best of the best of the best. You come to me, and maybe if you're good enough, I'll let you be. You might tell me, Jesus, weird, was saying he was coming to the least and saying, you, there is hope for you. But sometimes they came to discredit this new voice. whenever this happens. Sometimes they came to try to discover what was wrong with this rabbi's yoke because as you can imagine, a new yoke, a new way of looking at the text is a threat to the way people always looked at the text. So we've got to find out what's wrong with this and blow it up so we don't lose our power and control among the people. Let me give you an example of that. This is a fun one. It's going to show us kind of the brilliance of this rabbi Jesus. Luke chapter 20, verse 2, Jesus was teaching in the temple, and the chief priests, scribes, and elders came to him and confronted him. They were desiring to discredit him, saying this, tell us, rabbi, by what authority, there's the word, are you doing these things? Or who is the one who gave you this authority? In other words, where'd you get your Shmiha. Which, by the way, is a legitimate question. Let me explain that. In Jesus' day, for a rabbi to have authority of any kind, he had to be confirmed in some way by at least two other voices of authority, two other rabbis that everyone in the rabbinic community recognized as having authority for the Talmud to finally graduate and become a rabbi himself. Two other rabbis had to say, this guy's the real deal. He has authority. And the authority we have is kind of being conferred upon him. You couldn't become a rabbi if that didn't happen. It was kind of like an ordination in our day, where you would go to school and you'd get all these grades, but at the end of the day, your grades mattered, but not that much. It really, somewhere along the line, some people, men and women, who had been in authority and people recognized us having it would say, yeah, this woman, this man is the real deal. Two quick questions. One quick question, actually. Think about Jesus for a second. Who were the two voices of authority that we know of who publicly declared Jesus, yeah, this Jesus guy, he's the real deal? Well, see, I think it might have happened. If Jesus went through the educational system that I think he went through, I think there might have been some sort of formal ceremony where two rabbis said, yeah, this guy's the real deal. But what's recorded in Scripture, that's not recorded in Scripture. What is recorded in Scripture is that there were two voices of authority that said to Jesus, over Jesus, in public, this guy's the real deal. First one was John the Baptist. That is baptism. Remember that? John the Baptist, who everyone believed had Shmiha himself, who said of Jesus, there is one coming after me whose sandals I am not fit to tie. And then looking at Jesus, he said this in public, behold the Lamb of God. There he is. Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. And the second voice of authority at that same baptism was God, the Father, who at the baptism said this, this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him. Why? Because he's got shmeha. Who says? God. You know, I guess... Anyway. Yeah, I have this memory of when I got ordained and went through seminary and did all that great thing. And then there were some denominational mucky mucks. They were good people. They weren't bad, but I didn't know them and I didn't, whatever. And they kind of, yes, he is the real deal. There was another voice of authority in my life at that time in my life who said, yes, he's the real deal. He was my dad. That was the voice that mattered to me. Someone with shmeha says, got shmeha. Jesus got it from John the Baptist and God the Father. With all of that in mind, now that history, come back now to the question. In Luke chapter 20, verse 2, the Pharisees are wanting to discredit him and saying, where'd you get your shmeha? Verse 3, Jesus answered and said, I love this, let me ask you a question. Where'd John get his? Here we go, here we go, here's the rabbinic thing. He's answering a question with another question. They're going round and round. They're applying their trade as it were. And by the way, when I said where did John get his, it says in the verse actually, Jesus' question is, was the ministry of John from heaven or from God? The authority that John had to do his ministry, did it come from God or was it just kind of manufactured by man? They didn't know how to answer. Reasoning to themselves, verse 5, if we say he got his authority from God, from heaven, then we're toast because he's going to say then why didn't you believe him? Can't do that but if we say he got his authority from man and not God the people will stone us verse 6 because the people loved John and thought he had shmeha. So they answered verse 7 that they didn't know where it came from. Can you imagine Chief Freeze these people who know everything saying well we don't know. And it says later that they couldn't ask him another question, and it made him furious. Do you know that there are Torah-observant rabbis today who don't believe Jesus is Messiah, but when they study him as a rabbi, they say, this guy's brilliant, just brilliant. A rabbi, Jesus, has authority. But let me tell you a little bit more about his authority. It's an authority that has power. Oh, I love this. Mark 1, verse 27. Same kind of thing. The people are listening to him teach, and at the end of his teaching, again, it says, the people were amazed. A new teaching with shmihah, with authority, but then they describe a little bit more what they mean. This kind of authority, such that when he speaks, Demons obey. You see, when our rabbi spoke to a storm, it quieted. When our rabbi speaks to disease, it flees. When he spoke to death, it died. This rabbi has authority and power. So just this important kind of question, who's your rabbi? To whom have you given authority? From whom do you get your information about life and how it works? that's a really important life question to think about and decide see I know it's true that a lot of people when they think of Jesus they think of him as a kind of dreamer an idealistic guru who had some nice religious thoughts and in the religious context you know I'm going to go to church from time to time and have warm and gooey feelings about him some way, but in terms of practical things that might actually speak into how I live my life, do my marriage, handle my anger, deal with the poor, live my life, spend my juice. Not that much. I know a lot of people who grew up in the tradition I did who trust Jesus. They put confidence in Jesus. but even the sales pitch they heard when they put confidence in Jesus was they were putting confidence in Jesus that what he did on the cross and when he rose from the dead made a way for them to get into heaven. And they trust Jesus, that I'm going to heaven because of what he did. But in any arena of life that makes any difference in life, they don't trust him at all. What he says about life and how it works and how we're called to live and who we're called to be. He's my savior, he's not my rabbi. See, I've told you this before but to me the real critical question isn't just if you were to die tonight would you go to heaven when you die? That's a really important question. To me though, the more critical question is if you're reasonably certain that you're going to live tonight what kind of life do you want and who are you giving authority to tell you about how life works? who's your rabbi dallas willard says it this way in divine conspiracy at the literally mundane level jesus knew how to transform the molecular molecular structure of water to wine that knowledge and power also allowed him to take a few pieces of bread and fish and feed thousands of people he could create matter from the energy he knew how to access from the heavens he knew how to transform the tissues of the human body from sickness to health, from death to life. He knew how to suspend gravity, interrupt weather patterns, eliminate unfruitful trees without saw or axe. He only needed a word. Surely Jesus must be amused at what Nobel Prizes are awarded for today. In the ethical domain, he had an understanding of life and how it works that has influenced world thought more than any other. Death was not something imposed on him by others. He explained to his followers that in the moment of crisis, the moment of his death, he could have called 72,000 angels to set him free. No one takes my life, he said in John 10, 18. I lay it down and I will raise it up again. The Father and I have all of this worked out. All of this, these things show, says Willard. Jesus, cognitive and practical mastery of every phase of reality, physical, moral, spiritual, and ethical. He is master only because he is maestro. Jesus is Lord can mean little in practice for anyone who has to hesitate before also saying Jesus is brilliant and might just be worth following. Somebody say amen to that. Thank you. There you go. Hmm. Hmm. Other which raises this question again. Who's your rabbi? To whom have you given authority? From whom do you get your information about life and how it works? Because there's lots of options. From MTV to Jerry Springer to Oprah Winfrey, to your buddies at school, to your colleagues at work, or maybe just you. Maybe the authority in your life, in terms of how life works, and what you're going to do and what you're not, and the direction you're going to go, it just kind of comes back to what you've always thought. You ever hear somebody say, well, you know what I've always thought? And you see a 14-year-old kid, well, you know what I always thought? No, I don't know what you've always thought, but I just can't wait to hear what you've always thought. What I'd really like to know is where did you get what you've always thought? Where did you get what you've always thought? that you're kind of an automatic pilot about? Would you get that from a really smart person or maybe an idiot who has no idea how to do life, an abundant life, a kingdom life, no idea? Some of us got what we always think from our parents, and I really don't want to blow up parents. I'm a parent, your parents, and you need to have shmeha in your family. But I'm telling you, there are things that we, an automatic pilot, believe about what our parents said to us, curses they laid on us. that we just believe about us. Why do you believe that about you? There are so many reasons you need to get a different rabbi who says, if you would put your confidence in me and follow me, you could be like me. You are not stuck where you are. Who's your rabbi? I offer you Jesus. Jesus. who we sang about in worship. Jesus, who holds within himself, says Paul in Colossians 2.3, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. A great rabbi, he, who says to anyone who wants to come, Lechacharai, come, follow me. and immediately they left their nets and followed him. What about you? You know, I'm really patient around this question. I really am. In fact, some of you need and you know, it's like I should close the deal right now. You know, I'm going to tell you some of you need to wait. Some of you need to wait because next week and the week after and the week after, we're going to start talking about this rabbi's mission. And we're going to start talking about this rabbi's message. And like many who followed Jesus then in the multitude who were, wow, what a message. Wow, this guy's interesting. When they heard what the mission really was and the message really was, they, whoa, see ya. So while I want all of you to come, some of you should wait. But I want to speak to some others as well because something's going on for some others here. So every once in a while, the Spirit of God moves in such a way that people begin to hear the voice of God. Some of you, in ways, you maybe wouldn't put it this way, but it's really happening. You are hearing the rabbi's voice. It's coming through my voice, but it isn't my voice. You are hearing the rabbi's voice. And what he's saying to you is this, lechachari. Come follow me. This doesn't have to be a big fanfare thing. It's just like saying, okay, I will begin this journey of stepping into, putting confidence in you. For life, for eternity, for a whole ball of wax. And so I pray, Holy Spirit, come. Would you stand with me as we close? you know I'm going to ask the prayer team even as I pray now to come and just make yourself available to anyone who needs prayer you know some of you if you feel like you've heard the rabbi's voice today and your answer is yes you know what you just need to seal that between you and God you don't have to tell me I think you do need to tell friends because nobody you just don't want to be in this journey by yourself I want to follow this rabbi tell somebody some of you will need someone to pray with and so the altar team, the prayer team will be here to receive you and there may be other issues as well you need prayer for let's pray together Father we we thank you for the power of your spirit that can move among us on a snowy Sunday in January in such a way that the wonder and the glory and the veracity of your son Jesus can be revealed. And I pray that it is true at a number of levels, at a number of levels, maybe even in a fresh and deeper level to people who are already following you in significant ways that they have heard, that we have heard the voice of our rabbi calling us further and deeper into this life with him. You guys, I get to see a picture in my mind of the Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit dancing over us, each of them revealing to us the other, the Father pointing to the Son, the Son pointing to the Spirit, the Spirit pointing back to the Father. Holy Spirit, reveal, call all these things. We pray in the name of your Son, Jesus. and all God's people said, amen.
