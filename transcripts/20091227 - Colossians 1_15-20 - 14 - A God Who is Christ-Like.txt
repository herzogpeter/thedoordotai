Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Welcome to Open Door. My name is Steve. I'm one of the lead pastors here at Open Door. And before we receive our offering, I want to give you the final home base update of the year. This is kind of what we do. We do our best to just put our finances out right in front of you so you can see them and be with us in it. If you were here two weeks ago, you heard Dave talk about our finances, and in particular, December's giving goal of $763,000. Now, that number is huge. It's a lot of money, and it's our biggest month financially by far. This number is larger than a normal month because it reflects the giving patterns that you all do year after year after year. So year-end giving represents a significant part of our annual budget. And it really does shape what we're able to do or not do throughout a ministry year. So here's the update. As of last weekend, we've received $338,000. This is less than half of our goal. So I want to give you some perspective. At this time last year, after three weeks of December weekends, we were about $50,000 ahead of where we're at right now. So we've got some ground to make up between now and Thursday, December 31st. And as we said, our financial resources really do shape what we're able to do as an organization or not do. And just as I was sitting down there thinking about this announcement that I was going to give, I remember years and years and years ago being at Open Door. I worked at a different church, but I would come on Saturday nights sitting up in the creaky bleachers at RHS and hearing a push like this. And I remember thinking, I had my checkbook with me. I remember thinking, I can give something. And it was not much at all. I mean, it was this little amount. But I gave because I believed in Open Door even back then. And so really, even little gifts, especially little gifts, matter as it comes time for year end. The stakes are high, as Dave said in his letter that he sent out a couple of weeks ago, and the outcome really matters. And when you hear stakes, I want to paint some pictures for you. You know, you hear a lot about next generation around here, and these are high school students and middle school students who get paired up with mentors that are in their 20s and early 30s. And what we're finding is that many of these students, now that they've been with these mentors for a few months, they're finding out that they can talk to them. And the mentors will really listen. And so problems and issues and all kinds of stuff are coming up. And we anticipate more and more students needing mentors. And so when you think finances really matter and outcomes really matter, these are the lives that we're talking about. As you think about your neighborhood and your friends, There are thousands of marriages in Maple Grove and around the Twin Cities that right now, on December 27th, are falling apart. They're headed toward divorce. And so we want to be a place of hope for marriages that are breaking up, a place that says, we have some resources for you. We have some hope for you to give. As you think about people struggling through addictions and grief, we want to be an organization that says, we would like to help. We would like to paint a picture of God for you that is full of grace and that every day is a new day and a fresh start and there is grace for you. And so when we say the outcome matters and the stakes are high, these are the kinds of people that we're talking about. We talk a lot about the kingdom of God here at Open Door. And what that simply stated is, the kingdom of God is where what God wants done is done. And so we want to be a church and a community of people that is about partnering with God and what God wants done. And so part of that is related to our finances. So if you consider yourself a part of this community and plan to be with us through the foreseeable future, I'm asking that you take some time to consider how you can intentionally and purposely partner with us in this upcoming year and support Open Door. If you want to make a gift today, There are several options that you can do that. You can find out how to give online or here, elsewhere. You can find that out in your bulletin. And I'm also asking that you would continue to faithfully partner with us in your prayers and in your service to Open Door. So many of you are involved in so many ways through giving of your time and your resources, and we just want to say thank you. Obviously, we do this together. We're in this together. We're partnering with God together, and it's a great, great privilege to be on the journey with you. So as we do this year-end financial push, just like I was at, you know, years and years ago in the creaky bleachers at RHS, if you have something you feel like you can give and you feel led to give it, we ask that you would do that. So let's pray together for the offering. God, thank you for another day to breathe in and breathe out. We thank you for the loved ones around us who you've given us. We thank you that we are able to partner with you in what you're doing. And so we ask for courage to do it. Eyes to see it, ears to hear it, hearts that are eager to move toward it and feet that are courageous enough to follow where it is that you're going. So as we take our offering, God, I pray that you would use it to advance your kingdom where what you want done really would be done right here in Maple Grove and all around the Twin Cities and really all around the world. In your name, amen. Amen. And so, beloved, we get to worship with the giving of our offering, and our ushers will be forward in just a few moments. Amen. Is it the mending of bone and flesh That tells us best You are healing us All the strength that grows while we endure Until the body's cured Who builds our trust Either way you are still for us And either way you will restore us If character is what we really need Then we'll receive it even in our pain And if our bodies you'll restore That's just one reason more To sing your praise Be the way you ask for us Be the way you will restore us Be the way you show your love Dear the way it is enough Enough That you walk with us in our need Enough Then you know it when we bleed Enough That you can't give them any sight Enough That you will restore our dreams and times too Either way you want stood for us And either way you will restore us Either way you show your love And either way it is enough Either way you want stood for us Be the way you will restore us Be the way you show your love Be the way it is now Be the way it is now Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah. 15 of Colossians chapter 1. So that's good news. The bad news is, man, this section of Scripture is so intense and rich and thick that we may be here for the foreseeable future. Okay, well, we've entered a new section. As Dave pointed out, it's more of a song, this Colossians 1, 15 through 20, or a poem than anything else. And it starts with this treasonous first line. It's crazy. where Paul writes, Jesus, the Son, is the image of the invisible God. And the reason why that is so treasonous is because in Colossae in the first century, Jesus was certainly not thought of as the image of God. Caesar was thought of as the image of God. In fact, as Davis pointed out, Caesar was called the Son of God. Caesar was thought of as divine, one who could forgive your sins. There was even a phrase that Caesar put out that said, there is no name under heaven and on earth whereby you might be saved other than Caesar. It's amazing. The image of Caesar was everywhere in the marketplace as you went shopping, on the coin that you paid for the thing that you bought at the marketplace, in your home, little statues of Caesar and on pottery and everything. The image of Caesar was everywhere. and the promise was that if you pledged your allegiance to Caesar, then you would be saved. So into that reality, Paul writes these crazy words, Jesus is the image of God. There is no name under heaven and on earth other than Jesus, whereby you must be saved. It's amazing. So I want to take another look this week from a different angle perhaps on what it looks like that Jesus is the image of God. So I want you to imagine that you're sitting down with a four-year-old, and she asks you this question, what is God like? What is God like, four-year-old? Now, everybody knows that four-year-olds ask about 37 questions per minute at the very minimum, right? I recently had a pretty long conversation with a four-year-old, actually my four-year-old niece, Olivia, when I was down in my basement and she saw a closed closet door, and it went something like this. What's in there, Uncle Steve-o? And I said, oh, just some stuff. Huge mistake. What kind of stuff? Just some stuff that I use to clean other stuff. Well, what kind of stuff do you clean? Just, you know, stuff that gets dirty, not a big deal. Well, why does it get dirty? I'm not kidding you. This is the conversation we had. Because dirt gets on it. Well, why does dirt get on it? Because you put it there, okay? Why do I put it there? Ah! So imagine a four-year-old asking you what God is like. What would you say? Now, if you ask most churches and most pastors what they believe about God, you're going to get pointed to a website or a statement, a very long doctrinal statement of faith about what they believe about God, filled with a bunch of words starting with omni, plus a bunch of easy-to-understand concepts like eternal, immortal, and justification. If you look God up on Wikipedia, I did this this week, it was amazing, you get this definition, and I want to read it to you. God is most often conceived of as the supernatural creator and overseer of the universe. theologians have ascribed a variety of attributes to the many different conceptions of god the most common among these include omniscience omnipotence omnipresence omnibenevolence that was a new one for me divine simplicity and eternal or necessary existence god has also been conceived of as being incorporeal meaning without body a personal being the source of all moral obligation and the greatest conceivable existent. So four-year-old, how are you doing with that description? Does that help at all? Well, what if we turn around and to that four-year-old that asked that question, what is God like? What if we asked them a question back? That would be sort of rabbi-esque, wouldn't it? Wouldn't it? To answer their question with another question. But what if we asked them, Well, what do you think God should be like? What is a good God like? What do you think the adjectives that they would use would be? No omnis, I'm guessing. Nothing about eternal or immortal. I think this four-year-old might use words like good, fair, big, strong. And I wonder if the words that a four-year-old might use to describe what God should be like would end up being words that describe Jesus to a T. And I wonder if you lined up a four-year-old from any continent all over the world and you said, listen, I want to know, what do you think a good God looks like? What do you think God should be like? I wonder if the words that any four-year-old on the planet would use would be words that began to describe Jesus, whether they knew Jesus or not. Well, Paul's answer in Colossians 1.15 is that Jesus actually is the image of the invisible God. And in Hebrews 1.3, the writer puts it this way, the sun is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being. Jesus himself said, If you've seen me, you've seen the Father. Now think about that for a second. That means that for any question you might have about God's character, whether it be really, really intense and difficult and hard to answer or not, the first place you need to look is the person of Jesus. It means that what's true about Jesus is true about God. And that if you don't find it to be true about Jesus or you don't see it in Jesus, then you have no reason to assume that it's true about God. Because according to the scriptures, Jesus is the exact representation of God. He's the very image. The Greek word is the icon of God. In our language, it works the same way. Jesus on our desktop, if we clicked on that icon that is Jesus on our desktop, the application that would open up would be God. Because Jesus is the image of God. now E. Stanley Jones was a missionary to India in the early 1900s and this incredible book I think it's out of print now but you can get it used on Amazon or wherever it's called The Christ of the Indian Road this is what he said about what God is like and I quote if the finest spirits of the human race should sit down and think out the kind of God they would like to see in the universe his moral and spiritual likeness would gradually form like unto Jesus. And this is what's incredible. The greatest news that has ever been broken to the human race is the news that God is like Christ. And the greatest news that we can break to that non-Christian world is just that, that the God whom you have dimly realized, but about whose character you are uncertain, that God is like Christ. It's a fascinating concept, if you think about it, to even say this statement. What if God, the God that you have all kinds of questions about, what if God at God's very center is like Christ? The God that is Christ-like. What E. Stanley Jones is saying here is the same thing as the four-year-old conversation that we talked about. If you brought together the world's greatest minds and asked them the same question, what do you think God should be like? What is a good God like? whether they believed in Jesus or not, the adjectives that they would start to describe a good God would be ones that would describe the person of Jesus. So, what are the characteristics of Jesus? I want to take a risk and share with you two characteristics about Jesus that I personally find the most compelling about Jesus. And this is why I'm compelled to believe in God, because these things are true about Jesus. And the first one is this. The first characteristic about Jesus that compels me to believe in God is this. Jesus is relational, not conceptual. Jesus is relational, not conceptual. Now, as a pastor, many of the conversations that I end up getting into regarding how God works and who God is are based on ideas and concepts and a book that someone read or a blog that someone just discussed. As long as the conversation stays in our minds, we can talk and argue about God endlessly. And sometimes this can be kind of entertaining for me. I mean, I actually like to think about these weird things. I'm sort of a geek that way, and I like to talk about those kinds of things. But, and I think it's really important to rigorously examine what it is that we believe. God gave us minds and abilities to reason, and we need to press into those things. But many times, these endless discourses, especially among Christians, about what God's like, what God isn't like, what God does, and what God doesn't do, what God would never do, and what God would always do, gets infuriating and exhausting to me. Because what I'm coming to realize is that I need to resist the temptation to believe that just because I've thought about something, I have engaged in it. I need to resist the temptation to believe that just because my mind has grappled with something, then it's become real to my life. It's one of the dangers about, I think, about a good sermon, whether it be listening to one or even preparing one, that, you know, it gets deep and you can really think about it. You can leave thinking, ah, I do that now. When in reality, here's the deal. If I am moved by a talk or something I read, but don't take it into my actual life of messiness, of forgiving and being forgiven, of loving and being loved, and of hating and being hated, then I'll live in the world of concepts and miss out on God entirely. See, Jesus didn't live in the world of ideas and concepts. He was relational. Now, the word that could be used to describe Jesus is incarnational, Though, if you throw incarnational out to a four-year-old, they wouldn't get it, right? Unless you explain it. To be incarnational means that you refuse to live only in your mind. It means that your ideas take on flesh, that they get messy and material, something that you can put your hands in, something that you can touch and feel. And this is the essence of the person of Jesus. There's a great story found in John chapter 9 that illustrates this perfectly. So I want to read the first part of it to you. It starts in John 9, verse 1 and 2, I'll read to you. And as he, that is Jesus, went along, Jesus saw a blind man from birth. And the reason why it says blind man from birth is because people knew who this guy was. He was known in the community. You pass by him every day. Saw a man blind from birth. His disciples asked him, this is so hilarious, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind? now great question right but the hilarious thing is that the disciples see a blind man and what they want to do is get into a discussion about theologically what does this mean they want to discuss ideas and concepts and jesus does not live in a world of ideas and concepts you can almost hear him sigh as he answers them in verse 3 when he says listen you guys neither this man nor his parents let's keep his parents out of it says jesus this happens so that the works of god might be displayed in him because as long as it is day we must do the works of him who sent me we got to do the works we could talk about it forever you guys as long as it is the daytime meaning that it is urgent. We got to do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming when no one can work anymore. While I'm in the world, I am the light of the world. Having said this, he does this very gritty, messy thing. He hocks a loogie on the ground. Makes some mud out of the dust of the ground that man was created from in the beginning. And he mixed a little of his own saliva with the dust of the earth. And something happened in that moment. And he rubbed it on this blind man's eyes. And then he said, go, wash in the pool of Siloam. So the man went and washed. And after he washed, he came home seen. Amazing. See, why was this man born blind? According to Jesus. Well, it wasn't because of sin. It was that the works of God would be put on display in him. And even that kind of sounds weird, like, ooh, someone has to go through pain just so God, the works of God can be displayed? I mean, isn't God more creative than that? What this means is this. The Greek word for displayed is pheneru, which means to reveal or to make visible. And my paraphrase would be this. God is made visible when blind men or women receive sight. If you want to see a picture of who God is and what God's mightiest works are, it's when someone that is damaged becomes whole. That is how you see God. Not by having a, I mean, having a conversation. Please don't hear me say it's bad to have conversations about God. It isn't. But if that's all you ever do, the implication here from this teaching is that you won't actually see God, but you think, you will think that you do. And that is a danger. So think about this for a minute. If God is Christ-like, and God's mightiest works really are put on display when damaged people are healed. So the question, if we went away from the idea of ideas and concepts and right into our lives is, is any part of you damaged? I think in this kind of room, most of our damage is on the inside, is invisible to most people. Most people don't know about the areas that you have experienced the most damage. Even some of us don't know it of ourselves. But if we believe that God is Christ-like, meaning God lives outside of the world of ideas and concepts, but right in our actual lives, we would begin to say, God, put your mightiest works on display in me. Put your mightiest works on display in me. And heal me. Which also brings up another question. What if you aren't healed of your physical wounds? Even though you pray that God would heal you, is it because you sinned or because you don't have enough faith? No. I think people have been hit over the head so many times with that that they end up with a picture of God that he's like this miserly, you know, rich shop owner that is keeping all the good things away from his children. And that is not what God is like. Well, if that is you, if you have asked for God for healing, and God for whatever reason has not healed you, because the God that is Christ-like is relational, my encouragement to you would be to take that anger or that frustration directly to God and pour it out. God can handle every single ounce of your frustration, sadness, anger, because the truth is, I don't know why you're not healed. I don't know. You don't know. What I do know that is true, if God is like Jesus, is that what Jesus longs to do is be with you in your struggle. And just like the song that Joel just sang, sometimes the mighty works that are put on display in people are when God gives people the strength to endure through it. As hard as that is, as hard as that sounds, God will engage with you in your struggle. Whether he heals you or not, God will give you the strength to endure. Either way, he's still for you. And that is the God that is Christ-like. And you know what? A four-year-old gets that. A four-year-old gets that because a four-year-old longs for someone to do that for them in their little life. Well, if you read the rest of the story in John chapter 9, you're going to find that Jesus, you're going to find out that Jesus has created quite a stir when he hocked that loogie in that mud and healed this blind person's eyes because, again, this is most of chapter 9, but if you can read it on your own, but the people in the village are somehow really upset about this, and the religious leaders especially, super upset because what Jesus did doesn't fit within their concepts and ideas about God because they had made an assumption about either this man's parents or this man that the reason why he was blind was that he was a sinner and that God does not deal with sinners other than punishing him. And so this has created a huge stir. Theological boxes are breaking all over the place. They even get this poor man's parents involved. They set up a meeting with poor John and Linda and say, Listen, what happened to your son? How is it that he can now see? And in the end, the religious leaders are so infuriated, we read, that they throw this formerly blind man out. We do not know what to do with you. Has that happened to anyone in here? Maybe. We don't know what to do with you, so get out. Let's pick up the conversation in John 9, verse 35. It's another reason why you can love Jesus. It's amazing. I love this. Jesus heard that they had thrown him out. And then it says, when he had found him, meaning what? Jesus went looking for this guy. This is awesome. Jesus went looking for this guy who had been thrown out. And he said, do you believe in the Son of Man? Well, there's a, I mean, that's a brutal question. To which the guy answers. well who is he sir tell me so that i may believe in him well pause because this is so classic the powerful works of god are put on display in this person who doesn't even know who jesus is that story might even rankle a few religious leaders today Well, verse 37. Jesus says, You have now seen him. In fact, he is the one speaking with you. Then the man said, Lord, I believe in you. Not in an idea about you. Not in a statement about you that I read somewhere. I believe in you. Because of what you have done to me. Amazing. Amazing. amazing Jesus said for judgment I have come into the world so that the blind will see and those who will see become blind you know if you got this guy in a room later on and you gave him a theological quiz you know what's really important to believe he might fail most of the questions but if you were to ask him what is God like you know what he would say God is like a man who heals blind men. That's what God is like. The sun is the image of the invisible God, the exact representation. And so the greatest news that has ever come to the world is that God is Christ-like. But there's a caution in here too, in this little story. Be careful that you aren't trying to get to know God simply by living in the land of ideas and concepts. Now, again, think, process, read, know what you believe and why you believe it, but don't live there so much that you think you see perfectly because what Jesus says here is this. Listen, the way I'm gonna love you through that is by helping you become blind so that you really don't know everything. The second characteristic that I find so compelling about Jesus, makes me want to believe in God, is that Jesus always takes last place. He takes last place. He starts out in last place. And because of that, he can't lose. Now, most of us live in a kind of world where we're in a line that measures our importance. Now, we wouldn't admit this or say it, but we really do. To our right, we look and see the people that are ahead of us, and we envy them. and to the left we see the people who are behind us or lower than us and we feel better about ourselves because at least we're not as bad off as they are we spend our lives jockeying for position always trying to get a couple of pegs higher trying to win more than we lose always trying to move up this happens on playgrounds in classrooms in boardrooms even in bedrooms but Jesus lived his life differently he started off by voluntarily saying hey everybody where's last place show me the person who's in last place and I will get right to the left of them Philippians 2 6 and 7 we read that Jesus being in very nature God didn't consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage rather you've heard these verses many times but rather he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant. So Jesus takes last place, right to the left of the person that's last in line. He makes himself nothing, takes on the nature of a slave. And this is really important to understand. Jesus didn't empty himself and become nothing, even though he was God, as if God is lofty and high and lifted up. And Jesus is so weird that Jesus would do that because he was God. What the writer, what Paul is meaning here is that precisely because Jesus was in very nature God, he emptied himself and became nothing because that is exactly consistent with the character of God. That is who God is. That is what God does by coming down and taking the last place, the very underneath place, so he can lift everybody up. That's who God is. and it's exemplified in Jesus. And that's why the way of Jesus ended up where it did. It shouldn't have surprised anybody that the way of Jesus ended up at the cross because the way of the cross is the way of defeat. It's choosing to be in last place. But here's what's so fascinating to me and here's what compels me to believe in Jesus so much is because when Jesus became nothing, when he became the very servant of all, when he took the place to the left of the person that was in last place, when he did that, that is precisely what makes him the greatest. Because who does that? Who does that? No one but Jesus. And if God is Christ-like, then we have a lot to hope in. Now again, I think if you've got the world's best thinkers together in the same room, and if you ask them, what's the greatest thing any human being could do for another human being? You would get variations of the same answer. It would be some form of sacrificing for something else, whether it be a medical person who sacrifices their life study to try to find a cure for cancer, or someone giving up their vacation to help people in need. The greatest would be someone who voluntarily lays down their life for someone else, Again, if you got the world's brightest people in the same room, they would agree. Yep, you can't beat that. That is the very greatest thing that someone could do for anyone else. That wins. And the God in heaven came down, became last, and did that for all of humanity. Jesus did that. And because death cannot hold that kind of life, God raised them up again. See, the way of the cross is defeat. But because it starts with defeat, it can't lose. It doesn't lose. Death can't hold it. It's what we mean when we say love wins. Not some, you know, mushy kind of syrupy sweet love. No, the love that takes last place wins because there is no defeat that you can hand a thing that takes defeat as their way. Does that make sense? Love really wins. E. Stanley Jones says it this way. You cannot beat brokenness. It starts with defeat and accepts that as a way of life. But in that very attitude, it finds its victory because it never knows when it's defeated. For it turns every impediment into an instrument, every difficulty into a door, every cross into a means of redemption. And any people that would put the cross at the center of its thought and life would never know when it was defeated. It would have a quenchless hope that Easter morning lies just behind every Calvary. Now this demonstrates why our Christ-like God is so powerful, doesn't it? It's weird for me to think about when we talk about the powerful God. We talk about, can God cause a hurricane? Can he stop a hurricane? Or the age-old riddle, can God make a rock so big? that he couldn't move it? This is the stuff of blogs, right? Well, the truth is, I will never know if God can stop a hurricane or cause a hurricane. I won't know. We can talk about it endlessly. The good news that God is Christ-like means that God is there with whomever is suffering loss because of that hurricane. And a God that chooses to be with those who suffer does the greatest possible thing and therefore the most powerful thing. It's also true that any person who voluntarily chooses to take the place just to the left of the person in last place does the greatest possible thing and the most powerful thing. Power, real power, lasting power, Christ-like power is a power that takes last place. A power that lifts another up. It's power under instead of power over. That's why any form of Christianity that ends up fighting for its rights instead of taking the place that Jesus took, last place, at the bottom, serving all, any kind of Christianity that fights for its rights primarily simply will not last because it does not have the character or power of Christ. But if you take a little group of people, just a little group of people that says, I will follow in the way of Jesus. I will take up my cross, and we will take last place so that others might be lifted up. That is the kind of power that cannot be stopped. It never has been able to be stopped. And Christianity, in fact, is at its best when it's forced to head into last place. So now, there's this amazing story that illustrates this. We have a friend who told us about this former president who visited Mother Teresa for the first time. And the minute this president got into the presence of Mother Teresa, he fell to his feet and wept. Now this is the most powerful person in the world, falling at the feet of a poor peasant woman who didn't have a dime to her name. Why? Because Mother Teresa took last place and therefore she had a kind of power that made powerful men fall to their feet. That's the kind of power Jesus had. You think about getting in a room with Jesus and at the end of all times when we all behold Jesus, we will fall at our feet weeping and bowing, and we will do so because we are in the presence of someone utterly powerful because they laid their life down. When you're in that kind of presence of that kind of people, I don't care who you are, you bow. It's not because someone called him king. It's because he did a kingly thing by laying his life down. So now here are Philippians 2, 5 through 11 with that background. In your relationships with one another, have the same, this is crazy, you guys, in your relationships with each other, yours, in your messy, gritty life, not ideas and concepts in your actual life, have the same attitude of mind that Christ Jesus had. Whoa! The bar is huge here. Who, being in very nature God, didn't consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage. Rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a human being, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, even death on a cross. And that is why God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name. Because he did the most powerful thing. That at the name of Jesus, every knee really should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth. in every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ really is Lord. That means when people get to that last day and they really see Jesus for who he really is and they really understand what he did. Yes, Jesus really is Lord. There is no one else. There is no one else that has done this. See, in the end, God is inviting people to follow Jesus, the person of Jesus, in all of our foibles and faults, in all of our messiness and starts and stops and all of our mistakes. God is not inviting people to follow a doctrinal statement that you can line up on one side or another or an idea that you can agree with or disagree with. God is inviting us to believe in and follow a person. When Jesus says that he is the truth, what should compel us to believe in the truth is not some abstract thought of absolute truth. The actual person of Jesus who healed blind men and became the servant of all is the truth that should compel us. The person of Jesus is the truth and the way and the life because he is the image of the invisible God. And in him, all things really do hold together. So in closing, let's take a minute to exhale. We've done this before. But just take a minute to think about one thing that maybe challenged you or one question that you have that you want to think about more and talk about or one encouragement you got. One thing that you've taken in that you want to breathe out and live out. Just take about a minute. If you need to talk to someone next to you to sort of process it, that's fine. You need just to sit in quietness and write on your bulletin, that's fine too. Just take about a minute. Just in your space and exhale. What's one thing? And then I'll close in prayer. Thank you. Thank you. As always, I want to encourage you to check out the message tool this week online. That's a practice that you can do on your own that helps you to make these thoughts real. It's an experience. you can do with others that helps you take this truth into your lives. And it's questions that you could talk about, either reflect on your own or talk about in a little group of people. The message tool, it's right online at the door. Every week, it's published on Monday. And it's, the whole goal is to help you take these thoughts that we share on the weekends into your lives together. I want to encourage you to use that resource. So let's, let's, let's pray together. God I think one of the most formational images that we have that affects what we do how we think is our picture of you and some of us have very damaged faulty pictures of you so God I pray that you would replace those faulty and damaged pictures of you with a picture of you that you sent to us and that is the person of Jesus, the man who lived 2,000 years ago who healed blind people, who died on a cross for our sins and was raised up again because death could not hold him. The God that is like Jesus. That's what we pray for. It would get burned into our minds, God, that would be so compelling to us to believe in and follow because you really are as good as that. God, we thank you for what you do with us, the challenges that you invite us into so that we might come to trust you more and more. We pray for courage this next week in our lives with all the complications and disappointments that we might face, with all the relational conflict that is maybe waiting for us at home or at work on Monday. That you would give us the strength to walk into that the way that Jesus did. You would give us the grace to remember that when we make mistakes, there is a fresh wave of forgiveness coming every moment because of what your son did on the cross. Thank you, Jesus, for grace. Thank you for fresh starts. Thank you that we really can live in the way that your son lived because of the grace upon which we stand. Amen? Amen. Thanks, everybody. Have a great rest of the weekend.
