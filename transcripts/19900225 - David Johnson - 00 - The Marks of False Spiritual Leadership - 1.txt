Open your Bibles to Matthew chapter 23, verse 1. Our continuing study in this gospel brings us to a new chapter. As the drama continues and the curtain goes up on our drama, I want you to know that it's still Wednesday of this final week in the life of Christ. we find ourselves at the tail end of a day-long argument between Jesus and the leaders of the temple. This argument began back in chapter 21, verse 23, when Jesus returned to the temple, having cleansed the temple the day before. Enraged and indignant, the leaders of the temple, the scribes, the chief priests, the Pharisees, came to Jesus and demanded to know by what authority he did the things that he did. By what authority he came to cleanse the temple. By what authority now he would come back to teach the people in the temple. He never did answer them. Instead, he unleashed upon them a trilogy of parables that exposed their hypocrisy and declared judgment upon them. They countered with waves of questions designed to discredit Jesus. We've been dealing with them the last several weeks. But Jesus turned the tables on them because the questions designed to discredit him ended up discrediting them. And in the end, he silenced them all. That was seen in verse 46 of chapter 22. And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask him another question. The fact is this, that they have at this time, at the end of chapter 22, played out their string. The dialogue is ended. They are finished. But what I want you to notice is that Jesus is not. And in chapter 23, it's like a missile being launched. The picture I have in my mind is that back in chapter 22, verse 15, the ignition button was pushed. From chapter 22, verse 15, we've been hearing the engines roar and the smoke billowing in the context of this verbal barrage back and forth. But when we come to chapter 23, it's as if we have liftoff as Jesus cuts into their religious hypocrisy, religious bondage, and really their religious abuse with a frightening kind of clarity. With that in mind, let's read. the text. Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples. One of the things I want you to know here is that while he is speaking here to the multitudes and to the disciples, they're still in the courtyard of the Gentiles, and the Pharisees are still standing there. With them standing there, and Jesus kind of pointing to them as he speaks, he says these words. The scribes and the Pharisees that you see right over here, standing here listening, have seated themselves in the chair of Moses. Therefore, all that they tell you do and observe, but do not according to their deeds. For they say things, and they do not do them. And on top of that, they tie heavy loads and lay them on men's shoulders. But they themselves are unwilling to move them with so much as a finger. But they do all their deeds to be noticed by men. For they broaden their flacteries, and they lengthen the tassels of their garments. And they love the place of honor at banquets, and chief seats in the synagogues, and respectful greetings in the marketplaces, and being called by men, Rabbi, don't call him Rabbi. There is one who is your teacher. You are all brothers. Don't call anyone on earth your father, for one is your father. That's the one who is in heaven. Do not be called leaders, for one is your leader. That is Christ. But the greatest among you shall be your servant, and whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted. And now he turns his attention away from the multitudes and the disciples directly to the Pharisees themselves. But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees. And if I were to kind of stick with this rocket ship metaphor, now we're into stage two. Stage one was the disciples and the multitudes. That's gone. Now I'm going to nail you. And then the third stage is going to come at the end of the chapter when he looks at the victims of these people's spiritual abuse and feels compassion for them and begins to minister to them. What are we dealing with in this particular chapter? At least in these first 12 verses are the marks of false spiritual leaders, what they look like. As I said, it's going to go through verse 12 today. We are only going to get through verse 4. In fact, only verse 3. Let's pray as we begin. Father God, we thank you for your word. We thank you for the gift that it is to us in a myriad of ways. but today the word is a gift to us and that it reveals to us things that we need to be careful about. Things that we need to notice. In the family of God, things that we need to notice and then identify and then come back from and pull away from. Father, I pray that you would use this to equip your body, to warn your body. And I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Whether we understand it or not, or even like it or not, one of the constantly necessary aspects of any viable ministry of the gospel is to warn people. Paul, in Acts chapter 20, upon his leaving the church in Ephesus when he had been there three years, said this on his departure. I want you to be on the alert when I leave, remembering that night and day for a period of three years, I did not cease to warn you. And what I'm warning you about now, Paul said, was that when I leave, there will be grievous wolves who will come in from among you, and they will not be willing to spare the flock. Their design is to devour you. It's interesting to me that Jesus, at the end of his earthly ministry, like Paul at the end of his ministry at Ephesus, begins to launch into a ministry with his disciples and with the multitudes that was doing that very same thing. It was a ministry of warning. The reason a ministry of warning is necessary in the church is because the world is full of lies and liars. It's necessary because the world is full of deceived and deceiving people, False teachers, false shepherds, false leaders who for a myriad of reasons defile and twist the word of God. By their twisting and defiling of the word of God, they destroy the work of God. And by their destroying the work of God, they ultimately end up devouring the people of God. It's not a new problem. It's one that we have to have a biblical perspective on. As we get a biblical perspective, we bring it into the present day. Moses battled people who were false spiritual leaders when he was in Egypt. Jeremiah confronted them when he was in Judah. Ezekiel identified them this way, calling them foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and see nothing. That's an interesting thing. They follow their own spirit, whatever they want to do. They're really not in tune with God. And they keep telling you they see things about what God's saying and doing, but they don't see anything at all. Not really. Jude called them deluded dreamers. Peter called them wells without water. Titus called them empty talkers. Paul, when he was in Galatia, called them preachers of the gospel, but the gospel they preach is not the gospel. In Philippians, he called this kind of person a dog, an evil worker. In Acts chapter 20, as I've already indicated, he called them wolves that devoured the flock. In this particular chapter, Jesus, we're going to discover, has some names for them as well. But as we consider this whole issue of false spiritual leaders, One of the things that is really frightening and disconcerting about the whole issue is that these empty talkers, as Titus calls them, are very hard to spot. They're very hard to identify. And the reason they are hard to spot and identify is they come to us in the form of something that looks like it ought to be safe. They come to us in the form of sincerity and spirituality. In fact, they are not only just spiritual, they are the leaders of spirituality. They are the supposed spokesmen and spokeswomen of God. They are the supposed representatives of God. They are the priests. They are the rabbis. They are the pastors. They are the elders. They are the chairman of the board. Who do you trust? In recent years, the Church of Jesus Christ has been rocked with a series of scandals, public scandals, among its leaders. Some of those scandals to you and I have seemed beyond belief. Bordering, not even bordering anymore on the bizarre. They are bizarre. From the irritating and incessant reminders of the Jim and Tammy show, that fiasco, to the gut-wrenching revelations that periodically come to us, just seems to me like every three to six months, I hear about some local pastor that people knew and loved and trusted who wound up having an affair. And that's a hard thing. But every once in a while you'll hear of a situation where they didn't just have an affair and get into some sexual problems and trouble. But it had been going on for 10 years, 13 years. And it's incredibly disillusioning. Who do you trust? I want to hasten to add as I think of false leaders and things that we get frightened about that the abuse is not always in the form of a sexual kind of thing you see sometimes people get into a position of authority and with authority comes a measure of power and there are some people in the hands of them because of maybe their insecurity maybe their egocentric issue maybe they are very good people but they haven't been in a place where they are accountable they begin to use that power and instead of using that power to heal people they use that power to manipulate, control, dominate use and literally abuse people definition of spiritual abuse and that's what we're dealing with these next few weeks actually definition of spiritual abuse is when I begin to use God, and I begin to use the Bible, and I begin to use my authority, or you do the same thing, and I use all that to get people to do what I want them to do. It has nothing to do, you see, after a while with what God wants at all. I'm really using the God word, and I'm really using scripture to manipulate people to get them to do what I want them to do. Sometimes the problem isn't even as overt and evil as that, but sometimes, I'm afraid, has the same effect. See, sometimes the problem is we are victimized by shallow teaching. We are victimized by poor teaching. We are victimized by wrong teaching. And the result of that, when people are not clearly hearing the word of God, they are then not clearly hearing the voice of God. And when God's people do not clearly hear the voice of God through his word, people go adrift. We get confused. We don't know what it is that we can believe for sure. All the way through the Old Testament, one of the legacies that we see through there are prophets and teachers of the word and speakers for God who are faithful to God, but there all along the way was a legacy as well of prophets who did not clearly enunciate the word of God to the people of God, and whenever the word of God was not clearly delineated to the people of God, the people of God began to drift. They lost their bearings. Pull all of that together and you end up with a question as we look at leadership, as we look at the system, The question is this. It's a frightening one. How do we know who we can trust and who we can't? How do we know what's really going on behind closed doors? And even as I raise this question, one of the questions you've got to be asking is this. What about you? What about me? What about open door? What about the staff? You don't know us. You see us on Sunday. What you need to know, first of all, is that question, how do we know? That's a fair question. That is a fair question. More than a fair question, that is an important question. That is a necessary, vital question that needs to be asked in the body of Christ. Who do we trust? Who can we trust? The thing, however, that we need to understand is that there is a pattern. There are some distinctions that we can identify that will identify for us if we're moving in the right direction or not. And you have to look. We have to look. The problem is we need to know what to look for. I've got some good news for you we are not left clueless as to what are some of the indicators of a teacher who is false we are not left clueless this passage here maybe more clearly than any place I've ever found before gives to us some very clear parameters and indicators of what a false leader or false teacher looks like one of the things I think that troubles us troubles me anyway when I hear about something that has revealed that among some Christian leader there has really been, for a long period of time, a double life being led. One of the things that really troubles me is that it's such a shock. It's like we have this response that I just never saw it. I never knew it. I couldn't believe it. It was so totally contrary to what we knew about him and that kind of stuff. And I believe that there are certain times when there isn't a clue. There isn't a clue. I think that's true. What I'm beginning to believe firmly, though, and I hope over the next couple of weeks this is going to become more and more clear that this issue of a shock is really not valid, that there are things you can look for, that there are observable, objective, unhidden signs. Jesus reveals at least five of them in these 12 verses. I'm not sure that this list is absolutely all-inclusive, but it sure comes close. Today, we're going to deal with two of the five. Two of the five. The first indicator that you're dealing with a well without water, the first indicator that you're dealing with an empty talker, the first indicator that you're dealing with one who is following his own spirit is that they have a false basis or a false criteria of authority. Write that down if you're taking notes. One of the first ways to spot a false leader is that they've got a false basis of authority. That's revealed in verse 2. Let me tell you something about the scribes and Pharisees. They have seated themselves in the chair of Moses. Stop right there. The chair of Moses is not a literal chair. It is a phrase that is used to speak of the seat of authority. The picture I have in my mind is that of a university, and a university has the chair of the philosophy department. And the chair of the philosophy department isn't a literal chair. What that speaks to is the authority that one person has in the philosophy department to be the leader of it. It is a position of authority. The Greek word for chair there is cathedra, cathedral. We get cathedral from that. The Latins took that Greek word cathedra and turned it into a phrase meaning ex cathedra. And ex cathedra means to speak out of the place of authority. To speak out of the place of authority. If somebody speaks ex cathedra to a Latin in terms of what that word means, it means that what they say is binding. The reason it is binding is because I said it. I have authority because I speak ex cathedra. I speak out of the place of authority. That's what the word means. The key here for this teaching in verse 2 in terms of how it reveals that these guys had a false criteria for authority was that they have seated themselves in that place. They have seated themselves. Nobody put them there. They have seated themselves in this place of authority. And the basis of their placing themselves in this position of authority was their position. It was their office. It was their rank. The fact that they were scribes and Pharisees to them indicated to them that they had the right to place themselves in the place of authority. I am a Pharisee. I am a scribe. Therefore, I am the authority. And the criteria for their authority wasn't necessarily that they were right. It wasn't necessarily that they were wise. It wasn't necessarily that they were directed by the Spirit or heard from God. The basis of their authority to them was that they were a scribe. They held the office of a scribe. They held the office of a Pharisee. Therefore, I place myself in the seat of Moses, and from the seat of Moses I speak ex cathedra. I speak as one who has authority. Why? Because of my position, because of my rank. Put that right down to today. A false basis of authority is this. You have to listen to what I say, not because I'm right, not because I'm spirit-directed, not because I'm listening to God, not because I'm telling the truth. You have to listen to me because I have authority. Why? Because I'm the pastor. That is a false basis of authority. It is the first sign of a false leader. Happens all the time. Think about it. It's really a neat system if you're a pastor. Huh. See, if I'm a pastor and my criteria for authority is that I'm the pastor, that's the basis of my authority. Why do I have authority here? Because I'm the pastor. That's great. Again, what that means is I don't have to be right. I just have to be the pastor. I don't have to be wise. I just have to be the pastor. I don't have to be discerning. Don't have to be mature. I just have to be the pastor. And because I am, I seat myself in the chair of Moses. That is, again, false authority. That is a false basis for authority. And I want to guarantee something to you. If you identify someone who is using that as their base of authority, I guarantee you that in that system there will be spiritual abuse. I guarantee it. When you see that, run. Run. Get away. Do not pass go. Do not collect $100, just get out of there. This mentality, this mentality that the position brings with it, automatic authority, reminds me of the mindless and maddening mentality that we dealt with several months ago when we dealt with the whole issue of women in ministry. You might remember in the teaching as it related to women in ministry that one of the issues that we discovered was that in Israel, the criteria for leadership and authority in Israel was based on three things. Number one, you had to be a man. Number two, you had to be a Jew. And number three, you had to be old. And so an old Jewish male automatically had authority. He could be stupid, but if he was an old Jewish male, he had authority. So he could sit there and pronounce his ramblings and make no sense at all, but he had authority. You could have a young man or a young woman who was moving in the spirit, but no authority. Why? Because he didn't have the office of being old Jewish and male. well. Acts chapter 2, you remember, came and blew that whole up, that whole thing up. And the Spirit of God said this in the new covenant, my sons and my daughters are going to prophesy. The Jew and the Gentile are going to be part of this. And it's not just the old, it's the young. But the criteria you see now for authority and leadership in the kingdom of God is not any longer going to be based on race, gender, age, or rank, whether you're the pastor or not, a scribe or Pharisee or not, The basis for authority now is going to be the Spirit of God in you, maturity in you, wisdom upon you, holiness coming through you, a knowledge of the Word and an anointing of the Spirit. Those are the people who've got authority. And I don't care if you're a pastor, a scribe, or not. If you don't have those, you don't have any authority. None. You have none. Hopefully, the people who have the office of pastor, scribe, Pharisee, got that office because they had maturity. But if you're presuming on the position to have authority, you have a false basis of authority. That's the first sign of a false leader. At least the first one identified here. Let's keep going through this. Let your mind kind of play with the concept. Moses had authority. In fact, Moses had authority that everybody wanted to claim for themselves. It was the seat of Moses that they wanted to claim it because Moses automatically spoke of authority. So if you want to talk about authority, let's talk about Moses. He had authority. but what we need to understand is that even his authority was not his own what do you mean it didn't belong to him what do you mean what i mean is this his authority did not come just because he said it things were not true just because moses said them things were not true and authoritative just because he said them his authority came from the fact that when he went to the mountain god gave him what to say he came down from the mountain and said exactly what God gave him to say. Do you understand? What the authority was, was that he told people what God told him accurately. If he would have changed what God told him on the way down from the mountain, he would have not had authority. The authority was in the truth. The authority was in the truth. His authority was not because he was Moses. His authority was because he was right. His authority was because he spoke the truth. The authority that he had was because he was a humble servant who did what God told him to do no matter what. You do not have authority because you're a scribe. You do not have authority because you're a Pharisee. You do not have authority because you're an elder or a pastor or a chairman of the board. You're going to have to speak the truth to have authority. You're going to have to make sense to have authority. You're going to have to be wise in the Spirit to have authority. You're going to have to know God to have authority. you're going to have to say clearly what god says to have authority you don't get authority because you're cute because you're loud because you're big because you hold the office timothy another i think good example of this timothy was having a terrible time in his church we've talked about this before but he was the pastor of the church of ephesus he followed paul which would be a very tough act to follow and there was a real problem with people respecting him he was getting run over he didn't have authority. So he wrote to Paul, evidently, and Paul wrote back to him. What did Paul say to him? Well, it's interesting. If you want to know what Paul said to him in terms of how to get authority in the church, how to begin to move and exert your leadership in the church, all you got to do is read 1 and 2 Timothy. And Paul consistently is exhorting Timothy in terms of what he does, what he needs to do. What is interesting to me is what Paul didn't say. Paul didn't come to Timothy and go, Timothy, just tell them you're the pastor. I'm the pastor here and you have to listen to me. Well, Timothy, Paul didn't say that because just being the pastor doesn't give you authority. Timothy, here's what I want you to do to bring some authority to your ministry. Study, to show yourself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, who can rightly divide the word of truth. And when you rightly divide the word of truth, you will have authority, but it isn't yours. It's because the truth is being rightly divided and the authorities and the truth. So start telling the truth and start reminding yourself of the things you learned even when you were a child about the holy scriptures and be reminded, Timothy, that all scripture is inspired by God. And if you want authority, get back to the scripture and teach the scripture. Timothy, the basis of your authority is not because you're Pastor Tim. You have no authority in you. None. The only authority you've got is when you begin to tell the truth. Kind of going out on a limb here, but there's even a sense in which Paul, just because he was Paul, didn't have authority. Now, 2,000 years later, I look at Paul, and everything Paul said, I take as authoritative. But on the front end, just because Paul said it, didn't make it authoritative. He spoke the truth, that's why it was authoritative. But you know what's interesting? Paul even himself said to the Galatians, in chapter 1, he said, I need you to know something. These Judaizers are preaching a different gospel, and they really look good, and they really look spiritual, but it's legalism, and it is not the gospel. It's not even a variation of the gospel. It is damned from hell. It is a heresy. And I want you to know, just because they look good doesn't mean that they have authority. In fact, if I were to come to you and preach to you a different gospel than I have preached, let me be accursed. Do not listen to me. because just because I say it doesn't make it true. The only reason what I say has authority is if what I say is true. Do you understand? In fact, in 1 Corinthians 6, there was a big problem because people were beginning to exalt Paul and there was a big division in the church. We're going to deal with this a little bit more next week in the second part of this study. I am of Paul. I am of Apollos. I am of Cephas. They're my hero because they're the best teacher and on and on and on. Paul identified that as rank carnality and an indicator that these people were absolute babies, maturity-wise. But then he said in 1 Corinthians 6, he said, what you need to understand about us is that all we are is stewards. The Greek word steward there means to be a table waiter. And it's required of a steward to be faithful, a table waiter. My job, Paul says, is to go into the kitchen of God's mystery, go into the kitchen of God's truth, bring out the food that God prepared, Bring out the truth that God said and give it to you. I'm the waiter. I didnít make the food, okay? I didnít even cook the food. I just went into to the kitchen, got into the Word, found out what God said, brought it to you and laid it on the table. I didnít make it up. Itís just what God said. And my job is to be a faithful waiter who doesnít mess up the food on the way out. I donít want to make it fancier. I donít want to make it hotter. I donít want to make it anything. I just want to tell you what God said. And thatís the authority. Get it? A false basis of authority. One of the ways you're going to spot a false teacher, a false spiritual leader. Sometimes their doctrine might even be great, but I'm going to tell you something. One of the ways to spot it is if they have a false basis of authority. Because I'm the pastor. That's why. Run! Run! Run! It's the first indicator of an empty talker. Second indicator is a lack of integrity. This is the last one we're going to do today because it's big. It's real big. Lack of congruity or genuineness in their lifestyle. They say, but do not. They say, do this, do this, but they don't live consistently with even what they say. I think this is the thing that gets to the heart the hardest. This is the thing that is most disillusioning, I think, when we see leaders do this. Let's read the text, verse 3. Therefore, all that they tell you, do and observe. Stop right there. I need to explain that. That's a little confusing, all that they tell you, do and observe. That's a little confusing because if you've been with us through Matthew at all recently, you're aware of the fact that there have been other places where Jesus has said to the disciples or to the multitude, do not listen to these Pharisees because they lie. In fact, in Matthew 16, 6, it says, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees. The word beware means hold yourself back from. Do not give yourself to the leaven of the Pharisees. And in some places, the leaven of the Pharisees was their hypocrisy, their hypocrisy in lifestyle. But in this place, it says in verse 12 that finally the disciples understood that he was speaking of their teaching. The leaven was the teaching. And we needed to hold ourselves back from the teaching of the Pharisees because they were telling lies. But why is he saying here now do what they say to do? Do and observe the things that they say. I think the reason he's saying that is this, That even Pharisees, that even false leaders, use Scripture. Told you over and over again that Pharisees were studying the Bible all the time. And then they'd add all their tradition and all their rituals and all their regulations on top of that to the point where it obscured the Word, but they would still use the Word. False leaders use the Word. They use it to sometimes beat people up. But they do use Scripture. And when they do use Scripture, and when they do say true things, Do that. Observe it. Scripture is good. There's a real tendency, if you've ever had an experience with a false leader, to throw everything out. I think that's one of the real painful things when a false leader does infiltrate somehow the church, that it has an incredible ripple effect on people who just want to back off not only the false leader, but they see all of the things that Jesus ever said as being false because they've always heard it through the grit of a lie. so when they say true things do and observe them but do not according to their deeds it says why is that here's why because they are phonies without reality they are phonies without reality they put on a lot of superficial religious garb and they have all sorts of little rules washing your hands just right tithing dylan on and on and on but they have no real holiness their holiness does not come from the inside. Again, this is a theme we've hammered all through Matthew. They tithe dill and mint and cumin, but they neglect the weightier matters of the law like justice, mercy, and faithfulness. They've got this little showy thing. Want to see me do my seeds? Aren't I something? But in terms of loving people, the real work of God is never there. They do the showy thing. Galatians 6, 12, and 13 identifies this same person again. They are those who make a good show in the flesh. They parade around in little religious robes. They talk very piously. They put a little effect in their voice. You know, hello, my brother. You know, they talk like they look real good in the flesh. And they try to compel you, too, to get all the same religious garb that they wear. They want you to get all the same religious regulations that they do and feel real spiritual about how you look, too. The problem is, that next verse says, the problem is that they don't even keep the law themselves. while they're trying to compel you to do all this religious junk. They don't keep the law themselves. They have no integrity. They're living a double life. It's an external show with no internal reality at all. This is the kind of time I'd like to kind of sit down on the stage and say, let's talk about this. Does this bother you when you see this kind of stuff? How does that happen? And you'll find out about some leader in ministry somewhere, and all of a sudden you'll find out they had another. I'm not talking about a stumble. I think leaders stumble. I'm talking about when you find out there was a double life, 10 years of this. That's real disillusioning. How does that happen? Saying but not doing for a long period of time. I don't think any of us can forget the images of Jimmy Swaggart. calling Jim Baker on Ted Koppel's nightline a cancer on the body of Christ and then finding out later that while he's saying those words he himself is doing some of the same kinds of things in some ways even worse somehow than he was accusing Jim Baker of doing. Those are images that don't go away. They haven't for me. Interesting to me, and not interesting and curious, but interesting and like, I want to figure this out. How does this happen? That at the time Mr. Swaggart's double life was revealed, he was doing a series on Rahab the harlot. So while on one hand he's talking about Rahab the harlot, he's going to one on Monday. I don't get that. It's like, I want to figure that out. And I have no desire to judge the man in terms of, I want to figure that out. Because I want to be able to know if anything like that's going on in me. Well, I tell you, I think there's a lot of people who are an awful lot smarter than me who have tried to figure that out. And so I don't know for sure why that happens, but I have a couple reasons that I think. One is I think people really do get deluded. I think people get deluded. And they literally do not see what they're doing. I don't think people like Mr. Swagger want to do that. I think he probably absolutely would rip his arm off if he could not have done that. I think we'd get deluded. 1 Timothy 4, 2, Paul warns Timothy, Timothy, you need to know that it can get to the point where we begin to speak lies with hypocrisy and people get their conscience seared with a hot iron. To have your conscience seared with a hot iron, you know what happens? The picture is it scars over. And when it scars over, you don't feel anything anymore. And it doesn't bother you anymore, what you're doing. We get deluded. the other thing is really more my opinion. This is something I just see, and I think I'm right about this. I think we not only get deluded, I think people get trapped. I do not believe that these people, whether they be Pharisees, the Jimmy Swaggers of the world, whoever, I do not believe they set out to be hypocrites. I don't believe that. I think genuinely they have a heart to serve God. I don't think they set out in their ministry and say, oh, how can I lie and fake and hide my sin to fool people all my life? I don't think that. In fact, I believe they hate their sin. I really think that. I believe that Mr. Swaggart has tremendous anguish over what he couldn't find control over. In fact, I believe that sometimes when we see these kinds of things happen, the people involved in them have been aware of their problem even from their youth. And they wanted like crazy to get rid of it. They knew it was almost like a demon on them and they even probably did that. Pass the demon out and make it go away. But it wouldn't. Even from their youth, they knew it. And they were trying to find ways to get rid of it. But I'm afraid that in many of our evangelical circles, the only method we give to people to deal with their sin is to put a cap on it. Did you hear me? The only thing we give to people to deal with their sin is to put a lid on it. And we just kind of crank that lid down with our effort and we bring ourselves under a whole lot of external restraints and constraints and injunctions and edicts and prohibitions. And if I say the prohibition loud enough, and if I say it long enough, and if I do it enough, And if I just kind of beat myself up, it'll just keep the lid cranked on. And this sin that I hate, I hate this sin, this thing will just not come out. It'll not come out. And here's, with that concept in mind, a frightening thing I think happens, and that is this. People who really want to have victory over their sin, the only way they've got is to put a lid on it and hold it down with all they've got. Look at the ministry. And they look at the ministry as being a system within which they could find themselves, all sorts of restraint upon them. You know, if I'm preaching this every week, I know that'll be part of what helps the lid stay on. Do you understand that? If I preach this, if I'm saying it, if I'm yelling at everybody else about it, that'll keep the lid on this whole thing. And they have a desire not to do it. And they think that being in the ministry maybe will even protect them and provide them a discipline that will give them victory over the sin. I see the same dynamic, being drawn into ministry to somehow hide this thing that they have no idea how to deal with. I saw it when I was a psychology major. It was a weird phenomenon. It took me a while to figure it out, but then I discovered, just talking to other people, it was a common thing. The people were drawn to psychology and even drawn into therapy, becoming therapists. And by the way, this is not a slam on all therapists any more than my sermon is a slam on all pastors. But a lot of therapists are doing therapy to fix themselves. You understand? They were drawn to it because they knew they had an issue. They didn't know how to get rid of it. And so if they figured it out in psychology, they weren't there for the patient at all. They were there for themselves to try to figure it out. I'm scared to death. A lot of people go into ministry for the same thing. Try to keep a lid on it. There's a problem with that. It doesn't work. Sooner or later, the lid is going to get blown off. And when that lid gets blown off, if you're a teacher, there will be bodies everywhere. Barclay did a whole study, He spent a significant time in his life researching Pharisees. They came up with different kinds of Pharisees. They weren't official titles. They were kind of his pet names for seven kinds of Pharisees. One of the Pharisees, the groups of Pharisees, he called the bruised and bleeding Pharisees. And what the bruised and bleeding Pharisees were was a group of people who were so committed to not commit adultery and they were so committed to not lust that they made it a law that you couldn't look at a woman. And so every time a woman came by, And this is what was going to protect them from their lust. Does this sound like putting a lid on it? Okay, this is what's called putting a lid on it. We're not even going to look at a woman. So whenever a woman would be on the street or in public or in any private place anywhere, a woman was there, they would put their head down like this. And they were bruised and bleeding because they kept walking in the walls and falling downstairs. And the problem is they're doing this. It didn't work. It didn't keep them from lusting because you still got a mind that can think. Do you think those people were bad people? Do you think they want, I really want, they didn't want to lust. The reason they were acting so silly was because they really didn't want to lust. But they had no idea how to get victory over sin, none. They thought, I'll put a lid on it. Colossians 2, 20 to 23 says this, Submitting yourself, beloved, to decrees such as do not handle, do not touch, do not taste. These matters which have to be sure the appearance of wisdom and self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body. They appear to be, I mean, you put a lid on it, guys, but they are of no value, hear me, verse 23, but they are of no value against fleshly indulgence. You see, if your method of dealing with sin is crank the lid down as hard as you can, one day the lid is going to blow, and again, when it does, there will be bodies everywhere, And the bodies will be yours, your family's, the sheep and your flock. You know why? Because external control is no control. There needs to be an internal work of the Spirit. There needs to be an internal reality. There needs to be an inside look. Jesus said again, I've said this a million times from this pulpit, you are those who policy outside of the cup and of the bowl. You look real good. You say the right word. You perform religiously very well. I would that you would look at the inside, look at your heart. And if you looked at your heart, you know what would happen? you'd fall flat on your knees. What? Broken, mourning, hungering for righteousness that finally you realize you can never crank out, put a lid on. Your heart is deceitful of all things and desperately wicked it makes you hungry for grace which is your only hope. That's how you get victory over sin. Sin cannot be dealt with by putting a lid on it. Sin can be dealt with through brokenness. When we become aware of our sin, I can't put a cap on this. Sin is dealt with through mourning. When we start getting out here, what is in here? when we start saying out loud the hidden thing. Transparency. You know what? This thing about how do you spot a real leader, a true leader who's not living a double life. One thing is transparency. Mourning is getting out here what's in here, talking about what's really going on in life, and not just pious platitudes all the time. Mourning is getting out here. Quit pretending. And then hungering and thirsting for a righteousness that you're aware you can't produce on your own. I'm aware of the fact that as I speak of this issue, that it hits close to home for many of our people. One of the reasons it's obvious, it's just a current issue. But I'm also aware of the fact that many people have come from situations where they were in a church that was growing and God was blessing. And they were even saved in that church. And they even grew. They understood the gifts of the Spirit. They discovered all sorts of neat things. And all of a sudden, to their absolute horror and shock, they discovered that someone among their leadership was saying but not doing. You're living a double life. And your experience was that when that happened, there really were bodies everywhere and the whole thing blew apart. There's been this nagging question on top of your need to heal and wonder who you can trust. There's been this nagging question that's kind of plagued you. And that is this. all that stuff that we saw there and the God stuff we saw and the people who were saved, were they really saved? Some people have even wondered if they were saved when they got saved under a ministry that they found out later was a lie. Was the work that God did there and the life we saw and the word that we heard invalidated because of this inconsistency? Was it all a bunch of baloney? Were we just duped and therefore even my salvation is in question? the answer to that is absolutely not and I think the reason for that just kind of appealing to the even study we did tonight goes back to the basis of authority again what's the basis of authority it's not just who you are because I'm the pastor it's whether you told the truth or not you see I believe that if a church is growing and people are being saved and people are learning about the filling of the spirit and people are being healed I believe with all my heart it's not because of the man anyway it isn't because of the man the life is in the spirit if people got redeemed they got redeemed because of Jesus not because of some guy or gal who had feet of clay you see what's an amazing thing about the gospel is the life is in the gospel the life is in the truth the life is in the word the life is in the seed the seed is good when the seed falls on good soil it bears fruit even if the guy who planted the seed was an idiot okay even if he was inconsistent even if he was a sayer but not a doer if he told the truth the truth is what has life it lands on good soil it bears life ironically that makes me wonder at how glorious the word is a little bit more the truth is that the gospel of Jesus Christ in the mouth of a vilest sinner is still the living seed that produces life still is we've all been penciled in salvation is never salvation is never the result of the cleverness of the proclaimer deeper life, sanctification power to serve is never the result of the cleverness of the presenter the life is in the word the life and the authority is in the truth the life is in the spirit at work in the hearts of men so don't get excited about the Pauls and the Apollos be thankful for them if they deliver the seed but don't get all around them. We're going to get around Jesus. That's what we're going to get around. We're going to finish this study next week with the final three things. I might even come up with more than three by the end of the week. But as I was considering this teaching that I think is vital for our church, for the church at large, I wondered, how do you give an invitation on something like this? Because we always want to have an invitation. Here's the invitation. I'm very serious about this. Pray for the leadership. Pray for the leadership. When I say pray for the leadership, I do not just mean the pastor. I mean the pastor, but I don't mean just the pastor. I don't even mean just the staff. I mean the staff and the elders. I mean even more than that, though. I mean the people who are teaching your kids in Sunday school. I mean we need to be praying for our musicians. We need to be praying for the people working in the tape room. We need to be praying for the library people, praying for the nursery people, praying for the sound crew, the ushers, the administrators, We need to be praying for people. We need to be praying for our leadership. Because Satan would love nothing more than to make a credible message lack credibility. I believe that in our church, we have anointed, gifted, and sincere people at a leadership level. But you need to know that in the everyday, common to man struggles of life, our staff and elders are no more equipped than you are. The same spirit that is available to you for holy living is the only hope we've got. no special dispensation for leaders. We are very much all in the same boat. That's why it's important that you don't put people on pedestal. But I do believe that leadership gets targeted. And I think one of the reasons and the schemes of the enemy isn't because the leadership is more important even, or more special. But I do think that in light of the bodies that sometimes result when things blow up, I do think the stakes are higher and enormous amounts of people get hurt when at leadership levels teachers are found to be pointing to themselves and not to Jesus, are found to be living a double life. Pray for your leaders. you need to know that sometimes when we're in worship I don't want to embarrass this person but I know this for a fact that we had a piano player who for a series of Saturday nights during our worship was under incredible oppression to the point where she felt on Saturday nights she had to begin to be preparing for Saturday night on Monday morning just praying and she got a whole bunch of people praying for her because Satan just landed on and then Sunday was fine you need to pray for the people involved in ministry this might sound a little silly but again i just want to talk a little frankly here i'm a young pastor i i yeah i am and this might sound a little silly to you but i have heroes in my life and maybe hero is a little wrong wrong word especially in light of don't worship people and don't have but but you know people who for me have set an example and the people who are the heroes in my life are not necessarily flamboyant people they're faithful people you know what else they are? they're old I'm very serious about this people who like Paul said at the end of his life I've run the race I finished the course faithful I wasn't disqualified disqualified not from salvation but rendered useless in service can happen people who like my dad, who I've seen over the years, and it is a gift to me that I can look at someone like this, who I've seen over the years consistently point people to Jesus and not himself, consistently say in one way or another, without ever saying actually these words, consistently say these words, my authority isn't because I'm the pastor. If there's any authority here, it's because it's in this book. Let's point to Jesus. I'm glad I have people in my life that I can look to like that who are heroes of the faith. People like my dad who have maintained integrity and maintained transparency and maintained honesty about their sin. You see, you need to know that while we get disillusioned when we see people inconsistent and literally living double lives, you need to know that I get disillusioned too. Sometimes it makes you wonder if anybody can make it. Do you ever wonder about that? Is anybody for real? Is anybody true? as a young pastor it is important to me to know that there are men and women who finish the course who have hung on to Jesus for dear life their whole life I really want that for me I really want that for our staff but this cannot just be a message about our staff and our leadership I really want that for you too authority i've been talking about pastors who can't because of their position as pastor assume authority they're going to have to be sensitive to god and authority how about it dad mom's in the home authority because i'm the mom you know what you might have to be gentle to have authority you might have to be loving to have authority you might have to be right i mean really right not Right, I'm right because I'm the mom. Right, like, right, like, think about it. And integrity in your living. Not just saying, but doing. Not just saying, but doing. A lifestyle that is born of the Spirit, that is consistent and genuine and holy. I have a desire for our church to be holy. Not legalistic. I hate legalism. I hate legalism. Kills people. But holiness, born of the Spirit holiness, is something God wants to give to his church. But see, even as I give this and I consider it for my own spirit, you know, how do you do that? How do you make sure it would make it all the way? Never have an inconsistency. Okay, let's just do it. But you know that's not the message in this church. Let's make a vow that I will never be inconsistent. you know that's putting a lid on it and as soon as I do that ten years down the road it'll blow because see if I made a vow that I never would and then I did I wouldn't tell you get it see and then all of a sudden transparency is gone I can't be transparent I can't deal every day on a daily level with my sin can't do it because I'm projecting this image the bottom line of this message is the same bottom line as every other message that these things are going to be consistent in our leadership and among us our only hope is jesus our only hope is jesus as we look at these things and see them as being in some ways beyond our ability every day to do we i got to end up right back on our knees saying jesus we just got to hang on to you for dear life, the rest of our life. That's my, that's my, that's our plan. That's our plan. It's not a bunch of little rules and regulations. Don't do this and don't do that. No, no, no, no, no. I've got to keep it real simple. I'm just going to hang right on to you for dear life, the rest of my life. That's my plan. And in the end, hopefully we can say, we've run the race, we've finished the course. We won't render useless because we tried to get our life someplace else. I think this is an important word. I think it's kind of a hard word. I think it's vital for us and for the church. Let's pray as we do. Stand with me, would you? Jesus, we want to be purified from this picture we've got of people who presume authority because of an office they hold. Whether it be a dad or a mom or a husband or a wife or somebody who's a boss at work or a pastor. I'm the pastor. God, we want to so much put that aside and have authority based on the gentleness that we serve among one another, the love that comes through us, the truth that we speak, the life of Christ that we show. Bring that kind of authority into our homes. Bring that kind of authority into our marriages and our families and into our workplaces and bring that kind of authority into our church and keep it and make us aware, God, when we begin to move from it, because we will. And make us accountable to each other to confront and speak and lovingly bring back, even leadership, but bring them back. And God, I pray in your name that you would continue to give us a burning commitment to transparency and not putting a lid on our sin, hoping that by constraints externally we can stay pure. We all want to stay pure. but that God, by transparency and honestly looking at our heart and honestly disclosing the reality of what's there, that we can continually find your cleansing and sanctifying grace and power at work in us. Do this work in us, not in just our leadership, but in our entire body, starting with the leadership. I pray that in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
