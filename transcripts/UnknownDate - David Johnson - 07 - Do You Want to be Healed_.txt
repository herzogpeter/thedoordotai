Thanks, you guys. Let's pray as we move to the ministry of the word this morning. Father, what I desire this morning is for courage to, and not just for me, for us, to hear and be able to receive hard and penetrating questions, disturbing questions. But though they're disturbing, can lead to healing. I pray for the courage to do that in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. In the broader context of what we've been calling journey with the Holy Spirit. If you've been with us of late, you know that we've been dealing with the gifts of the Holy Spirit, particularly the gift of healing with most of what we're learning about healing, coming from an examination of the healing miracles of Jesus as found in Matthew's Gospel, the 8th and 9th chapters. Last week in Matthew 9, we dealt with and examined the healing of the paralytic. And among the things that we discovered in that story was this, that there's more than one way to be sick and need healing. There's more than one way to be paralyzed. You can be physically sick, obviously the paralytic was, but you can also be sin sick. You can be heart sick. You can have a sickness in your soul that's just as damaging, maybe more so in the big scheme of things than physical paralysis or sickness. You can be physically paralyzed, but you can also be, we said last week, emotionally and spiritually and relationally paralyzed. You can be paralyzed with fear. Some people get paralyzed with guilt and shame, so much so that they can't move emotionally, spiritually, relationally. A loss of function in life, just like physical paralysis, all of which is why I think it's very significant in the story we dealt with last week in the paralytic that the first thing Jesus healed on that guy was not physical, but spiritual, was not his body, but his heart. Take courage, my son, Matthew 9, verse 2. Your sins are forgiven, which means among other things, there's more than one way to be sick. There's more than one way to need healing. Jesus heals first his heart, which is of first importance because it's of eternal importance. In fact, it was only when the Pharisees objected to what Jesus had done, accusing him of blasphemy in Matthew 9, verse 3, because only God can forgive sin. Who do you think you are forgiving this guy's sin? It was only when they did that that Jesus said, which is the greater healing, spiritual healing or physical healing, which is harder to say, said Jesus. your sins are forgiven, or rise, take up your bed and walk. The implication being it's easier to say your sins are forgiven, because who would know? Therefore, verse 6, Matthew 9, Jesus said, in order that you might know the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sin, a kind of healing with eternal significance, he heals the paralytic, which is a kind of healing, important, but of temporary significance, because even if you heal the paralytic, one day he's going to get something else and eventually die. Bottom line, there's more than one way to be sick and need healing, to be paralyzed. All of these healings and needs matter, but some of them are more important. Some of them are greater because some of them are significant eternally, spiritually. it's significant, therefore, that the first thing Jesus healed on the paralytic was his heart. I'm telling you all of that because I want you to keep it in mind as we move now this morning to the next miracle. This one, not in Matthew's Gospel, but in John's. We're going to leave Matthew just for a week. To look at a miracle that is similar, actually, in some ways, to the healing of the paralytic and that it's dealing with someone who has lost function, but there's a twist. A twist that comes in the form of a question. A question that on the surface is at best strange, at worst offensive, disturbing. The question is this. Do you wish to get well? Do you really want to get well? Not just physically, but spiritually, emotionally, relationally. Do you really want to become functional again? And the reason it's a strange question, it may be striking you as strange as I say it. I mean, what do you mean, do I want to get well? Who wouldn't want to get well? And I don't care what kind of sickness you're talking about, whether it's physical, emotional, or spiritual. Who wouldn't want to be functional? It's a goofy question. I want you to open your Bibles with me to John's Gospel, the fifth chapter. Beginning in the first verse where we will hear Jesus in the sixth verse ask that very question to someone who has been sick for a very long time, a question that on one hand is strange, on another hand could be offensive. Verse 1, John 5 establishes the fact, just kind of setting the scene that Jesus is in Jerusalem during the feast of the Jews. Verse 2, now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool. So get this in your mind. I'm telling a story, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porticos. The porticos were porches. And in the heat of the day, the people who went to the pool of Bethesda would get underneath these porticos or porches. Verse 3, in these porticos lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered. Quite a scene. In fact, most of the commentaries talk about if you're trying to get a picture of this, It would be like a very primitive hospital with all sorts of people, with all sorts of disease gathered there. You come to verse 4, and in some of your Bibles, there's a parenthesis around the verse. You can see the parenthesis on the screen there. Some of your Bibles don't even have this verse. I just need to explain this before I even read it. What we have here, and when you ever have kind of a parenthesis thing, what that means is that this verse is not in the original manuscripts, not in the best manuscripts. What you have here is an addition by a scribe inserted years after the original manuscript. I don't want to get all technical on you here, but when you're dealing with biblical translations, the older the manuscript that they're dealing with, the more reliable, because the newer the manuscript, the more possibility it is that there are people who have added certain things. And they may not be heresy, but they aren't the original. And so the original manuscripts don't have this in there. What you have here is a scribe who inserted this lady later who is actually trying to help by explaining what people believed about this pool. It wasn't what was true about the pool, but it was what people believed about the pool. And what they believed is what it says in verse 4, that an angel of the Lord would come down at certain seasons into the pool and stir up the water. Whoever then first, after the stirring up of the water stepped in, was made well from whatever disease with which he was afflicted. That's what people believed about this pool problem. It wasn't true. And it didn't work. This might burst your little bubble here, but it didn't work. The pool was kind of a legendary thing that people had come to believe. The fact is this, the waters were stirred. They were stirred by underground streams that fed the pool. So from time to time, the waters would, in fact, stir. And there would often be bubbles underground, and these streams and bubbles would come up from the bottom. whoa, that's very weird, must be an angel. And that's what people thought. But the angel thing wasn't true. It wasn't that they lied, but they just didn't know about underground streams that can stir the water of a pool. And so the story about an angel stirring the water spread, and people came. And it's even possible, probable, some people sometimes were healed by this pool. It's part of how the legend would happen. In fact, some even have speculated that the waters might have been like hot springs. So they might have even had some medicinal kinds of things. But in terms of the angel stirring and overall healing, in fact, if you gathered that many sick people in one place, you're bound to get healed, some of them just by chance. And everybody got all excited. It must have been the angel. And so people came to this pool, some out of what I'm sure they thought was faith, others out of hopeless desperation. They knew of nowhere else to go. Maybe even they went there for the comfort you feel from being with other sick people. The picture I have in my mind is like a huge watering hole that had dried up in the middle of the desert, and they came. But instead of desperate animals, you have a multitude of sick, blind, lame, and withered people. Not a very happy place. Now, verse 5, among the many, among the multitude, there would be one, a certain man, verse 5, who had been in his sickness 38 years. Now, we don't know if he's been by the pool for 38 years, but he's been sick that long. By now, undoubtedly, a fixture at the pool where nobody, by the way, was really getting healed. I think it's worth noting and just kind of get the whole picture here and, again, kind of confuse us a little bit in terms of this whole coming to understand the gifts of the Spirit that is healing and how it functions. I think it's worth noting that on certain other occasions in other scriptures, like Matthew 4, for instance, There are examples of multitudes of people who are brought to Jesus with various kinds of diseases, all kinds of diseases. That speaks of that in Matthew 4, 23. And these are the passages we're familiar with around the healing miracles. It says that when he would be with the multitude many times with all sorts of diseases, he would heal them what? All. But here, just one. Why? Well, I'm not entirely sure why, but I suspect that beyond what you might call normal healing, if that's even a right term, the kind that Jesus would often do with the multitude, healing them all, there's another agenda here, is what I suspect. There's something here we need to learn about this kind of healing that I think is tied to this question, a question that on the surface of things is strange, maybe insulting. The question again is this, do you really want to get well? You've had this 38 years. You've been by a pool that really doesn't help for 38 years. Do you really want to get well? Not just physically, but spiritually, emotionally, relational, do you really want to become functional? Do you really want to break those addictions? Change those life patterns? Do you really want your marriage to be healed? How dare you ask? I need to ask you this question. It's been sick, and so have you for a very long time. Do you really want to be free from lust and anger? Do you really want to become a different kind of person, have a different kind of life? Or is there actually a way in which you'd kind of like to keep that stuff? I mean, if you're not angry anymore, how are you going to get what you want? Hmm. Do you really want to be well? Or would you rather just lay there the way you have for a very long time by a pool that doesn't help with all your excuses and explanations? and people to blame. Now, when I ask it that way, it's kind of offensive. You might even feel something rise up in your spirit. Oh, there you go. Okay, be mad at him. Okay. But this is precisely the question that Jesus asks this guy. I want you to get the picture. A multitude of people, all of them sick, blind, lame, and withered, gathering by a pool, which symbolically speaks to a source of hope, But it doesn't work. When Jesus notices a certain one of them, just one of them, isn't it weird? No, it isn't weird. This is on purpose. Who has been in his sickness. He's been in it. Even that wording is significant. For 38 years, finally verse 6. So when Jesus saw him lying there, he knew some things about him. That he had already been there a long time in that same condition. Unchanged for years. And he said to him something he didn't say to everyone he healed. Do you wish to get well? The word wish in the Greek is in the emphatic, which is part of what gives me the liberty to say what he's really asking here is, do you really want, do you strongly desire to get well? The sick man's response is significant to me. I may be being picky here and hard on this guy, But what I hear in his response is excuses and explanations to what is actually a very straightforward question. Do you want to get well? The answer to that is yes or no. Verse 7, the sick man answered him and said, Sir, you don't understand. I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. Water, again, keep in mind, that doesn't heal even when it is stirred up. My problem is no one will help me. Even when I try to get into the pool, I'm just not fast enough. I'm sick, you know. Verse 7 at the end. So while I'm coming to the pool, another steps down in front of me. What I hear in his answer is this kind of answer. The answer is yes, but. Yes, I want to be healed, but no one will put me in the pool. No one cares about me. It's a callous world. Yes, I want to be healed. What kind of question is that? But my parents abused me. Now, it's becoming offensive, isn't it? Of course I want to be healed, but my spouse wounded me and won't listen to me. My kids have abandoned me, don't appreciate me. The government screwed me. The church failed me. My boss fired me. And on top of that, people keep cutting in front of me, verse 7. And you expect me to be functional? A contributing member of the family? Are you kidding? A contributing member of the church community? Are you kidding me? How dare you ask that question? Of course I want to be healed. But no one will put me in the pool. Verse 8, Jesus' response is fascinating to me. Jesus said to him, arise, take up your pallet, and walk. The NIV says, I think more pointedly, instead of arise, get up. Now, if you read those words, like I think many of us do, as if what they are are the magic words Jesus says when he heals somebody, like the spiritual equivalent of abracadabra. Rise, take up your bed and walk. Wow. If you read them that way, I think you're going to miss, I think, what's really happening here, in my opinion. Because what I hear Jesus saying here is something that no one has thought to or had the guts to say to this guy in 38 years of coming to the pool. What nobody has even thought of saying to this guy or had the guts to say to this guy is this. Get up. get up don't you know I'm sick you can't say that to a sick person get up pick up your own pallet and start learning how to walk to take up your own pallet here is powerfully symbolic language in my view that speaks to among other things taking responsibility taking up your own cot, taking responsibility for your own life. Taking up your own cot is taking responsibility for your lack of functioning in the family, in the marriage, in the community. It's taking responsibility, you taking responsibility for your part in the addiction and in the rage you use and anger you use to control people and your codependence that just never says anything. Now, if I'm right about this, that taking up your own palate has something to do with taking the responsibility for your own healing to a certain level, then it helps to explain, at least in part, why some people may not want to be healed. You know, when the first question first comes, you go, why would anyone not want to be healed? Well, I think I'm smelling a little bit of why some people might not want to be healed. Because if you're healed, you're going to have to carry your own palate. I mean, seriously, just think in the most obvious level of this guy's life. If this guy is healed, he's going to have to go get a job. Of course I want to be healed. Really? Do you? He's going to have to provide for himself. He's going to have to feed himself. And he may not want that. He wants to be healed. He wants to feel better. He doesn't want, I don't like coming to this pool every day, but he may not want to take up his own cock. He's been carried for a very long time. In case you can't tell, I love this story. And I see it as a vitally important stop, an unexpected one. And I don't think many of us expected to have a stop like this and talk about this when we talked about the gift of healing and journey with the Holy Spirit. Because many of us view healing, particularly supernatural healing, kind of the paradigm we have for it is that it is kind of like a magic wand. Hocus pocus. And we go to church hoping the waters will be stirred. And what I mean by that is that the worship will be great and the sermon will be stirring, and if they are, I'll go forward at the end. We run for the pool, and some people have been doing that every day for 38 years in an analogy. And after every week for 38 years, as it were, of coming every time you felt some stir, no change. No growth. You aren't any sweeter. you're no easier to live with you're not a more loving wife a more attentive husband not even a little bit in fact the more spiritual you got the more irritating actually you became healing there's no healing here which raises the question nobody wants to ask do you really want to get well? it's very interesting in this story see this guy does get healed physically in verse nine he takes up his cot and is healed in his taking up of the cot but there's more than one way to be sick and there's more than more than one way to need healing in verse 10 and 11 he takes up his cot he's physically healed and he picks up his cot and the Pharisees who are watching all this and the only reason they're watching is because they're trying to catch Jesus in something so they can get rid of him the Jews therefore came to this guy who was cured and said it's the Sabbath it's not permissible to carry your pallet on the Sabbath and they arrested him actually and he answered them and he said he who made me was the one who said to me take up your what's he doing there what's he doing it's the same guy I'm not responsible for this I'm carrying my pallet I didn't want to carry the pallet. The guy told me to carry the pallet. I'm not responsible. I'm not responsible for being here 38 years. They wouldn't carry me into the pool. Why are you carrying the pallet? They told me to. In verse 14, Jesus sees him later on in a temple, and he says, you know, you have been made well. You've been made well. You've been physically healed, but I have serious concerns about you because there's more than one way you need to be healed. You need to stop sinning, he says to him, so that even greater things don't happen to you. He's not putting a curse on him is you're going to get a sickness physically worse than the one you had. He's not saying that. He's saying there's more than one ways to be sick, and you got physically healed, but you know what? That really didn't help you much. I called a therapist friend of mine this week to talk about this thing, this dynamic of, you know, that is stirred up by the question, do you really want to be well. And I just asked him, I said, Mike, am I on track here? Does this make sense to you? Is this a legitimate question? Or Mike, when people come to you for therapy, do you assume they all want to get well? I mean, why would they be coming to counseling if they didn't want to get well? And he said, actually, Dave, this issue of whether they really want to get well or not is one of the first big obstacles we have to face almost every single time. No kidding. Yeah, And then he told me a story. He said, Dave, I was dealing with this couple for several months in their marriage. They weren't getting along at all. In fact, it was headed for divorce. In fact, the more we talked, it seemed like the more hostile they became toward each other. And we were about to give up. One day, the wife of this couple came early. It wasn't the plan. They were just driving separately from work. She got there early. And in the time while they were waiting for her husband to show up, they just began to talk. And among the things they talked about was the frustration of this counseling thing seemingly going nowhere. And Mike, my friend, was frustrated as well, feeling like I just don't think I know what to do to help these people. And in a moment of what turned out, you know, after the fact, to be kind of inspirational, he noticed on the table a bottle of aspirin. He pulled a pill, one of the aspirins, out of the bottle. And he put it on the table between them and said, let's pretend this is a magic pill. And if you take this pill, you will magically fall madly in love with your husband. And all this stuff we've been going round and round and round about for several months will just fall away. If that could really happen by taking that pill, would you take the pill? Guess what she said? No. And it was like a revelation to this guy going, you've got to get out of here. I can't help you. You know, this lady, bottom line, I want to sit by the pool, which would be kind of going to counseling all the time, but I don't really want to get up. I don't really want to take up my palate. I don't even really want to love my husband. I want to sit here by the pool so it looks like I care, but I don't. By the way, while I use her as an example of someone who is going to counseling, but all it really is is going to the proverbial pool for others of you. The truth is that going to counseling might be the first step in your taking up the pallets and becoming responsible for your stuff because you're willing to do the work of looking at your stuff and what you're responsible for in your own healing. Next question. If it's true that some people don't really want to get well, even though it looks like they do because they're hanging around the pool, why? Why is it like that? Is there some benefit to staying sick? Obviously, maybe under the surface some way. Again, staying sick, not just physically, but actually I'm talking even primarily emotionally, spiritually, relationally sick. Is there some payoff? Because on the surface, it seems absurd that anyone would want to stay sick. Doesn't it? Well, no. See, it turns out that there are actually lots of benefits to staying sick. I've already touched on a few. One is this, you don't have to carry your own palate if you stay sick. You don't have to be responsible for your own life, for your own joy, for the circumstances of your life. You can blame somebody else for the fact that you're as miserable as you are. This guy's explanation was he had no friends to put him in the pool. What do you expect? By the way, that's another benefit of staying sick. It has to do with expectations because if you stay sick, if you embrace your limitations, your sickness or your wound, you know what you can eliminate from your life? Expectations. In other words, you couldn't possibly expect me to be anything but angry. I had it rough. you couldn't possibly expect me to be sexually pure I was neglected you couldn't possibly expect me to not take drugs to not drink too much you couldn't possibly expect me to get a job I mean one that works in my family you couldn't possibly expect me to pay attention I have ADD, it's kind of built in it's just a great place to go I don't have to pay attention I don't have to get a job, I don't have to go to school turns out there are some benefits real significant benefits to staying sick no one expects anything of you, not even you in fact, you would be highly offended if anyone ever talked to you the way Jesus is talking to this guy right here when he says, get up take up your own pallet and learn how to walk. And in that, you will find some supernatural healing. Another obvious benefit to staying sick is you can get a lot of attention, especially if you're in a community that cares a lot about lepers and paralytics. Let me give you an extreme example of that. Some months ago, I was in San Francisco with Keith Meyer and Judy Haugen, our chairperson of the Elder Board. meeting with about two other churches in a roundtable discussion about a number of things. And in the course of our discussion, it wasn't about this at all. It was just, you know, we were together in three days and we talked about a lot of things. This story somehow emerged out of what we were talking about from one of the pastors of one of those churches of a person in his church who had created, literally created an identity around their sickness. And they came to their church several years previous with a heart-wrenching story of ritualistic, satanic sexual abuse, as any church would and we would and have done, come around. They came around this gal with all sorts of support and love and help and deliverance and prayer and attention, lots and lots of really important, careful, compassionate, appropriate attention. Turns out in addition to these sexual, satanic kinds of abuse stories, that scarred her emotionally and, by the way, gave her a lot of permission to be quite a difficult person to hang around. Well, because, I mean, she's been satanically abused. She also had diseases, a number of diseases, including cancer. She shaved her head when she was getting chemotherapy like everyone does. Her body began to contort in certain ways to take on the characteristics of someone who had certain diseases. The problem is, and this was a horrifying revelation for everyone in the church, None of it was true. None of it was true. And you can just imagine. I mean, the pastor friend of mine told me of how hard it was to even confront the person and how sick all of them were at even having to broach the subject, are you really sick? Let's ask her the question, would you like to get well? Well, on one level, she wouldn't want to get well of her quote-unquote disease because the church, being a church of compassion, had showered her with money, had paid her bills, sometimes paid her mortgage, had given her all sorts of support and care. But her real disease wasn't physical. That was all made up. Her real disease was the lie she was telling. So let's ask her again, do you really want to get well? Well, here's the rest of the story, and it's the best part of the story. to her credit, and I was stunned when he told me this. When all of this got exposed, as the fraud that it was, she didn't disappear. Now, that's what people do when they get exposed, when they get confronted in some way. In fact, that's what happens in churches. When you get close to their stuff, they either press into their stuff or they bolt, and she didn't. I was stunned when he told me that. Instead, she stayed and allowed herself, and it took about two years, allowed herself to get in the room with some people who felt very betrayed and, quite frankly, very angry that they had been used the way, and person after person, after, for a couple of years, she sat with and listened to them tell them how it felt to be betrayed like this, and guess what happened over the period of two years, she began to get what? Healed. Because she, see, I think that's what it means to take up your cot. Don't walk away. Don't run away. There's grace for you, but you're going have to take some responsibility if you ever want to walk again. One more example, a little less obvious, but just as damaging, is what my psychologist friend called the law of homeostasis. In fact, this is the first thing he said when I called him on the phone, and I explained the dynamic. He says, oh yeah, what you're describing is what psychologists call the law of homeostasis. and what that is is this, that people will often hold on to what is familiar rather than choosing what is better. They might even in their minds go, yeah, yeah, that would be a better thing, but again, it's unconscious, but I'm gonna hang on to this thing that I even know is sick and hurting me and other people, but at least I'm familiar with it. So if what you're familiar with is hurtful, damaging or depleting even to your own soul, sick, you may complain about it. I wish my husband, I wish my wife. You may complain about it, but you won't change anything. You won't do anything. You won't accept responsibility, pick up your own cut, and learn how to walk. It's just a very common thing. And so the question comes. It's a question that I prayed at the beginning of the service we would have the courage to ask. Do you really want to get well? Not just physically, not primarily physically. I'm talking emotionally, spiritually, relationally, instinctively. When we hear the question reflexively, the answer is yes. Who wouldn't want to be well? But often what we really mean and what we really want and even expect from God when it comes to this healing is a magic wand. What we're expecting and wanting is a stirring of the water, some charismatic hocus pocus to make it all go poof. But sometimes what Jesus says, and it's what he's saying here, I think, is no. No hocus pocus today. Because sometimes you have a part to play in your own healing. So hear the word. It's a word that sounds harsh, but actually it is the most loving word that some of you could hear because it can bring healing. Here's the word. Get up. Quit complaining and blaming. Pick up your own cot. Take responsibility for your own stuff, for your sin, which, by the way, will probably yield or lead to some repentance, and begin to learn how to walk. And when you do, when you begin to rise to that, that's when the power comes. And that's when the miracle happens. The healing comes. The gift of healing. There's a number of different ways to be sick. A number of different ways to need healing. Some of it comes the way it did to the paralytic. The paralytic couldn't move. He's paralyzed. Supernatural healing. This guy, like many of us, need to decide, do you really want to get well? I don't know how to close this except with some questions to just give you some work to do if you're interested. Question number one. Just kind of, if you're a journaler, you might want to journal around this kind of thing. In one ways, is this guy's story your story? I can't answer that for you. Just do some work there. I will too. In what ways, here's another question, in what ways might you be sitting by the pool waiting for some magic wand to fix you when what God is saying to you is, there ain't going to be no magic wand. You need to get up. You need to take up your own cut and learn how to walk. And another question that comes on the tail of that, What might get up look like for you? Well, I don't know that either. For some of you, it might mean go on a diet. Get up. For some of you, it might mean begin to explore the roots of why diets don't work. For some of you, it might mean going to counseling. For some of you, it might mean get a job. Get up. final question do you really want to get well really it occurs to me as I close that maybe the first thing that needs to get healed in some of us is our wanter do you want to get well let's pray as we close why don't you stand with me Lord this this was not a particularly easy sermon to give I don't imagine it was a particularly easy one to hear because in many ways we're all this guy. All of us are this guy. At one level or another, at one time or another, we've all played this game. But you are a God who heals and you care about healing and we're on a journey around healing and I pray in Jesus' name that the power of your spirit would be present in this place to heal. But today that means no magic wands. It means to reveal to us in ways that might make us uncomfortable, disturb us, ways in which we need to quit waiting for magic wands, take responsibility, learn how to walk, and in that, experience the supernatural power of your spirit to heal. Holy Spirit, come. Breathe life into this and into us. In Jesus' name, amen.
