It was back in mid-December that we heard for the first time the Apostle James in Acts chapter 15 instruct a group of new believers in Antioch, Syria to abstain from fornication. The Greek word fornication that we have been using interchangeably with that word is pornea. Further, in that chapter, the Apostle James indicated that if you keep yourselves free from porneia, you will do well, verse 29. Implied in that was this, that if you don't keep yourself free, or if you can't, for a variety of reasons that we have already discussed, keep yourself free, you won't do well. Indeed, you will feel pain. We have come to call it the pain of porneia, that has become for us a very significant series of sermons called The Pain of Pornea. To begin again this morning, I want to indicate again that parental discretion is advised as we continue to deal with this issue. I'd like to pray as we begin this morning. Father, I pray again in this third service that the power of your Spirit would be available beyond any words I say that your spirit would be at work empowering truth. In this arena, as in many arenas, we have been lied to. Lies that have been compelling. Lies that have drawn us in only to bring us significant pain. I pray in your name that truth empowered by your spirit would come breaking the power of lies that would be followed then by the work of your spirit among us for healing in this arena and real freedom. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Most recently, as it relates to this series, we have been dealing with what I've been calling three whatabouts. In light of the pain of pornea, what about healthy sexuality? Does that exist anywhere? In light of the pain of pornea, what about singleness and sexuality? And soon to come, in light of the pain of pornea, what about homosexuality? The last time in the second week of our singleness and sexuality focus, I exposed and confronted what I believe was a significant lie. The lie is this, that sex is a biological urge over which we have no control. The key there was the second part of that statement, over which we have no control. Now, if we believe that lie, that we have no control, one of the consequences for that belief is another belief. And that is this, that I am not responsible for my sexual behavior. After all, all it is is a biological urge over which I have no control. It's not my fault, therefore, if I lower my boundaries for everyone who wants to approach me sexually. And it's not my fault if I put pressure on you, indeed even force you to lower your boundaries for me, because after all, sex is just a biological urge over which I have no control. I called that last time a lie, and we discussed at some length how it is that many of us have come to believe that lie and how it is that we have behaved on that lie, acted on that lie as well. Now, in light of that lie, I want today to add to our list of whatabouts, another whatabouts. It's this. What about when for me, the truth really is that in this area of sexuality, I have no control? What about when for me, in this arena of sexuality, I really have lost my know, I really have lost my ability to choose, I really don't know how to stop? What about when knowing that my behavior is wrong and even hating my behavior doesn't keep me from doing the behavior? What about when hating not just my behavior, but literally hating myself for doing what I do doesn't keep me from doing what I do. What about when promising to never, ever do it again doesn't keep me from doing it again? What about when throwing away my pornography after masturbating to it, feeling all sorts of shame, even despair, about what I've done doesn't keep me from going out and buying it again. What about when going to the prostitutes, male or female, running out the door, feeling again shame and despair, wanting to try to get as far away from him or her as I possibly can. What about when all of the shame and despair around that doesn't keep me from going back again? Now some might hear that and think, give me a break, Dave. This is baloney. It's just a matter of willpower. These people are weak. Okay, what about if you're that weak? What about if I really have lost my willpower? is there any hope for me is what I feel about me and if you are lost in this kind of cycle and struggle what you feel about yourself is that you're a worthless piece of slime is what I feel about me what's true about me and am I in this struggle alone hmm I want to read a letter that I read this week among many letters this letter that I want to read is from a man that if I said his name you would recognize him immediately the letter was not written directly to me but I am going to read it that way I'm also going to paraphrase it change significantly some of the things that he said to protect his identity respect his confidentiality I'm reading this with implicit permission. And I am calling it one man's not-so-secret struggle. Dear Dave, I am battling with some things right now, and I think I need some help. Without getting too specific, here's my struggle. Behaviors that I find myself sometimes doing, I do not understand. I fight with the fact that sometimes the things I really do desire in my heart to do, I don't do. But worse than that, sometimes I find myself actually doing things that honestly I hate. Did you hear that, Dave? I can't believe I said that. It sounds crazy, doesn't it? Schizophrenic. The good I say I want to do, I don't do. The evil things I say I don't want to do, I do. Who would believe that? I need a sanity check, Dave. You probably won't believe me. But the truth in my heart is I joyfully say yes in my heart to the law of God. Yet in my body I see a different law. And it's as if it wages war against my mind and my heart, making me a prisoner. that's it I feel like a prisoner a slave to this thing oh wretched man that I am notice something about the end of that letter not only what I do is a wretched thing but who I am is a wretched person now before I identify who that person is as if you didn't know and if you didn't know i read an excerpt paraphrased it changed it a little bit from romans chapter 7 the apostle paul is the one who had that i am out of control struggle but let me tell you first who that person is not and let it now be much bigger this person we're speaking of with this out of control struggle than the apostle paul let it be every man and every woman who's ever had that kind of struggle. But let me tell you who every man and every woman isn't who's had that struggle. They are not a Romans 1.32 person. And this, by the way, is extremely important as it relates to some theology that I am going to need and I want you to be able to hang on to for the next couple of weeks as we continue to go through this study. Romans 1.32 reveals that there are some people who not only practice sin, but they have embraced their sin, they love their sin, and in the embracing of their sin and loving of it, they have gone one step further to promoting their sin. It says that in verse 32, not only do they practice these things, but they give hearty approval to those who do. That is, they promote it, that is, they preach. what it is that they've embraced. People who have come to that place no longer have the struggle of Romans chapter 7. For them, the struggle is over. Indeed, the words you might hear from them is this. They have been set free. Know this, however, that they have not been set free, as the Bible speaks of, from sin. They have been set free, indeed have set themselves free to sin. I am now free to sin and so free that I feel no remorse. I feel no movement in me at all away from my behavior. I have embraced it. I am free to do it. They've turned themselves over to it. They have embraced it. Romans 1, 32, they now preach it. give hearty approval to those who do. And the message sounds like this. Promiscuity is no big deal. Boys will be boys. Pornography is not really something that hurts anybody. In fact, it's a normal part of healthy sexuality. Peep shows are fine. Strip joints are harmless. Good way to let off some stress after work. Pedophilia is actually quite nurturing to little boys and little girls. And by the way, if that sounds like a stretch, there are people who already are pressuring us in our thinking to accept the fact that little boys can be nurtured through adult sex and little girls can experience the same. And if you think it's far-fetched that we will ever as a culture believe that, think about the things right now that we accept that 10 years ago you never would have dreamt we would. homosexuality is viable and bestiality who's to say by the way these messages that speak of finding freedom by embracing sin will come in the name of love because we love people we are going to let them do what they want and and just encourage them to embrace this. These messages will come in the name of tolerance. They will come in the name of wisdom. Oh, my goodness, people. We just know so many things now that we didn't know 10 years ago. So we are enlightened now. They will come in the name of freedom, and they will come in the name of God. And because of that, couched in love, tolerance, wisdom, freedom, and God, even among redeemed people, it will sound compelling. It will sometimes seem right. It will literally have the ability, even in our lives, to turn our head. It doesn't seem right. The problem is, the Bible says things like this. Waiting for someone to read it, There is a way that seemeth right unto a man. The end thereof, however, is the way of death, not freedom, not even bondage, death. Romans chapter 1 says that long before the behaviors were being promoted, in verse 32, they give hearty approval to those who do, long before that happened, something more fundamental happened in the hearts and minds of men and women. And that is this, verse 25. They exchanged the truth of God for a lie and began to worship and serve the creature, that is, worship and serve you and me, rather than the creator. God became, I mean, man became God. God then became subservient to me and what I think and what I want and what I feel. He is here now to serve us. Verse 22 of Romans 1 says this, that though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God. They became futile in their speculations, darkened in their heart, professing to be wise, enlightened, more educated than ever before. They became in truth fools and exchanged the glory of an incorruptible God for an image that is corruptible man. Now the one we worship is me, and now the one we worship is you, and what you think and I think and what we feel. The result of that is this. In Romans 1, God gave them over to what? Well, God gave them over to what they wanted. God gave them over to what they already were embracing for themselves, what they were already loving. It says in verse 26, he gave them over to degrading passions. He gave them over to a depraved mind that didn't think straight anymore. Things were false, seemed to be true to this mind. And he gave them over to do things which are not proper. What a corny phrase. Are not proper. That sounds like prudence. Are not proper. The Bible, over to things which are not proper. But these people in Romans 1 not only embraced this and did this, but they began in verse 32 to promote this and preach it. And what they preach is, among other things, this. Freedom. We are free to do this stuff. No more struggle. No more struggle like Romans 7. Hear me. Whether you believe me or not, I believe there is a fatal flaw in this kind of thinking. The fatal flaw, I believe, is this. Freedom born from embracing sin, freedom born from loving your sin, is not freedom. Take it a step further. It's not even bondage. Wrong metaphor. It's death. The good news for the man we met, that is the Apostle Paul in Romans 7, with his struggle, painful as it was, is this. The very fact that he was still struggling and felt pain was a good sign. You know what was a sign of? Life. It was a sign that he was still alive spiritually. I got some good news for dead people spiritually. Know what it is? No pain. Dead people feel no pain. And they can embrace their sin, find freedom in their sin. They are not free. They're not even bound. They're dead. not free from sin they are dead in their sin by the way that is why the word of God over and over again speaks of salvation in terms like this resurrection is what it is it's death to life is what it is it's newness of life once I was blind now I can see. Once I was dead now I'm alive. Once I didn't feel anything now I feel a lot. And some of it is quite frankly a struggle. But it's a sign of life even the struggle. You know it's interesting though I can end the struggle by embracing my sin and finding this is really okay and I can end the struggle. this Friday morning my wife came down into my office at home where I was studying and she was on her way to work I wanted to run this by or this thing I just said to you and just see what it sounded like out loud and if she was going to make any funny faces she makes funny faces I go I need some work on this when I was done she said it's really interesting you talk about this the thing of embracing your sin and finding freedom in that embrace because I just was listening as I was getting ready to Phil Donahue and on Phil Donahue this morning there was a priest who six years ago was diagnosed as having AIDS and in the course of conversation what he indicated on the show was that he thought AIDS to him was a gift the reason it was a gift was because it allowed him to put down the struggle he had been having with his homosexuality And from that moment on, he began to embrace his homosexuality. And he found incredible freedom in the fact that finally, I am going to say this is a good thing, this is a gift from God thing, and I'm going to celebrate my homosexuality. And in that thing, I have found great freedom. In fact, he said, if the Virgin Mary herself were to come to me today and offer to pull back the clock six years, to before I contracted AIDS, and she would take away the AIDS, if I, instead of embracing my homosexuality, would deal with my homosexuality, struggle through that thing, and keep my vows, I would to her say no. Why? I'm free. His freedom, however, was entered into by embracing, by loving, and by the way, now on Phil Donahue, preaching and promoting his sin. He is not free from sin. He has set himself free to sin. Now he's free to sin. free to but as soon as you're embracing it and loving it and promoting it and finding your freedom in it the analogy changes it's no longer about freedom and bondage beloved it is now about life and death and what he's chosen is death that man in his freedom is dead in his sin that man is not a Romans 7 person struggling with not doing what I want to do. The struggle for him is over. It really is over. And in that, I understand what he's, I understand that he had to be free. I understand that desire. He's not in Romans 7. He's Romans 1. Let's get back to the letter. The apostle Paul and his alive to God struggle? The question I want to ask as we kind of get back to what we're talking about this morning, that is sexuality and when it's out of control in our life, was the sin that Paul struggled with a sexual sin? The answer to that is this. We don't know. What we do know is this, that the real life, flesh and blood, Apostle Paul knew what it felt like in some arena of his life, at some time in his life, to feel out of control. That's a great encouragement. That means I'm not alone and neither are you, if you've ever been out of control. At some time in his life, he knew what it felt like to have lost his no, to have, in terms of his experience from his own mouth, lost his ability to choose and follow through, verse 19. the good I wish I do not do. I practice the very evil I hate. Now, the contemporary buzzword for that dynamic of doing what I hate to do is called addiction. The biblical buzzword for that dynamic is called not addiction, but slavery. Being a prisoner to something to be mastered by something, 1 Corinthians 6. And right at the core of that struggle, often as a result of being in that struggle and failing in the struggle, failing would be to do something I really hate, at the core of all of that is shame. And at the core of all that shame or the result of all that shame is despair. And we heard it from the mouth of the apostle Paul. Oh, wretched man that I am. That is a statement born out of shame. But now add this. We don't know whether Paul's out-of-control struggle was in the sexual arena. Let's say your struggle, our struggle, is in the sexual arena. Add this. If our loss of control in the sexual arena is in the church, that is, you're in the church, you go to church, that's kind of the culture you live in, more likely than not, you not only will struggle with shame around your sexual lack of control, you will have silence. because not only in a Christian, not necessarily Christian, but church context is that behavior shaming, it is unspeakable. We can't talk about sex in church. And if you're struggling with that, the last place you're going to get any help or permission to say it out loud is in church. Not every church, but some, maybe many. Now, pull all that together. hidden in silence, shrouded in shame, people will feel helpless and they will feel hopeless. There is nowhere to go. And in conditions like that, people want to die. Sometimes people do die. sometimes in order to get outside of that shame and sometimes to break the silence some way and in the isolation that I find myself in, because you can't ever talk about this without getting condemned beyond belief, I might even be willing to exchange the truth of God for a lie. I understand what that priest did. If shrouded in shame, overwhelmed with silence, the only option I've got for some sort of sanity is even to embrace my sin even though it spells death, I might embrace my sin if some modicum of freedom could be found in that. If I'm right about this, that sexual issues that are out of control are shrouded in shame and are shrouded in silence, meaning we get isolated with these things, and if I'm right that the pain about this is as big as I have said, then I believe that what I'm speaking these days from this pulpit will for some among us be a matter of life and death. And that frightens me. Because I don't want to do further damage. In fact, it even kind of makes me aware about why it's hard to talk about it. if we bring it up, might make it worse. Let's just not talk about it at all. I will probably not say over these next couple of weeks as it relates to out-of-control sexuality, everything that could be said or everything that should be said. I hope I will say enough, however, to push all of us closer to health, closer to hope, and closer to healing, and that some among us who have been isolated by silence about your possible out-of-control reality in this arena will be pushed to get further help beyond what a sermon on Sunday can give you. And while this issue does frighten me because I think the pain involved is significant, I am encouraged by the fact that we are not without resources. and I even want you to know some about them, about their resources. I don't often do this. I don't often tell the people what it is I'm studying. I mean, why do you care? Except with this. I want to put in your hands some things you can follow up on. I am grateful for, and I have borrowed heavily from a number of people. Vincent Gallagher is one, wrote a book I recommend, Three Compulsions That Defeat Most Men. The reason that's top of my list isn't because it's the best book, but it's very easy reading. Pick it up, read it this afternoon. Another author, very helpful to me over these weeks, there's a guy named Patrick Carnes, not a Christian, I don't believe. Wrote a book called Out of the Shadows. Wrote another book called Don't Call It Love. Very helpful in this arena. Another author, Jeff Van Vonder. Now, we all know Jeff. Most of what we know about Jeff are some of his recent books. The book that's been helpful to me of late as it relates to this issue is his first book, Good News for the Chemically Dependent and Those Who Love Them. You might think, well, how does chemicals fit into this? Well, all you have to do is take the chemicals out and put the sex in, and you've got the same dynamic of addiction and loss of control. So this book's been very helpful. Another person that's been very helpful to me is a person in our body named Keith Hankinson. I believe that Keith among us is a gift to our body. God has given him some, I believe, real gifts and capacity to penetrate some of these issues. And at least among our men, has brought tremendous healing to significant numbers, starting with simply permission to talk about this stuff, but also bringing some real healing. I've listened to hours of tapes from Keith. Jeff Van Vondren, in his book, Good News for the Chemically Dependent and Those Who Love Them, writes this, and I quote, Through counseling others and gaining an understanding of the gospel and learning about myself, I have come to see three basic needs in human beings. Before I list them, let me declare that the Bible tells how God has already, through Christ, acted to meet those needs before we are even aware of them. Need number one is this. We need to be convinced that we are loved and accepted without conditions. The key there is to be convinced. We really need to know. The love that we need, beloved, cannot be withdrawn when we make a mistake. If our love is with, if people's love for us is withdrawn when we make a mistake, it is going to build into us not security, but insecurity. On the other hand, the love that we need as human beings cannot be enhanced because we do it right, because we do a trick, because we act cute. We need to know deep in our spirits, regardless of how our performance is, that we are loved. And what that empowers me to do is if I really do know I am loved, I can go through my Romans 7 struggle. I can say it out loud. I can flop on the floor like a fish because no matter how goofy I might get, Nothing's going away in terms of my fundamental love from you. I need the Father's yes. In the middle of my struggle. Got to have that. Second need is this. We need to be convinced that we are valuable, capable, and special. Now, in case that sounds like humanism, some sort of self-help book, hear the Word of God on this. The Word of God says to those who are redeemed, We are, according to Ephesians chapter 1, chosen in him before the foundation of the world. I love that verse because, among other things, what it means is this. Before God made the world, which was a pretty important thing, he did something more important than make the world. He chose you. He chose me. That means you're special. You're valuable. The word of God speaking to believers, redeemed people, speaks of them in words like this. gifted, royal priesthood, holy nation, his workmanship created in Christ Jesus. Complete in him you are. Third need, we need to be convinced that we are not alone as we face life's problems. Go all the way back to creation with me on this one. God made the world of everything that he made. He said one thing, it was good. This is good, this is good, this is good. He made Adam, looked at him and said, that is good too, but there's one thing that isn't good. It isn't good for man to be alone. And so it is God created Eve. And that was the beginning of relationship. And God knew at that moment in creation that one of the ways man and woman were going to have their physical, heart, emotional needs met, even from him, was going to be somehow with people. God, if you will, Jesus, if you will, with skin on, In relationship, we would have those needs met. In relationship, we would get messages of being loved and being valuable and being not alone. And from that initial relationship came family. And God's design for the family is this. The little boys and little girls and moms and dads in a family context would have cemented, would have experience after experience that would communicate to them through that family, you are loved, you are special, and you are not alone. But there's a problem, isn't there? And the problem is this. What God designed families to be, they are not. In fact, they sometimes communicate the very opposite messages relative to what our core needs are. In fact, families communicate sometimes this to little boys and little girls. You are not loved unless, and you are not special. Believe me, why on earth did I have you? Why can't you be like... And something else, little boy and little girl, know this, you are on your own. And we walk out of those families and none of these core legitimate needs are met. Because families break down, one of the things that God has provided is a wonderful thing. It's called the body of Christ. It says in Mark chapter 10, verse 29, Jesus, truly I say, Jesus says, there is no one of you who has lost houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers and farms for my sake, who will not in this life, in this life receive 100 times back houses and fathers and mothers and sisters and brothers and farms. And what's he talking about? He's talking about the body. Hundreds and hundreds of people connected in the body of Christ. But there's a problem with that, isn't there? Because not every person's experience in the body, in the church anyway, has been what God designed it to be because what God designed the body to be, among other things, was a place where I could have experienced and have cemented in my spirit that I am loved because of the grace of God. I am special, valuable, gifted, chosen, royal priest, holy nation, his workmanship. And I'm not alone. Sometimes in churches, the very opposite thing is communicated. You are not loved unless, and you are not gifted and valuable and special unless. And let me tell you pretty much, the truth is, you're on your own. You're on your own. the result of that is two things needs unmet make you thirsty second needs unmet the result of that is two things I will find something and I will do anything to quench my thirst. Two, I will find something, I will do anything to medicate my pain. But the problem with that is most of what we look to to quench our thirst and most of what we look to to medicate our pain leaves us just as thirsty, if not more, Just as much in pain, if not more in pain. But lots of things promise to quench the thirst. Lots of things promise to deal with the pain. And you know what? Not all of the things that can quench our thirst or promise to are patently evil. Some of them on the surface look very, very good. In fact, for many, many years at our church, this place, one of the things we have done is gone really hard at those real subtle things that are positive behaviors that we still use to quench our thirst, medicate our pain, but they're still wrong. Assuming for several years, we all knew the bad things couldn't quench the thirst. You know what I'm saying? Let me just give you an example of a positive thing on the surface that we might use to quench our thirst. Excellence in sports. I love sports. but look at it like this I'm up to plate the place is packed with people it's the bottom of the ninth the score is tied the guy throws a hanging curve I'm on it looks like a volleyball coming to the plate I swing I crack that little bugger out of the park as I round first base and I see it clear the fence there's some messages coming into my head and they're going into my heart you know what they are i am loved hear the people cheer not only that i am special one knows something not everybody can crack that little bugger over the wall but i can i'm special not only that i round third base come to home plate and guess what? I, at home plate, am not alone. The whole team is there. I am not alone. This is great. I'm in center field. The ball leaves the bats. I got a beat on it. Not everybody gets a jump on the ball the way I can get a jump on the ball. It's just about out of my reach, but if I dive, just maybe I dive. This looks good on 10 o'clock news. I catch that ball, and when I catch dead ball, something happens in me. I don't say these words, but as everybody rises to their feet, something happens in my spirit. There's some sort of thirst that's being satisfied because I feel loved and I feel special because not everybody else can do that. Anybody, not everybody can do that. And not only that, I am not, I am not alone. But you know what? I don't even get back to the dugout before something else starts gnawing at me. It's this, what's gonna happen when I can't hit it out of the park anymore. What is going to happen then? And what is going to happen when I don't see the ball as well and don't get quite the same jump on that thing as I used to? I'm going to start getting those same messages that I used to get, and I will be convinced again that I am not loved, and I am not special, and I am alone again. And even on the best day of getting your life even from a positive of thing. There's going to be a nagging doubt that one day this well is going to run dry, and it will. And again, for years, we've talked about that kind of thing, and we've talked about how if you get your life from preaching, spiritual service better be good. One day, you're not going to hit it out of the park. What are you going to do then? What are you going to do when the well starts leaking? What are you going to do when you don't make that sale and your career isn't going up, it's going down, and on and on and on. For years in our history, we did that. But now in our history, our church's life, what about when what we've chosen to quench our thirst isn't this positive thing we need to confront? It's a negative thing. Like out-of-control sexual behavior, what happens then? Well, let me start answering that question by asking another question. Why would anybody choose sexuality to quench their thirst and medicate their pain? I mean, why would they do that? The answer to that is very simple and very short. It's this, because it works. On the front end, sexuality will quench your thirst and it will satisfy your hunger. It will feel real good on the front end. Jeff Van Vonderen, again in his book, Good News for the Chemically Dependent, says of chemicals that among the reasons people use chemicals is this, chemicals are more reliable than people when it comes to relieving emotional pain. See, sometimes I go toward people and I get an incredible rejection. The chemicals never do that. Sometimes I go toward people and it isn't even so much rejection. It's just the pain involved and the work involved of opening myself up and entering in and working through conflict and moving toward intimacy. So much work might yield real intimacy, but the chemicals work right now. Just take the chemicals out, put sex in, you got the same deal. In fact, with both chemicals and sex, I don't even need people in some kinds of sex. I can do sex solo. So all I really need to do is to medicate my pain and to kind of quench my, I just pull out my pornography. and I can just kind of have I can have a relationship is the wrong word but I can pull something off the image on that page and I can listen to the messages that that says to me like I would be available to you, I'm available to you, I would like you, I would notice you and I don't even have to have a relationship and something in that moves me because the core need is to be seen and to be known and to be loved and to be not alone. But what I'm settling for here is something pretty, pretty thin. And I can go to the bookstore and I can go to the X-rated movie and I can go to the strip joints. And at that strip joint, oh, that girl's dancing for me or that guy's dancing for me. Oh, they're here for me. Keith Hankinson talks about symbolic confusion, where we've actually lost the connections between that page and why it is I'm so drawn to that image or that nameless person that I just want to look at and how that is ministering to some core needs that I have no idea how to get to anymore. People who get lost in this, evil, vile, dirty. Yeah. But you want something? Let's get past that. Get past that and add this. Empty, thirsty, starving in the soul. So unable to get the soul core connections that they need in their heart. So unable to get them met in a family or in a body. People. That I've gone to something with a picture. A few years ago, there was a professional hockey player in this town who got arrested for exposing himself. Some of you may remember that. So how do we react to him? He's in a public eye. That kind of thing happens all the time. How do we react to him? He's a pervert. Okay? Okay? After you deal with that stuff, let's get by that stuff and consider for a second what it is that would make a guy who seems to me is getting all sorts of attention by shooting goals on TV every night, gets interviewed on a 10 o'clock news, seems like he's got attention. But if he's taking off his pants and exposing himself, seems to me disconnected to him, symbolic confusion, he's looking for more attention. Like what kind of attention? Well, maybe, bizarre thinking here, maybe if I show you my most intimate place. You know what that person's asking for? To be noticed. Please notice me. And I mean more than just for hockey. I mean, notice me, my most intimate, I will show you my most intimate place. Now, people like that need to be pulled off the street, and the way they victimize people, we need to minister to the victims of that stuff, but that person is a starving soul. Two weeks ago on Star Tribune, I read a quote of a young college girl who had posed nude for Playboy. Playboy evidently had gone around the country to different colleges, and I don't know if it was something like Girls of the Big Ten or something like that. These girls were paid $300 for partial nudity, $500 for total nudity. I thought that wasn't very much money for that kind of exposure. They asked the girl in this interview, just a little blurb it was, why it was she posed for Playboy. She indicated she didn't do it for the money. She did it to be popular. Now, I couldn't believe that when I read it. It's one of the reasons it caught my eye. I thought she'd come up with a slicker explanation for why she was doing it, even if the real reason was because she wanted to be popular. I thought she'd come up with a slicker explanation for that, you know. But that's what she said. I did it to be popular. You know what I believe? I believe that she's going to be more popular. You know what else I believe? I believe that that young woman will not by that act satisfy the thirst in her soul. In fact, what I believe, if she was standing right here, I hope we would treat her like the woman at the well. I'm not here to condemn you. I'm here to tell you that you've been drinking from a well that's going to leave you thirsty. It's going to make you more thirsty. And I'd even try not to yell, because I yell. I preach, I yell. I try not to yell. I'd say, it's just going to make you more thirsty. I yell so much. Not only that, if she was standing here, I'd say not only that, but I believe that ultimately not only will it not quench your thirst, but it's not going to medicate your pain. I don't know about your pain. I don't know about your pain. But see, I just suspect something. I just suspect something that a young woman who wants to be popular, who would show to me and show to you, And basically, anybody wants to buy the magazine, so the whole world. I'll be willing to show you my most private parts, my most intimate areas. Would somebody please, would somebody notice me? Do you hear that? In her? That's what is there. She doesn't know that. She doesn't know that. She's drinking from a well right now that won't quench her thirst, though, and it won't satisfy her hunger. Bad people. I'm going to tell you some good people do that. They get trapped. They get confused. They get core needs that they've lost connection with. That which I would not, that do I do. That, the things I hate, I do. We're going to finish this next week. And next week, we're going to talk about how people get set up for this kind of stuff. How good people sometimes even get set up for this stuff. We're going to talk about how people get trapped in this. How even sometimes believers, redeemed men and women, get trapped in this. and in the end despair in this kind of out-of-control stuff. We're going to talk about some of the behaviors inherent in some of this stuff, and we are going to finally get to what I said several weeks ago we would get to. Eventually, we'll deal with some things like masturbation and pornography. But next week after we do that, we're also going to talk about hope, and we're going to talk about healing. What occurs to me as I close is this, that while some of these other issues can wait until next week, there's something that can't wait till next week. Because this week we need to talk a little bit as we close about hope. We need to talk a little bit about healing. Because if anybody here is lost in this kind of cycle, one of the questions you've got is this. Where is the hope in this? What is the way out of this? It starts with this. At least it starts with this. And what it starts with is something difficult, terrifying. And if, by the way, you have been protecting yourself with a wall of secrecy around your behavior, the first thing you need to do may be a life-threatening thing because what you need to do is you need to break the silence and you need to reveal your secrets. You've got to quit hiding. Yes, Catholic priest on Phil Donahue, you did need to come out of the closet. You did need to say this thing out loud. And you were moving in the right direction. The problem is when you came out, you embraced your sin and you fell in love with it. That's not the direction. But coming out, saying it out, you bet, let's do that. David in Psalm 32, verses 3 through 5, reflecting at a time in his life back on another time in his life when the way he chose to deal with the sin in his life was to create a shroud of silence about it and embrace his sin, justifying himself that what I did really was okay with Bathsheba, and then murdering his husband really was okay, and then just surrounded it with a wall of secrecy. And when he was in the middle of that, you couldn't have gotten through to that. But now in his life, he's looking back on that, and he says this, you know what, when I was silent about my sin, and when I was embracing my sin, my body wasted away. Like the fever heat of summer. But when I confessed my sin, you forgave my sin, and I found in the forgiveness that came from you, I found then real freedom. not freedom from embracing my sin, but being free from my sin, because you forgave it. Grace is what set them free. The breaking of the silence and the giving of grace. But what on earth would give people the courage to the energy to the minute of motivation to break the secrets, break the silence? There's a couple things. One would be this. You hit the wall. It quits working. have some sort of emotional breakdown. Maybe you'll get caught in your behavior. Maybe losing your marriage, losing your job. All of a sudden, I can't keep the secret anymore. I can't pretend anymore, and it comes out. Maybe getting AIDS. The priest on Donahue, he got AIDS. That's what made it come out. That'll do it. There is another way, and it may sound naive that it could come out this way, especially if you've never experienced anything like this, but just imagine with me. this. Wouldn't it be great? Wouldn't it be great if just at least among us the diseases of our soul could begin to be drawn out. The secrets of our heart could begin to be drawn out. The sin that we think we can't share with anybody would begin to be drawn out. And the out of control reality of our life could be drawn out. drawn out by amazing grace. Wouldn't that be something? Remember Paul in Romans 7? That which I would not, that do I do. Incredible bondage there. You know what set him free? Well, he tells us what set him free in Romans 8. In fact, I think the reason he told us about his struggle was so that he could tell us about how it was that he was set free. Thanks be to God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, who has set me free from this law of sin and death. And what it was that set me free was Romans 8, verse 1, when I realized that there really was, for those in Christ, no condemnation. There is now, therefore, no condemnation for those who are in Christ. What that means is this, that even in the middle of my struggle, even at those times when I'm doing things I hate, because there is no condemnation, I am loved. Even when I fail, do the things I hate, I can say it out loud. because when I say it out loud, I'm not going to get condemned. The reason I never say it out loud is because I'm absolutely positive everybody's going to go away, and I am going to get dunked on so big that it will make me want to die. There is now, therefore, no condemnation for Christians, even Christians, believers, who struggle with out-of-control sexuality. No condemnation. You are loved, and your performance one way or another can't change that. but your freedom will never come in embracing your sin and loving your sin and promoting your sin. It's going to come when you break the silence about your sin, when you're really sick of your sin. Then he goes on in Romans 8. Real quickly, I close with this. He says this. You know what else you need to know? Not only are we not condemned, we are loved, but I have come to believe and am convinced of that neither life nor death, life. What would life be? Life can't separate us from the love of Christ. What is life? I would think it means at least this, all the struggles of Romans 7. Even the struggle of Romans 7 can't separate us from the love of Christ. Angels can't do it. Principalities can't do it. Things present can't do it. Things to come can't do it. No power, not height, nor depth, nor any created thing shall ever be able to separate me from the love of Christ, which is in Christ Jesus my Lord. What that means is this. I am not alone, ever alone, never alone. And what that empowers me to do and empowers you to do is this. I'm going to get this. I'm going to say this out loud because he's not going away. He's not going away. And his yes toward me isn't going to change, even with this thing that looks so vile. I'm going to say it out loud. God, help me figure out the ways I'm trying to get my thirst quenched in ways that I hate and my pain medicated in ways that I hate. Break the silence. Hear the words of Jesus. Blessed are the broken. Blessed are those who realize they're powerless to change their behavior on their own. That's the first rule in the 12-step program. Well, guess what? The 12-steppers didn't figure it out. Jesus said, first word out of his mouth, blessed are those who recognize they can't save themselves, they can't with their effort sanctify themselves. Blessed are those who are desperate for grace. Blessed are those who mourn. Second word out of his mouth relative to the gospel means this, not blessed are those who walk around being sad. Blessed are those who get out here, what's in here. Blessed are those who break the silence. Blessed are those who reveal the secrets. They alone, according to the text, get comfort. And blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness not that they cranked out. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness that came to them by grace, a gift. Those words, by the way, from Jesus are not words for people who are looking for ways to embrace their sin. Those words, the kingdom is yours, comfort is yours, are not words for people who are loving their sin and finding their freedom in their sin. Those words are words of hope for people hopefully like you and like me who are so very, very tired of their sin, who are so very, very sick and tired of their sin. Blessed are the broken. Blessed are those who mourn. Blessed are those who are hungering and thirsting for righteousness that He can provide. We'll finish this next week. Would you stand as we close I want the altar ministry to come Those who need prayer you come Some may want to just stay where you are And pray others Just to leave I want to pray Jesus I pray in your name That you by your spirit Would continue to take your truth And pound away at the lies that we've believed for years And use this To set people free I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
