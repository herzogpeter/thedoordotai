All right, well, this morning we're going to see if we can just spend our last session here together thinking about and talking about, okay, you know, what do we do now about what we've heard? What is it that one would go and do having heard this? And I just want to try to give you a new perspective on this, hopefully, because as I've said, I think, you know, proper perspective makes all the difference in the world. Illustrate that by telling you a story. I was in England earlier this year a couple times, and I heard the story of this Anglican vicar who was walking down the street. And he comes across this group of boys, like 10 or 12 boys, all in a circle around this dog. And he's concerned that the boys were hurting or torturing the dog or something. So he goes over and asks, hey, you boys, what are you doing with that dog? And one of the boys looks up at the old vicar and says, he's just an old neighborhood stray. It's okay. We all want him, but only one of us can take him home. And so we've decided to have a little contest. And whichever one of us can tell the biggest lie gets to keep the dog. Well, you know, now the old vicar is like doubly offended, you know. And so he launches into this sermon, you know, this little 10-minute sermonette, telling the boys why they shouldn't be telling lies and having a contest like that. And so his little sermonette begins with, Now you boys know it's a sin to lie. And it ends with, Why, when I was your age, I never told a lie. And the boys were just silent for a minute, and finally one of the little kids looks up and says, all right, give him the dog. A friend of mine was in the Middle East recently, and he overheard a conversation at a consulate office. This guy had gone on vacation with his family, including his mother-in-law, And during their vacation and their tour of Jerusalem, his mother-in-law died. And so he takes the death certificate from the hospital and goes down to the American consulate to make arrangements to send the body back to the states, you know, for a proper family burial. Well, the council, hearing of the death of his mother-in-law, told him that sending the body back to the states would be enormously expensive, that it could, you know, cost, you know, many, many thousands of dollars, perhaps tens of thousands of dollars. So he goes on explaining to him and says, look, if you bury the lady here, it's only going to cost you $150. My friend's friend thinks for a minute and says, I don't care how much it'll cost to send the body back. That's really what I want to do. And the consul hears him and goes, man, you must have loved your mother-in-law very much, considering how much you're willing to spend to send her body back. And John says, oh, no, it's not that. You see, I know of a case many years ago of a person that was buried here in Jerusalem. And on the third day, he rose again from the dead. I just can't take that chance. So you see, whatever it is that you think's going on really does make a big difference. Can you stand one more? Group of American scientists, Dallas probably knew these guys. They were feeling pretty good about themselves, you know, with the whole DNA mapping and cloning thing, you know, and they're sitting around a bar one day and they decided, you know what, one of us just needs to go tell God we don't really need him anymore. I mean, his kind of main thing was making people and we got that down now. So who needs God? So they elected one of their members to go tell God, you know, we don't think we need you anymore. You know, we can pretty much do your gig. You know, the thing you're most famous for, we got down now. So God, you know, being patient, listens to this man very, you know, patiently and says, all right, well, how about if we do this? How about if we have a man-making contest? The scientist says, okay, God, I'm telling you, we're down for that. We can handle this. And God says, okay, but look, there's just one ground rule. We're going to do it way back like we did in the old days with Adam and Eve. Scientist not deterred, he said, I can tell you, God, we can hang with you. And at that moment, he bends down to grab a handful of dirt. And God says, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You go get your own dirt. All right. Enough playing. We've got to work now. Here's what I, you know, I actually don't know what Dallas is going to say, but here's what I would want you to think about as we start kind of winding down our time together and start thinking about, you know, what do we do about what we've been hearing? and so I want to give you just a brief sentence and I want to ask you to write it down because in a moment I'm going to ask you to stand and get in little groups and talk about it for a minute so jot this down as just kind of a beginning going away statement and it's something that I've learned from the gospel in our culture network group of professors who are missiologists from various seminaries and universities around the country. I'm not sure I've ever had an original thought, so this isn't mine. I'm always learning something from somebody. But jot this down, nevertheless. I'm not sure it's an exact quote. The gospel is not just a message to be proclaimed. The gospel is not just a message to be proclaimed. And now here's the big part. It is the form, the form of our participation in what God is doing in and for the world. I'll say that again. The gospel is not just a message to be proclaimed. It is the form of our participation in what God is doing in and for the world. So now this isn't a test. I just want to get your brains going this morning. I want you to take that, and in a second, I'm going to ask you to stand and get in groups, the three, four, five, six, whatever's comfortable around you there. And just for a few minutes, just bat that around. What could that mean? What does it mean that the gospel is not simply a message, as we all would have thought, but what could it mean, based on what you've been hearing Dallas and I say, that it's also the form, it shows us the form of our participation, in what God is doing in and for the world. Okay, you got it? All right, so let's all stand, get in groups of three, four, five, or whatever, bat that around for a little bit and we'll come back together and see what we figured out, okay? Can we get one more microphone? and I'm going to run around with one on this side. Can we have one on that side? Okay, here's what we're trying to do in this exercise and in the rest of this morning. I said earlier as we were getting going, I don't even know what day this is. It must have been yesterday. that human beings don't live from moral abstractions or little bits of verses you know ripped apart from their story and sort of hung together at best in some sort of systematic theology human beings don't typically live that way human beings typically live out of their imagination They live out of an instinctual, intuitive understanding of what's real, what's right for them, what's true, what's just. And that's normally informed by some sort of story. And what I'm wanting you to go out of here is some sort of mental vision, some sort of really solid sense of who you are and what story you're living in and how that informs the kind of people that we're trying to be. And so I've tried to boil it down to this very simple little vision that we're seeking to be the cooperative friends of Jesus. And as Dallas has been telling us that there is a passive and active part of that. And in the rhythm of that passive and active part. And as I've said, it's nothing heavy. As Dallas said, there's nothing meritorious in it. Or there's nothing legalism in and about it. It's, you know, as we read in the message, it's learning to live in the rhythms of grace. It's following Jesus and him teaching us actually the good life. And that the narrow way is the good life. that in following him we learn to live freely and lightly so we're seeking just to be the cooperative friends of Jesus and cooperation has in its genesis grace I don't know that we've talked a lot about grace this weekend but you know in the in the kind of religious tradition that I come out of grace gets equated simply and oftentimes only with the forgiveness of sins and of course grace has everything to do with the forgiveness of sins, but really all of this stuff is of grace. Creation is an act of grace that we're breathing right now is an act of grace. We live in, you know, the realm, the, you know, the sky. We are surrounded by grace. And so this cooperation we're talking about is simply human beings choosing, as Dallas would say, to bring our own queendom or our own kingdom and put it in the mix of what God's doing so that he begins to rule and reign over us as we submit ourselves to him. So that's what we mean by cooperation. So we're seeking to be the cooperative friends of Jesus, living constant lives of creative goodness through the power of the Holy Spirit for the sake of others. All right, so that sort of simple vision is what we're trying to put forward. And now we just want to say, okay, well, what are some ideas, what are some sort of practical, pragmatic thoughts that we could think that would hold that vision before our mind so that what I'm really after is that that becomes the organizing principle of your life. That's what I'm really after. Because that's what most human beings need. And actually, most of them have one. They may not be conscious of it, But, you know, a drug addict has an organizing principle for his life. A scientist, he or she has typically some sort of organizing mental picture or imagination that they're working from. So I'm trying to, and Dallas and I are trying to present to you an understanding of the gospel that has the potential to become the force that makes all the various bits of your life cohere around something or stick to something so that it all becomes something that's coherent and naturally and easily organized and it doesn't feel forced or religious or unnatural at all. It actually becomes the most natural thing in the world. As Dallas said yesterday, Jesus didn't say through gritted teeth on the cross, Father, forgive the little buggers. Because there was something going on in him that had caused all the things of his life to cohere around a story that for him, as it was more and more embodied, was just easier and easier. All right, so now, with that being what we're shooting for here, what does that little statement that I gave you, how would that help inform our thinking about having an imagination around which all the various parts of our life could cohere? Remember I read to you the, didn't I read you the little introduction to Matthew from the message? Remember Peterson says in there that in Jesus, Not only is all of God's story completed from creation to tell us, but we find all the parts of our life, marriage, family, work, paying taxes, raising children, we find all the parts of our life completed in Jesus as well. And from him and his story, we get orientation, briefing, background, and reassurance. Well, that's what I'm looking for here. So the design of this little exercise is how does the gospel do that? How does the gospel actually define for us the form of our participation, or as I've been saying, our cooperation in what God's doing? So we've got to start with this. Everybody ready? Montel, you ready? You're a little bit white, but you look ready. Okay. First of all, what's the gospel? The good news of what? okay so we got that far right so it's the gospel here is not just a message to be proclaimed but it's the form of our participation and so the gospel is what say it again the good news of what that the kingdom of god is at hand so that's the number one concept here that's why this conference is called kingdom living we weren't trying to trick you kingdom living walking in the character and power of God so now this this little statement begins to come clear if you think that the gospel is the kingdom the the announcement of Jesus that in his person the kingdom of God was at hand and now you know as it began to expand out to others and to us you know post-pentecost people now we're saying how does the the root the pre now we got to ask well, what's the kingdom? The effective reach of God's own personhood, the range of his effective will. I've suggested to you, think of it as a verb. I mean, I think that you shouldn't need to say that based on Dallas's definition of it being the effective range of his will, because that implies, I guess, it has both noun qualities to it in terms of the place in which it happens, but it has verb qualities to it that I think if you'll keep the verb qualities of that word basileia in your mind it'll probably work better I think it works I find that it works especially better for beginners to think of the kingdom as the ongoing expression of God's person and as he expresses himself there his rule and reign comes so think of his ruling and reigning as an activity more like a verb okay so the gospel is the good news of the presence of the kingdom the kingdom is the expression of God's will how then does that now shape and form our participation in what God is doing in and for the world what what kind of things did you think of come on you had to think of something here we go there's back here let's we'll use the mic now because we'll hear some various things here the one one thing that came to me when we were all talking and kind of ideas came as we talked but the one thing that came to me as i grew in relationship with my husband it was like when his hand touched my hand it was like my own hand touching my hand and just the feel of god um like a month or so ago just when he was working through me just like he was his touching me was about being me. And I can't even explain it. Just that same kind of thing as relationship, the sameness, oneness with him. Yeah. So there's kind of a hand in glove thing going on here. That as God acts, we act with him. And there's a unity there. Someone else? Oprah's side. Montel's going to his. All right. Thank you, Montel. Oh, no, over here. Yes. How did you say that? Preach the gospel to the world, and when necessary, use words. Very good. So that is actually very important, because on the normal conservative Protestant telling of this story, there is nothing for us to do. And in fact, any idea of doing is suspicious. that it is, what are we suspicious about there, that it's what? Works. Or, you know, it's somehow the gospel on the left. Well, I mean, is there a way of doing the activities of the gospel on the left that is actually arising from a participation with the kingdom of God that is at hand? Well, of course there is. So we, this is one of the things that the word there, participation, is enormously important. Or the word that Dallas and I have been using, cooperation. See, the reason those things are very important is that they contain both the passive and active parts of this. And they do it in a way that takes it completely out of the category of works or legalism or thinking that something is meritorious, that we're earning something from it. See, we get forced into that category. I think this is very important. I'm sure this has been said in one form or another, but let me say it again. We get stuck into that kind of works righteousness category when we see the gospel as having only to do with forgiveness of sins. And if that's someone's mental construct about what the gospel is, and that's the only way they know how to think about this whole business, then that's where we get confused about that. But if you're seeing the gospel as Jesus proclaimed it, as the good news of the present availability of God's rule and reign through him and the grace of God in him, and we're then called into that as the cooperative friends of Jesus or participants in this, well, suddenly those questions can still be alive and valid, but they're put in a much, much, much broader context and we have other ways of thinking about them and coming up with answers for them. Okay, let's do a couple more. What else did you think? one of the things that our group came up with was that word participation I think hit all of us was that we're not observers when I observe someone in relationship I just listen to what they're saying and I might say sorry and I carry on if I participate in relationship with them then I'm asking God what's my move, what's my part in the play of what's going on and that invites me to say to the person would you like to pray can I pray for you it's a very active part it's it's not a passive way of living with people right very good um i think what this helps us get to um i don't know if you've ever tried to think this thought but what is god's ultimate intention see i have a feeling now again i may be just reflecting my own conservative evangelical background which by the way when I say that I'm not putting it down I'm just trying to give you a point of reference I'm not in any way putting it down so I may just be reflecting my own background but but I I have to be honest and say in in virtually 99 or 100 percent of the time when I've heard the gospel talked about in my background the story starts with the fall and it kind of goes downhill from there and uh and then we now we've got this big problem we got to fix called sin and uh you know dallas talks about it in the nine conspiracy is you know sin management but but you know it only takes one second of thought to realize well wait a minute our story doesn't start with the fall um you know you might say well it starts with creation or you might say that it starts somewhere in the intentionality of God's own person. So it starts somewhere, but it does not start at the fall. So what was God's ultimate intention in creating human beings? And if you start there, instead of starting at the fall, you have a whole other way of getting to this issue of participation that removes it completely from the issues of works righteousness and puts it squarely in that word cooperation in the cooperative friends of Jesus. Again, I said the other day, when God created Adam and Eve, he didn't say, now just go relate. Go form a community. And the reason that is so stark in my own mind is the last five or six years of working with kind of emerging church people, one of the things I've noticed in very bright, very sincere, you know, 20-something church planners is that there's an instinctual knee-jerk reaction to anything institutional, to anything organizational, or to anything with much intentionality attached to it. For many people, probably for some of you in this room, today, intention is simply a euphemism or a synonym for manipulation. And so it's very hard for us even to evangelize because what right do we have to be trying to enforce our story or put our story on someone else's? Makes evangelism almost impossible if you have that worldview. You know what else it makes virtually impossible? Leadership. Because what right do I have to lead you towards a preferable future that's rooted in a vision that I have from God? I shouldn't even be trying to do that with you. Well, again, intentionality can come back if we see something that is wider than simply, if we see the gospel as something wider than simply forgiveness of sins. If we can think back farther into the story, God's intention was not to create people to just go have a community, which is the place that a lot of these young people are going because they just honestly can't see any other move to make. But mere community devolves into something just as unproductive as mere institutionalism or something that's built around merely organizational theory. Those aren't our only options. There are options available to us in which we can create communities of faith who actually do intend to cooperate with or participate in this story and that there is goodness and appropriate values and ethics attached to that. but many many people are stuck today having deconstructed you know the things they don't like and trying to construct something that's merely community and I know now after five or six years of working with those people that it's not satisfying either and so we have to find a third way here and I want to suggest that I think the third way is in something like that statement I just gave you how do we create communities of faith that exist for mutual edification as paul gives us a vision for that in romans and ephesians and first corinthians of the body ministering to each other how do we create communities of faith who are self-consciously trying to be the people of god in what that means in terms of ultimate intention to have cooperative friends it's what God was getting at in Adam and Eve. It's what God was getting at in the calling of Abraham and the creation of that nation. And it's what God's getting at in Pentecost in the church. Now see, if you have that broader view, you have at least a starting point for participation, for cooperation, and it's a starting point that takes it completely out of the issue of earning my salvation. Does that make sense? And I think it's really important that we hold on to that, that sense of ultimate intention, or I don't think we'll ever get to a kind of light and easy free place of participation, as you're saying back. All right, let's do a couple more, and then we'll move on. Yes, sir. How does that bring up with the fact that we were made for God's pleasure? Yeah, say it again. That's a very good question. I'm trying to remember your last statement. Participation. How do we participate effectively? We were made for God's pleasure. Right. And in many cases, we are moving in order to satisfy ourselves in relation to friends. Right. But this cooperative effort between friends would please God. Yes, I agree with you. The question basically is, you know, how does this work with the notion that people were created for God's pleasure? And I would just say that there is a pleasure that's inherent in the family business of the Trinity or the relationship of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. there is both relational and what the theologians would call economic pleasure in that. And economic just simply means activities, you know, workings. There are workings and relational elements of the Trinity that there is pleasure in that, pleasure beyond what we can even imagine, we can even imagine in the delight of God even in himself and what he's up to. Now, we're invited, as I said yesterday into the family business of the Trinity. And the gifts of discernment and wisdom and knowledge and the power and the authority and all this stuff that we've talked about yesterday that God gives us are the means through which we are allowed to participate in both the relational and economics or workings of the Trinity, which is our family business that we've been invited into. Does that help? All right. Well, what I want to do then in the last few minutes we have together, and thanks, by the way, for doing that. I hope it was useful to you. I want to try to put some concepts together so that you can have some legs to walk with this with. And so I want to talk about calling, mission, and gifts and how they integrate holistically in a disciple's life. now part of this is hard because it really is just um it's just language stuff it's um you know we use different words for different things and at some points I'm not sure how much it really matters but just for the sake of us communicating together what I would what I would like at least just for this conversation um for us to hold is sort of the umbrella theme under all of this is the word calling and this is why it gets a little bit hard because normally if I say calling, if we did word association and I said calling, you know, you might say back, I'm called to be a deacon or I'm called to the gift of healing or something like that. And it's not that that's, you know, bad or wrong, but the reason I like the word calling as the broadest, more umbrella theme is because, as I said the other day, our English word for calling translates from a Latin word. And the Latin word from which we get calling is fundamentally a relational term. So the way to think of that is think of God saying, Adam, where are you? Or the parable of the loving father waiting for his son who is a prodigious sinner. As he waits for him, that's a relational act. so that our calling, what I want to suggest, that I would hope as you go home from here and think about what to do about this, that you would think of your calling is to be, so this is the most fundamental part of you, your calling is to be an apprentice of Jesus. That's your calling. That's the most fundamental thing that you're called to, is to be a student of Jesus, learning to live your life, as a junior high math teacher who coaches the girls' volleyball team, you're trying to learn to live that life the way Jesus would live it if he were you. That's your fundamental calling, okay? Now, again, I'm not getting nitpicky over the words, but it's just the best way I know how to explain it. And I think that's really important because otherwise we reduce this. It gets too particular. It gets too narrow. and we don't have a bigger story around which the smaller bits of our lives, other callings, so to speak, marriages, children relationships, friend relationships, we don't have anywhere to put that stuff if we don't have a bigger picture of my calling is to be an apprentice of Jesus. Does that make sense? Are we okay so far? So if you're stumbling over the word, I guess forget it. You could put your own word in. But I want you to at least get that concept. That's the number one thing. And then what we would normally call callings, I want to suggest the word mission or something like that. The place I'm sent, my sense of mission, my sense of what I'm to do as the apprentice of Jesus. So again, you can pick your own word. I'll just suggest mission. And then what I want to suggest is that finding one's call is the most important human thing. To hear the good news of the gospel and to respond to it by placing yourself into the ruling and reigning of God and becoming a student of Jesus so that you learn to be an ambassador of that kingdom, 2 Corinthians 5, 17, and following there. that you learn to be, as a new creation in Christ, one of his ambassadors, participating in his work of reconciling the whole earth to himself. That's your fundamental calling. Within that, you're going to be sent. You're going to get a sense of mission. And this gets at what I think, again, is emerging both from scholarly literature among the missiologists, but it's also emerging in some of the young emerging type leaders you'll hear the word a lot these days missional and you know it of course can mean all kinds of things but but when I hear it used best and most seriously is people are grappling for a sense of what does it be what does it mean to be sent into a post-modern post-christian world now sorry to throw those big words out there just think of contemporary society that we all know somewhere in our guts is fundamentally different than post-World War II up to about the turn of the last century world. That something in the last 10 or 15 years or more seems to be really shifting right underneath our feet as religion in general and the church more specifically is marginalized. It no longer sits at the center of the social imagination of our public. That's what post-Christendom means. And post-modernity, you know, is just, You know, it's got cultural aspects to it. It's got philosophical aspects to it. So whatever, you know, that ends up being, there's certainly a shift in the way people are thinking about truth and how one can know truth, how certain you can be about your knowledge of truth. How does one, you know, ascertain and hold truth? How does one pass it on? What are the problems associated with all that? Well, you know, that has both philosophical, you know, issues to it, but it also has just sort of ground level things that emerge through media and movies and TV shows and songs, and it's changing something in our culture. And what many people are wondering is how do we be the sent people of God into the midst of that? And that's mission. That's the place that God puts you to work in the garden, so to speak. You know, he gives you your row in the garden. Now, that's not the most fundamental thing. The most fundamental thing is your calling to be an apprentice of Jesus, but that gets worked out somehow in a row in the garden. And then the third thing is gifts. Now, we got to this a little bit last night, but let me say it again because I think it's worth repeating. Is it 11 o'clock already? Oh, 10. Oh, you didn't change your clock up here. You forgot to fall back. Should we make the podium fall back? I suddenly thought, oh my gosh, my time's gone. I know, how could I have been here for two days and not noticed that? Silly me. We got at this a little bit last night, but let me just say it again, because just because we said something doesn't mean we all grasp it. I want to say that the reason a lot of people are not more active and comfortable with the gifts is because they've never heard a call to a mission. See, I want to say that mission evokes gifts, not the other way around. My mentor, John Wimber, used to say the guidance system on a rocket doesn't really mean much until that rocket is off the launching pad. now what do you suppose he's saying there think of any of the sort of verbal gifts of wisdom discernment knowledge prophecy i guess you could throw in uh you know discerning of tongues or interpretation of tongues those kind of gifts of god speaking with you you're going to find them coming more and more into play when you're off the launching pad and into doing something. You see what I'm saying? The need for communication happens when that thing is actually blasted off and you're going somewhere and doing something. You will find communication with God in the way that Paul talks about in his various lists of gifts. Those come into play when one is at mission. And again, as I just reflect back again on my experience in the church over the last 30 years, I actually explicitly did this. We used to give people gift inventories, right? You ever taken any of those? Again, I'm not putting them down. They have their usefulness and their place. I think where they actually broke down is that people would take those tests, get some sense, and let's just assume fundamentally right, about their gifts, but it left them still with no imagination about what to do with them. And so we would try to work with them and them with us to try to then plug them into some job that they could do in the church. And what I want to say is when you hear God call you to a mission and you begin to step out in that mission in faith as you see your row in the garden that you're supposed to work in and you start working in it shoulder to shoulder with the rest of us you will find that as you do that the gifts that you need will be given you that's why what we were doing last night with the gifts and saying that they're not mostly a constituted issue that they're situational that's why that's so important and let me say again or refer to the illustration i used last night again that i learned from wimber wimber used to think of this as we're like plumbers going out to a job and so you know we get a call from the dispatcher we go out to do the job and we're carrying a toolbox but the toolbox is empty and when we get out to the job and we look under the sink and we see what's wrong. We reach back into a toolbox that we know we brought in empty. But we also know that the tool we need in that moment will be provided as we reach into the box. That gifts are situational. Any of you can be used in any gifts of the Spirit at any time. This is what Paul's getting at in that first paragraph of 1 Corinthians 12. There's lots of different gifts, lots of different manifestations of those gifts. And God uses them in various ways and in various people as he sees fit. So I don't really have a quarrel with seeing Paul's metaphor of the body as being, having some elements of a one-to-one correspondence between a person and a gift. I don't think we have to throw that out. What I would say, we have to add to it that even if, even if just experientially we feel like I have the gift of teaching. Or take somebody like Dallas who actually is a teacher. Okay, we could all agree Dallas clearly has the gift of teaching, but that doesn't mean that God couldn't occasionally prophesy through him, that he couldn't occasionally heal the sick through him, that he couldn't occasionally give a word of wisdom or knowledge. Are you with me here? So it's very important that we see that the gifts aren't merely constituted, that a human being doesn't only equal an elbow and therefore could never be used like a hand. And I think that that metaphor has been pushed too far so that many people have no imagination for being able to be used in any of the gifts at any time. And once you get out in a mission, let's say, for instance, one of you in the room feels called to start a after-school youth center in a place in town where there's a lot of gang activity or something. And you should know that you know that you know that you're supposed to do that mission as a part of what it means for you to be an apprentice of Jesus. Are you with me here? So as an apprentice of Jesus, you feel called to a mission of starting a youth center. Now, can't you easily see with me that as you begin to work with 20 or 30 troubled kids that you're going to need about every gift you can get your hand on? Are you with me here? Now, you may, let's say, primarily have the gift of leadership. And that's why you could even pull something like that off. But you're going to need more than that. You're going to occasionally need a gift of discernment of spirits. You're going to occasionally need a word of wisdom or a word of knowledge. There are going to be times when you're going to want to pray for a crack addict and hope that through you a gift of healing will come to that person. Are you with me here? But if you are reducing yourself to, well, I'm only a hand, probably this works negatively in the reverse. Probably you're never going to hear a call to mission because it's very, very rare that any sense of mission can be reduced to one gift. are you with me here so what you want to do is as an apprentice of jesus begin to seek god for what's my role what's my row in the garden and then as you begin to work that row in the garden just in you know um cooperative community with the people working shoulder to shoulder with you and as you begin to try to do that job with the best wisdom and just putting your best self forward, as you begin to do that, God will begin to give you the gifts necessary to work that vision, that mission, sorry. Now, for me, I wanna say that this process is central to what it means to be fully human and to be fully alive. And it gets right at the heart of the good news that is not only a message, but that defines our participation in the gospel. And this, I think, is a major inroad for evangelism in our day. Remember I said the other day that for now on, when you see Christ on the cross, in your mind's eye, do not merely see atonement. Now, neither Dallas nor I nor any thoughtful person I know is setting aside atonement. But what we are guilty of, and I think in our day, mostly what we're guilty of, is seeing merely atonement. And not seeing that on the Christ, there is humanity as God intended it. Jesus is the fully human, fully alive, always safe and secure one in his father's love and his father's kingdom. That is Adam and Eve as God intended it. And also on the cross, that is Israel as God intended it. The fully obedient, fully alive, fully human one, becoming the agent through which all of God's promises to Israel will be fulfilled for the sake of the world. Now, the reason that's so important is that it gives you an imagination for cooperation or participation. If you see only atonement going on, there's nothing left for us to do. it's all been done and we're left with no imagination for anything and anything we can get an imagination for when you see this whole thing as being about atonement is immediately works righteousness but if you see God's ultimate intention is to have a people who naturally and easily and out of their own love for him participate with him or become his cooperative friends and they do so through the power of the holy spirit and they do so think here of philippians chapter 2 for instance for the sake of others not considering equality with god in this passive assertive thing that's happening they don't consider equality there with god being caught up into the family business of the trinity is something worthy to be grasped but they let go of it. And they incarnate themselves in the world like Jesus did, not to earn anything. It's just our family story. It's what we do. We're from a long line of bakers. We bake. Are you with me here? It's really that simple. We're from a long line of bakers. We bake. No, we're from a long line of Christ followers who are working with him in God's story on the earth. We get caught up into that family business of the Trinity, but we do so for the sake of others. That's our mission. so we have a calling to be the apprentices or students of jesus learning to cooperate with him with our our real life as i drew on the board the other day but we do it this is the missional part we do it for the sake of others so i'm trying to get you to see this morning that we're created to be actors in god's story and that discovering one's mission as an apprentice of Jesus that's to discover your role as an actor in this story and I think they have the power to become the organizing principle for your life so that as you begin to sense your mission what I found something that's enormously helpful about it is that it breaks the power of false dualisms like sacred secular. It breaks the power of false categories that we, most of us modern people, carry around in our lives. Because one of the hallmarks of modernity is modernity saw discreteness. It saw separateness, and it was very fond of categorizing things, of pulling things apart and into their smallest bits and then categorizing them with the notion and often true that we could then understand it better, put it back together and make it better and make it more useful. And so we've all sort of grown up with the instinct of categorizing or making things discreet. And it's not so intuitive for us to see things holistically, to see things around which a whole life could naturally and easily cohere. Well, what we've given to you this weekend is a way to do that. you're an apprentice of Jesus that then makes sense of all the various bits of our life it gives us something around which life can cohere and it breaks these very very powerful mental models we have of things like sacred and secular or bits of our lives that don't seem to normally naturally integrate into something that's a really beautiful whole of work and home and play and neighborhood and friends. But this is the way that you can actually do that. Now, here's where mission and why mission so easily comes into the picture once one is an apprentice. As soon as somebody is a disciple and wants to work with God in his story, literally almost the moment that happens one will begin to see with God's eyes and hear with God's ears and something of what Jesus was talking about when he said I only do the things I see my father doing I only say the things I hear him saying when my father's working I work I this is just this is what I do I'm I am caught up in the family business of the trinity well once you're caught up in that you're going to begin to see and hear in a very similar way and when that happens you know in some ways you're just forever altered you will never see the world the same again you'll suddenly begin to see beauty where you've never seen it and you may want to cooperate with that beauty and add yours to it but for some of you you're going to begin to see injustices in the world, places of pain, places where healing needs to be brought, places of oppression. And you're going to see it in a way that you've never seen it before. You're going to hear the cries of the oppressed in the way that you've never heard it. That will become to you something that pulls something out of you towards mission. Because you made the previous decision and you really meant it you actually did step into a new reality of the kingdom of God and once that happens you begin to see and hear in a way that you haven't before and that will begin to bring all the things of your life together now what happens though and this is how mission gets really specific is this can be this can actually be a little bit disorienting I mean I've I've seen people for whom they've stepped into the reality of the kingdom of God. They begin to hear and see in ways that they haven't. And they actually go through a period of freaking out a little bit. It's almost like being on a thrill ride or something where, you know, or there was a room I used to had at Disneyland when I was a kid that you would walk into and it had all these weird mirrors and stuff, you know, and it may just seem like you're tilted or really fat or really skinny, you know, and it's sort of, you know, you're in this disorienting space for fun. Well, it can feel that way a little bit. And this is one of the things that I see over and over and over again is people step into that reality. They begin to see and hear in a whole new way with reference to God and the world and they get paralyzed. They don't know what to do. Think about it. There is so much pain in the world. There's so much injustice. There's so much oppression. There's plenty of beauty and wonder around. And then you have to stop and go, what do I do? That's mission. See what I'm saying? Once you step in and you begin to get the answer for what do I do, that's your sense of mission. That's your row in the garden. And you have to just content yourself with that. And there's just so much to say and you can't say everything in a weekend. But it's very instructive, for instance, to just read through the synoptic gospels, or John 2, I suppose. But especially in the synoptics, you see these pictures of Jesus where why does he heal one man at the pool when everyone else around is sick too? Why is it that even Jesus himself isn't sort of Mr. Fix-It? He doesn't just fix everything. He does what he sees the Father doing. As he senses his mission on a given day or at a given point in time, he does it. And if that were true for him, I think it's all the more true for us that we just humbly accept our little row in the garden and we do our best there. And I suppose God could, you know, shift us around from here to there. But the idea is one of focus. If calling to be an apprentice of Jesus is the overall umbrella idea, what brings us down to a little bit of focus is having a sense of mission. What gifts do is empower us in the carrying out of that mission. all right now i want to take just our last few minutes and then we'll do some dallas and i'll do some question and answer together from 10 30 to 11 um maybe have a little conversation with each other we'll we'll do something fun here trust me all right let's think just a little bit more about mission and um let me give you as i did yesterday some sort of values around you know learning to minister in the Holy Spirit let me try to give you some values here around mission and and how it really works the first thing I've already said but let me say it again to make sure you really get it is that this idea of calling and mission is hugely important to humanity I mean from a God word point of view it's important because it was his ultimate intention. But from the human angle, it's enormously important because it gives our lives something around which they can cohere. And fundamentally, you know, brokenness is all about incoherence. You know, any therapist here would get that immediately. Anybody in law enforcement would get that immediately. That one way to talk about human brokenness is incoherence. Nothing around which a life can really cohere, or at least nothing fundamentally good. But in a mission, we get something that can bring together all the various aspects of our lives. Now, going back a little bit to what we were talking about yesterday, about creating communities of the Holy Spirit, I'd like to suggest that it's enormously important that we create communities of faith that honor call, excuse me, honor mission in our own lives and in the lives of those around us. And that in general, we let people do and be as their conscience dictates. It's enormously important because otherwise you won't be able to sustain the kind of risk-taking environment out of which kingdom creativity and giftedness comes i think a very important model for this the quakers did it over decision making i've adapted it as sort of a more fundamental principle have you ever heard of the old Quaker idea of a meeting for clearness? Anybody ever heard of that? You could, I think it's in one of Richard Foster's books, maybe Celebration of Discipline, where Richard, you know, is an old Quaker pastor, talks about this. Well, here's what the old Quakers would do. If somebody in one of their fellowships was having to make an important decision, they would gather together the community or an element of the community, and they would sit in somebody's living room and the person would describe the quandary that they were in and describe the decision that they were trying to make. The community would listen to them, as I was teaching you last night, listening to them but with one ear to the Holy Spirit. They would listen to this person, ask them clarifying questions to fully draw them out, and then these old Quakers would just get silent for a period of time 15 minutes half hour hour they would just be silent and asking the lord you know what the lord is doing here then they would maybe ask some further clarifying question of the person in need of clearness and then share openly with that person what they thought the holy spirit was saying now up to that point that all sounds sort of routine but this I think is the magic in it. Those old Quakers, knowing what Dallas has been teaching us about the importance of human personhood, left that person to do what was right according to their present conscience and never judged them. Now, if you can get that going in your community of faith, you will find people discovering mission and gifts all the time. But if what's going on in, but if the social psychology of a group, whether a big church like this or a small one, if the social psychology is one of suspicion, one of judgment, one of harshness, and it's not the community of love that Paul was dreaming of in 1 Corinthians 13 in the midst of all these manifestations of the gift, if that's not there, it will shut down calling, mission, and gifts. So I would say to the leaders of fellowships here that I have seen it maybe be equally as true that there are either theological issues, you know, misunderstandings of calling, mission, and gifts. That can sometimes shut this process down, but I actually think that the process is shut down more not through theological misunderstanding as it is through a social psychology in a church that is not a community of love. Only a community of love can sustain risk-taking, can sustain, I think the Lord is saying to me thus and so, and can let people do it. Now, obviously within reason, there's exceptions to every rule, but within reason can let people do it and celebrate success or failure. You know, all this is is a corporate application of what Dallas taught us yesterday about Jesus and Peter. Peter was allowed to fail. actually created a space in which he could fail but be safe because I've prayed for you that ultimately your faith would not fail now that environment of trust that Jesus created with Peter and his earliest followers we can create in our communities of faith and as we do that even big time failure like denying the Lord three times can have positive meaning to it it can be a step of growth. Are you with me here? Okay. A couple more things here, just kind of big value things. Pursuing mission always risks rejection. And now this, now, so I'm sort of stepping back from social psychology and just thinking now about individual personhood. There exists in almost all of us the desire to conform in order to please people okay can we just again there's exceptions but let's just let that sit there for a minute and almost all of us there's some desire to conform and and the desire to conform is rooted in a desire to please people Thank you.
