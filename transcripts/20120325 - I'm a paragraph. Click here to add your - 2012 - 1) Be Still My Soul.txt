Be still, my soul, the Lord is on thy side. Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain. Cieve to thy God to order and provide. In every change he faithful will remain. Be still, my soul, thy best, thy heavenly friend. Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end Be still, my soul, thy God of thunder take To guide the future as he has the past Thy hope, thy confidence Let nothing shake All now mysterious shall be by at last Be still my soul, the waves and winds still know His voice to rule them while He dwell below Still my soul The hours hastening long When we shall be Forever with the Lord When disappointment When pain and fear are gone Sorrow for God's purest joys restore They still my soul When change and tears are past All safe and blessed we shall meet at last Be still, my soul, begin the song of praise On earth believing to the Lord on high Acknowledge Him in all our words and words So shall he heal me with the well? Please die, be still my soul The Son of Life Divine Through the sea clouds shall but more bright be shine Be still, my soul, the sun of light divine Through passing clouds shall one more brightly shine I listened to that song, and I'm not kidding you, probably 50 times this last week. that version of that song, and it kind of awoke something in me and undid something in me, and so we decided to create a service around it. And part of it is so that we can begin to prepare for what's going to happen in a couple weeks, and that is when we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus. And so many times I end up on Good Friday and like I've done nothing to prepare for this beautiful centerpiece of our faith. And so what we wanted to do this morning is just provide some space and a reminder for you to begin to prepare your hearts and your minds and your souls for this event. that changed history that's going to happen in a couple weeks. And so just to remind you when our service times are, Good Friday, we have two identical services, six and eight on Good Friday. And then on Easter, Saturday and Sunday, we have a Saturday service at five o'clock. And then three services on Sunday, one at 8 a.m., one at 9.30 a.m., and then one at 11. So make sure to make note of those different service times. but one of the things that sort of arrested me about that song is the phrase obviously be still my soul and we all know how to take our pulse we all know how to do that what if we could place our hand on a part of our body and get the sense of the pulse of our soul what if there was a place that we could touch that would show us on a graph the state of how our soul was actually doing. The actual you inside there that actually exists in the actual universe. My expectation or assumption is that for many of us, the state of our soul is frantic movement. It's just not stopping. It's trembling with anxiety. It's stressed out. my wife and I spent the morning yesterday kind of looking at some stressful things finances, our schedule we took a look at our calendar from March and we saw that there was I think three nights where the two of us were at home together three in 31 days and that's not right I mean that's you know and so we were stressed out and getting ah what's going on and this has to change right now and we were getting real big about that Well, the invitation this morning will be for us to simply stop. When there's so much call to action, and that is so good and so right and so needed, the call this morning is to stop and get a sense of where your soul is. I'm heavily indebted to a book that I've been reading called Invitation to Solitude and Silence by Ruth Haley Barton. More so than is normal, the content of this talk was really fueled and inspired by the words on that page. So you can get it. I'm not sure if it's in our bookstore yet, but it will be if it's not and you really want it and you're stirred by the content of this talk. I would say get that book, Invitation to Solitude and Silence by Ruth Haley Barton. And the psalm that we're going to land in today is this beautifully simple three-verse psalm that was written by David, but it sounds like something that was not written by a king. It's just absolutely beautiful. So I want to read it to you really slowly, probably uncomfortably slowly, so that the RPMs just, even right now, start to slow down. Oh Lord, my heart is not proud, nor my eyes haughty, nor do I involve myself in great matters or in things too difficult for me. Surely I have composed and quieted my soul. Like a weaned child rests against his mother, my soul is like a weaned child within me. O church of the open door, hope in the Lord from this time forth and forever. so as we journey into thinking about being still in our soul one of the things you have to understand is this is a journey and it's not going to happen in the hour that we're together here this morning at least not completely you might find the invitation toward it the in in actuality this invitation to being still in your soul is an invitation to a journey that starts actually with your body. So I want to talk first of all about being still in your body. And I want to invite you to start to take notice of the things you normally don't take notice of as you sit in these very cushy, comfortable chairs. They're a little too comfortable if you don't mind me saying so. I kind of wish they were a little harder and a little less comfortable. But start to get to pay attention to how your body feels. Maybe you're carrying tension in your shoulders. Maybe your back, your low back is sore. And you're like, thank you very much. I wasn't even thinking about that. Now I am. start to pay attention to the aches and pains that you have and start to wonder if these things are not in fact very connected to the state of your soul ruth haley barton writes this the more we are willing to listen to our physical condition and respond with greater care, the more we discover that the physical and the spiritual are not as disconnected as we thought. Have you ever thought about that? That what's happening in your body might be very connected to what's happening in your soul and the anxiety and stress that you're feeling based on the schedule that is way too demanding and the relationships that are unrelentingly pressurized is doing something to your body. And so you need to pay attention to your body. You need to start taking care of your body. One of the things I think that our culture is just brutal about is sleep. We keep cranking it out, thinking that four hours a night, five hours a night, six hours a night is enough. And then we have a terrible spiritual life. We feel like we have no time for God. We feel anxious and angry. And we wonder why. Well, there's a great verse in the Bible that's going to be amazing for some of you who hate mornings. And so this is not me, but if you hate mornings, this is your life verse. Psalm 127.2. It is vain for you to rise up early, to retire late, And to eat the bread of painful labors for, and this is an amazing thought if you let it in, for God gives to God's beloved even in his sleep. That's your sleep that the writer is talking about. That God has the ability to restore you even as you sleep. Think of like IVs connected to you. giving you nourishment and settling down your soul in ways that only sleep can do. So I want to invite you into a practice, even if it's only for the next two weeks, as you prepare to engage fully in the Passion and in Holy Week and in Good Friday and in the Resurrection. The practice I want to invite you to, even if it's only for two weeks, is the practice of rest. and so I want to invite you to do whatever it takes to get eight hours a night for the next two weeks now for some of you that might mean shutting off the screen at about seven or eight no more screen time no more phone time no more texting no more emailing no more tv no more internet I'm seeing the anxiety in your eyes right now No, wait. No, now that's not a rule. I'm just inviting you into that. If you want to sleep, you have to figure out what it's going to take. And some of you right now, I'm going to read your thoughts right now, perhaps are thinking, I'm in church and we're talking about sleep? Are you kidding me? I want something deep. I want something substantial. I want something I can sink my teeth into. And you're talking about sleep. And if you're feeling that way, I want to invite you into noticing the anger. And invite you to wonder if you, in fact, if for you the most spiritual thing that you can do is get more sleep. There's other things that I think you need to rest your body from. There are some of us that are so preoccupied with getting on the scale and having it be a number that is lower than the current number. Some of us need to rest from the scale. Some of us need to take that thing and throw it as far away from ourselves as we can to rest from this. Now, some of us need to get in better shape and some of us need to figure that out. Yes, yes, yes. But many of us are so obsessed with a body type and body image and number on a scale that is the ideal number, but it's not your actual self and your actual body that actually exists in the actual universe. Some of us need to just rest from the ideal body and say, guess what, people? Not going to happen. Some of us need to just rest. so pay attention to your body my invitation for you is to get as much rest as you can that's where the journey into being still in your soul starts if your body is not at rest your soul never will be as you begin to learn to rest and be still in your body the next point in the journey is being still in your mind being still in your mind now are you aware that at this very moment your brain is capable of receiving literally millions of messages and filtering out the unimportant ones and focusing on the very important ones for example until I'm just about to say it you were not aware of the feeling that your rear end has on your seat. But now you are. Your brain filtered that out. There are so many things going on in our mind right now and what we do in terms of a way to cope with all the messages that come and all the information that comes is we just keep that processor churning. And you're thinking about the grocery list right now, even as you're listening to me talk, and you're thinking about what's going to happen this afternoon, and the people that are coming over tonight, and you haven't prepared the meal yet, and you don't even know what the meal is going to be, and that's freaking you out. And wait, did I set the crock pot to low, or was it medium? I'm not sure. And now you're worried about that, and now you're worried about the fact that you don't even have anyone coming over tonight, and maybe you're super, you know, all this stuff. And it's just, yeah, I know, I know. I'm just loading it on you. Now let's remember this verse, Psalm 131. Oh Lord, my heart is not proud, nor my eyes haughty, nor do I involve myself in great matters, or in things too difficult for me. This speaks about a lot of things, but what I want to focus on and invite you into is it speaks about a mind that is starting to be at rest, a mind that's starting to be still, a mind that's starting to release all the millions of things that you're processing and trying to figure out and trying to make sure you have it under control. And it's speaking to a mind that begins to slow down. Ruth Haley Barton writes this, our minds are tired of trying to hold it all together, figure everything out, and make something happen. can I get an amen? This is the picture of what our minds do constantly. It is a puzzle for us to solve. Every relationship, every work project, every failed attempt at community, every book you haven't read that you should read, every list that you've made that's hanging up on sticky notes all around your house. It's a puzzle to be solved. So Ruth Haley Barton continues to write this way. I needed to experience, she writes, the fact that my mental sorting and calculating and my efforts to process everything with words were not getting me anywhere. The good news is that finally, When we're exhausted from squirming. I love that picture. When we're exhausted from squirming, we may open up to the possibility of letting go of our own efforts and receiving something from God. Is it possible that the God who created the entire universe, who created the reproductive system that keeps working, who created our immune systems that work. Is it possible that that God can provide for you what you need without your working it out on your own? Is it possible that being still in your mind has a whole lot more to do with trusting than it has to do with getting it all figured out? I think we all live by this mantra. When I figure it out and get the lists done, then my mind will be at rest, right? And yet we all know the lists are never done. Can we just admit that out loud? You have the capacity to create more lists. In fact, there's even a part of you that likes to create more lists. It gives you a sense of meaning and purpose. working it out and trying to figure it out, there's a way in which that's how you feel like you get meaning. And God is saying, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That's in the Hebrew, I think. So here's the practice I want to invite you into even as we prepare for this very serious season called Holy Week. And the practice I want to invite you into is play. Look at that picture. That's actually at Joel and Kathy's house. He's going full steam. That's my son Isaac. He's going full steam down that hill. Hair blowing in his face. Look at the look on his face. He is having an absolute blast. Now, he's also trying to figure out his kindergarten homework right now in this picture. the scientist Stuart Brown talks about the science of play and what it does to our minds and he defines play as anything that's all-encompassing purposeless and fun so Isaac sorry the picture's gone Isaac takes that little train up that hill about 50 times that afternoon. Purposeless. Now we would call that exercise. That's where I'm getting my aerobic workout. Maybe even a little anaerobic, you know, because I'm dragging that thing up the hill. What if our ability as adults to play is one of the ways that we put on display the character of God. Have you ever thought about God as ultimately playful? Now, the fact that a rhinoceros exists is really proof. The fact that one of the ways that our bodies expel gas in ways that, you know, smell funny and make a funny noise, proof that God is very playful. Yes, I just went there. I'll go a step further. My boys, my boys can really have all-encompassing, purposeless fun simply by saying the word butt over and over and over again. Now, we're trying to, there's my wife, you know, hiding her head in shame. This is not great. We're trying to teach them not to do that, especially in public, but it doesn't help when I double over laughing every time they do it. When was the last time you played? Now, some of you golf, and for some of you, golf is play, but for many of you, golf is about beating a score, breaking 100, breaking 90, beating your partner. And that's why golf many times ends up in broken clubs and new records and swearing, and that's even when pastors golf. So that's an amazing deal. I remember one time, this is when I was in high school, talking about the playfulness of God. And I was out in my parents' driveway, and we had a basketball hoop that you could lower. Remember those deals? So I lowered it probably to about seven feet. And I was dunking, you know, and just doing that stuff. And I was not thinking about God. I was not thinking about anything other than basketball. But in that moment, I felt like, and I remember this so clearly, God whispered to me, do a dunk for me. and so I mean it was like boom I mean you know and uh God doesn't speak like that what if what if God absolutely delights in the times that you are at play So what is it like for you? Now, I want to really invite you to resist the anxiety that you even feel right now about, well, how do I play? Do I play? Honey, is there a thing that I play yet? I mean, all-encompassing, fun. You know, see? We're messed up. We're so messed up. My friend Scotty back there, for him, it's photography. He loves photography, and he's really good at it. So he gets out in nature and he climbs up on trees and rocks and he just gets out there and he loses track of time. You know, for other people, it's different sports. For other people, it's, you know, card games. For other people, card games are hell. So you got to make sure to, you know, fun is actually fun. What would it be like for you to, in the next two weeks, get real serious about play? And maybe that's the most spiritual thing that you can do as you prepare for Holy Week. To just enjoy God. Well, the next stage in the journey, or going down, from being still in your body to being still in your mind, is to being still in your soul. And again, I think it's important. You've got to learn how to be still in your body. You've got to learn how to be still in your mind. But then comes the invitation to be still in your soul. and we get this beautiful picture that we all have, we all can dial right into in Psalm 131 verse 2 when David writes, surely I have composed and quieted my soul and then here comes the picture like a weaned child rests against his mother my soul is like a weaned child within me. Now we have some mothers in the room. I want you to remember a time if you had this and I know not everyone did But if you could nurse your child, remember that moment after your child is done nursing. And his or her face is like red. And they just have this look on their face like... And they just make endless eye contact with you. And you just, I mean, it's like you lose all track of time in that moment. because this baby is totally content and totally connected to you. It's as if you're almost one person. This is the picture of a soul that is still in the presence of God. What would it be like to not sit with God confessing your sin, that's really important, but to sit with God wordlessly content? Being enjoyed by God as God holds you in God's presence. Ruth Haley Barton writes this again in this book. We all need a place to be a child no matter how old we are. Isn't that true? We all need a place. We all need a lap we can crawl up into. Because it is really true that I think, I don't care, I said this last week, but whether you're a CEO or stay-at-home mom or a high school student, at the core, we're all really insecure people that need to know that we're loved and we have a place that we belong. Every single one of us. We all need a place to be a child no matter how old we are. Ruth A. Lee Barton again writes this, In times of solitude, the soul rests in God by simply being with God with what is. Simply being with God with what actually is. Now, you remember the game musical chairs, do you not? Musical chairs where there's one more person than there is in a chair and the music plays and you're going around the outside of those chairs and then when that music stops, boom, you sit down on that chair. Wherever you're at, you are down on that chair. You're hoping you don't land on someone else's lap and that would be embarrassing. The picture of wherever you're at landing on the chair is the picture of the soul that is learning to be at rest in God with whatever it is. Filled with anxiety, you bring that to God. Filled with joy, you bring that to God. Filled with worry, bring that to God. Filled with stress, an overburdened calendar, problems you can't solve, debt, you bring that to God. God wants to know exactly what is in the current moment. And some of us get so lost. We don't even pray anymore because, you know, all the formulas are going through our minds. Well, first we've got to confess. Then we've got to be thankful. Then we've got to praise God. Then we can finally get, no, just bring whatever is real and true to God in the moment is what you bring. And then after you kind of vomit it all out, you can sit. And you can sit with the words like, be still my soul. Be still my soul. And after a while, you learn that it's safe to do this with God. And after a while, you learn that God can begin to bring you things that you need in that moment that you don't get anywhere else. It's not a magic wand. It's not a magic pill. and all your problems aren't solved, but you understand that wherever you go, God goes with you. So what would it mean to begin to still and quiet your soul? It would mean being honest with God with what is. So in the last few moments of this service, I'm going to invite Joel back up, and he's going to invite us to sing along with him, Be Still My Soul, actually the traditional version. And in the middle, after each verse, I'm going to lead you in some prayers that help you be honest with God about what God is. And so I want to really invite you, this is just going to take five minutes or so, but if you have things on your lap, if you have like a whole briefcase full of stuff, just put it down on the floor and enter into a space where you can be still with God. And so let's pray as we prepare to do that. Pray with me. oh God we long to bring to you what is real what is true and just what is so in this moment we breathe you in we breathe in life we breathe in rest we breathe in grace we breathe in your presence we breathe out anxiety we breathe out fear we breathe out stress we breathe out anything that would take us away from experiencing you like a child coming up to his mother's lap. So picture yourself, whatever age you are, crawling up into the lap of God and experiencing the presence of God that's coming to you at first wordlessly. is come Holy Spirit into this moment and allow us to rest into you, to breathe you in, to breathe out all the toxicity of our lives and in this moment to begin to be still in you. Be still my soul The Lord is on thy side Bear patiently The cross of grief or pain Leave to thy God To water and provide In every change He faithful will remain Be still my soul Thy best, thy heavenly friend Through thorny waves leads to a joyful end. Now let me read this prayer over you. Oh God, you know the pain and the sorrow our hearts cannot hold. You know all that is unresolved in our minds. So help us to forget the fear that disrupts and unseats us as we remember the friend who remains. I'm going to invite you to sing with Joel. Be still, my soul. Thy God doth undertake. To guide the future as he has the past. Thy hope, thy confidence, let nothing change. All now mysteries shall be bright at last. Be still, my soul, the waves and winds still know. Still know his voice, who rode them while he drowned. And now this prayer is going to be call and response. I'll read the first line, and you read the line that follows together. God of the future, the past, and this present moment, we put our hope in you who guides it all. God of the wind, the waves, and God of my heart, we put our confidence in you who calms it all. Be still, my soul, When dearest friends depart And all is darkened in the veil of tears Then shalt thou better know his love, his heart Who comes to soothe Thy sorrow and thy fears Be still, my soul Thy Jesus can repay From His own fullness All he takes away Now let me pray this over you. Oh God, you know the losses that are past and the losses that are to come because you have suffered with us. From your own nourishing fullness we receive back from you all that we have lost because you are enough. Be still my soul The hour is hastening on When we shall be forever with the Lord When disappointment, grief and fear are gone Sorrow for God Love's purest joys restore Be still my soul When change and tears are past All safe and blessed We shall meet at last And now another prayer of call and response. I'll read the first line, you read the second. God of eternal joy, blessing, and restoration, we look to your coming at the end of all things. God who overcomes sorrow, grief, and disappointment. We trust our new beginnings to you. Be still, my soul. Begin the song of praise. On earth believing to thy Lord on high. Acknowledge him in all thy words and ways. So shall he view thee with a well-pleased eye. Be still my soul, the son of life divine. Through passing clouds shall blood more brightly shine. And now as we pray this last prayer together, before we pray together, I want to remind you that we're praying about the God who is enough. We're praying about the God who cares individually and who provides all sufficiently. So I want to invite you to stand up as we pray this prayer together, the one that Jesus taught us to pray. and we pray our father who aren't in heaven hallowed be thy name your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen. Thank you.
