Okay, we're going to close the seminar by talking about rest and recovery. The purpose of this last session is to untangle some of the ways that the messages that we've gotten have landed on us that set us up to be abused in future situations. But mostly what this is is a confrontation on some of the brainwashing that we've gotten as far as legalistic performance-based theology and gaining a new sense of who God is and what our identity is because of that. So to begin this, then I want to start with a cycle. And the eventual place we're going to end up is in a place of rest, which is a different fight. And I don't believe that a lot of people have been taught to fight a rest fight, which even seems like a contradiction in terms. But it's not because you're going to fight either way. You're going to fight either way. And this cycle starts with outside sources of shame that people have in their lives. And I've alluded to some of those in previous sessions. This would be any place outside of ourselves that send us messages to us that something's wrong with us, that we're not okay. So this could be employment settings. It could be family systems where you were the problem for noticing the problem. I think that you need to work at replacing that rule with a new one that says the truth is never the problem because the truth is never the problem. The problem is always the problem. The truth is never the problem. But if you're in a system that says the truth is the problem then every time you don't tell the truth you think that's not a good thing because it bothers you that you're not telling the truth and whenever you do tell the truth you're the problem from their standpoint so you're the problem either way. This could be an event that someone has in their life. I've talked to someone who says that when I was in third grade, our teacher assigned us an assignment to draw a picture of a tree. I drew a fall tree that had many colors on it. She wanted a spring tree that was green, and when she saw my multicolored tree, she held it up in front of the class and humiliated me, and my life has never been the same since. I mean, I can't get up in front of people. So all it took was one little event, but a dart went in and stuck, And the message was, something's wrong with you. It could be living in a system where there's abuse every day. I have a letter here. This was on the back of a card that was sent to a man who was going to the foreign mission field with his wife and 12-year-old son. And on the back of a card, it's from his mother. It has a prayer list. And what it says is, number one, pray for your 79-year-old mother you are leaving, brackets, again. Number two, pray for your brother who will have to make all necessary trips and arrangements in case of sickness and death of your mother. Number three, pray for your brother also who will have to shoulder all the clearing up of the estate. He has a full-time job too. Finally, shifting your son out to a strange family is quite a risky thing, but it's your responsibility. Remember God, the same God whom we love and adore, took your dad away. My sons eventually left me and I've been void of human and family love and compassion for all these years. God doesn't give us more than we can bear, so says the Bible. Can you meet that test? That was what it said on the back of the thing. Now, there's a strong shaming message in there. I don't know if you can... No, I mean, you don't have to have much of a code book to break that one. I mean, there's a... Sexual abuse shames people because it says I can do this to you because I'm faster, stronger, louder, I have power, I'm male, whatever, and if you notice, you're the problem. Any kind of abuse where the person's told to keep quiet about the abuse, in the admonition to keep quiet, says this is not an okay thing. Do you understand that? If I did something to you and told you not to tell, I'm telling you by virtue of telling you not to tell that this is not okay, what I'm doing. And you are so not okay that I can do this not okay thing to you, and it's okay. So there's a double shaming message in that kind of stuff. And of course, spiritual abuse is really shaming. And some people think it's their job to keep reminding people how not okay they are because that'll get holiness from them. So anyway, that's what I mean when I say outside sources of shame. Now, from these outside sources of shame come the shame messages. and the shame messages are what we've talked about before. Something's wrong with you, you're defective, you're inadequate, you're a bad person, you're unspiritual, you're an idiot, you're stupid, you can't do anything right, whatever. Those are all shaming messages. The reason I said mindset was the word I liked is because in our mind then, for the sake of this talk, for the sake of this illustration, our mind serves two purposes here. One is in terms of our belief system. And our belief system is what we believe about ourselves. What we believe about ourselves. And these shaming messages bombard us and send us messages about ourselves to ourselves. And we end up with what I call a shame grid. And what a shame grid is, is it's a way of thinking about yourself that interprets things in a shaming way. which means that somebody doesn't even have to be sending it in a shaming way anymore, and you might still hear it in a shaming way. So, for instance, if Mark and I are having a disagreement, and I say, I really disagree with you, what that means is he thinks one way, I think another way, and the two ways aren't the same way. But if he has this shame grid, the way he'll hear my disagreement is that I really think he's stupid for thinking the way he thinks. Something's wrong with you for thinking that way, even though I might just be disagreeing, you see. You learn to hear things in a shaming way. It's like this thinking pattern that twists information, and when it lands on you, it lands as an indictment. And the other thing is that it lets indictments through real easy. So if somebody is actually sending an indictment, that just zips right through there and lands with a thud. That's a shame grid. And then the other part of the mind that I want to talk about is what we decide, our decision-making process, or our willpower, our will. Now let's say that you have been in some relationships, let's say that we're abusive, that we're shaming, that said something's wrong with you, that you're unspiritual, that you're a bad person. Well, how should you feel for being such a bad person as all that? How should you feel? Bad. What's the best way for you to feel as bad as you should feel for being so bad? Either behave badly or I'll stay here. Because if you stay here, you can keep hearing those things, and then you get to feel as bad as you should feel for being so bad. Understand how that works? Let me say it differently. If you're a wife who's being battered by her husband, the message you get is, something's wrong with you, you deserve it, you caused it, you're a bad person, shame on you. How should you feel for being such a bad person that deserves all that battering? Bad. And what's the best place or the best way for you to feel as bad as you should feel for being such a bad wife? stay in the abuse well it's the same thing in a spiritually abusive system if you're in a system that keeps hammering on you how bad you are what's the best way for you to feel as bad as you should feel for being so bad is to stay right in that abusive system then you get to feel as bad as you should feel and that's one of the things that keeps people in the abusive system or to say it more strongly that's one of the things that tends to propel people into abusive systems that have come from other abusive systems. Because in those systems, they get to hear the messages and feel what they need to feel in order to feel as bad as they really are in terms of their picture of themselves. So that perpetuates this, but what it ends up to be is a very self-punishing cycle. That would be getting small. This would be getting small, staying small and staying abused. Another way to stay on this self-punishing cycle, though, would be to do a negative behavior. Because if you do a negative behavior and these guys find out about it, how are they going to make you feel? Bad. And how should you feel for being so bad? Bad. So you get to perpetuate that in yourself by continuing to do bad behaviors. As a matter of fact, some people disappear then out of this system. They go off into the world, okay? And now we don't even have this outside source anymore. We have this person who does the bad behavior like acts out sexually or gets drunk or whatever behavior they think is a bad behavior. It could be someone who overeats, whatever. Well, when they do that behavior, what does that behavior say about them? They're bad. Well, how should they feel for being such a bad person who overeats or acts out sexually or whatever? How should they feel? Bad. And what's the best way for them to feel as bad as they should feel for being such a bad person who overeats or acts out sexually or drinks? Keep overeating. Well, let's say they don't read their Bible. What does that say about them as a Christian? Bad. Well, how should they feel for being such a bad person who doesn't read their Bible? Bad. What's the best way for them to feel as bad as they should feel for being such a bad person that doesn't read their Bible? Keep not reading their Bible. So there becomes this system of reinforcing the shame message, and one way that it gets reinforced is staying in the abusive system. Then you get to feel as lousy as you think you should feel for being such a defective person. But only someone who doesn't understand and accept their real identity in Christ would do that, or who hasn't heard it, maybe someone who hasn't heard it, or someone who has a hard time letting it go from their head down into their heart. Because there seems to be this thing that we call a heart-brain barrier, where people get this stuff in their head, but it has a hard time dripping down into their heart. They kind of know it up here, but it kind of gets stuck. It would be great if it just went like that, but it kind of just goes a drip at a time. Well, let's say that you're cycling around here, and pretty soon you feel so bad that you don't want to feel that bad anymore. Or you go to a Christian formula seminar that says, good Christians don't do this, and here's how you can not do it. Here's five ways not to do this anymore. Ten ways to get your daily devotions back. Five ways to stop masturbating. Six ways to not smoke anymore. Whatever. Or you have a friend or somebody that you care about that's going through the same thing you're going through, and all of a sudden they start to get better. And you go, wow. You know, if they can do it, I can do it. And so what happens is that instead of coming over here and doing the negative behavior, they do the positive behavior, which if you're getting drunk, what's the positive behavior? Staying sober, staying dry. If you're beating up your wife, what's the positive behavior? Not beating up your wife. If you're getting beat up, what's the positive behavior? Getting out of there. If you're not reading your Bible, what's the positive behavior? Start reading it. If you're overeating, what's the positive behavior? Undereating. different lecture it's a different lecture under eating is not the solution to overeating eating is the solution to overeating but see what happens then is you do that positive behavior and what does that say about you it says good for you it sends you an affirming message see what a what a capable adequate person you are good for you well when this affirming message hits this shame grid what happens to it what does that tell it not good enough. Not good enough. It's selfish and unspiritual for you to notice that you did okay, right? That's not humble. You're supposed to do the Christian life, but never notice it if you did it. Because that wouldn't be humble. In other words, you're supposed to set off on this task of holiness, and if you pull it off, because you tried so hard, we'll call that God, and if you didn't, it's you. And then you're supposed to try harder. And if you do it, you're not supposed to feel okay that you did it. Because that would be not humble. Well, what that means is that if this affirming message hits this shame grid and gets filtered out, that means you've got to do more good behavior. You've got to try harder. So you do more. Good for you. What a Christian. Hooray for you. But then it hits that shame grid and says, not good enough, though. Or, if one is good, two is better. Or whatever. If one week of daily devotions every day without missing it is good, two weeks would be better. Right? If starving yourself for three weeks is good, six weeks would be better. Right? So here, let me say it a different way. This person cycles around here now trying to generate their own positive messages about themselves with their shame grid constantly filtering them out. And pretty soon, guess what's going to happen over here? They're going to get tired. And so this is a very self-rescuing cycle. And they're going to get tired and they might run out of gas. And when they run out of gas, and shut down, they might end up back over here again because they did all this and it didn't work anyway, and what's the use? Okay, it looks like this. Here I am in the pit. You know, I'm over on this side. I'm in the pit. I'm miserable. I'm shamed. I'm disgusting. I have all these messages about myself because I'm not doing something or I'm doing something. Let's say I'm acting out sexually. So what I do is I abstain. So I abstain for a week. How do I feel now compared to there? Better. Okay, well, I'll abstain for another week. So I abstained for another week. How do I feel now? Better still. Another week. Six weeks. Pretty good. Twelve weeks. Now, I'm way over here, twelve weeks away from where I started, and there I was feeling really lousy and scummy and terrible, and now I'm feeling pretty good because I got a whole twelve-week streak. Well, if what motivated and generated my positive behavior over here was feeling really lousy and scummy and yucky, and now I'm over here and I'm not feeling so lousy and scummy and yucky, What's going to continue to motivate positive behavior? Nothing. All I have to do is eat a Snickers bar. It cancels out the whole streak, and I've got to go back over here and start the whole thing over again like none of it counted. All I have to do is act out sexually or even, for some people, even be tempted to act out sexually. And it's like, forget it. I wasted all my time, and I go back, and I've got to start the whole streak over again. And so the victorious Christian life then would be going back and forth between these two things. What do you think? Yuck! Now, here's an interesting thing. When I was growing up, I was taught this was walking by the flesh, doing the negative stuff, okay, acting out negatively, sleeping around, going to square dancing, you know, whatever. That was the flesh, okay? And I was taught to do the opposite, and that was walking by the Spirit. Okay? walking by the Spirit was going to church, reading your Bible. Now see, if what I'm doing over here to try to feel okay is to not feel okay, following that, this person, in order to feel like everything's okay, would have to feel not okay. Because feeling okay doesn't feel good. Or, if I'm over here and I'm trying to generate my sense of okayness from doing good stuff, what I want to tell you is that this is walking by the flesh too. It's just prettier looking flesh than the flesh you used to walk by and it is not the solution. This positive behavior cycle is not the answer to the negative behavior cycle, yet what I see is that most people I know in their life have been handed this as the solution to this. Do it right instead of doing it wrong. It's just walking by the flesh. And the reason why it is a sin, see, it's clear to see why this would be a sin, you know, like sleeping around is a sin. Not because it's on the negative behavior list, even though it is on the negative behavior list, but because sleeping around doesn't meet needs. It misses the mark. It doesn't generate value and acceptance. It promises value and acceptance, but it misses the mark. That's the definition of sin. So if I'm not sleeping around anymore, and I come over here and start teaching a Sunday school class in order to generate value and acceptance, guess what that does? It misses the mark. Even though it promises acceptance in this context, it misses the mark and so is it possible that teaching in Sunday school class could be as disgusting of a sin to God as sleeping around yes even though it certainly is on the good list of behavior but haven't you had a view of sin that it was about good lists and bad lists and do the good list and avoid the bad list and now we're talking about maybe if you do the good list for the wrong reason that misses the mark too and it does and this is very tiring both of these people are very tired the solution is a different fight and that would be I would call a spiritual fight a faith fight so now instead of walking by the flesh over here to generate messages about myself or walking by the flesh meaning natural self-effort kinds of stuff over here to generate messages about myself now I'm going to walk by that's one way to say it another way to say it would be in 1 Corinthians, it said, let him who boast, boast in the Lord. I'll put that up here. Boast in, walk by. Another way to say it is Ephesians 5, be filled with. Another way to say it is 1 Timothy 6, 17. Let those who are rich in this present world not become conceited or fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God who richly gives us all things to enjoy. So it's fix our hope on God. And for the sake of this illustration, which is a performance illustration, you see there is a performance here that you do, and there is a performance here that you do, now we'll talk about God's behavior. And leaning on, trusting in, believing in, having faith in, boasting in, putting confidence in, abiding in, what God has done for who we are. So now it becomes an identity struggle, not a behavior struggle. It's a whole different thing. It's about whose performance you're going to rest in. Whose behavior are you going to rest in? And for the sake of this, I want to break God's performance into three different categories. One is the Father. One is the Son. How God acts toward us as the Father, Son, and the Spirit. First of all, Father. I do not believe that the Father Word and the male pronouns in the Scripture are trying to promote a male picture of God. I don't believe that God is a male. I think God is a spirit. I think that the reason why Father and male pronouns, but not primarily male pictures, I mean not all male pictures, primarily male pictures, were used in the Scripture to describe God is because in the places from which the Scripture was written and to the people to whom it was written, maleness was where the power and credibility and bigness was concentrated in order to paint a picture of God as big and powerful as he is. They did male pronouns. But it wasn't about trying to say God is a male. As a matter of fact, in Genesis, it says in order to create mankind in his own image, he created them male and female. So if you want to see a real picture of God represented, you have to see both male and female. Now, the way that I can explain that on human terms is that there was a study done with police dogs, and what they did with these dogs, male and female police dogs, when they took a male police dog and they went to the house where the burglar was, what they found is that when they let the male police dog off the leash, the male police dog would tear into the house, bite the burglar all to pieces, so that by the time the cop got there, they were all bit to pieces. When they had a female police dog, when they let the female police dog off the leash, instead of running into the house, the female police dog would stay in front of the policeman to protect them in case the burglar came out of the house. Now, if you want to see what God is like, that's what God is like. That's a picture of male-female aspects of God. Do you understand? So if what you need is for him to go ahead and beat the burglars up, that's what he does. And if you need them to hang back in case they get out first, that's what he does. That's male and female pictures of God. Another thing about God, though, being the Father, what that has a connotation then of in this male-dominant era or scenario from which Scripture comes is that Father is a source thing. Father is the source from whom the children came. In 1 Peter 1.23, it says, You were born of incorruptible seed. You were born again of incorruptible seed. Now the fact that you were born of your parents means that you were born of corruptible seed and eventually what was born of your parents is going to disappear. It's going to rot off. It's going to whatever. But if you've been born of your father, you're born of an imperishable seed, an incorruptible seed, which means that you are so alive if you were born that way that we could shoot you full of holes and you're still alive. Like you come from a really good gene pool, and it will last forever. So one of the ways that father means something in terms of this is that you are born of an imperishable seed. He bore you. Another thing about the father, though, is in Galatians 4, it says he adopted you. Now, is there anybody here who's been adopted? Okay, some people who have been adopted. The reason why someone is adopted is because they weren't born to those parents. Do you understand? If you were born to a parent, you wouldn't have to be adopted by them. You'd be in the family by virtue of being born there. If you weren't born, then you could be in the family by virtue of being adopted there. Either way, you're in the family. Do you understand? Because you were either born there or you were adopted there. But you don't have to do both. But God, who really wanted us, did both. So he not only bore us into his family, but he wanted us so much that he also adopted us. Now, I don't know why he had to do that. I think it's a compliment. I think it's a picture of how much God wanted us to be in his family. Because not only did he bear us in his family, but he adopted us into his family. In Ephesians 1, it says he chose us before the foundation of the world. So not only did he bear us, he adopted us, he chose us. He really wants us. He did a lot to get us. He bought us. That's another picture of what he did. None of those cancel out the other picture. They add to the other picture. In Ephesians 1, it says he chose us before the foundation of the world. Now, any of you who have ever been in street football or baseball or, you know, alley baseball or whatever, you pick teams. And when you pick teams, someone gets picked last. Has anybody ever gotten picked last? How does that feel? Shaming, defective, something's wrong with you. It doesn't feel good. Being exposed in a diminished way. You're last and everybody knows. Well, now you have a father that picked you first. Let that in. That's a compliment. God likes us. He wants us. He bears us. He adopts us. He chooses us. He buys us. He really wants us. He goes through a lot of hassle to get us. That's how bad he wants us. Not only that, but turn to Luke 15. Luke 15 is the story of the prodigal son, but it's not really the story of the prodigal son. It's really a story of the father of the prodigal son, even though on the top of your Bible it probably says the prodigal son. And the reason I can tell it's a story of the father of the prodigal son is that in verse 11 it says, And he said a certain man had two sons. So this is the story about the certain man who had the two sons. And you know the story. The younger one came to the father and says, Give me my share of the estate. So the father gave him the share of the estate. He takes off, wastes it all, starves to death, ends up feeding the pigs, ends up fighting with the pigs over the food. Nobody bails him out. Nobody gives him anything. A famine hits the land. He hits the wall. And in verse 17, it says, but when he came to his senses, okay, like, I don't like this anymore. Okay, like, I'm not doing this anymore. It doesn't say, how can I get my dad to bail me out of this? It says he came to his senses. He went, yuck, I hate this. When he came to his senses, he made up a speech. and here's the speech. I will get up and go to my father and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired men. And he got up and he came to his father but while he was still a long way off. What does that say about the father? Father was watching for the son because he saw him when he was a long way off. While he was still a long way off, the father saw him and felt compassion for him. What does that say about the father? he loved them he didn't he didn't it doesn't say when he was a long way off he went oh there's that stupid son i'm so disgusted with him i can't believe he did that i can't wait till he gets here so i can give him a piece of my mind it says when he was a long way off he saw him he felt compassion for him then it says he ran to him now the greek word there isn't really ran it's really raced which means ran as fast as you can. So he ran as fast as he can. Also, you have to understand what it would mean in this culture for a Jewish man to run as fast as he can. What it would mean would be that he'd have to hike up that deal, you know, like this, like that, and run as fast as he could, which is not okay for a Jewish man to do in this culture, but it doesn't matter because the sun is home. And he embraced him, hugged him. Now, the Greek word says began embracing, and whenever you get a began doing something, it means, and he hugged him, and hugged, and hugged, and hugged, and hugged, and hugged, and kissed, and began kissing, and kissed, and kissed, and kissed, and kissed him. He was really happy to see him. Get the picture? The son takes off. He's off blowing it, doing weird stuff. The father's watching for him, but when he comes back, he runs to him as fast as he can, and hugs him and kisses him, because he's really happy to see him. Then the son does the speech. The son says to the father, I've sinned against heaven in your sight. I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. What's the rest of the speech? If the son got to finish what he was going to say, what would it have been? Make me as one of your hired servants. But the father doesn't let him do the speech. He interrupts the speech. And as a matter of fact, he doesn't even listen to the speech because it says, but the father said to his slaves. So he wasn't even looking at the son when he was giving him the speech. She was looking at his slaves talking to them. But the father said to the slaves, quickly bring out the best robe, put it on him, put the ring on his hand, sandals on his feet, bring out the fatted calf, kill it, let us eat and be merry, for the son of mine was dead and has come to life, he was lost and has been found, and they began to be merry. Now here's the deal. The son feels bad. He feels bad. And he comes back and he says, I feel bad. And then he's going to make him a deal. He says, look, I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. He's going to say, make me one of the servants. But the father interrupts him and doesn't let him do the speech because the son was never the son in the first place because he was worthy to be the son in the first place. He was only ever the son because the father was the father. Nothing had changed. But see, what this son wanted to do is what a lot of Christians want to do. When they come back or when they come to God, they want to go, oh, I'm so undeserving, so don't treat me like a son or a daughter. you just treat me be okay with me if you just treat me like a servant and I'll just go live over here in the servant's quarters and live like a servant and you know how servants live? Servants live in a way where when they wake up in the morning they hope they do it good enough that day and when they go to bed at night they hope they did it good enough that day because if they didn't they'd get fired. That's not how sons and daughters live. That's how slaves live and this father wouldn't let the son live that way. So if what you need to know is that when you're off goofing around and blowing it and doing whatever you're doing that isn't good enough. When you figure it out and hit the wall and say, I hate this, I'm not doing this, that you have a father who waits and waits and waits and waits and waits. And when you finally figure it out and you come back, he's so happy to see you. He runs to you and hugs and kisses you and throws a party because you're there. That's the kind of father you have. And some people need to know that because they're still waiting out there trying to be servants or else not coming back at all because they figured out they're not worthy to come back. When they were never there in the first place on the basis of worthiness, they were only there on the basis of grace in the first place. But, in verse 3, there's another picture of the Father. And in verse 3, it says this, And he told them this parable, saying, What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep, has lost one of them, doesn't leave the ninety-nine in the field, and go after the one which is lost until he finds it, and when he's found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying rejoice with me for I have found a sheep which is lost. I tell you in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over the one sinner who repents than over the 99 righteous persons who need no repentance which by the way who are they? There aren't any. There are only the 99 who think they don't need repentance and then the one who knows they do. Here's the picture. Sheep is off wandering away. Now this is a great picture the sheep thing because that's what we do sometimes. We're like sheep, okay? We're just walking down the road with the flock, you know, sheep being sheep, like that, and a butterfly goes by. And we go, whoa. And the rest of the flock, they keep going down the road and pretty soon we're off over here and we don't know where they went and we don't know how to get back again. We're stuck and we're lost or maybe we're even tangled up in some briar patch, you know, called addiction or something else like that and the harder we pull on the briars, the more they get tangled up in our wool and we're stuck. And if what you need to know is that if when you're off doing weird stuff, when you finally hit the wall and figure it out and come back, you have a father that waits and waits and waits and waits and when you come back, he's really happy and throws a party. That's the kind of father you have. But if what you need to know is that when you're off stuck and you can't get back, you have a father that looks and looks and looks and looks and looks, then that's the kind of father you have. And when he finds you, you don't even have to get back under your own power because he picks you up and carries you back on his shoulders and when he gets back has a party because you're back. So which kind of father do you need to know you have? Both of them. You got either one. Both. And in verse 8, we got a woman father. A woman picture of father here. What woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one of them, doesn't light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it and when she's found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors saying, rejoice with me. For I found the coin which I've lost. In the same way I tell you there's more joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents. So here's the deal. Here's the coin. Sitting on the dresser. A bunch of other coins. Falls off the dresser. Rolls around a little bit. Spins around and goes underneath the dress. On a table. So you can't even see it anymore. Now while that coin is on its edge, it can move a little bit. Still not under its own power though. But it can move a little bit and it looks pretty good. Going down this floor like this. Rolling down the floor. What happens is it goes underneath the dark spot and flips over on its side, and now it's laying there on its side, kind of kicking one of its legs up and down. There's no way in the world that that coin is going to be able to flip back up on its edge and under its own power roll back up and join those other coins. The only hope that that coin has is if someone goes and looks for that coin, and as a matter of fact, it says she searches carefully. And if what you need to know is that you have a father that does that when you're lost, that's the kind of father you have too. so that's just some of the pictures that we have of God as father acting on our behalf now God as son acting on our behalf standard Christian theology you know it he paid the price I grew up in a family system in a church system where you ended up feeling like you were supposed to pay for your sins so people would try to do good stuff to try to make up for the bad stuff they did They didn't do good stuff because it was good. They did good stuff to pay for the bad stuff that they did. They paid for their sins. So it's really hard for me to receive forgiveness if I hadn't done a bunch of stuff first to pay for what I did because forgiveness meant I was off the hook and I didn't feel good off the hook. Felt too free, felt too whatever. But Jesus has paid the price. So if you're living in a way where you feel like you have to keep doing bad stuff or stay in a system that sends you messages about yourself that something's wrong with you so you can feel as bad as you should feel for being so bad. You just need to know that somebody has paid the price for you and you don't have to live in a self-punishing way anymore. The punishment has been taken. It's a done deal. You also need to know that you have someone who on the basis of his death has rescued us and given us life. Let me show you a verse. Hebrews 7, 25 says this, Hence, he is also able to save completely those who draw near to God through him. He's able to save completely. You know what? When I ended up feeling lousy about doing this kind of stuff, I could save myself pretty good. You understand what I mean by that? What I mean is I could get a streak going, but I couldn't save myself completely. But I could save myself temporarily, or a little bit, or kind. or even pretty good sometimes. And people went, wow, and it was wonderful. But I couldn't save myself completely. But what this verse says is he's able to save completely those who draw, which means that in terms of doing anything more to make this okay, he's already done everything that makes that completely okay. But also what this verse says is this. Since he always lives to make intercession for them, he always lives to make intercession for them. Now, making intercession for them means pleading our case. He lives to plead our case. Why does he plead our case? Well, one reason is because Satan is the accuser of the brethren, and he's in the Father's face all day long saying they're not okay, they're a bunch of jerks, you trust them, what's wrong with you? All that kind of stuff. And then we have the Son making intercession for us. But it also says this, it says he lives to make intercession for us, which means he lives for that. I don't know if you can catch that. It's like living for the Cubs. Okay, Dave lives for the Cubs. Dave Johnson. He lives for the Cubs. He is preoccupied with the Cubs before the Cubs season. The day before the season, he cuts the standings out of the newspaper and puts them on his bulletin board of the National League East because the Cubs are in first place, because everybody has a zero and zero record and Chicago is the first letter in the alphabet, so they're in first place. He does. It's a true thing. He lives for the Cubs. Some people live for the ministry, right? They live for hunting and fishing. They live for the Vikings. Some people live for Jesus. But you want to know what else? I live for Jesus too. But I don't always live for Jesus. And I wish I always lived for Jesus. And I'm going to try to always live for Jesus. And even though I live for Jesus, I don't always live for Jesus. But you know what this verse says? It says, He always lives for me. He always lives to make intercession for me. And not only does He always live to do that, but He lives to do that. It's what He lives for. It's why He lives. So the picture I get is, when Jesus goes to bed at night, if he goes to bed at night, which I don't know if he does, but if he does, when he goes to bed at night, he's in the Father's face making intercession for us, and he's thinking, how can I make intercession for them tomorrow better than I did today? And when he wakes up in the morning, he says, how can i make intercession for them better today than I did yesterday? And so he goes to the Father and he says, you know what? These guys are okay. And the Father says. Well, I know they're okay. And Jesus says, no, they're really okay. And he says, I know they're okay. You already told me that. No, they're really, see, you don'T get it. They're really okay. No, they're okay. No, they're really okay. He always lives to make intercession for us. Now, why does he do that? Because God forgets? No, because we forget. That verse isn't in there to tell me that God forgets and so he needs the Son to keep reminding him all the time. That verse is in there so that I can know he's doing that because I'm the one who forgets that Jesus is pleading my case. And when I forget that Jesus is pleading my case and Satan comes to me and accuses me, you know what I do? I look at me and start straightening myself out so I can clean out my act and plead my own case when that's his job. Spirit. It says in Galatians that he has given us his spirit in our hearts by which we cry, Abba, Father. So he has placed his spirit in us. And the response that that spirit gives us is the ability to call the father daddy. It's not a judge thing. It's a dad thing. God is going to be the judge. But he's our dad. But it also says in Galatians that we are wrapped in the Spirit. We are clothed in Christ. In other words, encased so as not to be seen. So His Spirit is around us. His Spirit is in us. The word paraclete means the helper who comes alongside of to help. So the Spirit is in us. It's around us. He's next to us. And in Psalms it says, Where can I go to hide from your Spirit? Nowhere. So He's always with me. And in 1 Corinthians, or 2 Corinthians 1, it says that the Spirit has been given as a pledge. And the word pledge there is the Greek word erabon, which means engagement ring, which means that the fact that we have His Spirit says that we belong to Him. He's coming for us, and no one else can have us. Now these are all the things that God has done on our behalf. Some of the things, a few of the things that God has done on our behalf. His performance. His performance says some things about us too. Now I'm going to go through a list rapid fire and just to show you a sample, once again, an example of some of the things that God has done for us and what that means about us. So now we're talking about some new messages that are true about us because of what God has done. Whereas on this bottom scenario, you see, these messages are about us because of somebody else or because of ourselves. and these messages are about us because of ourselves or somebody else. These messages are about us because of what God has done. And here's some of them. Romans 14, 3, we're accepted. 1 Corinthians 1, 5, in everything you were enriched in all speech and knowledge. 1 Corinthians 6, 11, you were washed. Well, if you were washed, what are you now? Clean. You were sanctified. Well, if you were sanctified, what are you now? Holy. You were justified. If you were justified, what are you now? Innocent. 2 Corinthians 2.15, a fragrant aroma to God in Christ. When God smells you, he likes what he smells. You smell okay to God. 2 Corinthians 5.17, if anyone is in Christ, he is what? New creation. It does not say a part old, part new creation. It says a new creation. Behold, old things are passed away, all things have become new. It doesn't say, if any was in Christ, he's a black dog and a white dog, an old self and a new self. Few old things are gone, but you got a bunch of them left, and a few new things have come, but not very many. And so spend your whole time looking at yourself, trying to starve half of yourself. It says, if any was in Christ, he's a new creation. The old self was crucified. So everything that this person here is trying to do to get rid of that old self, has already been done by nailing that person to the cross. You know, the only person that has any power to get rid of my old self is God. Because if I could do it, Jesus wouldn't have had to come. If I could do it. Galatians 3.26 says, You used to be a slave, and now you're an heir. You used to be a child, and now you're a son or daughter. Ephesians 1.3, You've been blessed with every spiritual blessing. Ephesians 1.4, He chose us before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and blameless. What that says literally in the Greek is, his choosing then makes us now be holy and blameless. His choosing makes us be holy and blameless, not our holiness and blamelessness, because guess what, folks? We just aren't that holy and blameless. Are we? I'm not. If my holiness and blamelessness is up to me, I'm out of luck. But I am those things because he chose me, and so I need to look at the one who chose me then and not on my holiness and blamelessness. Ephesians 1.5, adopted as sons and daughters. Ephesians 1.7, redeemed and forgiven. Ephesians 1.11, we've obtained an inheritance. Ephesians 2.5, we used to be dead but were alive. Ephesians 2.6, seated with him in heavenly places. Ephesians 2.10, his workmanship. Ephesians 2.13, we used to be far away but he has brought us near. Ephesians 2.19, fellow citizens. Romans 5, we're at peace with God. Philippians 1.11, having been filled with the fruit of righteousness. Philippians 2.15, God's light in the dark world. Colossians 2.10, in him you have been made complete. Now you see, when I read a verse like that, what my inclination is to do is to look at me and go, what are you talking about? I'm not complete. I didn't completely treat my wife the way I should have this week. You know, I lost my hair. I didn't say something I should have said. I did say something. Don't tell me I'm complete. The verse doesn't say, in you you've been made complete. It says, in him you've been made complete. Quit looking at you and start looking at him. And then the next part of that verse says, and he is the head over all rule and authority, which means, in him you've been made complete, and he's the one who decides. And he's in charge. 1 Peter 2.9, a chosen race, a royal priesthood. Hebrews 3.1, a holy brethren. Hebrews 9.17, turn there. Hebrews 9, 17, verse 16 actually says, where a covenant, a will, like a last will in testament, where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it. For a covenant is valid only when men are dead. It is never enforced while the one who made it lives. Now those of you who have a will know that you have a will, and in your will, your loved ones, whoever you decide, gets everything in the will, but they don't get it as long as you're alive. They only get it when you die. Well, what this is talking about is that before the foundation of the world, The one who made it all made a will. And in his will, he left everything to his heirs. That's us. Fellow heirs, fellow partakers of the promise. We know what happened then? The one who made the will died. And when the one who makes the will dies, the heirs get the will. Do you know how many Christians are spending their life looking at themselves, trying to clean up their act so that they could get the will? You can't get the will by cleaning up your act. The only way you can get the will is, number one, to be an heir, and number two, for the one who made the will to die. When those two things happen, you get the will. Now, all of those things I said to you about you are all yours for free, and all you've been doing for the last however long is sitting in the chair doing nothing. You haven't even done one single Christian thing, and all of that stuff is true about you just because of what Jesus did. Sitting in the chair. If you never get out of the chair, all of those things are true about you because of what Jesus did. But see, what I know also is that if you realize that all those things are true about you because of what Jesus did, you're not going to want to be sitting in the chair. Eventually, maybe you'll need to sit in the chair because you're all beat up and wounded and tired and all that kind of stuff, so sit in the chair. But when it's time to get up, which would be then live consistently, living consistently with what's already true about us because of what God has done. Now you see, these are my behaviors. But in this rest scenario, my behaviors come out of the messages that are already true about me because of what God has done. On these two bottom scenarios, my behaviors generate the messages. In this scenario, the messages generate the behavior. That's why you get a verse in Philippians 3.16 that says, Let us keep living by the same standard to which we have attained. Now, have we attained the standard? Yes. Have we attained the standard because we're such good standard attainers? No. We have attained the standard because we are in the one who attained the standard. And now it's about living consistently with that. If I miss the mark, meaning I do a negative behavior, Like, I act like something can give me life or value and acceptance that can't, but I act like it can, like robbing a bank, let's say. That would be a negative behavior. The reason robbing the bank is not an okay behavior, the reason it's a sin is because it promises something it can't deliver. Now, if I remembered all this stuff that I just told you, and I remembered that in Philippians 4.19, it says he is able to meet all your needs according to his riches and glory, And I remembered 2 Corinthians 9.8. 2 Corinthians 9.8 says this, And God is able to make all grace abound to you, that always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed. Now, if I remember all that stuff, would I rob a bank? What do you think? Why would I do that? But if I forgot that, and I started acting like money and banks had power, I might do that, and that would miss the mark. You know what else I might do if I forgot all that stuff? I might go start teaching a Sunday school class to earn points with God. I might start giving 10% to earn points with God, too. I mean, is teaching a Sunday school class bad? No. Does it have the power to make you earn points with God? No. Plus, isn't it redundant to do that, to earn points with God, when you already have all your points with God for free because of what Jesus did? So if I remembered that, would I go teach a Sunday school class to get myself filled up from how many Sunday school classes I taught? No. Might I go teach a Sunday school class? yeah so if i robbed the bank to hit the mark or i teach the science school class to hit the mark neither one of those hit the mark that's called a sin and when i realize i missed the mark you know i do now i go back over here to the cross and i say i'm sorry and he says you're forgiven and i struggle once again to live up here if i hit the mark meaning i remember who i am and i don't rob the bank and i teach the science school class for the right reason then I don't pat myself on the back and feel relief because I finally hit the mark. I come back over here to the cross and say thank you, and then I struggle to keep living up here. So there's no shame or self-righteousness on this cycle. There is only rest on this cycle, even though it's really a lot of work. You understand that? And that is illustrated in 1 Peter 6.12, where Paul says, fight the good fight of faith. And the Greek word for fight there is A-G-O-N, which in English, if you can add a Y to it, it's agony. That's the right word, though, because it's agony for us to keep getting our sense of who we are, our sense of vindication, our sense of value and acceptance of being loved from a cross we can't see and a God we can't see that happened 2,000 years ago when we got all this stuff in our face promising us life and acceptance that can't do it. But it's a good fight. And what I know is that you're going to fight a fight either way. You're either going to fight a fight to please the in-laws and please the church leaders and please the world and please all these people so that when they're all pleased, you can feel like a good, acceptable person. Or you're going to fight a fight of remembering that you're valuable and acceptable because of what Jesus did, and that's going to result in some things too. So you're going to fight either way. And all Paul is saying is fight the good fight, because you're going to fight a fight. So fight the good fight. But let's not be naive about that fight. That fight is agony. It's agony for me to know that I'm okay because of Jesus if my kids are acting weird in the grocery store and you're watching. It's agony for me to know I'm okay because of Jesus if I stood up in the pulpit and said a stupid thing and a bunch of people said that was a really stupid thing and I was hurt by you saying that. For me to remember that Jesus makes me okay because if I did, you know what I could do to those people? I could apologize and own the behavior. If that doesn't indict me, there's a verse that says, if he is for us, who is against us? Who will bring a charge against God's elect? That's not, you know, who will bring a charge against God's elect? That's like if I do a bad behavior, you could confront me about it, but it doesn't indict me. It just is a confrontation, and I can own the behavior and apologize. And the struggle is to live up here, not to find prettier ways of trying to erase this side over here. The purpose of Christian relationships and the purpose of churches and the purpose of families is to support one another in living up here. Not support one another in trying to stop doing the negative stuff that we earn points with and start doing the positive stuff that we think we can earn points with that we can't. So with that I'll close. Thank you.
