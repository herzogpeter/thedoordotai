The book of Hebrews, 10th chapter, speaks of the desired effect of the gathering of the community of faith. Among other desired effects is this, that in our gathering it would stimulate us to love and good deeds. And that is my desire and that is my prayer as we move into this particular word this morning. Let's pray with that in mind. Father, my prayer this morning is simply this, that by the power of your Spirit, through the word proclaimed, we would be stirred to choose the more excellent way. I pray that in Jesus' name. Amen. I'd like you to open your Bibles with me as we continue our study in the epistle of 1 John to the fourth chapter. as we're entering this morning into our second week of study in a section that spans 18 verses, from chapter 4, verse 6 to chapter 5, verse 3. The theme of this section, as introduced last week, is love. More specifically, that God is love, chapter 4, verse 8, and that this God who is love has set His love on us. He has pursued us from before time. He has pursued us and was willing to pay an enormous price to win us, to redeem and reconcile us. Indeed, it was by this that the love of God was manifested to us, verse 9 and verse 10. By what? By this, that God sent His only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him. And this is love. Not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son. There's the pursuing of God, the sending of His Son to be the propitiation or the satisfaction for our sins. All of that coming with a glorious promise that if we have the courage and the faith to open our hearts, to step into and receive what we called last week the furious love of God, that that love will change who we are. It will change how we live, how we love, and why we obey, which speaks to a fundamentally different way to live. No longer driven to live and love and even obey by fear of punishment if we don't obey, but now driven, motivated, as it were, to live and love and obey by love, particularly for God. For perfect love casts out fear. Chapter 4, verse 18, it says, For we are a people who have been seized by the power of a great affection, and it is by that power of a great affection that we now live. But last week I was also careful to point out that while this love does indeed change us, it also calls us. It makes demands of us. Really, only one. For that which love demands is love, which is precisely why some people hold the love of God at arm's length, reducing it down to an arrangement, not a love affair, to a system of religion wherein I simply learn the system. And I can keep God at bay that way. I just do the list. I sing the song. I read the book. I go to catechism. I pay my dues. I do my duty. But love asks for more. Love asks for love. Brennan Manning, in his inimitable style, says it this way at the end of his book, Ragamuffin Gospel. So you think that the relentless love of God makes Christianity an easy religion. The love of God makes great demands. It weighs and counts nothing but expects everything. Perhaps that does explain our skittishness around the love of God, our uneasiness with the gospel of amazing grace. because instinctively we know that God's love for us brings with it a call to live and love the same way He lived and loved. Small wonder, so many surrender the care of their souls to the control of rules rather than run the risk of living in union with love. Christianity, Manning says, is not primarily a moral code, but a grace-laden mystery. It is not essentially a philosophy of life, but a love affair with God through Christ. It is not embodied in the keeping of rules with clenched fists, but the receiving of gifts with open hands. It is not for legalists, preening ascetics, or pretenders in the spirit. It's for the wobbly and weak-kneed who know they don't have it all together and aren't too proud to ask for the handout of amazing grace. But here's the catch. People who have authentically received the handout of amazing grace, by that reception, become themselves graceful people. People who are authentically walking in the love of God become themselves loving people, which is precisely what John is saying as we move now to portions of this section that I did not get to last week. Look with me now at verse 7 as we can't even hear the rest of the story. Last week, the love of God for us. He has pursued us. But because that's true and we've received it, here is the response. Let us, therefore, verse 7, love one another. For love is from God. And everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. The one who does not love does not know God. For God is love. That sounds like a fairly harsh black and white statement there, that seventh verse. If you don't love, you're not from God. But you need to get into John's head a little bit and into his heart. He is one himself who has been seized by the power of great affection. And it did indeed change him, and he became, out of that love from God, a lover of God and people. You see, John is at a place where he simply can't conceive of the love of God coming to someone without flowing through someone. It just doesn't add up. It's all very simple, really, says John. And verse 19, we love because he first loved us. It's just how it works. If someone says, I love God, but hates his brother, he's a liar. It just doesn't add up. I don't get it. For the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he hasn't seen. It all boils down to this, verse 21, that this is the commandment we have from him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also. David Jackman in his commentary on 1 John cites the first century historian Jerome as telling us that John in the gathering mist of his twilight years spoke with what he called magnificent monotony of the love of God through Christ over and over it's all he talked about when he finally became that is John finally became so weak that he could no longer preach and hardly even stand he was carried then into the gathering of believers by friends, contented himself with this singular word of exhortation, little children, love one another. His hearers grew tired of this message and asked him why he so frequently repeated it. He simply said this, it's what the master wanted, and if this is all you do, this is enough. I don't know about you, but I can almost picture John in his old age. I mean, feature him even maybe coming among us, and he would be the speaker of the day, no longer able to stand well, and we're not going to have a real long sermon today. Maybe someone will speak after John speaks, but in honor of what he's given us in the past, we're going to have him talk no longer, maybe even able in his age to recall the epistle, the whole epistle that he wrote. I'm not even going to be able to bring that, John would think, but he remembered one verse. There was one verse that John just never forgot because it was written on his heart. Verse 21, he never forgot. It's all he ever said. This is the commandment that we have from him. Love God. Love each other. We have it from him. And maybe the most poignant time that John got it from him was the time that John wrote it down so that now we can read it. And he made a record of it. It appears in his gospel, the 13th chapter, John 13. Let me set the stage. The cross is looming. The disciples are afraid and confused. They don't understand why Jesus has to suffer and why he has to die. He's preparing them for this event, trying to encourage them and direct them. He says many things to them, but among the things he says, this was central. He says these words, a new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another as I have loved you. By this, all men will know that you are followers of me if you love one another. And I'm sure those words penetrated the hearts of every person. But if you know John, you know John that in a special way, it absolutely ravished him. This is the disciple that Jesus loved. This is the disciple that put his head on Jesus' breast and hurt his beating heart. When Jesus spoke of love, something deep stirred within this man. And he wrote those words down. John 17, love of the brethren was the centerpiece of Jesus' priestly prayer to the Father. Verse 23, and it's much like John 13, but it takes a little different spin. The prayer of Jesus was this, perfect them in love, Father, in order that the world may know that you really did send me and that you loved them even as you loved me. In John 13, by this will all men know that you are followers of Jesus if you love one another. In John 17, he prays that love would be fully formed among the followers of Christ so that the world would know Jesus was really sent by God. in other places Jesus has spread this word this instruction if you will to love as applying to people beyond the household of faith beyond just the brethren it starts in the household of faith I mean if you don't have this dynamic of authentic love at home you don't have much to export in fact if you don't have it at home stay at home don't tell anybody you're from this family but it doesn't stop there Matthew 22 37 Jesus says you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart soul and mind and you shall love not just other people who think like you and believe like you but you shall love your neighbor as yourself love God love people Matthew 5 he pushed it past the neighbor he said I'm calling you to love your enemy in fact loving your enemy ties in with the love God had for us we love him because he first loved us remember last week we talked about Romans 5 you need to understand that the love of God was manifested in this that while we were yet sinners hostile toward God, enemies of God he died for us I want you to love the way I loved you and the way I loved you was this while you were still hostile I died for you that's how I want, here you now go love that way by this will all men know that you're followers of me By this will all men know that the Father has sent me and loves you. If you live a life of love, the kind of love that people can see, the kind of love that people can feel, the kind of love that people can hear because it's coming from your mouth and how you say it and the words you choose, and it's coming from your hand, and it's evident in your life. That is why the Apostle Paul said in Philippians 4, chapter 4, verse 5, Let your forbearing spirit be known to all men. Be known to all men simply means let that be the first thing people see about you. In fact, in the original Greek, it speaks, it conjures up kind of a picture of a banner over your life. Like someone holding a sign. Let the banner over your life, let the sign that you hold, let the first thing people see about you be this, forbearing love. That is why Paul, in Philippians 1, verse 9, prayed this, and this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment. Real knowledge and all discernment of what? Of two things, actually. That your love would abound in real knowledge and all discernment of, number one, what real love is, that it is not just syrupy sentimentality, and also that it would abound in real knowledge and all discernment of what people really are like. Meaning this, that they're not always that lovable. that they do heinous things, that they might do hurtful things even to you. And my prayer for you, church, says Paul, is that your love would abound still more and more even though you know what people are really like. Why would he pray that? Because he knew it is precisely by that kind of demonstrated love that the world will know that the gospel of amazing grace is true. Beloved, the manifested love of God that has come to you, now flowing through you, is the most powerful argument on earth for the veracity of the Christian faith. It is more compelling than a sermon. It is more moving than a song. It is more convincing than a creed. which, by the way, is really good news. Do you know why? Because it means even you can do it. It means you don t have to be smart to do this. You don t have to be wealthy to do this. You t have to be Billy Graham to do this. You don t have to be Brennan Manning to do this. Thank God for Billy Graham and Brennan Manning and how they craft words. You don t have to be Greg Boyd to do this. I love Greg Boyd. I love how he uses... He is an apologist. Maybe the best that I've ever heard. Apologist, by the way. Apologetics. It's not somebody who walks around apologizing. Although I think Greg should. I don't even know what for. But he just should, you know, by general principle. Guys just walk into rooms and go, sorry. And then you just kind of move on. I was at a prayer breakfast. That was a couple years ago. And it was one of those bring a friend who doesn't know the Lord prayer breakfast, men's breakfast, and we're going to share the gospel with him. And it was just the coolest event. And Greg was the speaker, and he did what he does. And using razor-sharp intellect and just a disarming humor, he presented the gospel in a way that was powerfully compelling. And I wrote him a letter. I called him, and I just wept through what you said. It was so true and so powerful and so disarming. And he kind of waded through all sorts of philosophical arguments about the existence of God and whether he doesn't. By the way, by the end, I was convinced. He had me. He had me right there. And people got saved that day. And just this incredible capacity to use words, and God's given him such a gift. So grateful. But the only downside of the Greg Boyds of the world is this. You kind of walk out of the room going, boy, if I could say it like that, then I'd really be able to do it. And Greg himself, if he were here, would stand and say, you need to know. Whatever words anybody is able to say that paints a picture or convinces people to come to Christ has nothing on the power that the Bible says we have if we would just love each other. 1 John 4.12 may be the most potent verse in this whole section on what it is that John is trying to get across here, but it's kind of hidden in there and it would be easy to miss. Here's what he says. It's on the screen for you to read it. No man has seen God at any time. But if we love one another, just stop right there. Just hold that together. The implication here is this. You haven't seen God at any time. But if we love each other in particular and people in general, that's what has the power to make the God who people haven't seen visible. Now, that's what it means. But it's really powerful when you get this particular connection. This is the kind of thing that commentaries flag, and it helps you because you see what's going on. But there's a little phrase, no man has seen God at any time. And that has been identified as kind of a favorite phrase of John's. And he used it in his gospel, in the gospel of John, the first chapter. He says exactly that, no man has seen God at any time. Well, that creates a problem. How are people going to know God? How are they going to come to God? Well, then he goes on to say, but here's the good news. The word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. then he has explained him. Who is he? That is, Jesus has explained God who no one has seen. Now, you get that. That's talking of incarnation. Jesus, God in flesh, has revealed the face of God to us, so we know who God is and what he's like. Well, now in 1 John 4, he uses the same phrase. No man has seen God at any time, but if we love each other, what's he saying there? What he's saying there is that it has the same power. Your love of each other and of the world has the power to reveal the face of God. Let that in. But as you do let that in, you'd also need to let this in, that it is precisely on this point and on that truth that this whole word gets a little sticky. Because if it really is true that there is nothing more powerful on earth for revealing the face of God and declaring the truth about the grace of God than the manifested love of God through you and me, then the opposite of that is true as well. For nothing has more power on earth to distort the face of God and confuse the message of amazing grace that when people who claim to know the love of God don't demonstrate that love in any manifested way, and I am pretty sure that we could probably, out of this room, get hundreds of people to testify to that fact, that your biggest struggle with Christian faith, with knowing God, was not some point of theology, even though there have been points of theology that have confused you and troubled you, and you still don't have reconciliation on it. the greatest points of distortion of grace and God and being able to come to Him. It was when people who claimed to love God didn't demonstrate that in any way. One of my closest friends is a man who grew up in a family, went to church every time the doors were open. His dad was a deacon, his mom was a Sunday school teacher, and they could both speak eloquently of the love of God at church. But when they got in the car, when they went home, he never heard it. He never saw it. He never felt it. And I'm telling you that that little boy growing up in that family that went to church every Sunday had a horribly distorted view of God. And his life right now is a demonstration of amazing grace. And God, He has been seized by the power of great affection, but I'm telling you this, at 45 years old with kids of his own, this distortion is still the biggest battle of his life. He's wading through it every day. He is wading through it, and it's getting clearer. Nothing, beloved, has more power on earth to distort the face of God, confuse the message of amazing grace, than when people who claim to know the love of God don't demonstrate that love in any manifested way. Sheldon Van Auken, in his book entitled The Severe Mercy, which was a chronicle of his personal search for truth, and then in particular his struggle with Christianity. Is it true? Is it not? He said this, and I quote, the strongest argument I have found yet for Christianity is Christians, their love most of all, their joy as well, their certainty of things to come. I love that. I'm drawn to that. The strongest argument I have found yet against Christianity is also Christians. However, when they're self-righteous and smug and complacent consecration, when they are narrow and petty, judgmental and small, lacking love, then Christianity, in my mind, dies a thousand deaths. I wish the examples of Christians lacking love weren't so easy to come by. I wish I didn't see it and hear it so often. I wish we didn't fail at love. I wish I didn't fail at love as often as we as I do. In the tape I was listening to recently by John Ortberg, John is one of the teaching pastors at Willow Creek Community Church in the Chicago area. And he's been in our pulpit several times and we consider him a good friend. told a story on this tape of correspondence he had with Chuck Colson. Chuck Colson, as most of you know, was a man who left the White House in the middle of the Nixon debacle around the Watergate scandal, and Chuck Colson went to prison for his involvement in that scandal. While he was in prison, he had a miraculous encounter with the living Christ, gave his heart to the Lord, and has devoted his life ever since then to a prison ministry. It's a ministry that a number of people in our own church are involved in, even at this moment. A couple years ago, in recognition of his work, he received what was called the Templeton Prize for progress in religion. Now, the Templeton group is not a Christian group, and they often honor people who are not consistent at all with Christian values, and there was a sum of money involved with this prize, which Colson gave away, but there were a number of Christians kind of disturbed that this Templeton group would give this prize and that Chuck Colson would accept it at all because they were thinking, you know, we should stay away from all that. And Colson wrote this, Now you think about that. You think about the feeding frenzy that was going on in the water. Some of you weren't around, but, I mean, you weren't alive. And if you were, you didn't care. But the feeding frenzy in the media that was going on and the blood lust, if you will, and his experience, what wounded his soul, what affected his soul, was that it was harsher from Christians than from even that. Philip Yancey, in his book, What's So Amazing About Grace, He tells the story of how some years ago he had written an article for Christianity Today that was entitled, Why Bill Clinton Isn't the Antichrist. Suggesting that, you know, maybe he wasn't. That while on one hand we may vehemently disagree with his policies, be thoroughly disgusted with some of his behavior, he might not be as black and white evil as some would like to portray him. And even if he is as black and white as some would like to portray him, the biblical imperative upon us as believers in Christ who say we are disciples of Christ is to love Him, authentically love Him, and to pray for Him. I'm going to get back to that in a minute, but I was, my wife and I were in Chicago this week making our yearly religious pilgrimage to Wrigley Field. And the front page of the Chicago Tribune was a picture of Bill Clinton with Bill Hybels. And he had been in the church, and Clinton was speaking there and talking about his process with the Monica Lewinsky thing and his own repentance around that. And there was just full thousands of pastors were there. And what's interesting about that wasn't that, but the incredible hate mail that not Clinton but Hybels got for identifying himself with Bill Clinton in any way. And when asked who's supposed to pray for him, when he opens the door for me to go and be with him and share with him amazing grace and the life of God, you want me to not go there. Well, in that same line, this is what Yancey was dealing with in this article in Christianity Today, in the article in Christianity Today, and he's speaking about the article in the book. I don't know if I've lost you on the train of that. In the article, Yancey talked about a private meeting he had with President Clinton and how the president had confided in him the fact that he was fully prepared for a strong negative reaction from the Christian right relative to his policies and justifiably so, a negative reaction for his immoral behavior. But he said to Yancey this, I was not prepared for the hate. Why do Christians hate so much? one of the points of his article that Yancey was trying to make later on in this article was the power of mercy and how potent it can be and how we tend to think that if we can make our argument and win the argument that's the most potent thing but the power of mercy is maybe greater than that would you please think about that that was the intent of this he told the story in the article of Hillary Clinton involving the First Lady and how Susan Baker, a Republican, wife of former Secretary of State James Baker, invited Mrs. Clinton to a bipartisan Bible study. The First Lady admitted that she was at first skeptical about meeting with a group that described themselves as conservative and liberal, Republican and Democrat, but all committed to Jesus. She went to the meeting with her guard up and ready to defend her positions and also ready to absorb some verbal blows, because that's what she was used to from groups like this. The meeting began, however, with one of the women saying, Mrs. Clinton, all of us in this room have agreed to pray for you faithfully, and we want to apologize to you for the way that you've been treated by some people, including some of us in this room. We have wronged you. We have spoken lies about you. The attacks have been personal. We certainly don't agree with everything you say, but we have acted unchristianly toward you. Will you forgive us? Well, Hillary Clinton later said, and she reported this directly to Philip Yancey, that she had come prepared to that meeting for anything except an apology. All of her suspicions melted away. Later in that same day, she devoted an entire speech to enumerating the spiritual gifts, she called them, that she had received from that group of women. You know what I think happened to Hillary? I think she saw the face of God. She then later asked this group of women if they could start a similar group for young people her daughter's age because Chelsea had not met many grace-filled Christians. Now the real kicker in this story, as Yancey was relating it in his book, was really this. And this is really why I'm sharing it with you. It's not about Hillary or Bill Clinton and their response to this. It's really about the reaction Yancey got for writing those things about the president and the first lady. And I quote now, Yancey speaking, I was totally unprepared for the firestorm of reaction. I wonder if my mailman will ever recover from the strain of logging bags of angry letters to my mailbox. All of them from Christians. Less than 10% of the letters had positive things to say, but it was the vicious tone of personal attack that caught me completely off guard. In 25 years of journalism, I have received my share of bad reviews, most of them well-deserved, but nothing like this. As I read through the stacks of angry letters, I began to get a strong sense for why the world does not automatically associate the words love or grace with evangelical Christians. And as those stories serving as a background, hear the word of God, hear the heart of Paul, of Jesus, of John. Let your forbearing spirit be the first thing people see about you. Let that be what you put on a sign. Let that be the banner over your life. And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment of what people are like. I want you to love the many. My prayer for you is the love would abound. Why? Because this is how all men will know that you are following me and that God has sent me. You guys need to understand we're all in kind of a in kind of a pinch here in calling people to God. You know what the pinch is? It's this. No man has seen God at any time, so he's hard to grasp. But if you love one another, and if you love them, They will see the face of God. It's more compelling than any sermon. It's more moving than any song. They may not respond to the face of God. They may not even recognize it. They might see it and spit on it. They might kill it. They will see it. Dr. Haddon Robinson, president of the Denver Conservative Baptist Seminary, made this observation, that outsiders to faith are drawn first to Christians, then to Christ. Unfortunately, not all Christians attract. Like a turned magnet, some repel. Yet Christians, alive to God, loving, caring, repenting, forgiving, laughing, sharing, involved where people live, and at the point of their need, present an undeniable, sometimes irresistible witness for Christ in the world. The problem, however, is this. Bridges are harder to build and take more time than building walls. That is why we have so many more walls than bridges. It's an interesting analogy, building bridges, building walls, as to applying to relationships and our care for people. And what it did for me was it kind of raised a disturbing question. And the disturbing question was this. Why is it true that I am so prone to build walls more quickly than bridges? Well, as I just reflect on it in my own spirit, part of it may be what Robinson said. It's just easier to build a wall. And so maybe that's why there's this lazy piece to it. A little further reflection. It could be much more serious than that. It could be a dangerous lack of love, maybe even a mean spirit. I mean, think about it. We build walls, and from behind our walls, we throw rocks at people who aren't on our side of the wall, who aren't on our side of the issue. Our aim at those times, if you're really honest, our aim is not at all to win them. We're throwing rocks at them. Our aim at that point is to beat them, to expose them, maybe to protect ourselves from them. And with that thought, I began to think about another reason that we sometimes build walls of ungrace, not always because we're mean or lazy or lacking entirely in love, but sometimes we build walls instead of bridges because we're afraid. I mean, if I get close to them, my fear is I could get drawn into them and even into their sin. I mean, if I speak well of them, people will think I agree with them. That's, by the way, exactly what Yancey did. He spoke well of Bill Clinton, that the possibility of something good, or the possibility of something good in the First Lady, just something maybe God might be doing. Even the possibility of that got him hate mail. Hey, I got to tell you honest, I don't worry about it here much in our church, but I really wondered if I should even include those stories, Because what would happen, what would come at you? What's going to come at you on that one? If you even consider that they're not as evil as you like to think, or that they might be worth someone going to be with them and pray with them. We do it for fear. Sometimes we build a wall because I honestly, I don't know how to authentically respect people that I'm strongly opposed to in terms of their view. There are places where you're in a place where you have to, I'm called to respect them and love them. At the same time, I oppose them. I'm against what they say and what they do. Well, it's easiest at that point to just build a wall. It's easiest at that point to get a really big brush and just paint them evil. I grew up in a very fundamentalistic church culture. In my very young years, this culture changed. At least we changed in the middle of this culture, and it was big on what we called separation. Key verse for the people that I grew up in in those days would be a verse like 2 Corinthians 6.16. Come out from among them and be separate and touch not the unclean thing. That's a good verse. But as it got applied in our context, the separation went beyond separating ourselves from sinful behavior, but isolating ourselves from anyone who did what we didn't do, who didn't do what we did, who thought what we didn't think or who didn't think what we thought. Now for most of the people in that particular church culture, what was at the core of their separation from people was not a mean spirit. Most of the people were good, godly, what you'd probably call salt of the earth kinds of people. They were not mean, but they were afraid primarily of two things. Number one, they were afraid of being overwhelmed by sin. That's a legitimate thing to be afraid of. and they were afraid of being drawn into sin. That's a legitimate thing to be afraid of. But the response to that fear was this. Built a wall, became a fort. We called it a church and wondered why nobody came. And we told ourselves and spoke of things like being the remnant, the faithful few, nobody else, just us. And it never occurred to us that we looked arrogant, that we looked self-righteous and unloving to a lost and dying world, a lost and dying world that desperately needed to see the face of God. And many of whom would have responded had they seen the face of God. All they saw was us. John Stott, as quoted by Becky Pippert in her book Pizza Parlor Christianity, refers to this kind of thing in kind of a whimsical way as rabbit hole Christianity. You know, says Stott, the kind who pops his head out of the hole, leaves his Christian roommate in the morning, scurries the class or work, frantically searches for a Christian to sit next to, thus proceeding from class to class. At dinner, he sits with all the Christians in his dorm at one huge table and thinks, wow, what a witness we are. We must look like something. From there, he goes to his all-Christian Bible study, and he might even catch a prayer meeting after that where he and other Christians will pray for all the non-Christians on their floor. But what luck. There aren't any non-Christians on their floor. That night, he scurries back to his Christian roommate safe. He made it through the day. And his only contact with the world were those brave dashes to and from Christian activities. He wasn't overwhelmed by sin, and that's a good thing. And he wasn't drawn into sin, and that's a good thing. But he never found himself in a place, and he never sought out a way. He never even wondered maybe about, it's a stereotype, but he never wondered even maybe about a way that he could show anybody the face of God. Steve Sjogren, a good friend of mine, of ours as a church, pastor of the Vineyard Church in Cincinnati, author of the book Conspiracy of Kindness, in that book confesses this, I've spent most of my life being stuck with those kinds of fears. I operated as a kind of Christian agoraphobic, loving the Lord and really loving people in my heart, but afraid to leave the confines of the house. In recent years, however, I've been venturing out of the Christian ghetto, which once kept me bound. I've been saying no to my fears. I'm building some bridges now. I've been daring to color outside the lines. As soon as I hear him talk about coloring outside the lines, something rises up inside of me, and I say, Steve, Steve, outside the lines, I have a question. How far outside the lines do you draw? I mean, Steve, honestly, is it possible to go too far outside the lines? Well, the answer to that question is yes, it is. But the danger of going outside the lines we need to understand is twofold. Number one danger is this, that in our effort to forbear, to authentically love the people of the world, but don't become part of the world. Remember a few weeks ago we talked about out of this epistle, love not the world. That didn't mean people, that meant the system of the world. So in our effort to love the people of the world but not become like the world, in our responding positively to our need to love and radically identify with the human culture and the human condition, the danger is we might fail to maintain a radical difference from that culture. And the result of that is tragic because what it means is that we will have an audience maybe because we've identified with people and we've established some relationships, But if we've compromised, we have no message. You have an audience, but you don't have a message. The second danger is this. That so fearing the first danger, we build walls, not bridges. Resulting in this, that we may have a message. And it may be exactly what people need to hear. But we don't have an audience because we've walled ourselves off. Million dollar question at that point then is this. How do we strike the biblical balance? How do we authentically and safely let our forebearing spirit be made known to all men so that they can see the face of God? Well, I'm going to try to answer that next week. Aren't you happy? In fact, I do want you to know this. We've gone through 1 John, and I think the study has been rich. One of the things I'm always looking for, and I have this little code word with my wife and with friends and staff and stuff. Every once in a while I'll come into something and I'll go, I think we need to sit down in this. And this is the first place in 1 John where I've just felt this real strong prompting from the Spirit, David, sit down in this love thing. Just sit down in this and sit down with the people and let the people sit in this for a while. So we're going to do that. I don't know how long it's going to last. But let me close with this question. Why are we going to sit down in this? Why are we going to take some weeks on this? Why am I going to spend a whole week next week trying to weed through how we can authentically let our forbearing spirit be made known and at the same time not compromise? Why are we going to do that? Here is why, beloved. Because the most powerful force on earth for revealing the face of God and declaring the truth about the grace of God to people who don't know God is when the people of God who've received the grace of God demonstrate the love of God. See, our tension as authentically redeemed people in this world is this. Nobody's seen God at any time. You haven't with your physical life. They haven't. But here's the trump card. Here's the card you can play. If you love each other, and if you love them, it has the power to reveal the face of God. Don't believe it? Think right now. What is it for you that revealed the face of God? What is it that melted your heart to amazing grace? The love of God, the love of people. I was talking earlier about Greg Boyd and his ability to expound apologetics and that you don't need to be able to say it like that. You just need to love somebody. What occurred to me about that is there were a lot of men in that room listening to Greg because somebody loved him. Because somebody loved him enough to say, hey, come with me. Could we just be quiet for a moment? Bow your head, close your eyes, everybody. He started this sermon by asking God to use this word to stimulate love among us. Another thing, I would like you to just spend some time quiet with God and let this word by the Spirit call you. Just let it call you. I'm going to be quiet. I believe that God is speaking to some of you right now and in some pretty exciting ways and undeniable ways is giving some of you words from the Spirit of God to you about how this can get fleshed out. Maybe something about how you act at work or some relationships that are askew right now. So often what we need is just a reminder like this. And it also could be that as the Spirit calls you to this, that you may need to sit with this for a little while longer. So what I want to do as we close is give you permission that if there's something moving in you right now and God's talking to you about something, would you feel real free to just stay where you are? Just sit and continue to pray. People will move around. In fact, I'm going to ask people to be maybe a little quieter than normal and be very respectful if you see people around you just continuing in prayer, to just be respectful of that and just move around them and leave, and that's okay. But no man has seen God at any time. But if we love one another and if we love people, they can see the face of God. I pray in your name that you would move among us with your amazing grace. That you would overwhelm us again with your furious love. And that as we bathe once again in that, we would be freer and freer and freer to give away what you have given us. That it would not even be with great effort. It will just be who we are. Because of what you have done and are doing in us, I pray all these things in Jesus' name. And all God's people said, Amen. Amen.
