Let's pray, let's pray as we go to the Word and prepare our hearts for the table. I pray, Father, that the power of your Spirit would be activated among us through this Word to indeed prepare us for coming to the table and for what we need there, and for coming to the cross and for what we need there, and for coming to the men and women who will be standing up here during communion for prayer and for what we need there. Holy Spirit, come and give us what we need. And I pray in Jesus' name, amen. It was on the night in which he was betrayed, says the Apostle Paul in Colossians, in 1 Corinthians rather, 11 verse 23, that he took the bread and he broke it, that he took the cup and he drank it, saying, this is my body and this is my blood and this is for you. And he did all that, notably, on the night in which he was betrayed by Judas, denied by Peter, abandoned by them all. Not very good friends were they. Particularly when the chips were down, they all left him and fled. It says in Matthew 26, verse 56. Well, if you've been with us the last couple of weeks, particularly last week, then I'm sure you remember that in our returning to our study in the book of Colossians, where the Apostle Paul is dealing with issues related to women and men, submission and love, marriage and family, parenting and children, Colossians 3, 18 to 21, we actually used last week a story in the life of Jesus to kind of bring us back to Colossians 3. Oddly, using the story in the life of Jesus founded Matthew chapter 19 that gave us a window actually into what was actually going on in Jesus' day and in Paul's day, thus the connection to Colossians 3, what was actually going on in the culture between women and men as it relates to submission and love, marriage and family, children and parents. And as it turns out, if you were here last week, I'm sure you remember, it wasn't a pretty picture. Not much submission and love going on in any of those arenas of life, because what the story of Matthew 19 revealed for us in this interaction between Jesus and the Pharisees was that the sons of Adam, that is men, had been treating the daughters of Eve, that is women, with contempt and anger and lust, and then having used them as you might use something, they were discarding them for pretty much any cause at all. That language is specific to the story, so let me remind you of the story. In Matthew chapter 19, because the Pharisees had come to Jesus, you may remember, doing what they kind of always did when they came to Jesus. They were trying to kind of test him and embarrass him to try to catch him in some sort of mistake that might cause Jesus to be marginalized. Thus, the following he was getting would no longer be a threat to them. So they come to him, testing him with a question. And the question was this. Jesus, is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause at all? And the reason that question was a question that potentially could get him in some trouble was because the prevailing view of the day, even among some very powerful rabbis, was that it was, in fact, lawful to divorce your wife for pretty much any cause at all. Remember, some of the history we did last week indicated that in Jesus' day, it was illegal for a woman to get a divorce. Men could get a divorce quite easily. In fact, they could be married to more than one wife, even sometimes more than one wife at a time, and get a divorce for any cause at all, including causes like the burning of the bagels or too much salt, all of that kind of coming out. Some interpretations by some pretty powerful rabbis, Hillel being one of them, interpreting passages like Deuteronomy 24 that talks about some indecency that you see in her, giving you license then to put her away. And these indecencies became whatever was at the whim of the man. And so these imbalances and these hatreds were quite prolific in Jesus' day. Not very good friends, were they, women and men, in Jesus' day and Paul's day. Particularly when the chips were down, they tended to withdraw from each other, to force their will on each other, to close up or even consume one another, and ultimately to discard one another such that now, if you fast forward it from Jesus' day to ours, the pain and the hurt between the sons of Adam and the daughters of Eve can at times feel irreparable, irredeemable. And some of you are even in relationships that feel very much that way. Not very good friends are we sometimes, particularly when the chips are down. Divorce rates continue to rise, even among people of faith, because today it's not just men discarding women, as was the case in Jesus' day for pretty much any cause at all. Now it's women discarding men. We've kind of become equal opportunity discarters of one another. And round and round and round we go. But, says Jesus, back to Matthew 19, and this is what I called last week his great sadness. relative to this reality between women and men from the beginning, he said. Matthew 19, verse 8, it was not this way. For God's desire and design from the beginning, as he quotes in Matthew 19, he's quoting Genesis 1, 28, was Azar Kinegdo, which Steve Wiens has unpacked for us a couple of times. Most recently, just a few weeks ago, I thought brilliantly, this Azar Kinegdo, God's desire and design between men and women, face-to-face, eye-to-eye, co-reigning, co-ruling on earth with God together. Not this relentless vying for power and control we've grown so used to as almost a matter of course in our relationships. But submitting one to another was God's desire and design in the beginning. Out of reverence for Christ, submitting one to another, wives to their husbands, husbands to their wives, getting underneath each other to lift, to serve one another, in love, which was indeed God's desire and design from the beginning. But as we were telling the story last week, going all the way back to Genesis, sin and selfishness came in. By Genesis 3, it had come in, and we quit playing fair in how we treated each other, and we learned how we could hurt each other so as to get the upper hand, to have the power and control, and how to win not very good friends. Are we particularly when the chips are down? Indeed, we have betrayed and denied and abandoned one another in what Steve Weins once described. This was a teaching he did a few years ago, actually, around this very same text in Genesis. Anyway, described it as a car wreck that began in the garden. Kind of picture it that way. In Genesis 3, when sin entered in and selfishness kind of ruled the day, but that car wreck in Genesis 3 is a car wreck that every generation since has piled into, thus adding to the pain and the hurt, the sense of betrayal and denial and abandonment. But it's not just husbands and wives or men and women. It's us. It's kind of all of us, discarding one another sometimes for any cause at all. Not very good friends, are we sometimes, particularly when the chips are down? I don't know if you have a story like this in your life. I have a few. It's an email interaction I had with a friend some time ago around some life issues that we both felt pretty strongly about. We'd been talking about it and arguing. It felt pretty healthy and normal and not a problem. And then we did this thing you should never do. Well, I moved to the email, started writing things to each other. And every interaction, have you ever seen this? Got a little more tense, a little more caustic, a little more sarcastic and angry. Problem with both of us. We were both good with words and knew exactly which one to use and where to place them. But the final shots between us were actually quite short. Remember, two words, see ya followed by one word k it's not even a word it's a letter one and when you're in one of those incessant cycles of hurt where you begin uh to wonder how do i stop this thing because when you say a mean thing they see your mean and raise you one and then it's like you're going down a hill and you don't have any breaks, you start to realize that for this thing to stop, someone has to go first. But when you're in the middle of it, again, I'm probably the only one who gets like this, and you realize someone has to go first, I know, but it won't be me. So you go first. No, you go first. I always go first. Why don't you go first? So nobody goes first. all of which brings me back to that text I started this talk with in 1 Corinthians 11 and the words of Jesus that I read there. It's what makes these words of his so extraordinary because it was on the night in which he was betrayed that he broke the bread and, that he took the bread and broke it, that he took the cup and drank it, saying, in effect, I think, I'll go first. I know you guys won't go first, so I'll go first. On the night in which he was betrayed by Judas, denied by Peter, abandoned by them all. I don't know how to stop this cycle, so I'll go first. Indeed, it's a common thread, a common theme, a consistent pattern, central to the message and the mission of Jesus. Matthew 20, the disciples even mentioned this one, last week had been arguing amongst themselves, as they often did, about who would be greatest in the kingdom, who would sit at his right and his left when the kingdom would come, who's the greatest, was a common argument for them, like some husbands who want to know if headship means that they're the boss, and they're coming to Jesus as if to say, tell her, Jesus, tell us which one is the greatest, to which Jesus says, in effect, in Matthew 20, 25, you guys just don't get it. You just don't understand, because while it works this way in the world, that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, I know how it works there. And our great men exercise authority over them. In the kingdom of God, this kingdom into which I'm inviting you, it's not going to work that way among you. For whoever wishes to be great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first, and you all apparently do, Jesus is saying to them, I shall be the slave. But knowing that they wouldn't do it, and knowing that they didn't get it, at least not yet, he says, in effect, in the very next verse, so I'll go first. I kind of show you how, verse 28, because the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many, because to break the cycle of sin and selfishness and anger and pride, someone's got to go first. So I'll go first. That's why I came. Not just to do this for you, but to show you how, so you could be cycle breakers too. So you could, in the language of a couple weeks ago when we were talking about the Red Sea and Jordan, so that you could walk across this Jordan into a different kind of life. John 13, same thing. Same kind of dynamic is going on beginning in verse 1. It was just before the Passover feast, and Jesus knew that his time had come to face the cross. He was about to die to leave this world and go then to the Father. But he also knew something else at this table. Not only was his death imminent, but he knew that the meal was being served, that as the meal was being served, Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, was preparing, at the meal, was preparing to betray him, That Peter would deny him. He knew that all of them would leave him and flee. That not very good friends were they, particularly when the chips were down. It was in that context that he got up from the meal, verse four, took off his outer clothing, wrapped a towel around his waist, knelt down and washed the disciples' feet as if to say, as if to say without words, we can't just talk about this anymore. I've been talking about this for three years with you. I need to show you this, that someone's got to go first, so I'll go first. Remember Peter? In this very scene of the foot washing, Jesus came to Peter to wash his feet, and Peter resisted. Remember that? Indeed, he refused. Never shall you wash my feet, said Peter in John 13, 8. We speculate as to why he resisted, not exactly sure. Maybe he just didn't get it, which actually would be quite consistent, I think, for Peter, that he just didn't get it. But maybe he did understand, at least in parts, at some instinctive level, that if this really is Jesus' way, it will have to become mine. And I don't know if I want to go first the way Jesus goes first, but it's the only way to break the cycle of sin and selfishness, of anger and pride, of betrayal and denial and abandonment because someone's got to go first. But they all left him and fled. Not very good friends were they, particularly when the chips were down. Now, eventually Peter did get it. And when he did, he said in effect, two things, I think, and both of them are kind of born from John 13, verse 9. The first thing he says, obviously, in verse 9 of John 13 is this, I will receive. In fact, Jesus says, well, if I can't wash your feet, then you can have no part of me. And Jesus and Paul, Peter, what's his name? Peter, there we go, immediately changes his mind and said, if that's the case, then I want to receive this washing. I want to receive this grace. In fact, I do think he got it because he said, Indeed, not just my feet, but my hands and my head. I need to be bathed in this. As do all of us, from time to time, to receive this grace, to let it in, to forgive ourselves, which is oddly, isn't it? Where sometimes that's the hardest work some of us have to do. Really go deep into things with God, even forgiving others. but getting to that place where I need to be bathed in this. I need to receive this grace and let it in and forgive myself. I need this grace. And part of why we need this grace is that, if we're honest at all, we realize that we've all been part of the problem. In one way or another, we have all added to the pain between women and men. Not much submission or love. Not very good friends. are we sometimes. So in coming to the table this morning, in coming to the cross, in coming to men and women up here for prayer, one way to come would be with this spirit I need to come and receive. To kind of be bathed in this grace I need because maybe your part in all of this is right in your face in a very big way. So come and receive. But beyond receiving this washing of grace, I think Peter ultimately was willing to become this. Because a disciple, it says in John 13, 16, is not above his master. A disciple is not above his master. So what he did as a disciple, I want to do. And what he said as a follower of his, I want to say. And where he went, I want to go. And who he was, I want to be. at least to become like him. To become like him. I always sing those songs, and we really mean it. I want to become like him. Really? Just keep in mind, then, that it was on the night in which he was betrayed that he took the bread and broke it, that he took the cup and drank it, as if to say, in order to break this cycle, someone's got to go first. So I'll go first. But then he says this, does Jesus. Come follow me. I'll just receive this thing. I want you to emulate this thing and make my way of living and loving and serving and even forgiving your way. And I'm just here to tell you as I tie this into where we've been around the Jordan River and breaking through these deliverances at the Red Sea. As we begin to do that kind of thing, the waters of the Jordan begin to part. Waters that you thought you'd maybe never get across begin to part because it's only when we step into the deep water of risky obedience that God begins to make a way out and through. so here's the final word as we come this morning to the table and to the cross and to the people up here who will be up here for prayer and it's the same word I've closed with for the last couple of weeks out of Joshua chapter 1 the word is this be strong and courageous Joshua 1 verse 6 only be strong and very courageous he repeats it in verse 7 and then again in verse 9 have I not commanded you be strong and courageous. Why? Because strength and courage is what we need to, number one, receive this grace. And strength and courage is what we need to become this way. And so we come to the table and to the cross and to men and women for prayer.
