It is always great to be here. I think it's my third time up here and my millionth time in here, and it always feels like coming home whenever I enter into this place. I'd like to start today really right where Dave left off last week. And so if you watch 24, you know, every once in a while they have this sort of previously on 24. I'll give you a little update on the story that Dave told last week at the end of his message that might have left you kind of scratching your head a little bit. It did me. Maybe it made you cry. The story was about Jean Vanier, the mentor of Henry Nowen, actually. And Jean Vanier, well, he spent his life working with mentally and physically challenged adults, and he worked in this home with them in rural France. And this particular home got amenities from the government like running water and electricity that some of the rest of the neighborhood did not. And so one day Henry Nouwen was outside of this home and he got approached by a very angry man from the neighborhood. This guy was visibly upset. He came right up to Jean Vanier and he started to express his anger in very vocal ways. And so Vanier, feeling protective of his friends that were in the home and also sensing this guy's rage could think of nothing else to say other than, sir, would you like to hit me? Well, he got his answer really quick. This guy hauled off and cold cocked the 70-year-old man, knocked him down. Well, Vanier dusted himself off and stood back up, and as he was relaying the story, he said, the only thing I could think to tell him was, do you want to hit me again? Well, the rage and resentment turned to tears, and this angry man broke down and wept. And the cycle of violence was broken, at least in one man, at least for that day. Because Jean Vanier took the punch that absorbed the pain and stopped the cycle of violence. So, into that story I have a question. And my question is this, when does a little child who grows up to be a teenager, and then who grows up to be a man, when does that person learn that hitting is the only way to get what you need? what's behind that when does a person learn that the only way to get is by taking even violently and then conversely when does a child like jean vanier who grows up into a teenager and then into a man learn that only by taking a punch and absorbing the pain of another can the cycle of violence be stopped? When does that happen and what's behind that? Well, I'd like to share with you some wonderings that I have about that, but in order to do that, I need to tell you about this little problem I have with pizza. So every time I'm with a group of people and we order a piece of pizza, this is what happens. We quickly open up the box and then I do an immediate calculation of how many slices there are in the pizza. And I don't like it when they cut it into squares. It's got to be into the pie shapes. And then I divide that number by the amount of people that are going to consume said pizza. So if there are 10 slices of pizza and three people, then I conclude that there are three slices for each person. But then I know that once the pizza gets eaten, once the three slices each get eaten, there's going to be this awkward moment. That one lonely slice is going to be sitting there in the box amidst the grease spots and chunks of cheese. And every person in their mind, they're not going to say this out loud usually, but they're going to be trying to figure out why they deserve that last piece of pizza. I had a salad for lunch. I'm sure these guys had steak. my pieces were much smaller than theirs the cutter didn't cut right and sometimes someone will take the pizza slicer and they'll take that one little tiny slice that's left and they'll cut it in half and take that little sliver of pizza that they kind of fold up on each other and just eat it as one don't do that can we just commit to never doing that. Can we just say, be greedy, take the last slice, or leave it for someone else? Can we agree to that? Well, the reason why I do this quick math equation in my mind every time I order a piece of pizza is because somewhere along the line, as a child, or maybe as a teenager, or maybe as a man, I learned to believe in the law of scarcity. See, the law of scarcity says that there is never enough pieces of pizza in any box. So you need to make sure that you get enough for yourself. There's not enough of your time, parents, for you to fulfill your needs and to make sure the needs of the kids get met. So you need to medicate a little bit in order for you to get what you want. There's not enough promotions at work. So you need to bite and scratch and claw and do whatever it takes to take that last promotion. Maybe you're not a scratcher or a clawer. Maybe you're a hoarder. I remember when I was growing up, we were allowed two boxes of sugar cereal per year. I don't know why I remember this, but once on July 4th and once on December 27th. And I would eat that box of cereal in like two days. My sister would make hers last for like two months. And she would just have her little thimble of cereal and just taunt me with that. The law of scarcity says that you better knock someone down in order to get what's coming to you. or you better hoard what you already have, or someone will take it. See, in Dave's language, which I think is so brilliant, the law of scarcity leads us to take power over measures, to take what we want of a limited supply that's available. So if you're the older sibling, you can just take the piece of pizza because you're the biggest. And if you're a member of the ethnic majority, you can pass a law that says those kind of people can't sit in the front of the bus. The cycle of violence and of poverty and of sin in general, I think is rooted in a belief that the law of scarcity is the ruling law. And so you have to knock someone down in order to stay standing. And the rabbi that we've been studying these last weeks and months, he lived in a society where the law of scarcity was out of control. the economic system supported that if you were a fisherman like Peter, James and John every time you hauled your nets into the docks after a day's catch there would be a tax collector maybe even Matthew the tax collector sitting there at the end of the docks to take a percentage of your fish away to build the empire that was Rome and the religious systems believed in it as well when they had feasts They would line their tables with people who were following the law to the exact letter. And these systems were designed to keep people out who weren't following the law to the exact letter. Even the rabbinic system that Dave talked about in the earliest weeks of this series seemed to support it. That only the cream of the crop can become a Talmud or a disciple of the most popular rabbis. Well, Jesus, the rabbi that we've been looking at and asking the question, are we following, he wrecked the whole system. He did it by showing that the law of scarcity would bend and break under the force of a greater law. And so Jesus came with a different law. He came with the law of abundance. And Jesus demonstrated the law of abundance in so many different ways. But one of the best ways that he demonstrated this law is over meals. And the Eastern understanding of a meal is very different from our understanding of a meal. Because when we dig into a meal, it usually lasts about five or six minutes. Think Thanksgiving, if you disagree with me. And we just scarf it down as quickly as we can, and then we leave. In the Eastern tradition, meals were ways of sharing relationship and sharing yourselves with each other. So I'd like to look at four meals that Jesus shared with people that show his law of abundance. In the first meal, Jesus found himself surrounded by 4,000 men up on a mountainside, not counting women and children who were there. And no one had eaten, we read in the scriptures in this particular setting, for three days. So you can imagine there was crabby-ness up on this mountainside, right? Well, let's pick up the story in Matthew 15, verse 32. And you can read it up on the screens. I'll paraphrase it for you. Jesus called his disciples to himself and said, listen, these guys haven't eaten for three days. They're super crabby. Their stomachs are growling and I want to feed them because they'll collapse if they don't eat. So his disciples kind of said, well, Rabbi, where would we get enough bread? I mean, we're way up here in Elk River and there's no way that there's a place that would have enough food. So Jesus said, well, how many loaves do you have? and they scrounged up seven loaves and a few fish and so Jesus told the crowd to sit down and he took the seven loaves and the fish and he gave thanks and then he broke apart the bread and he passed it out and we read that people ate until they were satisfied and seven basketfuls of abundance were collected afterwards so Jesus takes the bread he gives thanks he breaks it and he passes it out and 4,000 men plus women and children were fed with seven loaves and a few small fish the law of abundance broke the back of the law of scarcity over this meal because Jesus could do anything with a loaf of bread in his hands amen right before the second meal Jesus and his disciples are in a very similar situation lots of people, no food. This time we read there's 5,000 men there plus women and children. And so this time, with a grin, I imagine he could barely hide behind his beard that maybe had a little smudge of hummus on it. I don't know. Jesus this time asked his disciples, how are we going to feed these guys? Where are we going to find enough bread for this many people? How many loaves do we have this time? so the disciples scrounged around and found this little kid who had five loaves and two fish and they said you know this is the food we have but it's not enough law of scarcity rearing its ugly head so Jesus went to work and we pick up the story in John chapter 6 verse 11 and Jesus then took the loaves and he gave thanks and he distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted he did the same with the fish and when they had enough to eat he told his disciples to gather the leftovers and you know the story twelve basketfuls of abundance were collected Jesus takes the bread he gives thanks he breaks it and passes it out and catch this he feeds more people with less food more people with less food. The law of scarcity was broken under the law of Jesus because he could do anything with a loaf of bread in his hands. Amen? Well, during the third meal, Jesus was celebrating the Passover with his closest friends. This was the night that he was betrayed and the night that he was eventually crucified. And this time, he only has one loaf of bread. And we read about this in 1 Corinthians 11, starting in verse 23, the last part of verse 23, says the Lord Jesus, on the night that he was betrayed, he took bread and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, this is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me. And in the same way, after supper, he took the cup saying, this cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me. For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, You proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. I don't know if you're noticing a pattern in these meals yet. But Jesus does the same thing. He takes the bread. He gives thanks. He breaks it and he passes it out. In the first meal he feeds 7,000. He feeds 4,000 people with seven loaves. In the second meal he feeds 5,000 people with five loaves. And so the question that is hovering over the table quite literally on this night is how many people can Jesus feed with just one loaf? Will the law of abundance be in effect here? Well, followers of the rabbi for over 2,000 years have waged everything on the fact that this rabbi can feed the entire world with just one loaf of bread because the law of abundance makes the law of scarcity submit to it because Jesus really could do anything with a loaf of bread in his hands. Now even as I say that, there's a thought that rumbles around in my mind that says that's theory and that's ritual, but it's really not enough. If there was, we wouldn't be reading about children dying every day all around the world. And we wouldn't be reading about the cycle of violence being more and more all over the world. There isn't enough. There doesn't seem to be enough. The law of scarcity really seems to be winning. The law of abundance maybe ended 2,000 years ago. And so let's not pretend that it's winning now. Can we get real for a second here? So into that thought, Jesus tiptoes into the fourth meal, this time incognito. We read in the scriptures that he's walking along the road, and there's two guys walking along to a place called Emmaus, and they're talking excitedly about the fact that maybe this rabbi that they had been following, just maybe the rumor had it that he had risen from the dead. But Jesus came and joined these guys, and for reasons that we don't have time to get into, they didn't recognize him. They didn't know it was him. They walked all the way to their house, and like good Torah observant Jews, they invited this stranger into their house for a meal. There's always room, one chair, for a guest on this meal in Jewish tradition. So he occupied it, And they gave him the honor of breaking bread, giving thanks. And when he did that, when the rabbi that had led them for three years broke bread and gave thanks and passed it out, something happened. Luke 24, 30, we read about it. When he was at the table, which has so much richness, when he was at the table, if you think about the sermons the last few weeks about who is at your table, when he was at the table with them, he took bread and he gave thanks and broke it and began to give it to them. And then their eyes were opened and they recognized him and then he disappeared from their sight. So when they saw him do, what he always did when there wasn't enough, give thanks, break bread, and pass it out, Suddenly, their belief became abundant. What they hadn't believed on the road to Emmaus, they suddenly believed at the table in Emmaus. And then Jesus, the rabbi, disappears from their sight. And all he left them with was a little piece of bread in their hands. Now, why did he disappear at this point? I think it's because Jesus was literally passing the torch to them. Because in their world and in ours, the law of scarcity seems to be winning. And the children are dying and the cycle of violence keeps on going. And so Jesus is calling a little group of followers, a little group of people that say we are committed to being who the rabbi was to his people, to the people that were around. When that little group of people commits to the law of abundance, to giving thanks for the bread that's in our hands, for breaking it apart and passing it out, then the law of abundance begins to win again. So how do you do that? How do you lean into that? I think we have to take the pattern bit by bit. First of all, we need to learn to give thanks for the bread that is in our hands, whatever it is. Now, if you're held captive to the law of scarcity, you're looking down at your hands and the bread that's there, and you're saying, honestly, there is not enough even for me. There's not enough pieces of pizza in this box. So if I give it out, there won't be enough. So how do you turn to thanking God for that bread that's in your hands if it doesn't seem like it's enough? Well, as usual, my wife Mary was really helpful in this regard. She's come to believe that it's when we have the courage to ask a bold question that we're led into the law of abundance. And the question is this, we need to have the discipline to ask, where is the gift that God might be bringing in this situation, no matter what it is? Where is the gift that God might be bringing? And this question is grounded in a belief that God actually is good and he actually is Savior. that even in the painful situations of life, we can look down into our hands and say, God, where is the gift in this? Not that God is bringing the painful situations, but that God might bring a good gift in the painful situation. Now, a woman you've probably never heard of, her name is Eti Hillesim. She understood this principle. She was a Jew who lived in the time of Nazi Germany during the Holocaust, and she died at age 29 in Auschwitz after spending her adult life trying to help fellow Jews make it through life in concentration camps. And this is a prayer that she recorded in her journals during her time in Auschwitz. You have made me so rich, oh God. Please let me share out of your beauty with open hands. My life has become an uninterrupted dialogue with you, oh God, one great dialogue. And sometimes when I stand in some corner of the camp, my feet planted on your earth, my eyes raised toward your heaven, tears sometimes run down my face, tears of deep emotion and gratitude. And at night when I lie in bed and rest in you, oh God, tears of gratitude run down my face and that is my prayer. That is written from a 29-year-old Jewish concentration camp person. I don't think you fake that. I don't think there's enough reserve in you if you're living her life to fake gratitude like that. The gift that she found in the midst of the pain was an ongoing and constant dialogue with her creator, her friend. I'm reminded of Colossians 2, 6, and 7. Paul writes this, So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him, rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, overflowing with thankfulness. And the word for thankfulness there is actually a Greek word. It's a compound word called eucharizomai, which means a good gift or a good grace. The U, that E-U means good, and charizomai comes from the word charis or grace. And it means a great gift. And I really believe that no matter what situation that we are in, we can look for God to bring a great gift, a great eucharizomai. Now if you haven't already made the connection, Eucharism is where we get our word Eucharist, which we tend to call communion or Lord's Supper. And people in churches all over the world, maybe all over the world even today, are gathering together to give thanks and break bread and pass it out. To remember the king of abundance who was the great Eucharism, the great grace or gift, and celebrate his life and his body that was broken and his blood that was passed out or poured out. Even Jesus, even Jesus, when he was going through one of the most painful experiences of his life, got a great gift when he was looking at the bread that was in his hands. When he was in the garden praying with his friends who were asleep, he was in great anguish and he received a gift from the Lord. In Luke 22, 41 through 43, we read, He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them and knelt down and prayed, Father, if you're willing, take this cup from me. Take this bread that is in my hand so that I won't have to hold it. Yet not my will, but yours be done. And here's the gift. An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. See, I think we're able to stand and absorb a blow and defeat the law of scarcity when we have the courage to find the Eucharismi as we look down at the bread in our hands, no matter what it is. This practice fuels our ability to live in the law of abundance. It fueled Jean Vanier. It fueled Eti Hillisum, and it can fuel you and I. It fueled Jesus, our rabbi. So we give thanks for the bread that is in our hands, no matter what it is, and then we have the courage to break it and pass it out. now Rob Bell who's the guy that Dave has referenced several times during this series he has a great thought around this concept he says that whenever someone receives a really good gift or a blessing it's because someone gave a really good gift or a blessing there is no good gift without someone giving a good gift and whenever someone gives a gift that's really a eucharism I there is a part of their body that is broken and a part of their blood that is poured out. And if we are called to be a Eucharist, because we are in the body of Christ, if we're called to have the courage to lean into the law of abundance and give thanks for the bread that is in our hands and break it and then pass it out, even if we don't know if there's enough for us, then there's a price that we need to pay. I have a 7th grade kid that I know that's in my church that gets this now he doesn't know the word Eucharizomai he doesn't have any language around the body and the blood and stuff like that but he gets this principle because he has a friend that's mentally challenged in 7th grade with him in this school in Edina and he invited this friend of his to this dance 7th grade dance and if you know anything about 7th grade dances they haven't changed a whole lot over the years. I mean, it's the same deal. One line of insecure, crazy males with too much cologne on, on one side of the room. And one side of beautiful but awkward looking seventh grade girls on the other side of the room and no one knows what to do. The only thing they want to make sure they don't do is to make an idiot of themselves. I mean, that is the number one goal. Just don't look stupid. Well, into this dance, this little 7th grade guy walks with this mentally challenged 7th grade girl on his arm. And with the strength and maturity that was way beyond his years, he goes right into the middle of the dance floor and starts dancing with her. And 7th graders, they'll follow suit. So pretty soon there was a big circle of dancers. You know how this works? One person gets thrown into the middle, and they do a little bit of their groove or whatever, and then they get pushed back out, and then someone else gets in the middle. Well, with utter abandon and joy, this mentally challenged girl goes into the middle, and I've got to be honest, if I was at this dance, this would be the moment where, what's going to happen now? But because of the strength and maturity of this 13-year-old kid, People just cheered her and celebrated her. This little seventh grader was a Eucharist, to this mentally challenged girl. The story doesn't end there. There's another dance that he wanted to take her to, not because he was romantically interested in her, but because she was his friend. But a thought came into his mind. He wanted to make sure that her dad knew that he was legit, that he wasn't trying to make fun of her or make her an object of ridicule at school. So he called up her dad and said, Sir, can I come over and just have a word with you? Went over to dad's house and explained to him that he was legit, that she was his friend. Well now, walk into the locker room the next day or down the hallways and listen to the snickers that are pointed toward this boy who now hangs out with this girl. And you realize that his body was broken and his blood was poured out. Now, if the Eucharist is only a ritual that we practice once a month in church where we celebrate the great gift and it's so important that we do that, but if it's only a ritual that we celebrate once a month, then we are missing a greater calling that the rabbi has on us. What if we understood that we are called to be what Jesus was when he was alive, right here in our reality, to be a great gift to people, a Eucharist. What if we understood our role as part of the body of Christ, that we would be broken and passed out. Paul writes this in 1 Corinthians 11, 23, right before the passage that I read earlier. He said, For I received from the Lord what I also passed out to you. Paul is calling us to be living rituals, living Eucharismites. Dave said this last week, the cross to which Jesus is calling his followers to join him in carrying is the primary way of fulfilling the purposes of God in the world. I believe that is really true. The cross to which Jesus is calling his followers to join him in carrying is the primary way of fulfilling the purposes of God in the world when we take up the cross and become a living ritual. And so the people in the time of Jesus, some of the people, in the words of Dave, simply didn't believe that this power underway had any chance of making what's wrong in the world right because they believed in the law of scarcity. But the law of abundance says when we have the courage to break the bread and pass it out. And the law of abundance wins and the kingdom comes. This can happen in little ways. I have a friend who has got a lot of money, but he went into noodles. He was thinking about these thoughts. Went into noodles for lunch one day with a friend, and after he had paid for his lunch, he handed the cashier his credit card and said, for the entire time that I'm sitting here having lunch, I want you to pay for every person's meal that comes in on this credit card. So he sat down and gobbled down his meal, and in five minutes, he got up. No, he didn't. He actually sat down and he shared a meal with his friend and at the end he got up and took his credit card and the receipt and put it back in his wallet and he told me, he said, you know, it's weird. I didn't feel the way I thought I would feel. I mean, it was really, I felt, I thought I would feel big. I didn't feel any different really. But the truth was he was breaking the back of the law of scarcity for strangers. And he'll never know the stories. A few weeks ago, when it snowed, I was thankfully out of town. My wife and I were on vacation, and I knew that my neighbor didn't have a snowblower, and you know how much snow came down. So I called my neighbor Charlie and said, dude, if you want to go into my garage, here's the code. Get my snowblower. Use it. That'd be great. I mean, do your driveway. Do the whole deal. And so he did that, and when I got home, I had noticed that he had done my driveway as well, which is actually the reason why I called him in the first place. Yeah, right? It wasn't much of a Eucharism to him, but he sure was to me when I got home at night and didn't have four feet of snow in my driveway. So if we're going to join Jesus in carrying the cross as the primary way of fulfilling the purposes of God in our world, if we're going to have the courage to give thanks for whatever bread that's in our hands, and then break it and pass it out, the question then becomes, how do you do this without being completely exhausted, totally cynical, or without getting a Messiah complex yourself? Well, Rob Bell said it this way, if it's all Christ through us and no Christ in us, we're headed for a train wreck. If it's all Christ through us and no Christ in us, we're headed for a train wreck. I think that is true. And the deal is, there is undoubtedly a price to be paid when we choose to be a Eucharist. We will get the snickers down the hallways. We will get the bloody noses from absorbing the punch. But there's a deeper price that we pay. How do we live this way and not become exhausted or cynical. Well, 2 Corinthians 4, 7 through 12, really, I think, helps us out a lot. I'd like to read it to you. Paul writes this, but we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. We are hard-pressed on every side, but not crushed, perplexed, but not in despair, persecuted, but not abandoned. I think there's a song in there somewhere. struck down but not destroyed. We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may be revealed in our body. For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body. so then death is at work in us but life is at work in you. The law of scarcity is at work in us but the law of abundance is at work in you. Amen? It helps to remember two things. If you're going to live a life where you follow the rabbi into carrying his cross and believing that that is the primary way for getting his work done here on the world there's two things you need to remember based on these verses. Number one, you are a jar of clay. You are not the source of the all-surpassing power. Now, at first, that sounds like this obvious statement. The biggest no-brainer in the world, right? You know, God's God, I'm not, blah, blah, blah. I mean, it becomes this language, right? But if you're going to lean into this thing, you really have to believe that and let that sink in because some of the reason why you and I are so exhausted is because we're convinced that we are the all-surpassing power. We're convinced that it is our job to produce life, not just carry life. Are you tracking with that? That is not our job. Our job is not to be the all-surpassing power. Our job is to carry the all-surpassing power in our cracked and broken nature. And so when you get cracked and broken, it is time to pull over and heal. I really believe part of why Jesus, we read, went away to lonely places so often is because even before he died, there was a lot of times where the body was broken and the blood was poured out and he needed his father to just strengthen him because he was a human being that needed strengthening. You are a jar of clay. You are not the all-surpassing power and at that, the collective room should go, ah. Number two, death is at work in us. The law of scarcity is at work amongst us but life is at work in you. The life of Jesus, who is the great Eucharist, is alive in you. And the life of Jesus is generative, which means that he can make something happen in you which you cannot. He can make something happen in you which was not there before. Jesus in you means that you are not dying. You're becoming more and more alive with every breath, with every step carrying the cross toward the rabbi. Here's the paradox. Even as your physical body is dying, you are becoming more and more alive as you follow Jesus in this world. The call of the rabbi is one that leads us and others by the way of death. There can be no law of abundance without death. so in his way we shouldn't be surprised when he calls us with those words follow me we shouldn't be surprised that there is a price to be paid so the last question is this what kind of person would allow herself to be broken and passed out to absorb the pain of another What is behind that? What kind of person who grows up as a child and then into a teenager and then into a man or a woman would have the courage to look down at the bread that's in their hand, no matter what it is, to give thanks for the gift and then to break it and pass it out and be a Eucharist to the world? The only kind of person that would do that is someone that has met the rabbi and knows that he's good. And all the rabbi says to you, the only criteria for being around his table is do you want to follow me? Ahachari. Do you want to follow me? Let's pray. Jesus there are some of us who are sitting in our seats right now feeling like we're asking the question have I met that rabbi? have I sat down so to speak to dinner with that rabbi and looked in his eyes and seen the love that he has for me have I have I met that rabbi? I think I would follow him if I had met him but I don't know if I have. Jesus, the only way that ever happens is by a movement of your spirit and so right now for people who haven't been to church in years and for people who have been to church who have been to church in years I pray for a movement of your spirit and a picture of an empty chair sitting at your table with their name on it. That they would look into your eyes. That we would look into your eyes and see a rabbi who has enough bread. Whose body was broken. Whose blood was poured out for us. That even in this moment we would meet you. and call you our rabbi knowing that there is no degree we need to do that. There is no amount of good things that we can do to earn that. There's no amount of bad things that we should have not done or if we did do them would disqualify us from the place at the table. Jesus, you are calling us to the table and some of us are meeting you there for the first time. Thank you, Jesus. others of us are so exhausted from being a Eucharist and we need a supernatural filling from your spirit to put the body back together and to pour the blood back in Jesus for those of us who are there invite us to your table where you anoint our head with oil and where your cup runs over with goodness and healing for us. Jesus, your cross is not a ritual. It's an event that you, it's an event that you went through and you became the great Eucharism, and now you call us with you in us, you as the life, you as the source, to follow you so that you can accomplish your purposes in Maple Grove and around the world. And to that call, we say yes. Yes. Yes. In your name, amen. Amen.
