Let's open with a word of prayer. Are you recording this now? Hello, tape people. Join us in a word of prayer. Lord, thank you for this class and the people that are here and their desire to know you. That desire, Lord, is itself a gift from you. None of us would be seeking after you the way we do, to know you more perfectly with our minds and to love you more perfectly with our hearts. We wouldn't have that unless you gave that ability to us. You're the one who opens up our hearts. You're the one who melts away the callousness of sin. And therefore we owe even our desire for you. We owe that to you. And we thank you for it. We pray, Lord, that you'd make this class, like this entire course, A stepping stone that would further our love for you and our appreciation of you and our understanding of you, Lord. Be working in our hearts even as we're talking here. And help us to have a freedom and an openness like we had last week, to ask questions that are gutsy, that come from our heart, to dialogue with one another, Lord, and free us from thinking that we always need to agree because we don't. There's room in your body for even a diversity of opinions on things. So help us to be free to ask questions openly and to disagree openly and to celebrate what we have in common, Lord. Let your spirit rest upon this classroom this evening, we pray in your name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Okay, last week, we're talking about the attributes of God. And let's see where we are in my little notebook here. Hello. And as I recall, we were just talking about the love of God. Let's just review this. We saw last week that God is, of course, eternal. Would you shut off one of those lights? Yeah, it helps a little bit, doesn't it? that God is eternal, always has been, always will be. God is omnipresent. Wherever you are, God is. And that means whatever state you're in, God is there. Though you make your bed in Sheol, the psalmist says, yeah, God is with you. God is omnipotent. God is all-powerful. God is sovereign. And we discussed there the two different ways of understanding that, the two most fundamental ways of understanding that, the one being the Calvinist tradition, which understands God's sovereignty, to mean that God is in control of all events and that all events that happen are in one way or another, directly or indirectly, an aspect of God's will. The other perspective is the Arminian perspective, which says that God has all power, but delegates some of that to creatures who are free and therefore have some decision-making power on their own. And that means that God doesn't always get his way. Though the fact that he doesn't always get his way is part of his way. So he is indirectly getting his way. He wills above all else that this would be a creation where love is possible. This is the Arminian perspective now. And therefore, willing that love is the highest of the goals he's shooting for, he wills that there would be creatures who can make decisions, who can freely choose that, which entails that they can choose the opposite. And that's where the problem of evil comes from. It's not that God's hands are tied, as though there is some kind of power outside of God that binds God. God's all-powerful. But it's that God, by his own decision, by his own will, limits himself. And so he doesn't intervene as often as he might because he doesn't want a creation of robots. One more word about that. Last week when we were talking about that, some of you brought up some points and asked some good questions relative to that. And I think a lot of times when people ask questions and they begin to flush out stuff, that's where the best learning takes place. And a great deal of what was said last week wasn't, I hadn't planned on saying, and it was precisely that unplanned element that seemed to resonate with most of you. So that's why it's always good to be asking questions. Be thinking questions. be thinking absorption. I have to absorb this. Be thinking questions. What is left unanswered here? And that usually helps flesh out a lot of stuff. Teachers love questions. At least they should love questions. And so be thinking about questions to ask, even as I'm going through this. What stuff haven't I covered? What is left unanswered? Okay, and then we talked about God being loving. God's very nature is loving. His very being is loving. 1 John says that God is love. And there are two real monumental events which show God's love. The first is creation. Love is giving substance to another, giving worth to another. You love someone when you don't relate to them from what you can get from them, but when you relate in terms of what you can give them. Love is, in its purest sense, unconditional. God in creating us shows forth the fact that he's a loving God. He doesn't create us because of what we can do, because we don't exist before he creates us. He just gives us life. He gives us existence, and that itself is an act of love. The proof that God loves you is that God created you. So if you're ever wondering about whether God loves you or not, ask yourself the question, do you exist? The second way in which God shows forth his love, He shows forth His love in a lot of different ways, but the second fundamental way in which God shows forth His love is in salvation, in redemption, which is really a new creation. The Bible says we are new creatures in Christ Jesus. We are made anew. He created us the first time, but being part of the fallen race, we've fallen from grace, we've fallen into sin. And in terms of our relationship with God, on our own, we're unable to make ourselves compatible with God. So God, unilaterally now, unconditionally, gives us new life. He creates in us a new heart, creates in us a mind that quests after God, puts in us a desire for God. And that, again, is an act of love. He does it not because of what we are, but usually in spite of what we are. He does it because He loves us. Do we cover God's justice? Okay, this is where we were. God isn't just loving. He's also just. In fact, I think maybe it's a mistake to separate these two attributes too much because His justice is a part of His love. God is perfectly just. It's a part of His character. It's a part of His holiness. It's a part of who He is. There's no injustice, impropriety in God. There's no bias in God, no prejudice in God. God is perfectly just. That means that his decisions are always the right decisions to make, whether we can see that from our perspective or not. God always makes just decisions. It also means that God can't equivocate on a stance against sin. Sometimes we are inclined to interpret love as being a person's willingness to overlook faults, A person's willingness to forego things and to look the other way and say, ah, don't worry about it. But see, God is loving, but God is also just, which means he doesn't ignore the reality of where we're at. He can't just decide to ignore sin. He can't just forgive and forget kind of a thing. His character, his very essence is holiness. His very essence is justice. And so the sin question has to be dealt with. Sometimes the way God's justice is shown throughout Scripture is pretty mysterious. And we only see a small slice of the pie. We don't know what goes on in the entire background of heaven, which goes into making his decisions. Was it just that he would send the flood, for example? Was it just that the Israelites would slaughter all the Canaanites? It has to be, because God is just. Though from our limited perspective, we don't really, I don't think, see that very clearly. But whatever God does, it is just, whether we can discern that or not. The significance of that, I think, is this. And this is what the significance is for me. It means that my moral intuition, your moral intuition about right and wrong, has a basis in the creation. This world is screwed up, and you see a lot of unfairness in this world. There's no fairness in this world, is there? Little kids get killed. Little kids get raped. It's just an unjust world. And what this attribute of God tells me is that there'll come a time when right will be made right and wrong will be shown to be wrong. there is going to be a final time of reckoning. This is what's called the final judgment. And it's not bad news. For the Christian, anyways, it's not bad news. It simply means that God's going to vindicate himself. He'll show forth his justice. And in this time of waiting to that period, we have to tolerate all this injustice. We do what we can do about it, but we can't ever completely make the world a just place. It's in a fallen condition. It's under siege by the enemy. But there's coming a time, because of God's justice, where things are going to be made right. Where finally those that should be punished will be punished. Those that should be vindicated will be vindicated. I told you last week a little bit about my personal struggle with the suffering of children. That's always been a major struggle of mine. And it has to do with my own issues as a kid. When I see kids suffer, I always ask the question, where is God? Why doesn't God do something? Why doesn't God intervene? Why doesn't He rectify the situation? I told you last week one instance how the Lord came to me and won my trust in Him in a particular situation with my daughter. There was another time where I was just wrestling with this. It had to do with when Jacob Wetterling was kidnapped. And I again was just wrestling with the Lord about these kind of issues. And, you know, God, show forth your justice or whatever. Why do these children suffer? Why is there this crying? You know, and I, you know, for me, when a kid gets kidnapped or something or when this little girl, this eight-year-old girl was abducted and then raped or whatever, you know, I hear a voice crying out. You know, like, I mean, it's like crying out for mom, crying out for dad, and it goes unanswered and it just kills me. I don't know how I'd stay sane if any of my kids were ever kidnapped because I know every night I'd be hearing them calling for me. They would just kill me. And what the Lord told me at one point was about the suffering of children is that he's going to make it up to those kids. He's going to make it up to those kids. There's coming a time, the Bible says in Romans 8, Paul says that the present sufferings of this age aren't worthy to be compared to the glory which God has in store for those who love him. And I don't know how that's going to all work out. I don't know how literal to take that. I don't know how that's all going to work out, but I do know that when all is said and done, everything's going to be perfectly just. Those jolly characters, what's his name? Something jolly. What a misnomer. But the guy who abducted this gal. Whatever punishment he deserves, he's going to get. And only God knows that. Because only God knows to what degree that was a morally responsible decision he made or to what degree he's sick. But in the end, the scales are going to be balanced. We have, I think, inside of us, unless you're severely damaged from circumstances in your life, if you're healthy, you have a sense of right and wrong. And that's what gives grounding to your outrage at the way things are in this universe. I think it's very appropriate in this world to get really ticked off at the way things are. And there's something in it that says justice must be due. Justice must be due. And what we learn, I think, from Scripture and from the character of God is that justice will be done. And that's the time of the final judgment. Yes. You know, if a person becomes a Christian, and it's a genuine thing, not just to cut down your prison time, but it's a genuine thing, a genuine conversion, justice is still done. And we'll talk about that maybe even at the end of tonight, but it's done on the cross. Justice is always done. But when a person becomes a Christian, those sins are punished, but they're punished on the cross. So sin is actually punished, but you're not the one who pays for it. Christ has paid for it. So in that case, yes, our sense of moral outrage still is appropriate, and it was expressed on the cross. So the person, because of their regeneration, is now cleansed and forgiven by that. For the little kid, I don't know what to say about that except that God's going to make it up to her or him. That somehow the reward of heaven is going to be so great that the sufferings of this world, the nightmare of this world, will be inconsequential in comparison. Does that address the question? Okay, the question is, and we're doing this for the people on the tape, the question is, what of the rapist or the killer, maybe even this person, Jolly, whatever his name was. What was his name? His last name was Jolly. Yeah, I don't know what his first name was. Mr. Jolly. What about if he himself was severely battered and abused and stuff like that, and so he was not responsible for what he did? Only God knows how to distribute responsibility in an equitable manner. We never know the psyche of a person. We want to just, I mean, there's a part of me that just looks at this job. I would like to personally kill him. I mean, frankly, isn't that loving? But I'm just talking honestly. I would, you know, and if I ever caught the abductor of Jacob Wetterling, I don't. I want to focus the responsibility. I want to pinpoint it on that person. And I think legally we have to do that. We have no option but to do that. You've got to stop the cycle of sickness somewhere. But in terms of what kind of eternal punishment is due him, only God can decide that because only God knows the degree to which he was responsible, the degree to which he utilized the gift of free will towards this evil person. So God knows the extent to which what he did was an inevitable outcome of his upbringing and genes and whatever, and the degree to which it was a free act of his. We can never know that. That's why we can't be the ones to be in a position to say, I really believe that in the end, every sin that a person commits is in some ways a social sin. The idea of individual responsibility, there's always influences that went into making that person the person they are. And so in the end, the society, or at least certain persons in the society, bear some of the responsibility for who this person is. But only God can, in the end, filter all that out. Yes. I think there is. I think that's what the Bible means by the unforgivable sin. There is a point of no return. It's every, not every culture, but almost all cultures have understood this. The ancient Greeks understood this. A person can, through a process of decision making, form their character to such an extent that it's utterly unrepairable. Every decision you make solidifies the direction you're going. And I think the clearest example of the unforgivable sin is found in Romans 1, where the Romans, through repeated free choices that they made to worship the creature more than the creator, to pursue a lifestyle that was utterly in contradiction to the Holy Spirit, who was moving in their life to convict them against this, but they shut it down so much that there came a time where God gave them up. It says God gave them over to do whatever they wanted. God gave them up. And I think that's a sin against the Holy Spirit. When you resist the Holy Spirit to such a degree that you become so good at it that he has utterly no impact on your life anymore. You become so calloused that you are hopeless. And so my answer to your question is, is there a point of no return for human beings? I think that there is. Now, with Jephardt Dahmer, only God can decide to what degree. I mean, it could very well be that at a young age, he started making decisions about inflicting pain on animals and inflicting pain on people that were free decisions. and by the time he was 25, it may be that he was so ingrained in that character that at that point, he was gone. And now what he does, whereas once this behavior would have been kind of convicting even to him, after a while, you just do it and it doesn't even bother you. That's the way it frequently is with people. I've known several individuals who were involved in various forms of sexual addiction. And things at first would make them feel kind of convicted and guilty. But in time, that guilt goes away. And then they graduate to new things and more jaded things. And after 10 years or so or 20 years or so, they sink to a level they never would have dreamed of earlier. But it all kind of comes naturally. Through little decisions we make, we're always forming our character. And the longer we go, it's like rain running down a hill. The longer it runs down in a certain pattern, the more likely it is that it will ever change that pattern. The grooves become very deep. In time, they lose their sense of right and wrong, and then they become animals is what really happens. You had a question with a just war. Boy, that's a good question. Yeah. Well, you know, the only just wars that we can be sure of are the ones that God himself declares. And there he has in mind a whole, you know, like for example, his war on the Canaanites. He declared war on the Canaanites and used the Israelites to do that. But there the interest is not a national interest or it's not a piece of property. It's the salvation of the whole world. But the principle involved there is one where you tolerate a lesser evil. It isn't evil to kill people, but you do it because it's necessary for a greater good. The question is, can you abstract that principle and apply it to national interests? Where it's terrible to kill people, but if you don't do this, then greater harm will come. A classic example would be Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a Christian who really had pacifist inclinations. He really was against violence of any sort. But he, seeing how Hitler had risen to power and what he was doing to the Jews and the potential that Hitler had for world domination, he decided that as bad as it is to ever kill, Hitler had to die for the sake of others. And so he tried to assassinate Hitler, or he was involved in a plan to assassinate Hitler, which finally got him in prison and finally got him executed. But it's sort of like this. If Mark here is in a tower shooting everybody, if I let him go, don't I share some of the responsibility for their deaths? So isn't it a better sacrifice to kill him and spare the lives of other people? That would be a just war policy. Okay, again, you don't have to agree with that, but that's the thinking, this whole just war deal is having a lesser evil for a greater good. You're right, Hitler's a pretty clear-cut case, and so would Mark be shooting from a tower, But the trouble is, and this gets too much into politics for me, so I'm not going to get into it, but whenever you have one nation declaring war against another, there's a lot of ungodly motives. We're very selective on where we declare war. When the Cambodians were being slaughtered by the Khmer Rouge, we didn't lift a finger, because they don't own any oil. So there's a lot of issues like that going on. And it may be that in terms of national interests, there is no just war. But that's a real debatable issue. Yes? Yeah, I think I'd be inclined to agree with you. There the question again would be, to what degree is their sociopathic dysfunction the result of their own free will, or to what degree was it inflicted on them? And it may be that beneath all of their sociopathic dysfunctions, there is a heart that is actually open to God, that actually responds to the Holy Spirit, even though it's very concealed by all of their sociopathic behavior. And if there is a glimmer of hope there in opening, it could actually be that God could go into that person and regenerate them. Though they would have to still go through a lot of treatment to start getting their brain to follow up their regenerate heart. I don't know. I don't want to write. That seems very improbable, but God can do the improbable. Though I've never seen a sociopathic person saved. Okay, another question. Mark. Okay, that's a good point. What exactly you did, I mean, we all indirectly, at least, actually directly, crucified Christ. And so, I mean, that's true about all of us. We see the consequences of our own sin on the cross of Calvary. Now, what exactly your brand of sin was is pretty inconsequential. And it is more sensational to talk about child molesters and rapists or whatever. But if they are redeemable, Christ can redeem them. I mean, that's kind of a tautology. The question is, is a Jeffrey Dalmer redeemable? And we can't know whether he is or not, so we have to preach to him. And if he converts, if he gives his heart to the Lord, accept that. Though I still think in social terms, I think he should be a Christian in prison the rest of his life because there's still social consequences to what he did. But it may be that his heart would be open. That would just be a glorified God that he could reach a person like that. But it also may be that he's not open to it, that he has solidified himself in a course of self-destruction that is irreversible. It's kind of an awesome thing, that there is at least possibly a point of no return. What's really important for us also to keep in mind is that you can never know that about another person. And I'm not sure another person can know that about themselves, except for the fact that they wouldn't care any longer. There's just been so much abuse inflicted on people with the idea that they've committed the unforgivable sin. I've got a relative who's been in and out of institutions since she was 14 because a minister told her that she had committed the unforgivable sin because she said, God damn you, Holy Spirit, in a moment of anger. And then she all of a sudden felt like, oh, I've committed the unforgivable sin. Went to the pastor. The pastor said, righto, there's no hope for you now. And that cracked her up. If you really believed that you were going to hell, that would probably crack you up. And she's been in and out of institutions. She's now 40 years old. and that's abuse. Okay, we'll take one more question and then we'll move on. Oh, comment, that's fine. Right, okay, I think maybe the point you're getting at is this. When harm is done to other people, even if you're forgiven and okay with God and you come to the Lord, there are still consequences of that. We wish it could just be that God could reverse time and make all the wrongs right. But there are still consequences of that. You know, if you do drugs, you damage your brain. And unless God heals your brain, even when you get saved, your brain is going to be damaged. There's this physical and social and emotional and psychological and spiritual consequences to the things we do. God can forgive us. We can be okay with God. But that doesn't mean that society has to take God's perspective. I think society can't. there's still going to be consequences for that. Okay, let's then finally wrap this up with talking about God's graciousness. And we've already touched on that. God is gracious, and the bottom line meaning of this is simply that His love absorbs His justice. When a person accepts the gift of salvation, His love absorbs His justice, and He can do that in self-consistency because of the cross. on the cross what we see is God's love absorbing his justice not ignoring his justice he couldn't do that and and and and still be God but he rather pays the price that his justice demands God is God he can't be other than God and that means God is love and that means God is just and both of those are true about God. So how does he save a fallen race? How does he make himself, who by nature can't have any relationship with sin, compatible with people who are sinners? He does it by paying the price of that sin, the consequences of that sin, by fulfilling his own justice for the sake of his love. It's not that his love wins out as though it were some kind of contest, but rather his love absorbs his justice. And the significance of that is what we've already been talking about. That means that no matter who you are, no matter what you've done, no matter what hideous thing you've ever committed, it can be rendered irrelevant in terms of your relationship with God, but maybe not socially, but irrelevant in terms of your relationship with God when you cling to the cross as the only thing that can ever make you right with God. And as Mark said, sometimes it's the people who have, In fact, I think frequently, if not most often, it is the people who have done the most outlandish sins that are aware of that and are more likely to cling to the cross because they know they have no other hope. Whereas people who are pretty content with their own righteousness are less inclined to do that. Okay, I want to move on now and talk about the Trinity. We're talking about basic Christian beliefs. We've talked about the belief in the Bible as inspired. We've talked about the belief in God and the various attributes that the Bible gives to God. And now we're going to talk about another fundamental basic belief of Orthodox Evangelical Christendom, and that is the belief in the Trinity. This has been a belief historically and still today that is a matter of quite a bit of controversy. It's one of the first things that unorthodox groups reject, that heretical groups reject. And usually a good indication that a group is off is whether or not they accept this doctrine. Because when you reject this doctrine, a lot of other things get screwed up, as we'll show shortly. But let me just lay the groundwork for a belief in the Trinity and the significance of it, and then let's talk about it. Write down whatever questions you have, and we'll flesh this out. and we'll have all the answers. The biblical basis, just kidding, the biblical basis for the doctrine of the Trinity. The word Trinity is not found in the Bible. You probably all know that. That's a fact that a lot of groups, unorthodox groups like to point out. Where's the word Trinity found in the Bible? It's not found in the Bible. But that's not to say that it's not a biblical doctrine. The incarnation is never found in the Bible. But that is a biblical doctrine. It's a way of saying what the Bible says. Let's review the biblical basis. The basis is basically this. The Bible is very clear that the Father is God. Throughout the Bible, God the Father. No one disputes that. The Father is God. At least the Father is one of the titles of God, showing God's paternal care. but it's also the case that the Bible portrays and we're going to examine this in much more detail in a little bit so I don't want to take time to defend this point right now but the Bible makes it clear that the Son is God Jesus Christ is God the Father is God, God the Father but it also makes it very clear that Jesus Christ is God it doesn't stop to ask the question how is that possible, it just proclaims it that the Word was God and the Word became flesh Jesus Christ is the Word in flesh Jesus Christ is fully God and also makes clear that the Spirit is God and you find this all over the place in the New Testament though there are some who try to do gymnastics and deny it but in Acts 5 for example Peter is confronting Ananias and Sapphira and if you look at the way he talks about what they did he says interchangeably you've sinned against God or you've sinned against the Holy Spirit he assumes that the Holy Spirit is God in fact if you look at the way the Holy Spirit is treated throughout the Bible, both in the Old Testament and the New Testament, he's used interchangeably with God. The Holy Spirit dwells in you, God dwells in you. God moved, the Holy Spirit moved. The two are used very interchangeably. Very interchangeably, is that a word? I think so. If you read John 14-16, Jesus Christ makes it very clear that when he leaves, he'll send the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit's going to dwell among them, and the Holy Spirit is personal, Because the Holy Spirit will teach them and lead them and guide them and convict them, do all these personal things. So you have three facts in the Bible that you have to hold together. The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God. There's another fact you have to hold together, and that is that there's only one God. Oh, I thought I had it down. Now you screwed me up. Unequivocally, the Bible proclaims that there's only one God. Here, O Israel, the Lord our God is one God. It's a predominant theme in the Old Testament, and it's carried over into the New Testament. No Jew would ever consider the possibility of there being more than one God. There is only one God. And yet the Bible clearly portrays that the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God. This is the data that the Bible proclaims. And the question is, what do we do with it? Yes. Okay, the question is when in the, I'm doing this for the tape people again, when the Bible says that the Lord our God is one God and you shall have no other gods before me because the Lord is a jealous God, does that imply that there are other gods? Two points to note about that. There certainly are other gods. We have them all the time. For us, in our culture, it's usually houses and cars and looks and sex appeal. Those are gods. They feed us. They give us life. They are our reason for being. Whatever is your reason for being is your God. And our struggle is to be freed from those gods. In ancient cultures, they were more mythological deities. You know, the god of this nation, the god of that nation, the god of this temple, or what have you. And so whether the person writing that really believed there were these other gods or not is really inconsequential. They were gods to the people. In the same way that my house isn't literally a god, but it could be a god to me. Not my house, but maybe some house that you have. It would be hard to make my house a god. or some ability that you have. But it's not really a God. And so also, these religious ideas that people had, the Bible's not necessarily saying that they really did exist, but they certainly existed in the minds of the people. So what do we do about this? Here's what the Nicene Creed says. The Nicene Creed was a creed that was formulated in the year 325, and it really is the summation of what the church believed. There were people at this time who were saying that Jesus wasn't divine, that if you have the Father God, the Son God, and the Holy Spirit God, you have three gods, and so two of them got to go. And so there were people who said that Jesus can't be God and that the Holy Spirit can't be God. The church said, no, no, no, no, no, because the Bible clearly says that each one is God, and yet there's only one God. So what do we do about this? Well, the Council of Nicaea, the church formulated this creed, And this isn't the birth of the doctrine of the Trinity. A belief that the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God had been around from the beginning. You find that in the Bible and it had been carried on through. But no one sat down to try to defend that against people who were denying it. So this is the church's first defense. And what it basically says is this. How can you have these three being one God? The Nicene Creed basically says, in contemporary terminology, that we believe there's one God who exists in three different ways. there's one God who exists in three different ways the word they use is hypostasis which really means a way of existing or some real thing the contemporary Trinitarian creeds modern Trinitarian creeds say we believe there's one God in three persons and that's okay but the word person can lead people astray in modern times it has much when we think of a person we think of an individual body an individual mind, an individual soul, an individual will. And the early creed didn't want to imply that at all. It just said there's one God who can exist in three different ways. And that's still mysterious. But it's not as apparently contradictory as saying that there's one God who exists in three people. And that's the image that some people have. But there's one God who exists in three different ways. The three different ways are basically this. God exists as transcendent. That means God is up there. This is what we refer to as God the Father. A lot of times the Bible just says God. It sometimes says God, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. And by God it means God's way of existing in and of himself. God is infinite. God is invisible. And this is the first way that God exists as God. This is also, I think, the way that God exists and that it's referred to when the Bible says that no one has seen God at any time. No one's seen God at any time. But then it also says that, you know, Jesus says, if you see me, you see the Father. What gives here? Is there a contradiction? Well, I don't think so. I think what the Bible's saying is that in one way that God exists, his way of, you know, his bigness, no one's ever seen that. No one can even comprehend that. God, in terms of his bigness, no one's ever seen at any time. But God, in terms of His incarnateness, we have seen. And this is the second way that God exists as God. God isn't only big, He becomes a human being. God exists as the man, Jesus Christ. The bigness of God, the transcendence of God, God the Father, is revealed in the incarnate way that God exists as God. now here's the mystery the mystery is this he does this at the same time he doesn't stop being father when he becomes son he's still infinite he fills the expanse of space he's still his father but he's revealed now as son and in fact the bible says he fully exists as son God is fully incarnate in the man Jesus Christ the word really becomes made flesh but at the same time that doesn't exhaust who God is. It's just another way that God exists as God. And in fact, there's a third way that God exists and this is what I call imminent. God exists within us. He's imminent or inside us. He's working in the church. He's working in the world. And this is what we call the Spirit or the Spirit of Christ. This is what the Bible calls the Spirit. As incarnate, God, the incarnateness of God is referred to when it talks about the Son of God, or Jesus Christ being the image of God, Jesus Christ being the form of God, Philippians 2, Jesus Christ being the expression of God, Hebrews 1. All those things are saying that God in His second way of existing is revealed. Finitized, you might say. Finitized, rendered finite. But God in His third way of existing exists within us. And this is what the Bible proclaims. God is up there, God is in Jesus Christ, and God is in me. And God's in the church, and God's working in the world. A third way that God exists as God, and that's what the Bible primarily refers to as the Spirit. Now, this isn't laid out in some kind of formula in the Bible. It's fairly informal language. But if you look at the way they speak about the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, this is generally the way they speak. God's fatherhood is sort of his up-there-ness, his authority, his power. God the Son is Jesus Christ incarnate, the place where God is revealed, the place where God becomes rendered finite. And the Holy Spirit is usually referred to as the one who works in the church, the one who works within us. One God, only one God, who exists in three different ways. And He exists fully in three different ways. It's not that He's divided up into, like a pie divided up into thirds. He exists fully as Father, fully as Son, and fully as Holy Spirit. Okay, some points to note about this. And then we'll open this up for, well, now I want to talk about the significance of it. Okay, some points to note about this. Conceptions that you want to avoid. This doctrine really isn't, it was never proposed to be sort of a mathematical puzzle. If you spend your time worrying about how three can be one and how one can be three, you're missing the point. The point has nothing to do with a mathematical puzzle. It simply states the different ways that God has gotten. It's very significant for our life, as we're going to see shortly. But it wasn't meant to be a mathematical puzzle, and thinking that it is has brought about a lot of misconceptions. The first one is that God is not a committee. Sometimes people have a view of God. Trinitarians have a view of God, where they picture three people up in heaven sort of sitting around in chairs, And they kind of vote on what they're supposed to do. Who will go down and save the race? Well, let's draw straws. Or it's sort of a committee, a society. We have three individual people up there. Sometimes this comes out in literature. Jimmy Swigert wrote an article on the Trinity, in his The Evangelist, some years ago, about 10 years ago, I guess, in which he said that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, when somebody asked, explain to me the doctrine of the Trinity, He says, well, liberal theologians would call it a mystery, but it's really no mystery at all. God is three in just the same way that three people are three. The Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit all have individual, what he called spiritual bodies. They all have individual minds. They all have individual wills. And they decide among themselves. And God is one in just the same way that three people would be one, but perfectly so. They could be one in agreement, one in love, And that's the way that God is one. Well, Jimmy Swagger, he believes he's being an Orthodox Christian when he says that. There's a new book out by Benny Henn, is it? Called Good Morning, Holy Spirit. He says the exact same thing. Drives me nuts. Where each one has a spiritual body. Now, there's none of that in Scripture that I can see. But the question is, if three people are three people, and God is three in just that same sense, how do we not have three gods? We just have them all agreeing together. But it still is tritheism, and though Jimmy Swigert thinks he's being orthodox, he would have been burned at the stake in the 14th century. People were burned at the stake in the 14th century for saying stuff like that. That's what's called tritheism. Tri meaning three, theism meaning God. So it's a belief in three gods. God is not a committee. There's one God who exists in three different ways. Now, this doesn't solve all the issues about how is it that the father loves the son, the son loves the father, or how is it that the son comes to do the will of the father. There's still a lot of questions involved in that. Maybe we can get to them. But whatever else happens, we must keep in our minds that God is one God. We don't believe in three gods. It's not a committee. As though God could ever disagree with himself. You see, if you say you have three wills, that means that there's at least the potential for disagreement. Or if you say they have three minds, that means that they're not omniscient. They'd have to communicate with one another. God is not divisible. One of the most common things that I have to run into when I talk to Bethel students is that they refer to the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit as being the three parts of God. And, you know, I'm not going to burn them at the stake for that, but it really is the wrong way of talking. God is not divisible. To suggest that God is divisible is to suggest that God is corporeal or physical. Because physical stuff you can cut up. But God is indivisible. You can't, you know, wherever God is, all of God is. And the church made this very clear in its Nicene Creed, and also in its Chalcedonian Creed, that God is fully Father, God is fully Son, and God is fully Holy Spirit, all at the same time. If that causes your brain to go, it's because you're thinking in quantitative terms. You think like a jar of water, and you say the water's fully here, fully there, fully over there. Or fully steam, fully ice, fully liquid. I'm a physicist here. But all those analogies, whatever other value they might have, they all deal with something that can be quanticized. And physical things can all be quanticized. And we think in physical terms, so we naturally think that God can be thought of in quantitative categories. But God's not a quantity. As though you could have a little bit of God and then five ounces of God, six ounces of God. Sometimes Christians speak that way. You need more of the Holy Spirit. I only got a drop and need a bucket. What is it? God can't be divided like that. God is not a quantity. Maybe the best analogy comes from physics when they talk about energy. Energy has a lot of paradoxical qualities to it, and they have to talk about it in ways that really defy a quantitative interpretation. For example, light. Physicists talk about light being a wave and light being a particle. And you can prove both mathematically. But if there's anything they know, it's that particles are not waves, and waves are not particles. But light, whatever light turns out to be, it manifests both qualities. And it's not that part of light is particle and part of light is wave-like. All of light is particle-like and all of light is wave-like, depending on the circumstances in which you view it. So also, all of God is Father. When you think of the Father, you see all of God. All of God is Son. Jesus Christ, the Bible says, Colossians 2.9, the fullness of the Godhead dwells in him bodily. All of God is Holy Spirit. You've got God Almighty dwelling within you, if you're a believer. And all of God's attributes and character are dwelling within you. In a way, that's different than they dwell in Jesus Christ, because you're not God, and he was. Minor difference. But God is not divisible. Thank you.
