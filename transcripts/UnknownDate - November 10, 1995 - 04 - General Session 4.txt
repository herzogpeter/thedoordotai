I'm going to be talking about characteristics of spiritual abusive places, churches, organizations, families, characteristics of spiritual abusive places, and Dave did that last night in terms of talking about false spiritual leadership. And I think the way that our material fits together, I know this is very much better, is that in terms of this package on spiritual abuse, I think that what I talk about is maybe a little more practical in terms of my information puts legs on this stuff, So he put the teeth in the teaching about the characteristics last night when he talked from Massive 23, so I'm going to talk about moving it along in terms of some practical things that we've noticed, what spiritual abusive systems look like. So there's seven characteristics that I'm going to tell you about. And the first characteristic, and actually it breaks down into four and then three. The first four characteristics are dynamics that happen in spiritually abusive places that make it hurtful to be there. And then the last three are dynamics that happen in spiritually abusive places that make it hard to leave when you are there. And that's how it breaks down. The first is what we call power posturing. power posturing. Now, the teaching that Dave did on this was called, and I don't even know if he got into this a lot, because I think he was going to let me explain this a little bit more, but when he talked about they've seated themselves in the chair of Moses, the issue with seating themselves in the chair of Moses is that there is such a thing in that thinking as the chair of Moses. And the chair of Moses is the place of authority, just like those of you who have been in the university or someplace like that. There's a chairman or chairperson, chairwoman, a chairperson of the psychology department. And the chairperson of the department is the person who, when they're in that chair, has the authority of the department. And the way you get that authority is you're there the longest, or it's your turn, or something like that. But that's because they're recognized as the chair of the department. Well, the chair of Moses was the place that the Hebrew people thought had the most authority. Moses was their big gun. He wrote Genesis through Deuteronomy, and he was their main authority person. And so the chair of Moses was like the symbolic thinking that said, this is the place of the most authority. But the issue isn't that there isn't such a place. The issue is that they seated themselves there. So they were not seated there. They seated themselves there. They took authority. They were not given authority. Power of posturing just means that leaders spend a lot of time focused on their own authority and reminding you about it too. And the reason they have to spend so much time focused on their spiritual authority and reminding you about their spiritual authority is because they don't have it. It's not real. It's posture. Oh, man, this had been 1975, 1976. Holly and I had a friend, had some friends that lived up by sandstone, and they rented a farm up there, and we went up there to visit them, and they had a cat that came with the property. And so it would live under the porch, it was malnourished. It was like this evil demon cat. It was like, it was stunted. It looked like, you know, one of the, what was that movie where those things you say, touch the water, they should have to just grab that. Yeah, it looked like a gremlin after a drink of water, okay? But it was really little. Like it's an adult cat, but it's really little. And what it would do is it would turn sideways, you know, and put it back up, you know, and then look as big as it could possibly look, which is maybe twice the size that it normally looks, but still it was pretty little. I mean, you know, it didn't know this, but I knew that if you wanted to, you could just kick it again. It just was this little thing, you know. But what it did was it postured power, you understand? It postured bigness and strength and weakness, but posturing it doesn't mean you have it. And so when we talk about power posturing in a spiritually abusive system, we're talking about leadership that postures power because they don't have it. People who have genuine spiritual authority don't have to spend any time reminding anybody about how much authority they have. Authority is something that God gives. Authority is something that people notice. In Matthew 7, it says of Jesus, When Jesus had finished his words, the multitudes were amazed, for he was teaching them as one having authority. Jesus said a bunch of stuff. They went, wow, this guy has authority. not as their scribes. Over here were the people who had the authority. Do you understand? They were in the place of authority. They had the robe. They had the degree. They carried the big King James Bible. They had it all. Over here, they were the ones who were in authority. Jesus was just, over here, saying stuff that made sense, that was powerful stuff, that was helpful stuff, that was good news, and they went, wait a minute, you know, he is sounding like he has a bunch of authority, not like these guys who have the title, you know, like that. So they could tell. John Dawson, who wrote the book, Taking Our Cities to God, says the one who offers the most hope has the most authority. People who are in positions of true leadership demonstrate their authority and their power in their lives and message toward others. The reason why God gives authority is to serve and equip and build and lift up and not to come over, not to lord it over. In Romans 13.1, it says there's no authority except from God. In Matthew 28.18, Jesus says, all authority has been given to me. Authority is something that's given, not taken. In Matthew 10.1, it says, having summoned his twelve disciples, he gave them authority. Why did they have authority? than because they had the title of Jesus' disciple? No, because he gave it to them. Being hired or elected to a spiritual position, talking the loudest, being there the longest, giving the most, doesn't give anybody authority. Getting a paycheck, having a sign on your door, doesn't do it. God gives it. He does it for the purpose of coming underneath people to build them, equip them, and do God's agenda. Okay, number two, performance preoccupation. Now, we already covered this quite a bit in the last session. Preoccupied with performance, obviously, you know, if one of the wounds that happens in a person's life is that they end up being really preoccupied with performance, then they must have probably come from a place where that's where they cared about. Let me do a little bit longer of a teaching in terms of this 1 Timothy thing I heard of just before I burned down Gotham. 1 Timothy 1.3 As I urge you upon my departure from Macedonia, remain not at Ephesus, nor that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines. Okay, Timothy, you stay at Ephesus because I want you to tell these people to stop teaching what they're teaching. Nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies which can rise to mere speculation rather than furthering God's provision, which is by, anybody know the next word? Faith. Furthering God's provision, which is by faith, not by trying hard to be good little Christian boys and girls. But the goal of our instruction, the reason I'm telling you this, is love. So let's even make that an action word, okay? The reason I'm telling you this is that when you leave here today, you're going to act in loving ways towards everybody around you. The goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. I want you to leave here today doing what you're doing out of a clean conscience and a pure heart. For some men, straying from these things, have turned aside the fruitless discussion, wanting to be teachers of the law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions. We know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully. the law is good if you use it lawfully now I heard those of you who have a Ryrie study bible look down at the note on the bottom of the bible what it says on that verse the note on that verse is it says when the law is used lawfully it restrains evil people ok this is not true the law is not capable of restraining evil people and if you don't believe that read the newspaper all you gotta do is watch the news to see all the evil people that haven't been restrained from killing, even though there is a law against them. You see? The law does not restrain evil people. The reason why we give you the law is not to restrain you. It's to show who are lawbreakers. All the law can do is expose the evil and can't control the evil. And the danger in going to a Christian formula seminar is that you can get so good at being good that you would think you were really good. Instead of knowing that you are righteous and holy and blameless because of what Jesus has come. And that you have that as a gift, not because you were so good. I did a thing when I worked in treatment back in 1978. I did a thing with my clients. I had maybe 12, 14 people, half of which were going to prison if they didn't make it through my group. I mean, this was an adversarial thing. We weren't buddies. It was like, you don't make it through my group. They come cuckoo and you go to Stillwater. I asked these people to go to their room at night and open their bed stand and take out their Gideon Bible, find the Ten Commandments next to this. The assignment was, if you were God, if you were God, and you wrote these, why would you have written them? Understand the assignment? If you were God, here's the assignment, if you were God and you gave these to the people that you cared about, what would have been your motivation for giving these? So they went, they did it, they came back. And the reasons they gave were wonderful and I also think right. They said, if you don't chase your neighbor's wife, your neighbor won't chase you with a gun. Understand that? Not one of them said, if you don't chase your neighbor's wife, then God's going to like you better because you did what he said. Not one of them said that. If you do these, God will like you better. A non-Christian can do the Ten Commandments, and if they do, well, they can't do the first one, because if they do the first one, they become Christians. But the other nine, if they do the other nine, their life would improve. Things would go well for them. You understand this? But in terms of God's view of them, we're changed off. Just like a Christian. God's view of us is dependent on the gift that we receive. to Jesus. And that's a settled thing. We don't have to get up tomorrow morning and reinvent that. So, here we have some people that are laying the law on people. These are the strange teachings. They're being taught wrong about the law. And what I want to do to correct this is I want to say, the reason I'm telling you this is so that you will love out of a pure heart and a clean conscience. This is your faith. Now, Hebrews 10 talks all about this. I don't have time to teach the whole thing, but I can spend the whole rest of this session just on a couple verses of Hebrews 10. But here's what it says in verse 19 of Hebrews 10. Since therefore, brethren, we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus. What happened if you boldly entered the holy place in the Old Testament? Anybody know? Yeah, you died. You got, you know, toasted. But here, now we can go, because of the blood of Jesus, by a new living way, which he inaugurated for us through the veil that is his flesh. And since we have a high priest, a great high priest, over the house of God, listen, let us draw near with a sincere heart and full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience. Why is our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience? Because of Jesus. And because it is, we can go boldly to the stone of grace. Now, love. Okay? So now that you know that, now love. Now you want to do some things that you should be doing or stop doing some things that you shouldn't be doing because your life would improve and your relationships would improve and, you know, things would go well. Now, fix those things. But don't fix those things. to try to get a clean conscience based on how well your life is fixed, because that's not possible. Plus, for a believer, it's not necessary. All that work has been done already. Right. Performance preoccupation. I know about church where it started out with a ministry that had a really important service to people in the community, people who needed food, housing, things like that. But people who served in that ministry were required to go before the leadership and document how they spent the day in 15-minute increments. So every day, you have to go with this thing, 15-minute increments, just how you spent the day. Here's what I was doing here, here's what I was doing here. All day long, they were evaluated based upon whether they used their time wisely the way that God wants you to use it. Most of the scientists were not reading the Bible enough. And, of course, the leadership decided what enough was. They're confronted with spending 15 minutes instead of 10 taking a bath, which means that the leadership also knows the right spiritual amount of time it takes to bake. But, of course, see, if you were to just spend 10 instead of 15, if you use another 5, read your Bible, which you don't do enough of, this is not about holiness or obedience to God. This is catering to some leader's sick interpretation of what spirituality is and their need for control. The truth is, I have a hard time keeping track of my own baths. And I'm going to keep track of yours too? No way. So, is obedience, submission, and performance important? Yes, it is. Romans 13.1. Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities. 1 Peter 5. Be subject to your elders. Hebrews 13, 7, obey your leaders, submit to them. But in Acts 5, his spiritual leaders, his elders, ask Peter, they bring Peter in, and they say, shut up. Quit talking about this Jesus guy. Quit doing miracles. Just shut up. Don't do anymore. And the reason that they said that was because they had postured authority, and Peter had real authority, And the leaders were trying to do ministry that looked pretty impotent and didn't really have much effect except making people more tired. And Peter and John were going around healing people and miracles were happening and people's hearts were being lifted. And so the power of this made the impotence of this look as impotent as it was. And so the leaders bring this guy in and they say, Shut up. These are Peter's spiritual leaders. This is the same Peter now who in 1 Peter 5 says, be subject to your elders. This place is telling us, be subject to your elders in 1 Peter 5. Here he says, no, I won't shut up. I have to obey God rather than you. I won't shut up. So he disobeys, does not submit to his spiritual leaders in Acts 5, even though in 1 Peter he tells you he's supposed to do that. What's the difference? Because the leaders that he describes in his writings are about serving, not lording it over, that kind of stuff. Submit to those leaders. These leaders were not using authority for the reason why God gives authority. Don't submit to them. Submit to God. If you have to submit to God and take the consequences over here, then do that. You know, it's the difference between what I would call a microscopic versus a telescopic view of scripture. A microscopic view of scripture is when your spiritually abusive leader comes to you and points you at all the verses that say, do what your leader says, do what your leader says, do what your leader says. But if you take a telescopic view picture, you find out that you don't do what your leader says if your leader's not using their authority for the reason why God gives authority. So yes, do what your leader says. And leaders quit lording it over people. The kind of leader that we're talking about wouldn't come to the scripture and say, do what your leader says. Wouldn't need to. Number three, unspoken rules. Take a little poll here. Now, unspoken rules are the rules that run the joint, but they're not said out loud. Because if they're said out loud, they sound as ludicrous and stupid as they really are. But they have lots and lots of power. How many of you ever went to a church, and when the greeters greeted you, they said, Hi, welcome to our church. Just remember, don't ever disagree with anything the pastor says at this church, because if you do, you will be blackballed and you won't be allowed to be involved in the ministry in any way. How many of you ever were told that by the greeters coming in the dark? Okay, how many of you ever experienced that? You experienced that when you got there. Well, sure. You know why? Because it was a rule that ran the place, but it wasn't spoken. And the only way you can find out that there aren't spoken rules there is if you break them. As long as you follow them, you don't know they're there either. So that was the rule. Don't ever disagree with leadership or you're in trouble. That was the rule. But they didn't say it because if the greeter had said that to you on the way to the door, Hopefully, maybe not though. Seriously. You know, a lot of people have really good radar about this stuff, but they ignore it. They talk themselves out of it. It's like, this is so bad. It can't be this good. It can't be this good. They see it and they go, nah. It must not be it. Hopefully, you get greeted like that when you come in the door. You say to yourself, I'm out here. Run like a bunny. Get out of there. Unspoken rules. One of the worst ones, oh, let me give you another example. How many of you grew up in a spiritual place, a religious system, where the spoken rule was the Bible is the final authority? This is what we read, and here is what our final story. I'm going to leave you at that. Okay. Now, I'm just talking to you to raise your hand. The rest of you just want. I'm just talking to you to raise your hand. What the written rule says is, therefore, laying aside falsehood, speak truth to each one of you with his neighbor before we remember to one another. And that means if I have an issue with you, then I need to not lie about it, then I need to tell the truth about it, then I need to tell it to you, and not to you, and not to you, to you. That's what the written rule says. The spoken rule. Okay. You can note that you who raised your hand came from a place that said, We care about this. This is the final word. Okay. Now, those of you who raised your hand, how many of you also came from a place where there was an unspoken rule that said, Nice is better than honest. Or peace at all costs. Or whatever. Okay. Now, which rule one? How many in the second rule one? Oh, I thought we cared about what the Bible said. See how powerful these rules are? They're really powerful. They're really powerful. They're more powerful than the Word of God. That's not it. Are they? Are they more powerful than the Word of God? Well, no, they're not. But, see, in a scary, abusive place, it's hard to look that way. You get punished to tell the truth when the Bible says tell the truth in a place that's supposed to care about the truth the most. Confusing. The worst rule of this kind is what I call the can't talk rule. The can't talk rule says the problem is not the problem. You're the problem. You're saying there's a problem. So what? Shut up. We didn't have any problems here before you came. Start shooting off your mouth and said, shut up. See, that's the bottom line message is shut up. And, you know, there's a couple purposes that the can't-talk world serves. A few purposes. One of the purposes, so just so you have it straight, the can't talk rule says don't talk. Talking about it is the problem. The problem is not the problem. Talking about the problem is the problem. That's the can't talk rule. One of the things that the can't talk rule does is if I'm the power person, now look at me. If I'm the power person in a system that's preoccupied with performance, then I have to perform better than anybody else. But I can't, since I can't, since I'm just like everybody else, then I'm going to not perform sometimes just like everybody else is not going to perform sometimes. But because I've created a system where we're preoccupied with this, and you get punished if you don't, you know, or you get unaccepted or unloved, then what the can't talk rule does when I don't perform, what the can't talk rule does is it keeps people from talking about it. You can't talk about it. If I don't perform, you can't talk about it. So it keeps me from being accountable. Okay? Second thing it does is this though. If I can't keep you from talking about it, then I'm going to blame you for talking about it. If I can't keep you from talking about it, I will make you the problem for talking about it. So, Lynn and I are married. I slug her. She calls the cops. I go to jail. Why did I go to jail? No. Cancel on a sluggy wife. Did you know that? It's against the law. All 50 states against the law slugged me like, can't do it. I went to jail because I slugged her. I broke the law. But, that's not what I'm going to tell her. I'm going to tell her, the reason I went to jail is because she's an unsubmissive, disloyal wife who has exposed me to public ridicule and ruined my ministry. Well, whose behavior exposed me to public ridicule? My behavior, but what I'm going to say is it's hers. You see, Lynn, the problem is that I hit you. The problem is that you noticed. If she buys that, if she buys that, she won't call the cops. If she doesn't call the cops, what? I can hit her, hit her, I'm not accountable. See, so what this does is if it can't keep you from talking about it, it will make you the problem for talking about it. Which also says, shut up. And then the other thing that it does is it just keeps all these other rules kind of locked up. I don't have time to get into them, but lots of unspoken rules. It's important to understand the unspoken rules that we serve so we don't pass them on to others by accident. Number four. Now, I'm not going to have time, I guess, to get to the three characteristics that make it hard to stay hard to leave. I'm not going to get to them. I'll risk them. I won't be able to describe them. But this lack of balance one I do want to talk about. A lack of balance means that it's either overboard objectively or subjectively. And objectively means there's an inordinate amount of focus and authority given to things that you can explain, things you can see, rational kinds of things. in this kind of place that elevates education, degree, intellectual capacity. If you can't prove it, it can't be true. We talk a lot about the Holy Spirit and what He does, but if He ever showed up and did something, we think He was weird. Because we can't explain it, we can't control it. People who have gifts and exercise their gifts, would get spiritually abused in this place because you'd be told that you're something wrong with you. The extreme subjective approach is what is true is decided on feelings and senses and experiences giving more weight to them than what the Bible says. And in this system, you can't know what you know, even if you know it, unless I know it first and impart it to you. You understand that? So even if from your own relationship with Jesus and your own spiritual history, you know something or understand something, you can't know it or understand it unless the Spirit first reveals it to the leader and then he imparts it and she imparts it to you. So there's more focus put on the experience than there is on the tangible Word of God. Let me just say something about this. If I come to you, how many of you have ever had someone come to you with a Word of God for you? Okay. If I come to you with a Word of God for you, the only way that you can be absolutely, positively certain that it really is the Word of God is if I'm actually, literally reading the Word of God. Now, it doesn't mean if I'm not reading it, it isn't the Word of God, but the only way you can be absolutely, positively certain that it is God's Word is if I'm actually reading God's Word. Understand this? And even then, it might not be for you. Okay? I mean, if I show up and say, well, I was just reading this thing by you, and I inspired you the other day, and I thought about you, well, I might be wanting you to give. But listen, if I'm not reading the Word of God, it doesn't mean it's not a Word for you. But here's the deal. See, if it is a word for you, then that means that the Holy Spirit that lives in me gave me the word to give to you, where the Holy Spirit who lives in you is the same Holy Spirit that lives in me. And so if I give you this word that is for you, God, and you're going, Jesus, this doesn't make sense, I don't get this, oh man, you're trying to squeeze it in your head that it doesn't really fit, But, you know, of course, Jeff's the leader, so I have to receive this. Don't receive it. Understand? I think God can do it better than that. I think, haven't you ever had an experience where somebody came and gave you a word, and all of a sudden, bang, and you knew it, and it was a yes, and even if it was a stinky, yucky word, okay? It was light, it felt like a gift, even though you didn't really like hearing it because you knew it was for God for you, and it made sense of something, and something lifted, that's because the Holy Spirit that gave the word is the same one that confirmed it to you. If you have to go, oh man, this person is the leader, so I've got to receive this, and I've got to act on it, but I don't get it, and I don't understand it, don't receive it. Don't necessarily throw it away. Understand? But don't receive it. And the only way you can know for sure if it really is God's word is if I'm reading God's word. So, in this system, people get abused who aren't exercising gifts. Something's wrong with you if you don't have tongues. Over here. Here, something would be wrong with you if you had tongues. Okay? And what the scripture says is, you want to have tongues, have tongues. You don't want to have tongues, don't have tongues. If you're pointing at whether you have tongues or you don't have tongues, point at Jesus and enjoy tongues if you have them. It's a gift, right? That's the short talk on tongues. Okay. Three characteristics that make it hard to leave. Number one, spiritual paranoia, which says that everybody outside the circle is wrong and dangerous and the safety is in here. If you leave here, you leave God. If you leave here, you leave God. We're the safe ones. Nobody does as good as we do. Now we understand as much as we do. Number two, actually, number two. Spiritual abusive systems foster a misplaced sense of loyalty. I heard of a Christian organization, a youth organization, that makes this youth worker sign a loyalty statement. They promise that if they ever leave this organization, they won't minister to youth in that geographical area for a period of so many years. Now here's my question. If I'm building God's kingdom here, and you're building God's kingdom here, why do I care where you're building God's kingdom? In fact, I would welcome you building God's kingdom here, because sometimes God's kingdom building feels kind of lonely and crazy. But if I worry that you're here next to me building God's kingdom, maybe it's not God's kingdom I'm building. Maybe you're getting a little closer to my kingdom. One of the ways that this misplaced loyalty is fostered is with scare tactics. God's going to withdraw his spirit from you and your family if you leave. He'll destroy your business without a protection saint. He'll get your kids, your family, and you will come under a curse. As you know all things I've heard, this is spiritual blackmail. It's spiritual abuse, but it does get people to stay. Humiliation. I'm still under this number six. how do we foster misplaced world? Affiliation, the threat of being exposed, or being exposed, phone campaigns launched against you if you disagree or leave, you know? Being made public examples in order to send a message to those who might want to think about disagreeing like you did. And number seven is that spiritually abusive places are secretive. We can't talk about this outside of here because people wouldn't understand. When you see somebody in a system being secretive, run like a bike. Watch out. People don't hide what's okay. Understand that? People don't hide what's okay. People don't hide what's appropriate. If you can't stand up in broad daylight and say out loud what's going on, you've got to go hide back here and say, you're doing that because they wouldn't understand. Watch out. Thank you.
