Turn with me to the book of Matthew, chapter 5, verse 5, Matthew, chapter 5. Just as we begin to move into this, I want to remind you of the context. Jesus is a hit. The reason we know that is because of chapter 4. He has introduced his kingdom, and the kingdom that he has introduced in chapter 4 is not a kingdom of words, but it is a kingdom of power. And that power was demonstrated in verse 23 when he was in Galilee teaching in the synagogues, proclaiming the good news about the reign of God. But he did more than do that. He started healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness, and that attracted people. And we saw that attraction in verse 25, when great multitudes followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, and Judea, and even from beyond the Jordan. People wanted to know what was going on. But Jesus noticed something about this crowd that was following him that maybe they were coming for the wrong reasons. Maybe the real reason they were coming wasn't because they really were responding to God and his glory, but because of the glorious things that were happening. And people who want power and want neat things to happen to them were coming to see the show. And because of that, in chapter 5, verse 1, we see that when he saw the bandwagon effect, the multitudes, he withdrew and he went up on a mountain. And after he sat down, his disciples came to him and he began to teach them things about the kingdom of God. And basically what he says as we go through this is this. I want to describe to you, Jesus says, who it is that really does enter into the kingdom of God. And I want to also describe to you who it is that the power of the kingdom of God really does flow. It is not those who are seeking the power and the glory. It is the broken who are going to enter into the kingdom, the poor in spirit who are going to understand the power of God. And that's a paradox that religious people never will understand and never have. Blessed are the poor in spirit, the broken, for theirs alone is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn. Last week, remember that, blessed are those who are getting out here what's in here. Blessed are those who are dealing honestly with their pain, for they alone will get comforted. Blessed are those who are mourning over their sin, confessing their sin, outwardly admitting that they have done wrong, for they alone will get the grace of God. They alone will understand the comfort of the Holy Spirit in their lives. And then today, blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Let's pray as we begin. Father God, as Dan has already prayed, we want to hear from you. and that is my desire too. The last thing we need as your people is to hear a speech about God. We want to hear from God. And God, we really do see ourselves these days sitting at your very feet, the feet of our King, our Master, and we see ourselves stumbling and failing and sometimes doing it wrong, but you gracefully teaching and bringing us back to relationship and redemptive kinds of things. And Father, we pray in Jesus' name that your spirit indeed be our teacher. We unleash your power here. Touch hearts. God, break through hardness that words of logic cannot do. Do your work among us. We believe that you will and that you are. In Jesus' name, amen. As we continue through this study of the Sermon on the Mount, There are things we need to be mindful of. One of them that I want to keep before us continually is the enormous confrontation that this teaching of Jesus is on the religious system of that day. Not only that, but the enormous confrontation that this teaching of Jesus is on the religious system of our day. And let's make it as close to home as we can make it. The evangelical religious system of our day. You see, in those days, true spirituality and holiness was defined in Israel by scribes who knew everything there was to know about the Bible, but they didn't know God when he moved. It was defined by chief priests who were madly involved in the temple activities, but when Jesus was born a babe in Bethlehem, though they knew the prophecy of him, they never responded to him. And it was defined by Pharisees who were the Orthodox. They were the keepers of the truth of that day. They were the fundamentalists. They were the conservatives, the elite, the scholars, the theologians. They were, of all people, the right ones. The problem was this, that what really characterized them with all the garb of an external spirituality, what really characterized them was spiritual pride that was masked in phony piety. They looked good. They kept the rules. They memorized Scripture. They followed the form. They called it God all the time, but it never really was. And it intimidated people whose hearts were really seeking after God because their definition of God was one you could never know except through that external, pious, faraway system. As good biblicists, these Pharisees anticipated the coming of a Messiah. They talked about it all the time. Much as we, who are good biblicists, would anticipate the second coming of Jesus Christ, we could kind of have that same kind of category. They would be talking of it in that term. in those terms. But the Messiah that their hypocrisy had created was a Messiah that was going to come to them and confirm them and commend them and say things like this to them. Pharisees, I really do approve of your great religiosity and your piety. You look very, very good and you know so very much and that's what I really care about. That was the Messiah they were anticipating. That was not the Messiah that came. The Messiah they anticipated was going to come and say, I appreciate how separate and aloof you have remained from a lost and dying world and how you would never mingle with anybody like that or have them in your church or synagogue. You have kept the temple clean. I'm so proud of you. The real Messiah did not say that. Theirs did. The one they were looking for did. Theirs would say things like this. I appreciate how well you have stuck to the form and the pomp that is really impressive, but it meets no one's needs and how you have created an image of God my Father, an image of God my Father to the world that makes him look unreachable and untouchable and unknowable. I really appreciate that. The fact is that's the Messiah they anticipated. That is not the one who came. The one who came looked them in the eye and says, Woe unto you, you scribes, you Pharisees, you chief priests, you hypocrites, who have shut the doors of the kingdom to people whose hearts are ready for it. Because your whole thing has made it external. My kingdom, beloved, is not for the religious. It is not for the proud. It is not for the righteous. It is for the unrighteous who know they are unrighteous and are confessing their sin. It is not for the well. It is for the sick who know they are sick and need a healer. And ask for healing. It is not for the strong. It is for the weak who know they're weak and say, God, you are my only hope. Those are the ones who are the dwellers in the kingdom. And those alone are the ones through whom the power of the kingdom will flow. And it is to those alone that the power of the kingdom will ever be known. Blessed are the poor. Blessed are the broken. Blessed are those who mourn. And what a delightful thing to know that if you're mourning over your sin, and if you're broken over your life situation, that you can come and be blessed and enter into the kingdom and receive grace and health in time of need. That's good news. Unless you're pious. Unless you're a pretender. Then it's bad news because you're being unmasked. Today, blessed are the meek. Who are the meek? What do they look like? What do they sound like? have any images in your mind i'm sure i'm sure you do meek is what meek is it rhymes it's weak meek is weak meek is pathetic meek is mealy mouth meek is spineless blessed are the spineless blessed are the weak and the mealy mouth let's everybody get mealy mouth together and call it god i don't think that's what he meant but we have impressions of what meekness is think about it this way. If someone was talking about you in a conversation that you overheard and you heard that the word on you was that that Dave guy is really a meek guy, what would your reaction be? I can tell you what mine, I'd want to go into the circle and say, I am not. I'd want to set them straight. Would you feel like it was a compliment if you were called meek? If you were an employer and you had someone's resume before you and all of the characteristics of his life were laid out before you, and one of the things it said of him was this, that he was meek. Would you hire him? If the word on someone else was that they were meek, would you like him? If the word on some guy or some gal was that they were meek, would you marry him? Would you follow him? Would you trust him? Would you go into battle with him? No. My impression of meek is somebody who's real nice, but he's not the kind of person I want to be around when things are tough. I don't want to go into a battle with a meek guy or a meek gal. That's not the kind of thing I want to do. I want to go in with a tough guy or a tough gal. Why? Because meek is weak. It's mousy. It's nice, but it isn't strong. It doesn't take a stand. I'd go fishing with meek. Wouldn't you? I would like that. In fact, that's the kind of person I want to go. I don't want to get in any arguments. I don't want to have somebody, you know, throwing out the lure and taking a stand. You know, I don't want to get out of the boat. I'd jump out if they didn't. I'd go on a walk with Meek. I'd pick flowers with Meek. You know, stuff like that. But when we're talking, but when we're talking, I'm going to watch the Bears game this afternoon with my brothers, and I don't want Meek around then. My impression of Meek. You see, when I'm going into battle, and when there's a tough situation, and where courage is needed, this Meek guy is nice, but he's pretty useless in this situation. Meek is weak. The dictionary even gives us a hard time with this because the definition of meekness in the dictionary among the different definitions is this. Deficient in courage. Blessed are the deficient in courage. Blessed are the cowardly. Blessed are the spineless. I think something is missing in our impression of this word. Let's get to do some digging here. The Greek word for the word meek is the word praos in its root, and its root word is indeed gentle, mild, and tender. But where we really begin to get a handle on what this word means and how it is applied and what meek people look like is not in just its definition, but in its usage. And you have seen that in our studies together through the years, that we'll take a word and we see how it's used, and that's what begins to broaden it. So let's get some usages of it. One of the usages of this word is this. It is a word that is used to describe a soothing medicine. If you're taking notes, you write that down. Meek is a soothing medicine. It is used to describe a gentle breeze. Now, I can warm up to that a little bit. I like that. Blessed are those who are a soothing medicine. Do you know anybody, beloved, who when you meet him is a soothing medicine? There's another usage of it. They are a gentle breeze. Do you meet anybody in the hall, in your life, in your family, that when you walk by them, it's like walking by a gentle breeze. Do you know anybody in the church of Jesus Christ who calls himself a Christian, that when you have interaction with them and relationship with them, even sometimes in confrontation kinds of things, the interaction that you have is a soothing medicine and a gentle breeze? I hope you do, because that is a description of kingdom people, and if you don't have relationships with anyone like that who has that impact on you, and you see that in their lives, we're dealing with some desperately sick people who may not be in the kingdom at all. Because one of the characteristics of kingdom people is that they are a soothing medicine and a gentle breeze. Some of you, while you could come up with examples of people, and you maybe even have names in your mind right now, and you know what you need to do if you know people like that, you need to thank God for them. But there may be people in your life as well who call themselves Christians and know the Bible, and like the Pharisees and the scribes and the chief priests are filled with activity for God, but when you encounter them, it is not a soothing medicine that you experience. It is an abrasive sandpaper. One of the sad things is this, that in the church of Jesus Christ, many of us, in what we experience when we hurt and when we've failed and when we haven't done very well and when we're not at our best, the last place in the world we want to go is to the church. You know why? Because very often the church of Jesus Christ has become known to us as a place where I will not get a soothing medicine or a gentle breeze. I'll get a brace of sandpaper and condemnation. And it's not okay to deal with what's really going on with me in the church. Maybe anywhere else in the time I come to church is when things are going great. That's a travesty. That is a defilement of the kingdom of God. And don't ever call that kind of place a church. Ever. It's not a church. It's not a kingdom church. and would to God that we more and more would be this kind of place when people come. It's a soothing medicine. It's a gentle breeze. Confrontation can also be in that as well. One of the things we also need to face in applying this is as we wonder why some churches are so often filled with pettiness and vindictiveness and self-righteousness and we scratch our heads as to why that is, one of the things we need to consider is that not all those who say, Lord, are indeed going to enter the kingdom, you see. Jesus said that, not me. Blessed are the broken. Blessed are the poor in spirit. Blessed are those who are getting out here what's in here. And blessed are those who are a soothing medicine and a gentle breeze. There's another usage of it that broadens our meaning a little bit more. It's this. It's used to describe the taming of wild animals. The taming of wild animals. Now, the picture you've got is this, a wild colt or a lion. Wild colt to begin with. And this horse is manic, and it runs all over the place, and it goes wherever it wants to go, and it has no control at all. All sorts of power, all sorts of energy, but it's directionless. It goes in every direction. And in fact, it's dangerous, and it's of no use at all. But something happens to that horse, you see, when the trainer gets a hold of it, and it works with it, and it kind of hits it, and it reins it in, and when that horse is what is called broken, it then becomes useful. And the word that they would use to describe a horse that was broken is the Greek word praos, which means mild. It is not spineless. It is not without energy. It is not without power. It is just power that is now under control of the master. That's what it means to be meek. Not destroyed, not spineless, not a pile of mush, but power and energy and direction. but the direction now and the things at which it moves now is not its own whims, but it is now moving at the impulse of the master. That's meek. Meek is a gentle breeze and a soothing medicine. Meekness is power under control. From that little illustration of a horse that's broken and then it results in meekness and usefulness, there are two truths that I want to draw from that. One I already drew and that was this power under control concept. The other one is this, and we just need to note it. So meekness or gentleness, I believe is a byproduct of brokenness. I get That right out of the illustration of the horse that's broken, and when it's broken it's called meek, it's called praos. I believe with all my heart that meekness or gentleness, praos is a byproduct of brokenness. In a wild horse, it is a yield of the will, it is a relinquishing of control to the master in a person. It is a yielding of the will, it is a relinquishing of the control of my life to be the master. But it doesn't come by trying to be meek. It's a natural result of being broken. Many of you were here last Sunday morning. And as we got into the Word and saw what it meant to mourn, and as we were given permission to mourn, and as we talked the week before that about what it meant to be broken of spirit, the Spirit of God moved here and many of you were broken. And many of you came and the response up at the front here was weeping for some of you. And some of you did it for a long time. And you know what I know about some of you who came, and I don't even know what God was dealing with you about in those different kinds of things. For some of you, it was sin long hidden. For some of you, it was attitudes long held on to, and you released it and God gave you comfort. For some of you, it was pain that had been inflicted upon you, and you'd never gotten it out, and you wept, and you wept, and you wept, and there came comfort. You know what I know about the people who came forward that Sunday morning? I know this, that when they left, One of the things that was true of them in their spirit was that they were gentle. They were meek. Do you see that? Brokenness results in meekness. And let me tell you something. If the spirit, if the disposition of your heart is not a soothing medicine and it is not a gentle breeze, what you need to understand is that trying to be that is never going to work. The fundamental problem you've got is that you need to hear a sermon on meekness. No, it isn't. the fundamental problem you've got is that by the Holy Spirit of God, there needs to come a touch on your heart for brokenness before God. And when brokenness comes, meekness is there. You're just gentle. When you feel the pain of brokenness, you know what happens when you encounter other people who have pain? You're gentle. You're not condemning. You know how it hurts. You know how embarrassing it is. And so when others come, those who have been broken deal meekly or gently with those who are going through pain. It's just the way it is. If you are rigid and pious and like this, I am not naive to believe that a sermon on meekness will bring it. What needs to come is the breaking of God on your heart. And I pray that for us. It's the scariest thing we can ever think of, but it's the greatest release of power you'll ever know. So that I could be, having been broken by my king, to the kingdom of God, a soothing medicine and a gentle breeze. I want that. I want to be like that. It doesn't come by trying to be gentle. It comes by continually relinquishing control and letting the spirit break me where I need to be broken. that's kingdom living that's kingdom living another truth that comes from this the breaking that the spirit of God does in us is not one that destroys us it is not one that destroys us the horse that is tamed is not a horse that is mush I said this already I say it again here just in the flow of the outline the brokenness that he gives is simply the power under control all the power is there and all the energy but now it is submitted to the promptings of the master no longer running off in all directions and knocking over fences if there was a lion in my backyard who was running loose I would not trust it it could sit there passively but on a whim it could lash out at me and kill me like that just on a whim but when the master comes to that lion and breaks that lion the power of that lion is still there the glory of the animal is still there but now it will pounce when the master says pounds. You want to know something about meekness? Sometimes in the life of a believer who is genuinely broken by God and it issues in gentleness, it no longer roars at its own little things, but sometimes meekness does indeed issue in roaring and confronting, but it roars now, not at its own whims, but now at the direction of the master who is in control of it. Let me explain what I mean by that. Jesus was meek. I'm going to give you some illustrations of this, and this paints the picture so we get it. Jesus was meek. In Matthew 11, 29, he says of himself, I am meek and lowly in heart. When I hear that verse, I think of things like Christmas carols, away in a manger, no crib for a bed. The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head. And the cattle were lowing, the poor baby waked, and little Lord Jesus, no crying he made. He didn't cry even. Why? Because he was meek. Jesus, Jesus, meek and mild. The picture is quiet and blissful and passive. Solomon's head of Christ. You've seen the picture. He looks kind of pathetic. But I don't want to make a lot of fun of that. You know why? Because that gentleness and that quietness and that, not passiveness. I don't like that word with meekness. I don't think it really is descriptive. But that gentleness is a character of Jesus Christ when the people who he is dealing with are people who are failing people and they know it. Are people who are sinful people and they're tired of it. Are people who are broken people and they've come for help. And in that context, when Jesus is dealing with those kind of people, He is gentle and He is meek and He is safe. And when I'm hurt, that's where I want to go. He is a gentle breeze and a soothing medicine. But when that same Jesus, meek and mild, came in conflict or in contact with people who were pious and petty and absorbed with their own causes and superficial and superior in terms of their religious perspective on everyone else, he became angry. In Mark 3, verse 5, it says, he looked around on the Pharisees with anger. Why? Because of the hardness of their heart. What was the hardness about? The hardness was this. The God of glory had come to earth and had begun to talk about his kingdom and demonstrate the power of the kingdom, but the most religious people on the face of the earth refused to believe that that was really God and refused to believe that maybe they were not as spiritual as they thought they were. And to those people he said, Woe unto you. Look up Matthew 23 sometime. Read the entire chapter. From verse 13, I believe, through verse 33. It is one thing after another. Woe unto you. Woe unto you. And what he was saying to them, essentially, he says in the 33rd verse, You who think you are the most spiritual ones are indeed the ones who will never enter the kingdom of God and are indeed destined for eternal judgment. A sobering section of scripture, to be sure, especially if you were self-righteous, petty, pious, and religious. Well, whatever happened to the meekness? We see the same Jesus scourging people in the temple and driving them out. Whatever happened to the meekness there? Did later on, maybe after he just kind of got all this off his chest and did 25 verses of, Woe to you, scribes, you hypocrites, you're da-da-da-da-da, all these kinds of things, did he, after he got all that out, say, Guys, I blew up. I'm really sorry. I take it all back. Well, that would have been appropriate because meek people don't do what he did, do they? At least our perception of what meek is. That isn't what happened. Why? Because meekness isn't weakness. It is not something that is without conviction. It is power under control. The only difference now is that now this power pounces at the movement of the master, not when you move against me. See, you could say all sorts of things about me. You could say all sorts of things about Jesus, and people did all the time. But when they moved with hypocrisy and shut the gates of the kingdom off to people, and when they presented an image of God that wasn't real, he pounced. And we need to, too. That's power under control. illustration of that first peter 2 21 to 23 gives the balance it says this it was describing the time when jesus was being crucified and it was talking about the fact that we have an example for us when we are going through suffering and excuse me and people are saying things about us that are bad does that bother you when people say things about you not me i'm so spiritual that when When people say things about me that they don't like me, it just kind of rolls off my back. It doesn't bother me at all. I'm a liar too. I don't think anyone could possibly know the pain that Jesus had when he went to the cross physically. But I think you can understand what I mean when I say that the reviling and the curses and the people who turned their back on him did something to his spirit and his soul that might be said was greater pain than the pain of the cross. Do you know what I mean by that? I remember when I was a little kid, I was eight years old, and I had walked a block too far in Chicago. You don't do that. And I walked a little block too far. It wasn't my block. And all of a sudden, some guys came out and greeted me, and they weren't going to give me a hug. And I got into a fight with one of the guys, and I wanted to get away, but I couldn't, and he started to grapple, and I beat him up. I didn't really beat him up. I wasn't that bold. What I did was I got on top of him, and I held him down, and in every law I know, when you hold him down, and he's down on his back, you win. But you know what I was doing? He didn't even touch me. He didn't hit me. I was crying like a baby. You know why? Because there was nobody there for me. Every person there was reviling me. And I was broken. I was sad. Didn't touch me. And being reviled, the hardest part of the pain possibly of the cross, he what? He didn't feel a thing because that's how spiritual he was. No, I think he grieved deeply. I think he was brokenhearted. I think he felt alone. My God, my God, you have even forsaken me. I've never felt so alone. But being reviled, he reviled not again. You see, when the truth of God was defiled, when God was made to look impotent, when God was made to look religious, when God was made to look like something other than what he is, a God of grace and power and forgiveness and healing to those who know they need a healer, he pounced with fierceness. But when people came on him, he reviled not again. But I need to have another truth emerge from that verse. You see, meekness is not just passive. Even in that verse, he does not passively take that reviling and then decide to just not do anything back. He didn't do anything back, but he did not do nothing. Can I say that? What was that, language-wise? He did not do nothing. Doesn't sound good. In that passage, 1 Peter 2, 21 to 23, it says this, And being reviled, he reviled not again, but he did not passively sit there. He did something. He kept continually entrusting himself to him who judges rightly the living and the dead. You know what meekness is? It's tough-minded faith. It's tough-minded faith. You write that down if you're taking notes. Actively, toughly, entrusting themselves to the one who judges rightly the living and the dead. That's a tough faith. I'm going to believe God that he is going to protect my character. You need to say the same thing. When I hear those things, I'm going to believe God that he is the one who's going to protect my character. In Numbers chapter 12, turn to this one quickly. we see the same thing happening with Moses Numbers chapter 12 Moses was the leader he was the big gun and Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses this is chapter 12 of Numbers it's at the front of your Bible close to the front chapter 12 verse 1 then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married for he married a Cushite woman. And they said, has the Lord indeed spoken only through you, Moses? Who do you think you are? Has he not spoken through us as well? And the Lord heard it. Now, Moses was very meek. The word there says humble. The word is the same as meek. More than any man on the face of the earth. Why is that put there? The reason that's put there is because Moses is a demonstration of power under control. When God was defiled, Moses would pounce. When people came against him, he just sat there passively. No, he actively trusted in God who would righteously deliver and would divide between the living and the dead, would righteously judge between the living and the dead. And God did intervene. Look at the intervention in verse 4. And suddenly the Lord said to Moses and Aaron and to Miriam, Come here, I want to talk to you guys. Verse 5, the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the doorway of the tent. And he called Aaron and Miriam, and when both of them had come forward, he said to them, hear now my words. If there is a prophet among you, I am going to get what I want. I'm going to read it. I, the Lord, shall make myself known to him in a vision. I shall speak with him in a dream. That's what I'll do. But I'm not doing that with Moses. Not so with my servant Moses. He is faithful in all my household. With him I'm going to speak mouth to mouth, even openly and not in dark sayings. And he beholds the form of the Lord. Why were you not afraid to speak against him who is my servant Moses? And the anger of the Lord burned against them, and he departed. You know one of the characteristics of meekness? That is broken by God, that issues in gentleness, that realizes it doesn't have to defend itself. That's one of the things. Moses wasn't defensive. Why? Because God is in control, and he believed it. Meekness is a tough-minded faith. It is not defensive. It doesn't need to be. God's going to do what he's going to do. And even the people who are out of line, sometimes there is need to confront, but sometimes there is an ability to back off and say God is going to deal with them and I need to let it go. I just let it go. Meekness is something more. Last one I want to give you as we kind of paint a picture. Meekness is teachable. One of the ways you know that meekness is a reality and gentleness is something that is indeed flowing through you is that it's teachable. Turn with me to James chapter 1. Hebrews, James. It's near the end of your Bible. Those of you who don't know where James is. James chapter 1 verse 19. This you know, my beloved brethren. Are you there? I still hear pages rustling. This you know, my beloved brethren, but let everyone be quick to hear and slow to speak and slow to anger. For the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God. Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness in humility, that is the same word praos, in meekness or gentleness, receive the word implanted, which is able to save your souls. What it says here is this, the way I want you to come to the word of God is meekly. The way I want you to come to the word of God is with a teachable spirit. Let me tell you something about my background. I grew up in a background that was strongly evangelical and maybe, and many of you have as well. The basic theme of my background was this, we were committed to the truth. If you've ever heard that phrase, but I grew up on that phrase, we are committed to the truth. My word is truth. But what that meant, in terms of my perception, was this. We spent, because we were committed to the truth, constantly, all of our time, defending what we already believed. We are committed to the truth, what we think is right, and there was no variable. And the sign of our strength was that we were closed-minded to everything. You know what that is? that is not coming to the Word of God meekly and gently with a teachable spirit. You know what I know about broken people? What I know about people who have come to the end of themselves and realize that God is their only hope. They are gentle. And one of the ways they come to the Word of God is they say this, Lord, I don't know it all. I don't have all the answers. I have some things I think, and I've got a lot of excess baggage from my past that puts you in little boxes. But God, I want to come to you meekly. I want to come to your word gently so that you by your spirit can change what I think, or I need to change what I think. People like that grow. People like that flourish. People like that understand kingdom power. Meekness is teachable. People who aren't teachable aren't meek. People who aren't meek haven't been broken. People who haven't been broken. are not in the kingdom. James 3, 13. Same feeling. Who among you is wise and understand him? And understanding. How do you find out in your congregation who the wise men and women are? Who are the ones who really have understanding of how God speaks and how he moves? Well, here's how you tell. Let him show his wisdom and his understanding by his good behavior and his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom. A lot of people are wise and know it all, but you never see any gentleness. Don't listen to those people. But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth. This wisdom, this arrogant, bitter, jealous, selfish ambition wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but that kind of wisdom is earthly, natural, and demonic. Whoa! For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing. We are totally convinced that the biggest thing to be is right. You could be right, but if there is jealousy, selfish ambition, there is disorder and every evil thing. You are not meek. But the wisdom from above is easy to spot. It's right. It doesn't even say that. It will. to a degree. It is first of all pure and then it's peaceable. And that's how you can tell it's wisdom. And then it's meek, gentle. And then it's reasonable. It's teachable. It's full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering. Incredible combination, isn't it? Gentle, reasonable, easily entreated, but at the same time unwavering. And without hypocrisy and the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace. That's a powerful passage of scripture. A revealing passage of scripture. And it's an indictment very often on churches and sometimes the churches you've been involved in and ours. You know that what I've seen very often in churches that the people who get listened to the most even with exhortations like this that tells you how to spot wisdom and understanding the people who get listened to the most are the petty and the ones who huff and puff and the bitter and the arrogant. And this right here says clearly that wisdom is not from above. It is earthly. It is natural. It is what? Demonic. When we see that we might grow. Because people who do not come with their right things in a gentle spirit will be resisted. you do not follow those people you do not acquiesce to those mentalities oh Dave but they're they're good Christians I'll tell you something an awful lot of times as Christians we blow it and there are times when you and I get bitter and we get goofy and we don't have gentleness and we make mistakes and boy I'll tell you there better be room for forgiveness and there better be room for doing it wrong and sometimes shooting our mouths off bitterly and going oh that was bad you ever done that it's embarrassing and one of the reasons that we don't deal with it well is because it is so embarrassing we got to rationalize it for five weeks after that and never just say I'm sorry I was stupid I said a bad thing I had a bad attitude and we need to have room and grace for people to blow it and then just come back and say it's okay i'll do it next week but we also need to consider the possibility that when that is a constant flow from someone's life no matter how much they know of the bible no matter how involved they are in the church like chief priests no matter how right they are in their doctrine when mercy and gentleness is never the flow don't be so sure they're in the kingdom blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth very quickly you know what that means that means this. The glory of this promise to those who've been broken and because of their brokenness have become gentle is this. That while petty, small, religious people push and strive and try to get their own way and grab it for themselves kingdom people can relax. You know why? Because it all belongs to you, buddy. And people are... Sometimes you get afraid because maybe it's not going to happen the way God wants it to happen. You can relax, friend. Because the kingdom belongs to you and everything you see belongs to you. blessed are the gentle and while everybody else is grabbing it for themselves let them do it belongs to you belongs to me that's good news that gives me an ability to relax psalm 37 1 let this just be heard by your ears and minister to you do not fret because of evil doers and backbiters don't be envious toward wrongdoers for they will wither quickly like the grass listen to this rest in the Lord relax relax wait patiently for him to work don't fret because of him who prospers because he's carried out a wicked scheme sometimes their little things seem to work and and thwart the work of God don't worry about that cease from anger forsake wrath why because it just leads to evil doing on your part and evil doers will be cut off you'll just become like them but those who wait for the Lord they will inherit the earth that's Psalm 37 Jesus was quoting Psalm 37 those who wait for the Lord they will inherit the earth yet a little while the wicked man will be no more and you will look carefully for his place and he will not be there that's incredible you will look carefully for that divisive one you will look careful for that backbiting one and when you just let God do it, one day you're going to look and he or she will not be there. Why? Because God removed them eventually. Be patient. But the meek, it goes on to say, the gentle will inherit the earth and they will delight themselves in abundant blessing of God. I want to know that in our church. The abundant blessing of God. How does that come? first of all by being broken I just close with this those of you among us maybe it's because you're not in the kingdom maybe it's because you've just got an attitude that you've gotten you've become rigid you've become unwavering you've become unteachable you've become warring and bitter I tell you the last thing you need is a sermon on meekness because sermons on meekness telling you to be gentle wouldn't work you put on an external gentleness and you look gentle, but nothing is done inside. What needs to happen is the Spirit of God needs to come and touch and break and give you the power to confess the sin, give you the desire to get out here, what's in here. And I just guarantee you, when the Spirit of God does that in your heart, you'll walk out of here gentle. You'll walk out of here meek. You'll walk out of here a soothing medicine, a gentle breeze, teachable in spirit, reviled but reviling not again. don't have to be defensive anymore. I'm talking about a free man. I'm talking about a free man. Let's pray. Would you stand with me as we do? Father God, I pray that the power of your spirit would be released among us right now. I thank you for your word, and your word is truth. and your word does pierce and it divides and it reveals. But God, words are words and they're impotent. Save the power of your spirit to move among us. And I pray that you would do among us the same kind of ministry that we asked for last week, that you would break us. Move among your people now for breaking, for mourning, for getting out here, what's in here, for confession of sin, for just an ability to release the pain they've got. God, we want to be a gentle people. We want to be a soothing medicine, not only in our body, but to the world. We want to be a gentle breeze, teachable in spirit, to which people are drawn like flies. God, do that work among us. Thank you.
