People on the tape, why don't you join us in a word of prayer here. Lord, I praise you for your marvelous works and for your marvelous character that you show in your marvelous works. You are the master artist that has spun out this world that we know, and you've spun out each one of us. And though you've given us free will and an ability to determine our own lives to some degree, and we frequently use that to screw things up. Yet you are the wise artist that can paint good out of evil and bring redemption out of destruction. And so you have done in our lives. We glorify you, Lord, for the way you've worked in our lives. And even to the point of giving us faith, giving us a love in you, a trust in you, to some of us you had to bring us pretty low to do that. You had to bring us to the end of ourselves and show us that we can't do it on our own, though we tried but we praise you even for that even for the pain that that might have involved because it drove us to you lord because you've done this to us we we want to uh worship you with all that we are with all of our heart with all of our bodies with all of our mind we want to infuse our entire existence into you lord because that's where it is already you have incorporated us into yourself and covered us with your blood and our identity is you lord and so we want to make that fact a fact in our experience by turning over everything about us our concerns our cares and even tonight lord as i'm praying i i expect lord that there are people here tonight who need to even pray this prayer to take the cares and the concerns the burdens of their life the struggles of their life and to give them to you because they belong to you because we are yours and our identity is found in you, Lord. So, Lord, we yield everything tonight, including our minds tonight as we're going to try to learn and grow. We yield that to you. Our wills, we yield to you. Our hearts, we yield to you. Our memories, Lord, we yield to you. And giving them to you, Lord God, we pray, Lord, that you would work in them and heal them and make something beautiful as only you can bring out that pearl from the grain of sand, Lord, and use this class as a part of that refining process. In your name we pray. Amen. Amen. Hi. Okay, a little review, a little review. Last night, or last night. It seems like it was just last night. Last night I was watching the Twins game, but last week we talked about salvation. and just by way of review. Well, we talked about the person of Jesus Christ, the deity of Jesus Christ, and why that's important and why it's significant in our life. And then we talked about the work of Jesus Christ, the atonement, the way that Christ paid the price for all of our sins. He absorbed our sin on the cross. He really became sin for us that we might become the righteousness in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah. Can you say amen, sister? All right. Now you may be seated. Christ really did become that 2 Corinthians 5 21 in a way that the human mind can never explicate God's second way of existing the son of God became a human being and died on the cross and no one did that but he became sin for us and therefore paid the full price of our sin he bore all the punishment that all the sin of the world ever deserved every possible sin that it deserved. He experienced God-forsaken hell on the cross of Calvary. He died in our place. These are all different ways of saying the same thing in the Bible. He paid the price. He died in our place. It basically means that everything that God's all-perfect holiness ever demanded and everything that sin ever set us apart from God with, Christ took care of. He satisfied God's holiness, his own holiness, and he erased and annihilated human sin, our sin. And because of that, we now, by gift, can receive God's own holiness, which is the only way you can ever be compatible with God, is to have his own holiness. And Christ annihilated our sin. Now, because of the work of the cross, we have the possibility of salvation. In principle, all the sin of the world is gone. Sin is no longer the issue between us and God. We talked about that last week. Sin's not the issue because it's been taken care of. God's got no problem with sin because Christ absorbed it. But it still is up for the individual to accept that gift or reject that gift. You can either say yes to it, in which case it applies to you, or you can say no to it and either reject God altogether by living your own life or by trying to earn that righteousness on your own. In either case, you're doing something which is utterly impossible, trying to make yourself compatible with God. So the atonement is the basis of salvation. The work of the Spirit, we also said, was necessary for the work of salvation. It is the work of the Holy Spirit to bring us to the Lord. Acts 16.14 talks about Lydia, how the Lord opened Lydia's heart. And that's what enabled her to believe. 1 Corinthians 12.3 says that no one can confess Jesus Christ as Lord except by the Holy Spirit. In John 6.44, in verses 64 through 65, Jesus says that no one can come unto him unless the Father enables him. You may have a whole lot of struggles in your life, a whole lot of problems in your life. That can be the case. And you may be wondering, am I really saved? But know this. that the fact that you're struggling with it and the fact that you believe in Jesus and trust in Him as your only hope, you could not do that if you weren't saved. The criteria for your salvation is not how good your life is. The criteria for your salvation is do you love and trust Jesus Christ? Because you couldn't do that on your own. It's impossible for a person who believes in Jesus Christ and knows that He's the Son of God and died for their sins and knows that they need him, it's impossible for such a person to have ever committed the unforgivable sin. Christians should never worry about that. It's impossible for them to ever be lost. And that's so important because the people who commit the unforgivable sin, they don't care about it. They don't worry about it. They don't call pastors and say, I think I've committed the unforgivable sin. Their conviction is gone. The people who commit the unforgivable sin are the people in Romans 1, verse 20 or 26 through 28 where the bible says the lord gave them up he gave them over to a reprobate mind to do whatever their hearts desired the unforgivable sin is when you have become so callous to the holy spirit there's no conviction left there's no bother god doesn't bother working with you anymore because you're a lost cause you begin your eternal sentence then and the first sign of that is that you lose all your conviction it feels great i mean the romans were probably cheering no longer any conviction they didn't worry about any longer uh whatever tinge of guilt they ever had about the acts they were doing is gone god just says do as you please that's hell that's hell yeah yeah yeah their fate is sealed but you can never know that the person has done that there's no way you could ever know that there are there are people who that you know that looks so far gone from god they didn't have a you wouldn't think a snow's flakes chance in perdition of ever coming around um and uh and yet there's something there behavior is not the criteria again good behavior isn't the criteria that you're there's hope for you bad behavior isn't the criteria that there's no hope for you nothing external is the criteria the heart's the criteria and only god knows that so that's why I think I told you about my I got a my mother-in-law's sister, what does that make her to me my aunt I don't know she's been locked up in and out of institutions all of her life because some wise minister told her she committed the unforgivable sin and no one ever is in a position to do that alright I don't know why I got off on that tangent but a lot of people worry about that repentance is the next step your heart is open and the first thing that happens when your heart is opened is is is that there's a sense of a repentance of turning you begin to see that that the life you've been living is not the life for you that this is that this is you're above this out of love this isn't a fear thing primarily it's not about like i'm in trouble i gotta turn around it's more a sense of when you sense god's love towards you he wins you he wins you around he doesn't scare you around he wins you around sometimes people out of their own self-interest say hey well look at i think hell's the reality i don't want to go there and so they begin to turn around and that can even have a role there but the primary turning the genuine turning fear of hell never turns a person genuinely permanently if that's all there is but when the love of god accompanies it and they begin to see that and experience it they begin to have a motivation for god repentance isn't a deed you do so much as it is a change of disposition you were oriented one way and then you begin to see the beauty of the lord how he loves you how valuable you are and pretty soon you begin to say this life is not this life i've been living i'm above this isn't this isn't the way i want to live he wins it from you and it's a genuine internal thing It's not a decision you say, I'm never going to smoke again. That's a good thing to do. Try that. But that's not repentance. That's an act of will that you're doing. But repentance is something that comes on the inside. It goes like this. And maybe quitting smoking would be a part of that. Hey, I don't need this. I like my lungs. But you do it for internal reasons. You do it for internal reasons. All right. And then faith. There's a faith. And that's a lifelong growing thing. faith a loving trust in jesus christ a relationship develops there he wins you he turns you and there's a loving uh relation and this is how how salvation uh occurs this is the act of salvation the result of that we said is justification which means you're declared you're declared righteous when your heart is open you're declared righteous god pronounces you righteous dikaiosune is the greek word and it literally means just to declare righteous the the judge says you are righteous is this where we left off, isn't it? Would someone read, let's get some Bibles out here, Romans chapter 4, would you read Romans 4, 4 through 6? We did read that one, I think, but it's worth reading again. And then other people with Bibles, raise your hand if you have a Bible and you're willing to read. Would you read John 3, 3? And would you read John 1, 13? And would you read 2 Corinthians 5, 17? You don't have to, you don't want to. Okay, you don't have to anything here. This is totally non-manipulative. And then Acts 2.38. Who's got another Bible? Would you read Acts 2.38? And who else is the Bible? Would you read Galatians chapter 3, 5 and 14? When you are saved, you are justified. You are born from above. We'll see. You're given a new nature, a new internal principle, and you're filled with the Holy Spirit. A lot of great things happen to you the moment you believe. Okay, let's read these. Romans 4, 4 through 6. Romans 4, 4 through 6. What then shall we say that Abraham, our poor father, discovered in this matter? If in fact Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about, but not before God. What does the scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness. Now, when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an obligation. However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness. David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works. Oh, this is just too good. That verse, you know, just soak that up a couple times. Paul is so radical here. He's just so radical. You know, there's two ways to do one of all things. You can work or you can get it by a gift. All right? I mean, you can work and get righteous that way, and then God will owe you a debt. You work and he pays you off. Or you get it all for free. Paul later on in this chapter goes on to say, you know, if it's of works, it can't be of grace. If it's of grace, it can't be of works. But God will be a debtor to no one. God never owes anyone anything, especially not sinners like us. So works is ruled out. But blessed is the one who... And he says, blessed is the one who doesn't work, who enjoys being on welfare, okay? And believes in God, who justifies the wicked. It's wicked people that God justifies. The only people God ever justifies are wicked. Your prerequisite is you have to be wicked, you have to be a sinner to be justified. Fortunately, everyone meets that condition. And so we're all candidates for salvation. Blessed is the God who justifies, blessed is the man who believes that God justifies the wicked. And then he quotes David. Blessed is the man to whom God credits righteousness. God will owe no one anything, but he loves to give credit. Okay, I'll just tack on a million dollars to your account, to your account. He does it for free. This is great. And what's the prerequisite? Well, let's look at all the people who aren't working. People who have burned out and working. People who have just given up that whole show. People who have come to the end of themselves and who are wicked. I like those kind of people, and I will credit them as being righteous. They believe on what I've done on the cross. It's great stuff. I love that stuff. Okay, so you're justified. Bam. That means you're rendered perfectly compatible with God. That's the legal aspect of salvation. You're made compatible with God. It really happens. God takes his righteousness, credits it to you, takes your sin, throws it away, as far as the east is from the west, and now you're compatible with God. That's the legal part of it. It doesn't stop there. That's just the beginning. That saves you. But there's many other things that are involved in salvation. Talk about the new birth. John 3.3. You probably won't get it. Go ahead. Let's talk about being born again. Born again, there's really bad a change in me. Ever heard that song? Born again. This is one of those country western 20s songs. I can't stand it. Just like Jesus said. The word actually in Greek is not born again. The word in Greek is anothen, which means born from above. All this born again terminology stuff, it's really not based on a good translation. Oh, again isn't too bad. The word actually came in again, but that's a secondary meaning. The main meaning is unless you're born from above, from on high. So when you believe, you are given a new existence. You're born a second time. But what's more important than the chronology of it is where you were born. See, sometimes when people say you're born again, they're looking for some kind of momentous, dramatic conversion experience. You have to be born again. That means at the age of 15 or something, you had to have a crisis in your life and fall on the altar and it had to be real dramatic. And some people didn't get saved that way. They just sort of kind of, somewhere along the line they caught it. And it took hold. And they didn't have any kind of dramatic experience. And then they feel like second class Christians. Or maybe not genuine Christians at all. Because they never get this wapo experience. But the thrust of John 3.3 is not like a chronological happening. The main thrust of it is the origin of the new birth. The origin of it. And the origin is from above. You're born from above. You were born from your mother, but now you're born from above. You receive something from a different source, from a source on high, which is as dramatic as your first birth. Sometimes it's as painful. But it comes from above. What does John 1.13 say? Okay. Those who believe. As many as received him, and then he gave power to become the Son of God. And who are those people who are the children of God? Those who are born not of blood. Okay, so it's not a normal birth here. Nor of the will of the flesh. Again, it's not your willing that is the primary ingredient in salvation. God has to work in your heart first for you to will it. So it's not your own, like all of a sudden, I will today become a Christian. God has to work in your heart first. So it's not of human will. Nor of the will of man. I don't know what the difference of those two things are, but there's probably some difference. But it's not a human will, but you're born by the will of God. Okay, so it comes from God. So there's a new birth. You're a new child, a new creature in Christ Jesus. Okay, out of that new birth, you receive a new nature. What is the nature? Who had 2 Corinthians 5.17? if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. Oh, that's great. You're a new creation. You know, when God, and this again just shows the whole grace of the matter, when you were created the first time, you didn't really cooperate with that, did you? I mean, God didn't ask your opinion about whether or not you're going to be created. He did it. It was all his doing. So also with your second birth, it's all his doing. All glory goes to God. He creates you a new creature in Christ Jesus. Now, unlike the first creation, there's something already there. You know, God said, let there be light, and there was light, and there's nothing to resist it. Well, he says, let there be light again. In fact, if you read 2 Corinthians 4, verse 6, Paul uses Genesis 1, 6 to describe the new creation that happens in our soul. As God said, let there be light in the beginning, so he said, let there be light in our soul, and there was light. The same God who speaks life speaks it into our existence when we're saved. The difference is, when he says it the second time, there's already something there. And so there is resistance. But it's all his doing. We'll talk about it. That's why all of a sudden, you say, oh, we're new creatures in Christ Jesus. We have the righteousness of Christ. Why do we act like sinners? Well, there's an old self still hanging around that we've got to talk about. It's on its way out. But it takes a while for it to get out, like a lifetime. But the point here is that we're new creatures in Christ Jesus. We have a new nature. There's a new internal principle. and what that principle basically comes to is this we could do a big study on this but we don't have time but it's it's what Paul calls warring against the flesh and the spirit there's two modes of there's two kinds of people in the world there are those who live in the flesh and what's most decisive about them is not what they do but what they love and then there are people who are walking in the spirit and what's decisive about them is not what they do, but what they love. Or maybe even more fundamental, it's where do you get your life? If you're living in the natural existence, you're a non-Christian, you're unregenerate, you don't have a new nature, you don't have a higher principle, then what is your life to you? What is the meaning of life? What's the purpose of life? What's the driving force of life? It will be your job, or your car, or your image, or your home, Or your kids, or money, or fame, or your singing ability, or recognition. What is it that gets you going? What's your identity? What are you about? What makes life to some degree meaningful? It will be the things of the world. Because that's all there is for you. That's all you know. You're a product of your environment. And so you'll latch on to the things around you to give your life. If you are a regenerate person, a person who's been saved, and given a new birth, and therefore given a new nature, there is something different in you, a driving force about you, where all of a sudden the things in this world don't satisfy. God makes sure that they don't satisfy. You begin to see them as empty, shallow, meaningless, stupid. In a weird way, they still attach to us. We still find ourselves worrying way too much about what we look like and what people think about us. But we at least see that it's stupid to do that. And there's something, a fundamental principle in our existence that drives us beyond that that says, what's life to us is Christ. And the only thing that's ever going to make me feel meaningful and important and lovable and worthwhile and make life valuable is my relationship to Jesus Christ. That's the essence of the new nature, a new nature. It's not mainly a good deed doing thing. It's an orientation of your heart that you love something that the world can't possibly give. You love something, someone, that the world can't possibly see. All of a sudden, you begin to be weaned from the death grip that the material world holds on you. And you see, this isn't life. You still want to be as best as you can at your job, and you still have to eat, and so you've got to make money and all those things, but that's not the meaning of your life. Nothing in this world is the meaning of your life, because you realize that when you die, it becomes worm food. The only meaning of your life is something that goes on forever and ever and ever, and that's a gift of God for you to see that. That's the new nature. They're born from above, and all of a sudden, there's this tendency to look above. You start looking above. And as you turn your eyes upon Jesus, the things of this world grow strangely dim. They kind of lose their value, don't they? Things that people think are so important are so utterly stupid. They really are, I mean, honestly. So you got a nice house. I'm impressed. Everyone's impressed. But I'm going to die, and they're going to die, and you're going to die. And who cares what kind of house you died in once you're six feet after? you know and do you really what are you gonna do with that big house you don't even need that big a house and now you gotta live with a conscience because there's there's two-thirds of the world that's starving to death how do you sleep at night and now you got to pay the bills and they got all you got to maintain the thing i mean it looks to me like that's a pretty stupid ambition in life one good way to witness to people start asking them you know what's your life about what's your goal in life okay it can get like an awkward you know they think well i want a promotion oh well then But then what? Well then maybe I want to take over the company. Oh, that's good. And then what? I want to make a lot of money. I want to get a nice better car. I want to get a new house. Okay, and then what? And then I start getting kind of uncomfortable. What do you mean, then what? Then I'll retire. And then what? What do you want in my life? Just be comfortable. And then what? And then you die. And then you become MAGA JUICE! I wouldn't say just like that, but that's what happens to you. It goes nowhere. But see, you wake people up to the stupidity of chasing things in this world. Everything you have is going to go. Okay, so you're given a new birth. You're given a new nature. A new orienting principle. That's what I call it. A new orientating principle. Now out of that will come the fruit of the Spirit. The good deed doing stuff is a footnote to it. You can't help but die to this world and then your behavior starts to change. But the change is not the behavior. The behavior is the footnote to the change. The change is in the heart. Really important to know, you guys. You know what? Behavior is never the issue. It never is the issue. Behavior is simply a footnote to a heart. There's a heart, and the heart will bring forth a footnote. Behavior. And the behavior more or less will reflect the heart, but not accurately, because you can have a great heart and a bad behavior, and you can have a rotten heart and a lot of good behavior. So behavior is never the issue. It's the heart that that's the issue. Trouble is, see, we can't measure the heart, and so we always like to look at behavior as a criteria for things. That's why churches love to manipulate behavior. The assumption is if you can just manipulate the behavior and get the behavior looking good, then the person is good, which is a totally fallacious assumption. Just ask the Pharisees. But behavior is never the issue. And that's not only true about God's relationship to us, but it should be true of our relationship with each other, especially our relationship with our kids. Behavior is not the issue. Learn to look beyond the behavior, which is to say, learn to see things as Jesus sees them. Because, you know, people act out, and if you shoot at the behavior, you could be missing the whole thing altogether. What is bringing forth this behavior? What's more important than the fact that your kid sass back to you is what's going on in their head that let her sass back. You've got to look at the fundamental issues of life, and behavior is never a fundamental issue. so add best of footnote oh that was just a free piece of advice take it for what you will it's not a basic Christian doctrine it is a basic Christian doctrine I just made it a basic Christian doctrine okay filled with the Holy Spirit Acts 2.38 okay and we're going to talk about the baptism thing in a little bit here but here what I want you to see is that receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit is associated with repentance, with believing, with the initial act of becoming a Christian. It is the assumption throughout the New Testament that all believers have the Holy Spirit. What happens is this. Jesus dies for you. Sin's no longer the issue. You accept that. You're cleansed from all your sin. God says, that's where I want to live. And the Holy Spirit, which is God's third way of existing, he comes and exists within you. He takes residence within you in a way that he didn't before i mean in one sense god's everywhere right but now he's living in a dynamic forceful way he's residing there god almighty dwells within you you know why god almighty dwells within you it's it's to be an infinite reservoir of power in your life that's why the holy spirit in the christian life is always associated with empowering and direction and wisdom and all the other things but an infinite reservoir of power Christians have an infinite reservoir of dynamic living ability within them we don't usually tap into it but it's there we are walking gold mines and yet we live impoverished lives a lot because we don't know how to write checks out on the gold mine the analogy didn't work but it just came on top of my head so forget it okay what about Galatians chapter 3 verse 5 okay in verse 14 Okay. The thrust of these two passages is this. The Galatians were on fire Christians. they were regenerate, or at least they appeared to be totally regenerate, and now they're going into a form of legalism. They're getting circumcised. They're trying to obey all the laws. They're trying to earn in their own basis what God gave them for free. So Paul says this. Let me ask you a question, Galatians. Did God give you the Holy Spirit when you believed because you obeyed him or simply because you trusted him? And then in verse 14 he says, you know, this promise that was to Abraham, this was the promise of the Holy Spirit. Now, did you get that because you were such good deed-doers, or did you get it by trusting in Jesus Christ? The point there that Paul's making is, obviously, that you receive the Holy Spirit by trusting in Jesus Christ. When you believe in Him, He sends forth His Holy Spirit like He promised He would do, read John 14 through 16. He was always talking about that. When I ascend on high, I will send forth the promise of the Father among you. And that's something that you have by believing in Him. The Holy Spirit comes and takes residence in Him. That's all part of this new... So here's what's going on. You're justified legally. You're rendered compatible with God. You're given a new birth. And then you are given a new nature. A new orientating principle. And not only that, you're given God Himself in your life to empower you to do that. To empower you to, with this new nature, grow out of the old self. We'll talk more about that shortly. But all this is given to you the moment that you believe. That's what salvation is about. Questions or comments about that? Questions, comments? Yeah. I love questions. You know that. It's kind of a what? Nothing is. the manifestation of the Holy Spirit will reveal you if you need to have a tongue okay wait a minute that's weird that's a very good question okay in fact we're going to deal with that that's one of the issues I want to deal with the question was someone's told this wonderful young lady but it's not to someone there's a lot of people who say this that when you're filled with the Holy Spirit you speak in tongues and that's a necessary thing to happen. If you haven't spoken in tongues, then you don't have the Holy Spirit. And we need to talk about that. There are four issues I'm going to run through very quickly that relate to salvation. Since this is a class in basic Christian doctrine, I told you I wanted to give you sort of a spectrum of what different Christians think about things. So I'll give you some views here. And let's talk about them. The first issue is this, and this was one of the major issues historically. And that is, are you predestined? Are Christians predestined to be saved? And in fact, some of what I just told you about salvation would make it look like you are predestined. I mean, after all, if your salvation is 100% God's doing, if God has to open up your heart for you to believe, if the Father has to enable you to come unto Jesus Christ, John 6, 44, if all that's true, Then it seems, well then the question is, why doesn't God do that to everybody? It seems as though God only does it to some. He says, I'll give you the ability to believe, and I won't give it to them. Because it's very clear that what distinguishes the Christian from the non-Christian is not the Christian's goodwill. Okay, hey, we're smart enough and we will enough so that we're going to believe in Jesus, and these other people aren't. That's not the case, because even our faith is a gift from God. So the question is, if faith is a gift from God, how is it that you don't have a God who chooses some to be saved and others not to be saved? One answer is to say, as a matter of fact, God does choose some people to be saved and not others to be saved. He chooses them to go to hell. He predestines some to be saved. He predestines others to go to hell. And this is called classic Calvinism. We talked a little bit about that a couple weeks ago. And there are a lot of Protestants who believe this today, in fact. In fact, I would hazard a guess that, oh, if I had to be pinned, I'd say 40% of all evangelical scholars are Calvinists, of one sort or another, who believe in its predestination. And there are some passages which really seem to support it. Let me just give you one. Ephesians 1, 4-11. Paul there says I can't remember exactly what he says so let me just kind of read it here Ephesians chapter 4 chapter 1 says this for he chose us this is Paul speaking now for he the father chose us in him that is to say Jesus Christ before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight in love he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ in accordance with his good pleasure and will. It sounds like the whole thing was written in stone before the world began. And then also in verse 11, he says this, In him we were also chosen. The word there in Greek is eklektos, which means to elect. We were also chosen or elected or selected, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will. All right, what do you think? What are you going to do with that? any ideas yes yeah well if the whole human race was predestined to be saved it seems like when paul he says we're predestined to be in christ blameless and spotless and and so if it was predestined why isn't the whole world saved okay she wants to to help you all right that'd be one way of saying it it's a weak sense of predestined um he predestined but not certainly uh i'm trying to think here out loud with he predestined the possibility of you being saved i don't know i think about that one that that's one that i haven't uh worked out to have to say something is predestined and yet it doesn't have to happen usually predestined means it does have to happen see there you go i mean there's a lot of verses which clearly say i mean ezekiel 33 ezekiel 18 second peter 3 9 i think it is get god's not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance he takes no delight in the destruction of the wicked but works that they may all turn and come again to repentance uh i mean very clearly the lord has universal love and be a weird it'd be weird if it would not be the god revealed in jesus christ if we had a god who is sort of half in love and half in hatred towards the human race because jesus christ reveals if jesus christ reveals the father he had his love right he didn't go around saying i reject half of you um so so something else has to be going on there i mean that that's what makes this passage problematic okay but to choose whether they want our how about self-determination I don't think we have. I mean, when it comes right down to God, I mean, if we do choose, we're going to go to hell, right? I mean, if we choose the wrong word here, we're going to go to hell. Yeah, yeah. That's exactly what I would call free will. Well, maybe the way to hell. Well, but, you know, it's this whole thing. Choose you this day whom you shall serve, Joshua 7. You have it on your plaque at home. Choose of this day whom you shall serve, but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord. The ability to choose, I think that's there. And that's why the Bible is always calling us to choose. It doesn't assume we have an ability to choose. Let me just lay out another way of looking at that. Let's say, there's two ways of interpreting these passages, as you'd expect. The Calvinists say that what was predestined are individual people. When Paul says we were predestined in Christ Jesus, He means we individuals in the church were predestined to be in Christ Jesus. But there's another way of looking at that. And this is, in fact, I'll tell you, the way I look at it. Let's say that we were watching a movie in this class. I decided to show a movie in this class for some stupid reason. And then in the middle of this movie, Lana says, when was it decided that we were going to watch this movie? She really thinks the movie is dumb. So she says, when was it decided that we were going to watch this movie? and Angie says, well, I think it was decided about two years ago because he wrote up the syllabus two years ago and he decided two years ago that we were going to have to watch this stupid movie. Now what's going on? It's true that now that in this class it was decided that you were going to watch this movie two years ago yet it wasn't decided or predestined two years ago that you individually were going to watch this movie but it was decided that whoever was going to be in the class would watch this movie. And so now that you're in the class, you can say, it was predestined two years ago that we would have to watch this movie. But it wasn't predestined that you would have to be in that class. So also, we can say that in Christ, we were predestined from the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. That's what Paul says. Because if you're in Christ, you're holy and blameless in his sight. And apparently, before the creation of the world, God decided that there were going to be a people who were going to be holy and blameless in his sight. Hook or crook, he was going to do it. because that's the only kind of people that would ever be compatible with him. So he predestines from the foundation of the world that there would be a people holy and blameless in his sight. Now that we're in that, we're in Christ Jesus, we can say it was predestined that we would be holy and blameless in his sight. So it wasn't predestined that we individually would be holy and blameless in his sight. It was just predestined that whoever would be in Christ would be holy and blameless. Do you see the difference there? It's not an unnatural way of talking at all. This view would say what's predestined is a corporate identity. A corporate identity. Romans 8 says we are predestined to be conformed to his image. Does that mean that we individually were? That I had no choice in the matter? That from the foundation of the world it was decided that Greg Boyd would be conformed to his Christ image? That goes against everything in my experience. Because I feel like I have a freedom to choose. But maybe it means that anyone who is going to believe on Jesus Christ, if you believe on Jesus Christ, now it's predestined that you're going to be conformed to his image. sooner or later oh you can struggle all you want but you're going to in heaven look like Jesus Christ and that's predestined okay if you keep on believing in the Lord just hang on with him it will eventually come okay this also relates to the question does the Holy Spirit override our free will when the Lord opened Lydia's heart did he just ignore Lydia's heart to do it the Calvinists say the Lord just comes in and opens up the heart and says you have no choice in the matter I give you faith and now you're going to believe. This is called irresistible grace. But if you accept the corporate view of predestination and you're not a Calvinist, you won't go with that interpretation. It's true the Lord has to open up my heart and give us the ability to believe, but that doesn't mean that we can't resist him. The analogy I like to use is this. The question is this. If we're saved totally by grace and if God has to open up our heart, then now it seems like we don't have any free will but but i want to argue that we do have free will even though our decision to believe in the lord is the result of his working in our life not the basis of it the lord doesn't love me because i believe i believe because he loves me here's how i here's an analogy i conceive of it um this picture these all of these walls lined with speakers okay here's these speakers and god's going to play a symphony for us and let's say salvation is listening to this beautiful symphony because this symphony will just change your life it will give you a new orientation it will just melt your heart etc etc he wants everyone in this room he wants everyone in this room to uh to hear this symphony the symphony starts playing and we all go like this we just cover up our ears we don't want to hear it that's that's called rebellion that's called sin and that's what all of us do and the bible says we are dead in sin or in this analogy we are deaf in sin we resist god we're by nature children of wrath okay so the lord gives us the opportunity to hear and we we don't want to hear so then the holy jesus comes and and i can't fit him in the analogy right here but he dies for us so that we now our deafness is no longer an issue with him and the holy spirit comes put your hands over your ear don't you think this guy's really weird i mean he can't hear what we're saying so i might as well use this time to talk about how weird mark is hi mark no okay now you heard that okay okay put your hands over here the holy Spirit comes, and now the Holy Spirit starts to pull at our hearts. Fight me on this. The Holy Spirit starts to pull and pull, and all of our life, he's pulling and pulling. And gradually, with some people, he can break that stronghold, and now Mark begins to hear the music. And all of a sudden, something starts to dawn on him. He starts saying, why was I resisting so long? This is beautiful music. And then he goes around and starts telling other people, hey, you've got to listen to this music but see their ears are covered up too but the holy spirit is pulling the arms away and the holy spirit breaks our callousness breaks our our stronghold against him so now that mark's arms are down mark can say the holy spirit is the one who gave me the ability to hear it was all the holy spirit's doing if it wasn't for the lord playing the music sending jesus christ and coming and yanking my arms away i i never would have heard the music but it's also true that mark could have eternally resisted the Holy Spirit's pull. In fact, the more you resist that pull, the stronger your biceps get, and the better you are at resisting it. And the unforgivable sin comes is when your biceps are so big, they can resist God forever. Okay? And so that's the difference between the Christian and the non-Christian is not in how smart one is or what they do or what kind of sin they have in their life or anything like that. It's a matter of, Is your heart breakable? Can God get in there and through the Holy Spirit chisel? Is there something redeemable there? You're dead in sin on your own. You're going to hell on your own. But the Lord can salvage you. The question is, how hard is your heart? And if your heart is meltable, God will melt it. He'll work in there. He doesn't give up. That's how I see the analogy. So it's true that the Lord has to work in our hearts. It's true we could not believe without the Lord, but it's not true that we had no decision in the process. There was an element of free will involved there. That's just my way of doing it. Any feedback on that? Yeah? Yeah. I think people are just having a struggle with it. I don't know. I remember when I was 10 years old, I was 16 years old and I couldn't figure out why I couldn't get out this back in college and I don't know. I don'T know. I asked my mom why it's like, why doesn't you take all that away from me? and just help him grow up. I don't know. She says it's a small robot. That's true. He wants people to love him because he does. He wants that because he makes him. Which kind of goes contrary to what he says about that. No, I don't think it does at all. No, I don't think it does at all. I agree that God, it's like right now I would love to get some kind of written guarantee from heaven that my kids are going to grow up and be okay. I love that. That means no physical harm going to come to them. They're going to be sound Christians. They're going to be on fire for the Lord. I would love that more than anything. But it ain't going to happen. Because to do that would have to, you know, be to turn them into automatons. And God, God apparently, I mean, obviously, the good of risking them turning away is better than the evil of the risk of them possibly turning away is better than the evil of turning them into robots. God gives people the space to violate him, to go against him. And so I, as a parent, kind of have to do that. I mean, I have to be wise in how much freedom I give, but I also need to know that I can't possibly tyrannize them into living the kind of life I want them to live. In fact, I've seen parents do that, and the result is extremely dysfunctional kids who aren't free. Whoever don't have, I mean, they grow up weird because they're not the way God intended them to be. I can't tyrannize them into that. I can't manipulate this into them. I have to give them space and try to win them over the way God does us. But it also says something, I think, profound about politics. And I'm not going to go into this, but it's basically this. See, theology connects with everything. Everything is related to theology. But it's this. Apparently, freedom is the greatest value God sees in the world. And if God sees that as the ultimate freedom, giving people the freedom to do even bad things, then it seems to me that as human beings, again, we should see people like that too. And far more important for me than getting you to conform to who I want you to be is to encourage you to be the person you're supposed to be.
