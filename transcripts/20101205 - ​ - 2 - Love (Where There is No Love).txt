Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Well, greetings everyone. My name is Steve, and if you are visiting Open Door, if you're new here, we're thrilled that you're here. we're in an Advent series. This is week two of Advent. And I was reading this week and I came across this amazing quote that I think sums up Advent. And it goes like this. It gets darker and darker. And then Jesus is born. And so what we're trying to do in these weeks is in song and in story connect into the longing. that we all have for the light of the world to come in this dark place. So last week, it was hope. We lit that candle and heard an amazing story of a woman that found hope where there is no hope. And this morning, we're taking a look at love. So pray with me as we dive in. Now, Jesus, love wins. we believe that. But for love to win, it has to overcome a lot of evil and a lot of darkness. So we pray, Lord, today, right now, send your spirit with light that reveals who we are and casts away darkness. Amen? Amen. There's going to be some images that are going to come up on the screens. and I want you to look at them. And as they come up, check them out. And then what I want you to do is connect back to the first feeling you had when you saw those images come up. For most of us, it's a kind of evaluation. I'm not talking about the feeling after the feeling, but the first feeling was probably some sort of evaluation. I want you to think about when you're driving down the road, and all of a sudden you come to a stoplight, and there's a person there. Instead of just a stoplight and other cars, there's actually a person standing out in the intersection, and that person has a little sign that maybe reads, We'll work for food. and the first thought that you have might be, oh no, do I make eye contact? If I do, will that obligate me to do something? Or, oh, what's he doing out here? Why doesn't he get a job? Or what kind of system, what kind of world do we live in that forces people out on the streets to ask for money? The system is wrong. So you might have thoughts of evaluation. You might also have an association that you would make to a person that you know, a name, a face, that you've met out on the streets. It might even be a memory, because maybe that was you. Maybe that is you Well, I'd like to invite you to open your Bibles to Matthew chapter 20 Sort of atypical Advent sermon text It's the parable of the workers in the vineyard And Jesus told parables Primarily because he was speaking to an audience That really had a misperception of who God is and so Jesus told this story kind of like a you know Jedi master weaving an intricate plan and he would tell a story that everyone's I know that story this is a great story but then he would this is where the Jedi master comes in with a twist at the end that would blow their minds and so the purpose of parables in Jesus's mind anyway was to say you're thinking about God wrong, and I want to paint a better picture. So Matthew 20, starting in verse 1, we read these words, for the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard, and he agreed to pay them a denarius, that's a day's wage, for the day, and sent them into his vineyard. Verse 3, but about nine in the morning he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing. He told them, you also, you go work in my vineyard and I will pay you, this is interesting, not a denarius, but whatever is right. Okay, so they went. He went out again about noon and again at three in the afternoon and did the same thing at about five in the afternoon. He went out and found still others standing around. He asked then why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing? Because no one has hired us, they answered. So he said to them, you also go and work in my vineyard. So as I read this parable, questions pop into my mind. And really, that's my opinion of how you should read the Bible. You should read the Bible with it in one hand and a pen in the other hand. Or a pen on the page saying, what? what no way i don't get that so i wrote down a bunch of questions and it came to three it always comes to three uh nonetheless first question is this it says the landowner went out got in his truck flatbed and drove out to where the workers were because he needed workers for the vineyard. My question is, why was it the landowner that did that? Certainly, this is in a time where a landowner would be exceedingly wealthy. There was no middle class back in the first century. There was really, really, really wealthy people, and that was just a few, and then the rest of everybody that were pretty much living from day to day or in desperate poverty. So the landowner goes out after having a cup of coffee, fires up the F-350 and drives out to the marketplace where there are day laborers waiting for work. Why is it that the landowner does that? Because my picture of a wealthy landowner is a picture of a lazy boy. I'm not saying he is a lazy boy. I'm saying he sits in a chair all day. That's what he could do. That's his prerogative. He just sits there and goes, maybe he has one with a little fridge in there, you know? A beverage of choice. He's got the remote in one hand, he's got the phone in another hand, and he's ordering people to do stuff. That's my picture of a wealthy landowner. That's what they've worked so hard to be able to do. So why is it that the landowner goes out to hire workers? Well, it turns out that this story is not a normal story. It's a love story. And what love does is it gets up off the couch and moves toward people. Love always gets up, sets the alarm, and engages. In the scriptures we read that God is not loving. God is love. and love gets up off the couch and moves toward people now this last friday night you remember friday night remember what happened in the afternoon well you live in minnesota but we're aghast every time this happens ah paul douglas is finally right i guess we're gonna really get the snow this time and then but it all, you know, it came right around rush hour. So I remember reading my friends who were tweeting along the way, and apparently they were tweeting while they were driving, which, you know, is a bit of a problem. But, you know, it was just hashtags, white knuckles, hour and a half later, I'm stressed out. I mean, all this stuff. It was crazy. So you remember how that was? Well, I was working that day kind of late into the night, and I got home about 10 at night on Friday night, and I expected to, you know, I was gearing up for my little Honda Civic to have to just plow through a mountain of snow in my driveway to get into my garage. But when I got home, my driveway was clear, and I thought, wow, it snowed every other part of Minnesota except for my driveway. No, I thought, I wonder which one of my neighbors did this. And that is love in action. Love doesn't just have the idea. I should shovel their driveway. I saw him drive out tonight. I should, love says, I'm doing it. I'm doing it. There's a woman in our congregation, single mom, and she has teenage kids. But she met this younger single mom who is in a really bad time in her life and was without a place to live. And so this single mom from Open Door said, well, you got to live with us. You know, and so I assume one of the teenagers got kicked out of the room or something. But this family talks about it like this. They get wide-eyed and they go, We get to live with someone who helps us see who God is. They're like excited about what they're being invited into by God, but that came because they were willing to say, oh, I'm moving toward, I'm getting off the couch. And what that means is you're willing to be inconvenienced and uncomfortable, right? See, we say love wins around here. And maybe for some of you, you get a picture, love wins. It's like, love, cue the violin. Teary-eyed movies, sipping cocoa. Love is always willing to get up off the couch and move toward, to be inconvenienced, to be uncomfortable. I want you to think about someone in your life. for whom you might get up off the couch. This might be a co-worker, and it might be something really little that you might think to do. One idea would be on Monday morning to come with a donut and place it before them. Now, donuts get a really bad rap in these days and these days of health, but I guarantee you, if you bought someone a donut and put it in front of them on Monday morning, a little hot cup of coffee, and just said, just look like a donut day, that person would weep with gratitude might be, Jan talked about you know, we, it's so amazing, you guys we have 43 needs cards come in, that means people that said Christmas is going to be terrible if this doesn't, if we're not going to be able to buy this or our kids aren't going to get presents, so 30 of those cards have already gone, we have 13 left it might be one of you after the service going, well I can do a card I can go out to the beyond our door wall and pick up a card love gets up off the couch and moves now I want you to think about someone for whom you might be able to get up off the couch and then think about something you might do okay could be small writing a little note could be big now you got that person and that thing in your mind, what I want you to do is turn to the person next to you and don't tell them what you're going to do. Don't tell them who you're going to do it for, but just say these words. Look them in the eyes and say, I am going to laugh. I am, say this, I am getting off the couch. Okay, go. Go. Now some of you rebels are like cheesy. Jersey, church experiment. I hate when they do that. Don't be a hater. You have an opportunity to get off the couch. Go do it. Second question that raises in my mind as I read this story is this. It says that the landlord went out at 6 a.m. Again, get the picture of flatbed truck moving out there to the marketplace. My question is, why didn't, he seems like an organized guy. Why didn't he get all the workers he needed at 6 a.m.? Seems like a terribly inefficient use of his really important time to go back at 9 and noon and 3 and 5. The day ends at 6, bro. What are you doing at 5? Why doesn't he get all the workers he needed at 6 a.m.? Well, the text doesn't say why. But when you've heard this text before, perhaps you assume that the text says that when he goes out at 9 and noon and 3 and 5, he goes out with the purpose of finding more workers. But the text does not say that. The text simply says he goes out. And then he sees workers in the marketplace. So my answer is this. I think he did get all the workers he needed at 6 a.m. But I think when he was meeting his friends at the coffee shop to talk current events, as he was taking his first sip of coffee, he looked across to that place he was at three hours ago, and he goes, Whoa, you guys, there's more workers there now. They probably have families. They need to work. So he gets up out of his chair, leaves the coffee shop, goes out to the marketplace, says, you guys, you guys need work? And they're like, you bet, sir. All right. Head on to my vineyard and I'll pay you whatever's fair. You see, love, remember this is a love story. Love pays attention and seizes opportunities to include more. That's what love does. Love pays attention and seizes the opportunity to invite others in. This landowner couldn't sit there and drink his espresso. He had to get up and say, guys. I kind of hired guys at 6 a.m. Don't know where you guys were at that point, but I got more room, so come. I had the opportunity a few weeks ago to talk to this guy named Nathan George, and he's the founder of this organization called Trade as One that Jen talked about. This global marketplace of fair trade products that's out in the gathering place was all his dream, and when I talked to him, I heard a story, and his story goes something like this. He grew up in the church. He's from the UK. But he got very disillusioned with the fact that even though he went to church every week, he didn't see the church making a difference in the world in terms of poverty and in terms of just making the world a better place. And so he sort of lost his faith. He went through a crisis of faith. But then he slowly began to search the scriptures for God's heart for the poor and God's heart for injustice. And what he found was, was a God that gets up off the couch and moves toward people, especially people for whom the rest of society has cast aside. So he had this crazy idea. What if he said, what if I could get church people, people that really care about doing God's kingdom, what about if I got them to think not just about the 10% that we ask people to give to the church, but about the other 90%, the money that they already spend on coffee and food and all that stuff. And what if I could ask them to start seeing a different opportunity for how to spend their money, the other 90%, maybe I could ask them to think about seeing third world country business owners who are selling things that they needed anyway. And maybe I could get them to solve their problem as well as people in developing worlds. problem. Maybe we could begin through fair trade to be a win-win situation. And I thought his vision was so compelling. And churches all over the country have done it. Upper Room in Minneapolis have engaged in that. Willow Creek in Chicago has engaged in this. And so when it became time for us, when the invitation came to us, will you partner with us? When we heard the vision, we said, oh, this is exactly the kind of thing Open Door loves to do. Move toward people who for whatever reason have been cast aside by society and decide to use the money that we would already spend on items that would actually help someone end their own cycle of poverty. So I want you to check out this two and a half minute video. This explains Trade as One Vision. You know it's strange but the more stuff we get the more entitled we feel. We become preoccupied busy driven people. We lose all sense of gratitude and our generosity disappears. And we're reduced to being just consumers. We live in this system that ruthlessly targets us, that manipulates us and before we know it enslaves us. And meanwhile, half of the world's population lives on less than $2 a day. And no matter how gifted, intelligent or hardworking they are, there's no escape. They don't have access to jobs, to resources, to justice, or even to clean water. have little education and nobody they know can help. Now what if an answer to our problem could also be an answer to theirs? What if our spending could actually be used to fix problems instead of creating them? What if the money we spent could save a life? With fair trade, small changes to our spending habits here can transform whole communities there. We get things we need like coffee, olive oil, chocolate, soap, bags, t-shirts, gifts, all made by the poor who now earn a living wage. Made sustainably and made without slavery or child labor. What they get are jobs that bring them dignified work, that break cycles of dependency and that free them from abuse. Churches all over America are partnering with Traders One to mobilize their people to buy fair trade and be good news to the poor. Their purchases have brought dignity, stability, and hope to some of the darkest places in the world. And think about this. If every person who attended church in this country made just one fair trade purchase, one million families would be lifted out of poverty for one whole year. So join us. Your spending can change lives. So you're going to get the opportunity to check that out and be a part of something that I think brings light to the world. What happens when you get up off your couch is found in Matthew 20, verse 3, When we read about nine in the morning, the landowner went out and saw others. Love looks up, goes out, and sees others that nobody else sees. I want to read the rest of this story because it's very compelling. has a very riveting ending, worthy of an Oscar. Verse 8, Matthew chapter 20. When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his supervisor, listen, I want you to call the workers and pay them their wages. Now remember, the early workers agreed to work for a denarius, and the rest of the workers agreed to work for whatever is right. Okay? Then he says this. Call the workers and pay them the wages, beginning with the last ones hired, and then going on to the first. So the workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came, and each received a denarius. Now, that raises a question for me. Number one, it's interesting that everybody receives a denarius. No matter how long you worked, whether it's one hour or 12 hours, everyone receives a denarius. But my question is this, why did the landowner, Why was it so important for him that the people that came at 5 o'clock and only worked an hour, that they were paid first? Did you notice that? Why is that a central part of this love story? Well, let's read the rest of the story, starting in verse 10. So when those came who were hired first, sweaty after working 12 hours a day, I want you to picture this scene. Imagine you're that person. You've agreed to work for a denarius, and you've worked all day. It's been hot. It's been really hard work. And maybe you've been working so hard that you don't even know that people have come throughout the day. And then you see the scene, like people that aren't sweaty, they're still looking great. And you see what they receive. They receive a denarius. So verse 10, when those who came were hired first, here's what happened. they expected to receive more. Which is fair, right? Here's the deal, though. I ran across this quote this week that says this, Grace is always amazing grace, but grace that can be calculated and expected is no longer grace. each one of them also received a denarius. When they received it, verse 11, they began to grumble against the landowner, which is exactly what you and I would do. These men who were hired last worked only one hour, they said. And this is really interesting. It reveals a lot. And you have made them equal to us. Whoa. To which the landowner said, who makes people equal to each other? Well, that's interesting. You've made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and at the heat of the day, but the landowner answered to them this. Friend, I'm not being unfair to you. Didn't you agree to work for a denarius? Well, take your pay and go. But then this wonderful two words that I love. The landowner said this, I want. to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you. I want. It is my prerogative to be generous, even foolishly generous. It's my prerogative to look at you and give you what you don't deserve. That is amazing grace. And that is what Jesus is trying to get people to see who are seeing this story, who are thinking that God is a God who cares about who the first person is who shows up and who gives credit to and righteousness to those people and not the last people. Jesus is saying this. You guys, this isn't a regular story. This is a love story. And love really takes great pleasure in revealing someone else's dignity. Love really enjoys looking at a group of people that are looking at each other and measuring, saying, well, they're a little less than me. Oh, they're a little more than me. Love really enjoys saying, here's your denarius. And you who have only worked an hour, here is your denarius as well. Now it's amazing grace if you're the person that showed up at five o'clock, isn't it? If you're a five o'clock person, barely made it in, and you received that denarius, you are shocked at the generosity of the landowner. In fact, you might be so compelled to be around that landowner that you would show up at 6 in the morning the next morning just to be around the landowner. But if you're someone who showed up at 6 a.m., the temptation would be to cross your arms and say, I can't believe this. And Jesus stands in the middle of those people and says, listen, friends, we are all desperately in need of amazing grace. And I want you to see this person as a person of worth and dignity. Love gets up off the couch and moves toward it. And love sees what other people don't see. Love looks up from their smartphone. and sees others and invites them in and love really enjoys bestowing dignity on people who normally don't get their dignity revealed. My friend Jack, who works with the Next Gen Department and who is the computer whiz who's been tutoring you all with your door, he lives in this place where he goes by this person who signs, stands by an intersection almost every day, and the sign reads, Hello, I'm Ernest. And so he was pretty curious about this, and so one day he made some plans, and he put a chair in the back of his car, and he pulled up, and he parked his car, and he got out, and he introduced himself to this man. He said, Hi, my name's Jack. And the guy said, Hi, my name's Ernest. and Jack said listen I don't know what your story is I'd love to hear it but what I'd love to do if you're okay with it is I'd love to hold your sign for a while and I've brought this chair you know you can sit in it and I don't know you know just take a break and Ernest was like oh man he looked at the chair that's awesome but then he looked at Jack and he said but your name's Jack, right? He said, Jack, that sign says, hello, I'm Ernest. You'd be lying if you held this sign. And Jack, I really appreciate your generosity toward me, but listen, I know this might sound weird, but me holding that sign, that's my work. You might not get that, but this is what I do. So why don't you sit down in that chair and just hang for a while? You know? And Jack is like, and the tables have been turned. Because Jack took time to reveal the dignity and not, not, see, Jack didn't give dignity to anyone. he let it be revealed the dignity that was already there by locking eyes with another human being and hearing their story he revealed dignity and Jack learned a little bit about the world because he saw someone else he got up off the couch he made a plan it wasn't just an idea I should stop well oh wow remember that idea that I had that I should have stopped man that was a great idea never did it love gets up off the couch and moves toward love sees opportunities that no one else sees and love really enjoys bestowing and revealing dignity in other people that's what love does and this story is a love story and it's all about Advent it's all about this deep longing that each of us have inside of us for a love that would get up off the couch and move toward us. And that is what Jesus does in the incarnation. Jesus leaving heaven, moving toward us. Seeing us in our moments of darkness and saying, I know it's five o'clock. I know you've screwed up your whole life until now, but I got room in my vineyard. Do you want to come? It's a love that once you've come, enjoys getting everybody on the same playing field and saying, let's look at each other and let's see each other's dignity. So as we light the second candle, the candle of love, and as we prepare to move to the table, my question to you is this. Can you dare to believe that the God of love has moved toward you? Can you dare to believe that the God of love has moved toward you with intention? And no matter where you are in the spectrum of showing up early, coming late, God says this, come to my table. There is room for you. so as we move to the communion table I want to invite the communion stewards forward and what the table is is this amazing tradition that the church has done for thousands of years 2,000 years and we remember the night Jesus was betrayed when Jesus took the bread and he broke it and he said you guys to his friends this is my body broken for you take and eat and he took the cup which he said was the covenant, the new covenant. And he says, this is my blood which is poured out for you. Take and drink. And as communion is happening, the way we do it here at Open Doors, we've set up stations all around the sanctuary. And during this time, there's going to be several things happening. One is communion, and you can go to whatever communion station that is nearest to you or that you'd like to go to at any point during the next 15 minutes or so. And there's gluten-free communion elements up here at the front of the stage. So if you have a gluten allergy, you can come to those. So you can take communion. There's also going to be worship. So you can just sing and be in the presence of God as Bruce leads us in song. You can come and just pray. Kneel on the steps here and spend time alone with Jesus if that's what you need to do. And if you are bringing a child with you and you're not sure whether or not they can take communion, you need to know that's up to you. This communion table is open. It's available to anyone who is hungering for what Jesus gives them. But if you are not sure if your kid is ready, you just say, hey, could you please pray a blessing over my kid? Or you can invite your child to take communion with you. The last thing that's going to be available as we worship together is the opportunity. I would encourage you, as many of you who want to, after you've taken communion, you might just want to step out into the gathering place and really start looking at these fair trade items and consider it an act of worship that you would be doing. You would be looking. There's one piece that's a cross, and the base of the cross is made, and this is available only online, but it's made from a person in Liberia, and the base of it is made out of gun shells. This is, you know, so some of you during this set might just want to walk out and check it out. It's going to be open after the service as well, so if you don't want to do it until afterwards, that's fine as well. So worship together. Take communion. Pray if you need to, and then head out. And engage in getting up off the couch and moving towards others. Amen? Let's pray together. Jesus as we come to your table we come with gratitude and we come knowing that we didn't deserve it but you just freely gave it and it really is amazing grace and we really are hungry and thirsty for it so God thank you so much for coming Amen Thank you.
