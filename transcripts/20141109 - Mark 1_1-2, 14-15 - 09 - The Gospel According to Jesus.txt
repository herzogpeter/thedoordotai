Our scripture reading today is taken from Mark chapter 1, and it reads this. The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way. Now, after John had been taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of God and saying, the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe in the gospel. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Amen. Repent and believe in the gospel. Let's pray as we begin. That utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth that I might make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel. I pray in Jesus' name, amen. Calls it the gospel of Jesus Christ. Does Mark in the text that Vicki just read, Mark 1, verse 1, verse 14, he calls it the gospel of God, which is the gospel that Jesus came preaching. When he came preaching, the kingdom of God is at hand. It is within your reach. Repent and believe in the gospel. Euangelion is the Greek word for gospel. I think you probably know that. It simply means good news. It was a common word in Jesus' day. Again, as most of you know, I think, used to declare the good news about pretty much anything, from the wedding of a daughter to a victory in a battle to the birth of a child. I've got good news, they would declare. Euangelion is what they would say. It was the gospel they were declaring, and it was the gospel according to whoever it was who had good news. So sometimes it was the gospel according to Caesar, who maybe had won a battle, or a father who maybe had just received a daughter or a son or something like that. But this time it is the gospel according to Jesus. And Jesus calls this gospel the gospel of God. Matthew calls it the gospel of the kingdom in Matthew 4.23, which brings us this morning to the question of the day. The question is this, what exactly is the gospel? which I think is a very important question to ask, probably on any day, I suppose. But particularly on this day, given what we've been dealing with these last several weeks, where we've been asking ourselves as a church, very important question, who are we actually as a people, as a church? Bigger question, what is the church? Why are we here? What is our purpose? What is our mission? Does anybody know what is the gospel? Because our understanding of the gospel, of the story of the gospel, might just, I don't know, have something to do with our purpose as a church, as our mission as a church, and even our strategy with how it is we actually carry out the mission. Because if you forget what the actual story is, you'll kind of forget the reason, the purpose, the mission that we're here for in the first place. So the question is this, what is the gospel? But the gospel, according to Jesus, is the gospel I want us to be thinking about getting our heads around today. He called it the gospel of God. He called it the gospel. So I want us„Å® think about what we think about. Seriously, I want you to think about what you think about when you think about that word gospel, the gospel. What are we preaching when we're preaching the gospel? What are you hearing when you're hearing the gospel? What are you sharing when you're sharing the gospel? Boy, you really preached the gospel today. Really, what did I say today that sounded to you like the gospel? And what are we preaching on other days? It doesn't sound so much like the gospel. I'm serious when I ask the question here. What is the gospel? The gospel that in the words of Dallas Willard in his book, Divine Conspiracy, shocked the ancient world. This gospel according to Jesus, the gospel of God, shocked the ancient world, Willard says, into the response that we see all through the book of Acts and then beyond, as it subsequently pulled individuals into a life that was clearly not of this world and even shaped whole people groups into the character and power of God. So what is that gospel that has that kind of effect? Well, as it turns out, it depends who you ask that question to because the understanding of the gospel that has begun to kind of dominate the thinking of most, many churches anyway, Protestant churches, actually especially evangelical churches, is a gospel that has been, in my opinion, and we've talked about this before, reduced to what John Ortberg refers to as a list. A list of the minimal things you have to believe in order to get into heaven when you die. And the list includes things like this. And they're very good things. And they're things we believe. But the list includes things like this. Jesus died on a cross to forgive us of our sins. If you believe that that is true, that he actually did that for your sin, you go to heaven when you die. It was always about heaven. That is the gospel. That's what people are waiting for, listening for, that's the gospel. And if you press people, as a pastor, kind of, if you're going to preach the gospel, what you have to do is press people to make a decision about that, sometimes in the context of highly charged, decision-based, low-light, evocative music events, then you've preached the gospel. You've heard the gospel. If you heard that, you've shared the gospel. If you shared that and if you reject it, you're rejecting the gospel. Scott McKnight tells this fascinating story in his book, The King Jesus Gospel. It's a story that some of you can relate to. Actually, I have been in this kind of situation. He's 17 years old, a senior in high school, fresh into a brand new experience of faith, full of zeal for evangelism as he attended all the sessions of an evangelism explosion course at his church, so he's ready to go, and they pair him very quickly to the head deacon of the church, and on this particular day, they're going to call on a man who signed a visitor card and church the week before. They come to his house, and when he comes to the door, the first thing that Scott recognizes is this is an awkward time to come. He's got food on his lip and a sandwich in his hand, or obviously having dinner as a family. The deacon was not able, about to be deterred, however, by such worldly issues when this guy's eternal destiny is at stake. So he pressed into the house, found a way to get into the living room and sit down with this guy where they spent the next hour. But as time wore on, two things became apparent to Scott McKnight as he was in this thing. The first was this, that this man had absolutely no interest in being saved that day. Second thing that was apparent to Scott was that this deacon was sure that he did want to get saved that day. So the deacon applied every skill of persuasion he could possibly muster and at the end of the night the deacon prevailed. The man made a decision for Christ so they prayed with him. They returned to the church to give their report and when they did everyone at church said Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. But deep inside, says McKnight, I was absolutely convinced that this man had not made a decision for Christ. Yes, we had achieved our goal, but the man had achieved his goal too. Because by praying the prayer with us, he got us to leave and that's what he wanted. I never saw that man again, says McKnight, but I wanted to because I wanted to apologize, but I had no idea how to do such a thing, how to apologize for something that I believed to be true, how to apologize for something that I believed to be, at the time, the gospel, the whole gospel, but what is the gospel, particularly the gospel according to Jesus? Jesus called it the gospel of God, so repent and believe in the gospel, he said, which according to a recent study out of the University of Michigan, this is fascinating, according to the study, 75% of all Americans have done that. They have repented and believed in the gospel. But actually, the question on this survey from the University of Michigan to Americans was this. Have you ever made some kind of decision to accept, to receive, to believe in Jesus? 75% said yes, which is either very encouraging to you or very confusing. What? We're a Christian nation for sure. Okay, wow. David Kinnaman of the Barna Group does statistical studies on Americans and their faith recently released this study of teenagers between the age of 13 and 17 and found that almost 60% of the general population have made some kind of commitment to Christ, some sort of decision for Christ. That number jumps to 80% among Protestants, and it's 90% among non-mainline Protestants, of which evangelicals are a part, and that would be us, kind of. And six out of 10 Roman Catholic teens say they've made some commitment to Christ, they've made some decision for Christ, but as you would probably guess, as I give you all of those statistics, when you kind of turn the page on the survey, when they are measuring those same demographics, those same religious demographics, of some of these same people who then become 18 to 35, and now they're trying to measure some sense of their actual discipleship, their actual following of Jesus' way. That 60% among Roman Catholics drops to 6%. The 80% among Protestants drops to 20%. The 90% among non-mainline Protestants, evangelicals drops to 20%, which means that the correlation that some of us make between making a decision for Christ, which is so important, and becoming actually a mature follower of Christ isn't high. Why? Well, that would be a very long answer. I mean, there's a lot of variables involved and stuff like that, and a number of people who actually walk away from faith, come back to faith, and walking away is a very important part of coming back to a deeper understanding of something. But in this book I just mentioned, the King Jesus gospel, McKnight suggests this reason for why this incredible drop-off. And what he suggests is this, that we've developed, without maybe knowing it, a salvation culture rather than a kingdom culture or what he calls a gospel culture. Let me define it the way he does as best I can. A salvation culture to McKnight is obsessed with getting people to make a decision. It's not a bad thing. It's an important thing. But the obsession is that. To accept Jesus as your own personal savior so you go to heaven when you die. The big question in the salvation culture is who's in and who's out. And we really want you in. I wish we'd all been ready. That's a great song. Anyway, whatever. I'm not singing it. But in a salvation culture, when it's really focused solely on get them to make a decision so they go to heaven when they die, discipleship, it would be important. It would be nobody that I know who would know it doesn't matter. It matters, but it isn't critical. It's almost not said out loud, but there's something we can talk about what it means to follow Jesus. We can talk about that later, leaving the impression that it actually is kind of optional, maybe for a few hardcore, maybe discipleship is extra credit. I don't know, something like that. But then he provides this fascinating history, and he went into things that I couldn't even understand, going back to the Reformation and things like this. But this was one that came a little closer to home. He said this, when we compare some sacramental traditions, and this is really speaking to our evangelical culture, when compared to some sacramental traditions, to more modern evangelicalism, both of them have a problem. Think of sacramental religions or traditions and others. And the problem is this, both among the sacramental and the evangelical, it's getting the members to become the disciples, the members to become the followers. In sacramental liturgical traditions, and we're talking here about Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, entrance into the church, I'm quoting McKnight here, begins at baptism of the infants. continues into catechism. For some, this is an all but automatic process. The baptized become the catechized, become the members. Now, they struggle, and they do struggle with it, and they figure it out, and some people come along, but the struggle is getting the members to become the disciples. Among Protestants, evangelicals, there was kind of a protest to that. that's thus protestants um and and here's his quote again the assumption that church bodies can baptize infants and then automatically catechize their babies into faith when they are preteens or early early teens has been challenged by making it clear uh that salvation occurs only if the child youth adult makes a more personal decision uh profession of faith toward christ so the evangelical tradition, which is what we're a part of, calls for another step to become the decided. Not just members, but decided. Now, in spite of the obvious and important difference between the liturgical and evangelical traditions, each has a very similar problem that you don't necessarily see on the surface. Because salvation cultures, which both of these are, the liturgical tradition and the evangelical tradition, both of them are salvation cultures. Both of them have struggled and are struggling and will continue to struggle to get members or the decided into the third category, followers. of Jesus, which according to McKnight can only happen if we create a kingdom culture, a gospel culture rooted in a deeper understanding of what the gospel actually is, which brings us back to the question, what is the gospel? Clarify, according to Jesus, who called it the gospel of God in Mark 1 verse 14, He also called it the gospel of the kingdom in Matthew 4.23, the gospel of the kingdom. Stop right there because we have a clue there as to what his gospel is when he uses the word kingdom. Because Jesus in Matthew 4.23, look at it on the screen, was going about in all of Galilee. He was teaching in their synagogues and this was his message, proclaiming the gospel, the euangelion of the kingdom and that it is within your reach. right here and right now, something you can enter into right here and right now, which means, among other things, this. It's not just heaven when you die. It includes heaven when you die. But that is not the full-orbed expression of the gospel, because the good news of God is about a kingdom. And we just have to know this historically, that every first-century Jew's ears would have perked up at that mention of a kingdom. Because the story of the kingdom, of a kingdom, is the story of, among other things, a king. And the story of a king is a story of a people. A people of God's own possession. Who would that be? That would be the people, the Jews, to whom Jesus is speaking this message of a kingdom. Kingdom. That means there's a story here of a king. And a king has a people, a people for God's own possession. people who once were not a people, but they now are the people of God, a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation. And this whole story, this story that would be spinning in the mind of any Jew listening to Jesus talk about the gospel of a kingdom began with this guy named Abraham. They'd be thinking of this part of the story. Abraham in Genesis 17, to whom God said, You'll be the father of nations. Nations meaning I'm calling out a people. Exceedingly fruitful will you be. Kings will come forth from you. I'll have an everlasting covenant with you, with your descendants after you. An everlasting possession of mine is who you are. Who are we? This is who we are, a people of God's own possession. And I will be your God. Verse 8, Exodus 6. The story continues. of God and his people, but now it's not Abraham, it's Moses in verse six. God says to Moses, say therefore to the sons of Israel, I am the Lord, and I will take you from my people, I will take you for my people, and I will be your God, and you will know that I am your God. And you, Exodus 19 verse five, shall be my own possession among all the peoples. You shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. And on that story goes into Exodus 19, then into Deuteronomy 6, 2 Samuel 7, Psalm 105, Isaiah 43, Jeremiah 31. But now, before you know it almost, it's moving, it's in the Gospels. Here's Jesus speaking of a gospel of the kingdom and then it's all through the book of Acts. And there it is in Ephesians. God chose you to be in him before the foundation of the world as a people. And there it is in Colossians 3 and then again in Hebrews 8. And then again in 1 Peter 2, 9, which is the passage we were in a couple of weeks ago. When a couple of weeks ago we were beginning to try to answer this question, who are we as a people, as a church? What is the church? Why are we here? turns out we're a people who come from a long line of people, a chosen people, no less, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, the people for God's own possession whose purpose, whose mission is now what it was in many ways. It is to proclaim the excellencies of him. Him who called us out of darkness into his marvelous light. And a couple of weeks ago, we talked about the fact that when God calls us out of darkness into light, we actually become light. Jesus said to his people, you are the light of the world. You are the hope of the world. But to do that, you're going to have to shine. You're going to have to actually have this life in you for people to see who I am. Which means that as a people here at Open Door, even though we're part of a long line of people, we have an identity too as a people. But we also have a mission as a people to proclaim the excellencies of him, to literally reveal him to the world, and that is who we are, and that is why we're here, and that is why we do what we do the way we do it, and that is why the mission statement of our church is to invite people into the struggle of becoming fully alive in God, because the more alive you are in God, the more God is alive in you, the more potential there is for you to shine, to literally reveal the face of God to your world, wherever that might be. Because we believe that in God, through Christ, you can become fully alive. And that is the gospel that we preach. That is the good news of God, so repent and believe in the gospel. which means review your plans for living. Seriously, review your plans for living and arrange your entire life around the good news of God, the gospel. But now I need to tell you the rest of the story because this is a grand story. And this time I want to begin the story at the beginning of the story because in the beginning, Genesis chapter one, in the beginning, God, stop right there. Because God is the beginning of this grand story of which we are a part. But God is also the culmination of this story. So in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. He created the world as his garden temple. And into this garden temple, he placed two icons. E-I-K-O-N-S. It's a Greek word that means image bearers. Two icons, Adam and Eve, if you will, who are bearers of the image of God. You can see God in them in some very significant ways. Adam and Eve, to whom God then said, in effect, this. Let's do this thing together. In this garden and temple of delight, let's partner together in the care of God's good creation. And what we'll do together is watch this thing grow and expand, moving toward its full potential. We've talked about this before, that in creation, God, everything he made was good. Remember that? But the whole design of God was to, with his icons, his image bearers, watch this earth, this world, come into its full potential. What an adventure this is going to be as we dance and sing and interact under the rule of God. I'm going to give you rulership, Adam and Eve. You will rule and you will reign under my rulership because God is king in this story. But that was the rub in the whole deal. Not satisfied to be ruling under God. They wanted to be like God. So instead of being godly, they wanted to be godlike. Instead of submitting to the rulership of God and ruling under God, they wanted to be God. They wanted to rule themselves. So when you think of original sin, you know, it's a big theological word. The original. I don't know about original sin. The original sin. was usurping. It was, I want to be God. I wouldn't say those words. I want to be in control. I want to call the shots. I kind of, in fact, you created me in your image. I'm going to now create you in mine. And I will call the shots and I will be in control. The lie, rather, from the serpent in the garden was that when you eat from the tree, your eyes will be opened and you will see, you will see that God's been holding out on you and been unfair to you. And so they did eat from the tree. And when they did, their eyes were opened. So the serpent was right. He didn't lie to them. He told them the truth. But what they saw was sin and death. And what they felt was naked and ashamed. And what they did was hide. First from God, then that. And from each other. And we've been hiding ever since. You know, it's true. so the Lord God sent them out of the garden in Genesis 3.23 and that's just this thing we read but you need to dial in this is very important sending them out of the garden ancients the ancients when they would hear that phrase it was a theological picture of what came to be known among the people of God as exile sending you out of the garden I'm sending you into exile and exile is simply that place of separation Exile is simply this, we're not home anymore. We're not safe anymore. We're not protected anymore. And you don't have to go back to the garden to know what that feels like. Because you know what it feels like to feel like I'm not home anymore. I'm not protected anymore. I'm not safe anymore. You're in exile. N.T. Wright says this about that, that to understand the idea of exile is maybe the single most necessary idea to understand, if you hope to understand, the message and the mission of Christ. And it was, the mission and mission of Christ as it was heard and perceived by original hearers. So here's the picture I want you to get. After what we call the fall, the whole human race goes into exile, as it were. Or in Babylon or anything, they're just in exile. We're not home anymore. We're not safe anymore. But immediately, almost immediately, God begins again to call them home. I'll start with this guy here, Abraham. We're in the 17th chapter of Exodus. He begins again to call him home. Abraham, who would be the father of nations, because what I want is a people. Most notably, the people were Israel, through whom God would make a people. But it wasn't for that. It was so that these people would reveal the face of God to the world, the grace of God to the world, the love of God to the world, that God would through them redeem the world, tikkun olam. Remember that word? To fix the world, to redeem it, to heal it. Tikkun olam. But over and over, you know the story, something went wrong. Because over and over and over again, they would do it again. And they being we, they being we would usurp again the ruling authority of God in the world, in our lives. And would reject the character of God again and would turn their hearts from God again. And they slash we do it over and over and over again. So the Egyptians came and then the Assyrians came and the Babylonians and Persians and Greeks came. And over and over again, over, they would, in those experiences, go into what was known as exile over and over and over again. Such that in Jesus' day, when Jesus comes, this issue of exile was the theological, spiritual, political, emotional issue of the day. Of their lives. Because we were supposed to be the people of God. I mean, think about being a church. which God says we are now. Well, they were thinking that then. Through whom God would reveal himself to the world. Through whom God would reveal the world, show his face, because we would shine, tikkun olam, and we'd be part of doing this good thing together with God. But look around, would every Jew say in the first century, there's no evidence of tikkun olam around? No descendant of David is on the throne. Rome is on the throne and fixed the world. We need someone to fix us. We need someone to deliver us. So all of that, I'll add this. The teaching of all the prophets all through the Old Testament consistently made one thing clear, that exile was because of sin. And often, you know, when people started thinking about sin, they would get off track and they'd get down into these little tiny dumb things. You should fix that and fix that. No, it was all about usurping. Go back to the garden. It was all about, will you bend your knee to God, or is it going to be your kingdom? So they knew that exile was about sin, and exile would end, these people all knew this, when people would once again bend the knee to God. And when they did, then opened their hearts to God and would humble themselves before God. God would do what he loves to do. He would forgive their sins and hard-heartedness, and they would begin again, tikkun olam. They would enter back into the mission. They were always his people, but now we're ready to get back into this mission, our purpose of partnering with God in the world to bring healing and redemption and life and grace Mark 1 verse 9 and it came about in those days what days? exile days that Jesus came from Nazareth and Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River and immediately coming up out of the water he saw the heavens opening up and the spirit like a dove descending on him stop right there very evocative language first century Jews would have gotten the picture here This is kingdom language here. When it says the heavens are opening, it means that the sphere of the heavens are moving. Something's going on. God is moving here. The sphere of the heavens are opening. The sphere of the heavens are being brought near like a dove, it said. Think back in your mind. Genesis 1 verse 2. At creation, God hovered over his creation like a what? Like a dove. protecting it nurturing it now here in Mark 1 the story continues God is hovering like a dove again he is moving on the waters again but this time it's not at the inception of creation this time he's doing that at the inception of recreation so that now in verse 14 Jesus began to proclaim the gospel he called it the gospel of God. So the gospel according to Jesus, beloved, is this, that the kingdom of heaven is within your reach. It is something that you in your ordinary lives can enter into and live in under the rule of God in your life, in our life, even as a people. So it's not just heaven when you die. Heaven is, yes, but it's more than that. It's, can I say, better than that. It's fuller than that. It's right here, right now, for God has begun tikkun olam. God has begun, through Christ, the restoration of all things. The reconciliation of all things to himself. And he wants to use his people, and that's who we are, to be part of that mission, to redeem the world, mend hearts, forgive sin. Exile is over. And what that means is this. You can come home again to three things. you can come home to God again. Exile's over. Peace has been declared, says God, through Christ. You can come to God through Christ who is not only our Savior, Jesus is our Savior. Let me tell you who else he is. And this is part of the gospel. This is part of the story. He is our king to whom we bend our knee because he's the king, not me. this is his church not mine or yours we are his people under his rule and when we get that right we're ready for mission you can come home again is what jesus message was first of all to god but second you can come home again to your identity as a people. Who are we? We are a people of God's own possession. For once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God, and that is who we are. So you can come home again to God. You can come home again to your identity. And third, we can come home now finally to our mission. We're back. We're back. I'm ready to play. You can come home again to your purpose as a people. What is our purpose as a people? Why are we here? It is this, proclaim the excellencies of him. To literally be a people so full of the life of God that we can reveal him to the world so people can see him, be reconciled to him. And that is who we are. And that is why we're here. And that is why we do what we do the way we do it. and that is why our stated purpose as a church. Why are we here? We are here to be a community of faith, radically committed to spiritual transformation, so we can be holy. No, so we can shine like lights, so we can do what God's called us to do and be who God's called us to be in this world. Spiritual formation for the glory of God, for the abundance of our own lives, And for the sake of the world. Your world. Everybody else. And that is the gospel that we preach. And that is the good news of God. So repent and believe in the gospel. Review your plans for living. And arrange your entire life around this good news. The gospel. He called it the gospel of God. Let me close with this, Luke 24. You know the story. Ruth Barton was here a couple months ago and did a whole sermon on the road to Emmaus where the disciples were on the road to Emmaus, two disciples, and they were discouraged. Their hopes were dashed. Jesus had been crucified. They heard rumors of a resurrection, but they didn't believe it, and they were trying to sort all this stuff out in their despair. Jesus joined them on the way. They didn't recognize him. at first began to open the scriptures to them. They still didn't get it, but then they came around the table and they began to eat. And Jesus broke the bread, it says, and gave it to them. And then when he gave to them the bread, verse 31, Luke 24 says, their eyes were opened. And they recognized him, Jesus alive, fully alive. Their eyes were opened. It's on purpose, you guys. You gotta remember the story. Think about the story that we are living in. Go back to Genesis 1. In the garden, the serpent said, your eyes will be open if you usurp God and take his role. You be the guy. And when they did, their eyes were opened. But what they saw was sin and death, and what they felt was guilt and shame, and what they did was hide from God and from each other. But in Luke 24, something is happening. Some eyes are opened again. again. But what they saw this time was the defeat of death and sin because what they saw was Jesus alive, risen from the dead. And what they felt was hope. And what they knew was they didn't have to hide anymore. What they realized was that Tikkun Olam was happening and they could be part of it. this thing that began in the garden was back under the rule of God yes bent knees to his kingly authority in our lives as a people and from that position we can be used by him to repair and redeem and restore and reconcile people to God and to heal and help and serve and become who God's called us to be and that is the gospel that we preach and that is the good news of God. So repent and believe in the gospel. Review your plans for living. Open wide your hearts and by faith put confidence in this Jesus and his message to enter into a whole new kind of life right here, right now because the kingdom of heaven is within your reach. And we have work to do. So repent and believe in the gospel, Jesus as our Savior, Jesus as our King to whom we bend our knee. And we have to do it again today. And then the life begins to flow. Holy Spirit, come into these images, into these teachings, into this story. The good news of God we've heard. The good news of God. Help us enter in. Empower us to bend the knee, to receive your life and grace, and then to stand up into all you've called us to be and do. Would you stand with me as we just close and give a benediction? I really don't know what's going on in the hearts of people. I mean, Al was here last night and said, You need to give some space for some kind of response. We brought the cross up. You know what, Open Door, we know it sometimes is good to move and kneel. And kneel, maybe be where you are. There will be people here to pray with you if you need anything. Things get stirred up when the spirit comes in. The story is so, it has power. And so, Spirit, we just pray that your story and all of the life of it, born of your spirit, would have its effect on us and grow and bear fruit in ways we can't even imagine, I pray, and this be done in individuals. But God, we are praying for this to be among us as a people because you're calling us to be a people because we are your people of your own possession, people of God. Help us to be and then to do. We pray in your name. And all God's people said, amen. Amen. God bless you as you leave.
