I love how Eugene Peterson says it. I quoted him last week. That it's hard to be human. To admit, actually, that we are human. One evidence of that is this. The outrageous schemes we devise to avoid feeling human. to avoid fully feeling, particularly feeling pain and loss. So we deny and pretend that there is no loss, that we aren't really hurt, that we don't really care, but losses are all over the place. And beyond what I called last week this loss of Eden that we all kind of vaguely sense just beneath the surface, Some of us have lost or are losing things in people above the surface that we can see and that we can name. But even then, we suppress the evidence, says Peterson, at least in part because mourning, which is the ability to fully feel pain and loss, involves, among other things, being vulnerable to God and to people and admitting that we need God. In people, it's hard to be human. In part because to be human means we need God. And people, and most of us, don't want to need anything. Or anyone. Blessed are those who mourn. In Matthew chapter 5, verse 4, It's our text last week. It's our text again today. For it's in the mourning, in the actual doing of it, that you may just find God, the comfort of God, and maybe the comfort of some friends as well. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. Last week I told you that this week we would talk a bit more about the second part of that verse, not just receiving comfort, but giving it on being a comforter. Because I think we struggle with both ends of that equation, receiving comfort and giving comfort. I'm not sure why, if it's a cultural thing or a spiritual thing. I'm pretty sure it's a human thing. No one likes pain. I think that's pretty universal. We all avoid it if we can. But sometimes I actually do wonder if the passion and capacity that we have, and by we I mean 21st century American people who just are who we are, I sometimes wonder if our passion and capacity to avoid and deny our pain and loss is greater than some other cultures, than other times even in history. In Jesus' day, for instance, it seems that people felt fairly free, I think, to fully feel their pain and loss, including Jesus. Talked about this last week, John 11. Remember Jesus coming to the tomb of Lazarus four days after his death. It says in verse 33 of John 11, that Jesus was deeply moved in his spirit and troubled, and when they brought him to the tomb of Lazarus, he wept. Why? Because he was deeply moved and troubled, but he wasn't the only one who was weeping. verse 33, again, earlier in the verse, it says that Mary, the sister of Lazarus, was weeping, and the Jews who came with her were weeping as, well, it's an interesting scene, worthy of kind of stirring it up in your mind. I think it would have been fairly chaotic, all of this weeping and mourning, though actually quite predictable when someone dies, because just like we have cultural norms around grieving. So did they years ago. Indeed, this group of the Jews that's referred to in verse 33 would have included, among other things, professional mourners. Even today in the Mideast, sometimes we see news clips of people who are, they just are very, some of those are professional mourners. And really a little uncomfortable are we with how expressive they are. That would have been part of this scene in John 11. Some would be in sackcloth and ashes, tearing their clothes and throwing dirt upon their heads. Very odd thing to do, but it was an expression of grief. Others in this scene would undoubtedly have been reciting Jewish prayers for the dead, all of which, however, would eventually give way to an ancient Jewish practice called sitting shiva. Got to be really careful how you say that. I'm hoping to make it through all three surfaces. It's an interesting thing, sitting shiva, wherefore seven days, people probably those closest to Mary, the sister of Lazarus, would just sit. The word Shiva being the Hebrew word for seven, so it was for seven days. They would just sit with the person who they loved, who had experienced this unfixable, irreconcilable loss to just be with them. And the key was not saying a word. Indeed, there was kind of a protocol around sitting Shiva that the only one who was allowed to talk was the person who was in grief. And if they talked, then you could respond in some way. But till they did, you just be quiet. Because the less said in situations that you can't explain and can't fix, the better. We're kind of the opposite. We think we should fill the room with words opposite. The less said, the better. Now this thing, this ancient practice called sitting shiva, we know about this practice from a number of sources historically, but the primary biblical source actually comes from the book of Job. The book of Job, remember him? In the middle of his incredible pain and loss, he had three comforters come to him, three friends of his Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, of whom Job said eventually, sorry comforters are they. Because they didn't do very well. But you know what? They didn't start that way. Indeed, they started in their desire to minister to Job in his need. They started very well, desiring very much to be comfort bringers. But something went wrong. And it's why this morning, is we talk about what it means to bring comfort and how to do it better than we do. It's why I want to talk about them. I want to use them today as a means by which we can learn. Maybe a little bit more about what it means to be a comfort bringer by examining some things that they did well, some things that they did not, and how, like us, their fear, actually, their fear of Job's pain and what Job's pain stirred up in them relative to their pain, how that all got in the way, and how their need to fix and to explain Job's pain, something that, quite frankly, they couldn't fix and couldn't explain, got in the way as well. The story begins, as most of you know, with Job, a good and righteous man, says in chapter 1, verse 1, he was a blameless, upright, fearing God, and turning away from evil person. He had seven sons and three daughters, a supportive wife, lots of livestock. He was considered, therefore, very successful in his day, but in the proverbial blink of an eye, Job lost it all. His kids, his cattle, is standing in the community, the support of his wife, and then he lost his health. There's no way in that short period of time I can kind of help you dial into that, but we're talking about a despairing situation. Having lost all that, he is now covered with boils from the soles of his feet to the crown of his heads. So when Job's three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, it says in chapter 2, verse 11, they came. Each one from his own place, Eliphaz, the Temanites, Bildad the Shuhite, Zophar the Namathite, and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and comfort him. Pick it up in verse 12, chapter 3, and when they lifted up their eyes at a distance and did not recognize him because he was physically in such a state. They raised their voices and did a very appropriate thing. They wept. And each one of them tore their robe and threw dust over their heads, which is very similar to the scene we would have seen in John 11. And then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights with no one speaking a word to him. Historically, we know now that's called sitting Shiva, for they saw that his pain was very great. William Hume, in his book on Job, actually, entitled Dialogue and Despair, describes this sitting Shiva thing as a sacramental silence, a nonverbal and yet tangible communication of the Spirit. Most of us have had the experience of not knowing what to say when ministering to someone overcome with grief and fortunately have the good sense to say nothing. Our presence spoke for itself. It was the basis for whatever words may have to be said at a later time. Just think about this with me. I think it's important to talk about if we're serious about wanting to know how to comfort people when it's irreconcilable, unfixable kinds of stuff. This need that some of us have, myself included, obviously, to talk, to fill the room with words. Do you ever wonder what that's about? I think it's good to wonder about that. Do you think that sometimes we think when we're in situations like that that we're supposed to explain it, that we're somehow supposed to fix it? And if we do think we're supposed to explain it and fix it. Why do we think that? Or maybe we're afraid of the questions that suffering raises in our own minds about God and what he does and doesn't do and how he acts and doesn't act. And especially if someone begins to express some anger toward God, is there like this thing that we think we're supposed to somehow protect God from those angry things by trying to explain what God is doing when we have no idea what God is doing. See, the problem with trying to explain what you think God is doing is this. You're almost always wrong. And often we end up saying stupid things and sometimes even hurtful things, though we never mean to do it. Like I said last week at the funeral of a very small child, I once heard a well-meaning pastor attempt to give comfort. It was a well-meaning attempt to give comfort to a family who had just lost a little baby girl by saying, God must have needed another angel. So that was his explanation. God was short on angels, so he took yours. Here's a little advice. Shut up! Better to be silent than to fill the air. Well, Job's three friends were silent for seven days when, as was the custom around this sitting Shiva thing, that the one who is suffering breaks the silence, Job finally did. At the end of seven days, chapter 3, verse 1, afterwards. Stop right there. Afterwards. After seven days of silence, seven days of sympathy and building trust, be one right now of Job's three friends. Kind of dial into that as fast as you can. You've been there seven days. And ask yourself this question. Job's about to speak. What might you expect him to say? Another question. What might you want him to say? Again, you've been there for a while. It's the first time he's going to speak. Well, the fact is, we don't know, and I don't know. But maybe, you know, a little appreciation would be good. We've been here seven days, and assurance as well. Like, you know, you guys, so glad you came. Appreciate it so much. You know, I know I'm bad off. But hey, you know, God is good. He's in control. He's on the throne. And as you know, all things work together for good. Because when God closes the door, he opens the window, and then he falls three floors. Because anyways, I don't have any idea what that means. so and if Job said something like that the good part about that would be this that then Job's three friends could say oh wow Job oh man this is so amazing here we are coming to comfort you and you comforted us I mean seriously how great would that be that's the script I would want to write so actually so I could leave feeling really good I don't care about Job anymore Job would be the Here all of us would feel good with all of our paradigms and religious cliches that explain to us how the world works, what God does and doesn't do, still intact, may not be true, but they're still intact, safe. But that isn't what happened. Back to chapter 3, verse 1. Afterward, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. So I guess this sitting Shiva thing didn't help. Saying, let the day perish on which I was born, and the night which said a boy is conceived. May that day be darkness. Let not God above care for it, nor light shine on it. Let darkness and black gloom claim that day. Let a cloud settle on it. Let the blackness of the day terrify it. As for the night, let darkness seize the night. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. Let it not be named among the days of the month. He's going crazy. Indeed, verse 8, I love this. Let those who are really good at cursing. Curse that day. Wow. I'm sitting there listening to this guy go off after 7. Kind of out of control. Don't you think? And a far cry from what he said. Just a couple of chapters earlier in chapter 121, when Job said, the Lord gives, the Lord takes away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So what happened to that guy? Where did he go? Well, I don't know for sure where he went. I don't know for sure what happened, but I have a theory. You probably knew I had a theory. My theory is this, that somewhere in those seven days of silence, something happened. An important thing. It needed to happen. But something happened, I think, in those seven days in Job's spirit that words could never create a silent bond, a sense of trust, a rising hope that maybe I can tell these guys how I really feel, not how I'm supposed to feel. And so he pours it out. He lets it fly. And all the pain and anger and confusion gets translated into what amounts to as a primal scream, which is what C.S. Lewis calls this episode in Job's life. In a book he wrote called The Grief Observed, he reflected on some of his primal screams when his wife died. Blessed are those who mourn. He thought he could. But he was wrong. Enter Elphaz, who obviously is threatened by Job's outburst here, now has a job. And the job is this, to shut Job up. It's not okay to talk this way. Job, let's watch it happen. Let's see how he does it in chapter 4, verse 1. Listen for the tone. I'm going to help you with the tone of my voice. He's just so condescending, and it's just so clear it's not okay that Job said what he said. Then Elphaz, the Temanite answered, chapter 4, verse 1. If one ventures a word with you, will you become impatient? But who can refrain from speaking? Obviously, he's not going to refrain. Behold, you have admonished many. You have strengthened weak hands. Your words have helped to tie their understanding. You've strengthened feeble knees. But now it comes to you and you're impatient. It touches you and you're dismayed. Is not your fear of God your confidence? I'm getting nervous now. And the integrity of your ways, your hope? I mean, if you've done nothing wrong, you've got nothing to worry about here, Job. Remember now, whoever perished being innocent? No one. So someone perished. they were what? Guilty. According to what I have seen, O wise one that I am, those who plow iniquity and those who sow trouble harvest it. So what's he saying? If you're having trouble, Job, you must have done something wrong. It's even bigger than that. See, We see Eliphaz, to Eliphaz, everything is clear. This is, you know, what Eliphaz says there is very irritating, but it's bigger than that. It's like, it's a way of thinking. There's a lot of people who think this way. Everything is clear to him. Everything is cause and effect. His is a very predictable universe. And it feels very safe in a predictable universe. So I was so safe with mindless cliches that nobody thought through for more than like five minutes. Job brought this on himself that's his explanation by some iniquity he has sown verse 8 so here is my advice Eliphaz says in chapter 5 verse 8 but as for me I'm just so sanctimonious if you would just do what I do because this is what I do I would see God stop right there something I'm sure Job never even thought of and the implication clearly he's going to say it even clearer as we go through is that if you would seek God everything would be okay and you wouldn't be in this mess as for me I would seek God and I would place my cause before God who does great and unsearchable things wonders without number he gives rain on the earth he sends water on the fields so that he sets high those who are lowly and those who mourn are lifted to safety here's what I don't like about him he's just so sure. He knows. He knows what God does and doesn't do what God says and doesn't say he's sure. Indeed, at the end of chapter 5, verse 27, he says, behold this. We have investigated it, and thus it is. I just want to punch him. Hear it and know for yourself. How do you argue you with a guy like that. Indeed, indeed, back in chapter 4, verse 12, he had already upped the ante even more when he claims divine insight. When he claims that God has spoken to him as to why Job is suffering, listen to this, if you're not already kind of hopping mad about this guy. Verse 12, he says to Job, a word was secretly brought to me, Job. My ears caught just a whisper of it amid disquieting dreams in the night when deep sleep falls upon men. Fear and trembling seized me in the middle of the night and made all my bones shake. A spirit glided past my face and hair on my, the hair on my body stood on end. And by the way, people like this, the weirder it is, the more sure that it's got to them, whatever. It stopped, but I couldn't tell what it was. a form stood before my eyes and I heard a hushed voice. So God spoke to me and told me why you're having this trouble. Which is kind of hard to argue with. But to Job's credit, he does. In fact, all through chapter 9 and 10, and many other places as well. He says, among other things, things like this. Behold, I hear that formula stuff where if you see God, everything's great and the rain will fall and everything's perfect. But I see another truth. In fact, I've begun to see it through my pain. One of the truths I see is the wicked perish. And their descendants flourish and their houses are safe from fear, but not mine. Nah. Which means, It doesn't mean that God doesn't bless. It doesn't mean, but what it means is it's not the way you think all the time. It doesn't always add up the way you think it does. And then Job just kind of backs off and he just says, you guys, chapter 6, verse 15. Listen, he compares them to water in a desert that turns out to be a mirage. My brothers, you've acted deceitfully with me like a wadi, Like a torrent of wadis which vanished verse 19. It's like the caravans of Tima who looked and from a distance they thought they saw water. And the travelers of Sheba who hoped but they were disappointed because they trusted that there would be help. They came but they were confounded because nothing was there indeed in verse 21. You have now become such to me. In your silence, I'd begun to think that maybe you had fresh water for me. But when you saw my terror, this is big, when you saw my terror, you became afraid. Told you earlier their fear got in the way of being able to comfort. The fear made them defensive. And when you're defensive, you can't bring comfort. You just can't do it. Let's sit on that for a second. Learn how to be comforters, what to do, what not to do. when you're dealing with someone who's in despair. I'm not saying they're just angry. You know, somebody didn't get their way. I'm going to maybe come against them if they're coming after me. But they're in despair. They've lost something that cannot be retrieved. What's happened to them is unfixable, inconsolable, and they're coming at you with their stuff and their pain. Pay attention to when something inside of you shifts from really caring about them to all of a sudden protecting yourself. And all of a sudden, the whole care process becomes about you, not about them at all. Tip-off that that's going on is that you're no longer responding to their pain. You're reacting to their words. And at that point, when you feel the shift, it might be best to go back to plan A. And plan A, in fact, if we could install something today in all of us, it would be like this little default button. When you don't know what to do, you hit the default button and what it doesn't make you be quiet. Just shut up at this point. If you're not sure, just be quiet now. If you're getting defensive, best be just be quiet, just be quiet. Some words might come later. Appropriate words, just be quiet. Or maybe when you notice the shifts that you're getting defensive and it may be best to take yourself out. Recognizing that you might not be the person who can actually help this guy. Because you're getting hooked by too much stuff. But here's the problem with all that. Noticing that kind of shift in your spirit would require a level of insight and maturity that these three guys didn't have. And most people don't. And so they get into this argument just like these guys did with Job. When they didn't really realize what they were dealing with. So here comes Bildad. Job says what he says, and Bildad comes, chapter 8, verse 1. Then Bildad, the Shuhite, answered, chapter 8, verse 1, and said to Job, how long will you say these things? And these words of your mouth be like a mighty wind. It's interesting, that phrase, because Bildad is actually here picking up Job's words that he previously said. I'll read them in just a second. And throwing them back in his face. Because back in chapter 6, verse 26, Job, in a somewhat desperate attempt, actually, to get these guys to understand him and hear him and maybe give him some room that maybe I'm not the totally bad guy you think I am now. It says in verse 26 of chapter 6, essentially, this is my paraphrase. You'll see the actual verse on the screen. You keep trying to reprove my words. You keep trying to correct what I say. but what you don't realize, and it's almost like Job is teaching them here, what you don't realize is that the speech of a despairing man is like the wind. It belongs to the wind, and you're correcting my words because they were wrong. No, my words right now belong to the wind. I'm not sure I even mean what I say. Here's the deal. When people are hurt and afraid, they sometimes say things they haven't thought through. You ever do that? Which doesn't mean they're not responsible, okay? It doesn't mean they can say any vile thing they want and, you know, you cross the line there. You can, you don't get to do that. But let me tell you what it doesn't mean, what it does mean. It does mean that maybe they're cursing the day they were born or cursing you, God, and whole wide worlds. Maybe that outburst wasn't their final answer. Maybe it was wind. And it needed to blow. Morning is messy. So please understand, says Job, the speech of a despairing man is like the wind belongs to the wind. Just kind of let it go sometimes. A lot of what we say in pain and anger is not our final answer because I actually love God and I actually love you and I love the whole wide world. I'm just in a lot of pain, right? Now, it's been a weird week for me because I'm thinking a lot about my dad. A couple of reasons. One, died around this time several years ago. I think it was in September. Two, most of what I'm saying today about Job, I got from him. And three, I remember a situation in my life that was very much like this. See, our family was a Bildad Zophar Eliphaz family. We had very much the formula. if you do this, this, and this, surely, God, it will rain. And there was a time in our life, I was about a sophomore in high school, when we were finding out that those formulas didn't work, and there was a lot of tumult in our family. And I was part of the tumult and a lot of anger. And this happened more than once, but I remember one incident where I sat down with my dad. He sat down with me and wanted to know how I felt. And I thought, you can't possibly want to know how I feel, because how I really feel would disturb you, Eliphaz. But he did want to know. And I I gave him some stuff and I jobed him. I jobed him. I gave him all of those stuff. And it was so bizarre. It was so bizarre because he didn't go away and he didn't reprove my words. I said some things that were inappropriate and we talked later. But he didn't correct my words. And we talked a little bit about that after I sobbed and yelled and screamed and stopped and wondered why he wasn't fixing me. he didn't say exactly these words, and I didn't say exactly, like this either, but as I put it together over time, why did you not reprove me, dad? Here's why. I got your anger. You gave me anger. I heard despair, and the words of a despairing kid are like the wind. That doesn't mean you get to talk to me certain ways, Dave. I only talked about that, trust me. That changed my life. That changed my life. It changed my view of God and who I could be with God. I am reasonably confident. I wouldn't be in the ministry without that. I think of that situation a lot. Well, Bildad didn't get it. He didn't understand. And maybe Bildad didn't care. Let's not even go there. Let's assume these guys did care. Bottom line is this, however, after Bildad throws that phrase back in Job's face, he presses on with rhetorical questions that have obvious answers. And that's what rhetorical questions are not fair. Because it looks like you know the answer, and there's no way to answer it without looking stupid. Chapter 8, verse 3. So Job asks Bildad, does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right? Think about it. What's he supposed to say? If he says yes, he's a heretic. If he says no, he's trapped. Verse 4, he presses it further. And in fact, this is where he sets the trap. He asks a rhetorical question. Does God pervert justice? What do you think, Job? So here's the deal, Job. If your son sinned against God, then their death was simply God delivering them to the power of their transgression. In other words, they got what they deserved, Job, because God doesn't pervert justice. Rhetorical question. So the explanation for your pain and the loss of your sons and daughters is your sin. It's their sin. And then he gives the solution. Here's your way out, Job. This is your wonderful gospel good news out of this pain. Verse 5, if you would just seek God, implored the compassion of the Almighty. If you were pure and upright, surely then, again, here's this guy who's positive, God would rouse himself for you and restore your righteous estate. Though your beginning was insignificant, yet your end will increase greatly. So for Bill Dad, life can be reduced, and the pain in life can be explained with a simple three-step formula. Three steps for the perfect marriage, three steps for raising your kids, three steps for being successful in life. Indeed, this guy could make it a seminar. I'm sure people today do. And teaching in churches all over the country. Chapter 8, verse 5, here's the outline of the whole seminar. If you would, number one, seek God. We'll do two talks on that. Number two, implore his compassion. That's about prayer. Two talks on that. And number three, be pure and upright. Literally set your life in order. Then surely, by the way, those three things are good ideas. See God, pray, set your life in order. Here's the problem, then surely, you don't know, this is, anyway, God will arouse himself, restore your estate, and things will be better than before. One problem with that, among many problems, but one problem relative to Job, and saying that to Job, is that Job did not just get off the boat. See, he's not saying this to some kid in Sunday school who was just kind of going, okay, I guess that's the right answer. In fact, the very formula that Bill Dad's giving him here for Christian living is the very same formula Job had lived his whole life by. But now, it wasn't working. Because he had pain he couldn't fix. Which is exactly what Job says in a variety of ways, all through chapter 9 and all through chapter 10. So when Zophar shows up, he's actually there. It's kind of his turn to talk. He's a little panicky because Job's not backing down. He's not buying what they're selling. But Zophar, I'm not even going to read you what Job Zophar says. You can go into the chapters and read it for yourself. But he doesn't say anything different than the other guy said. It's just more of the same, piled higher and deeper. But Job's not having any of it. Even after Zophar does the same stuff, If you do this, then God will do that. Job's just not buying it. Chapter 12, verse 1. Dripping with sarcasm. And this phrase makes me really like this guy. Just dripping. He said, then Job responded, truly then, you are the people. And with you, surely wisdom will die. Chapter 16. Sorry, comforters, are you all. You are worthless physicians. chapter 13, verse 4, an assessment, by the way, that God agrees with in chapter 42. God calls them evil, speaking lies about me, says God to them. Which actually provides another insight, another thing we might need to know if we're still interested, and might not be now, in bringing comfort to someone in the Spirit's this, that if If you bring, if we bring, simplistic, manipulative, condescending solutions to an honest person who's in a lot of pain, expect to get blasted. Enter Elihu. Elihu, who's that? Well, he's the fourth guy in the story. We don't hear much about him, and in truth, like the other three, actually, he makes some mistakes. He says some stupid things. But he comes, does Elihu with an entirely different spirit, which is actually going to make all the difference. And that's even something to remember when you're dealing with something. You know, it's your spirit is going to make a big difference. You're going to say some things that are stupid. You probably will. But he comes with a different spirit. He doesn't condescend. He doesn't try to fix it. He doesn't try to explain it. He doesn't try to shut Job up. In fact, chapter 33, verse 6, we get to meet Elihu, and you kind of meet his spirit. Just picture all the stuff that's been going on in the fight Job has been in. Just picture this, these words coming from Elihu as he introduces himself. Behold, he says, I belong to God, just like you. We're the same. I'm not above you. You're not beneath me. I too have been formed out of clay, just like you. Behold, no fear of me should terrify you, nor should my pressure weigh heavy on you. Don't worry about it. I'm not going to push you. I'm not going to try to fix you. I'm not going to shame you or manipulate you. Might confront you. And he does, actually. You know, this doesn't mean you never talk. He's like, I'm going to take that. I'm an idiot. No, no. Elihu will confront you. In fact, later when God starts talking, God will confront him too. But it's a different spirit. And as Elihu is talking to Job, something amazing happens in chapter 38. As Elihu is speaking, Job begins to hear God. I don't know if that's ever happened to you. When you're with a friend and you're hearing something, you're hearing something, or even just think of the possibility that someday you could be talking to a friend and they tune you out. And all of a sudden they really start hearing God. That's exactly what happens to Job. Elihu's talking, and Job starts to hear God speaking to him in a whirlwind. It says in chapter 38, God speaks to Job in a whirlwind. What do you think that was? Like a big wind came up. No, no, this is all metaphor, wonderful, symbolic, imagery-laden language. The metaphor, the whirlwind was Job's life. In the whirlwind that was Job's life, God began to speak. Little thing about a whirlwind. You ever been in one? I mean, you maybe not have had Job kinds of things, but where the wind is blowing and you're just knocked off center and you're very confused and you know which way is up. You know, when you're in a whirlwind, you don't need directions because nobody knows which way is up. You just need somebody to be with you. Sitting Shiva, maybe. Elihu facilitated a meeting with God. Now, I don't want to make Elihu sound better than he was. And I want to implicitly promise that if we do what he did, that we'll get the result he got. But I think a lot of us can do better than we do at providing comfort for a friend when they really need to mourn. So let me end with this. Just pull together with this. Remember just a few things. Because we can do this. We can. First is this. Just remember silence is golden. What I love about this is mourning and pain that people have does scare us, and we wonder what to say. Got to come up with some profound thing. No, this is such good news. Just go and be there. And most of the time, the best thing you can say in the face of someone's despair is nothing. Second, understand that if the calamity that they're in is great and they're in a lot of pain, you can't fix it, and you can't explain it. So don't try. Don't try. Get yourself off the hook. Don't try to fix it. Don't try to explain it. Because the truth is, you don't know why. Be particularly careful with mindless cliches that are actually designed to make you feel better. And if you feel the urge to come out with some God will open a window thing, push the default button. And just leave it right there. Just go back to silence. and then third try to remember that a despairing person's speech belongs to the wind so if they vent and curse you and God and the whole wide world don't act like it didn't happen but don't assume it's their final answer either just stay know why? Because two are better than one. For if either of them falls, the one will lift up their companion, but woe to the one who falls in despair when there is not another to be with them and lift them up. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. My hope and my prayer is that that's actually true among us. more and more and more. Amen. Let's pray. Would you stand with me as we close? I'm going to ask the prayer team to make yourself available today after the service. And if you need prayer for anyone to just come. Lord, I just thank you for this word. just the pictures of your grace that are here and for the ways we can learn how to really care about the people we care about in some of the most critical times of their life. We pray that this be true among us more and more and more. That people in mourning among us get comfort. And meetings even with you in the middle of the waterwind. We pray that in Jesus' name. Amen. Some of you need prayer. I encourage you to come. Maybe talk to a friend. The rest of you are dismissed. God bless you as you leave. Thank you.
