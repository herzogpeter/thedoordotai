John 1.29 talks about the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. 2 Corinthians 5.21, an incredible verse. God made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us. He made Him to be sin. Jesus Christ on the cross. This is almost an inconceivable thing. This is a mystery in the pure sense of the word. That's the most glorious thing in all the world. Here's the one who's fully man and fully God on the cross of Calvary. On the cross of Calvary, he is made to be, this is him, forgive me, he is made to be sin. God makes him sin. You are sin. God can exist in more than one way at the same time, and the second way in which God exists as God now was made to be sin. All the sin of the world, in fact. It's as though he absorbed the whole thing within himself. God made him to be sin who knew no sin, that we might become the righteousness of God in him. So that all of our sin is given to him and all of his righteousness is given to us. His righteousness. All of our sin is given to him and his perfection is imputed to us. I just think that's incredible. I don't understand it a bit, But it's incredible. All I know is it's true. Hebrews 9, 28, He bore the sins of us all. So Jesus Christ, the idea there is that He lifts the burden of the world and absorbs it in Himself. The sin of the whole world. Every sin that's ever been committed. Every sin that ever would be committed. The cross is sufficient for us. The verse doesn't say He was bruised for some of our transgressions and wounded for some of our iniquities. It was for all of them that he did it. We are made righteous and reconciled to God. 2 Corinthians 5.19 God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself. See, there's only one way to be reconciled, and that's for this to happen. If you're going to be compatible eternally with an all-holy God, you've got to be all-holy. and there's two ways you can try to do that you can try to do it yourself go or you can trust in Jesus Christ who did it for you those are your two options ain't no way you're going to do it the first way first is try it and they were worse off than anybody you can't do it even if you get 98% of it which no human being has ever done even if you got 98% of it that 2% is enough to send you to the same pit with Hitler you see cyanide is cyanide there's no negotiation here It's not one good deed done with a slightly ulterior motive. All of a sudden, sets you apart from God. See, think about that. Just give up. Just throw your hands up and quit. Because you don't have prayer. Just quit. Man. Okay, here's the result. This is the result, you guys. Sin is no longer the issue between humanity and God. Christ is. The sin issue was taken care of on the cross. God made him who knew no sin to be sin for us. That we might be made the righteousness of God in him. For the whole world now, sin is not the issue. Sin ain't the issue. It's a given that we're sinners. That doesn't surprise God a bit. That's why Jesus died. So there's no sin issue between you and God. The issue is, do you accept it or not? It's not sin that sends people to hell. It's a lack of Christ. And that's a very important point to note. Because sometimes when the church gets involved in these things where we think that our job is to take a machine gun and shoot at all the sin in the world, as though we could kind of root out the sin in the world, and then the world would be a better place. Go ahead and try, you know, but that's not what it's about. And our job isn't to be telling people what sinners they are, though they need to know that they're sinners. But to point out this particular one, or get on a hobby horse against homosexuality, or get on a hobby horse for this or whatever, our job is to preach Christ, because if you preach Christ, then the sin is no longer an issue. God will clean up the sin business. the job is to present people with Christ. It's not the fact that the adulterer is the adulterer or the gay person is the gay person that's going to send them to hell. It's the fact that they don't have Christ. Give them Christ and God will clean them up. Sin's no longer the issue. Yeah! Well, that's a good question. And all we can do is theorize on it. But if it's true that without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin, Hebrews tells us that all those Old Testament sacrifices that they did were simply a type of Christ who was to come. The blood of bulls and goats can't forgive sins. God's not impressed with that. God himself has to do it. But yet it seems as though that typology was efficacious for where they were at. That is to say, they were forgiven because we know that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are in heaven, at least three. We have no reason to believe that. In fact, when Jesus was raised from the dead, it says that some saints of the Old Testament were raised. So people in the Old Testament do go to heaven. Yet it's also true that there's no way to get to heaven, Jesus tells us, except by, but through him. John 14, 6, no one goes to the Father except through me. So what that seems to entail, and we touched on this a little bit last week, that seems to show, though here we're in the realm of speculation, that the blood of Jesus, what Jesus did on the cross, can embrace more people than have the opportunity to recognize it. Now, we need to talk about what it is that gets a person in and what it is that keeps a person out. But basically it's this. Do you accept it or reject it? Apparently the people in the Old Testament accepted it, even though they didn't have a clear idea of what they were accepting. But they accepted God insofar as they knew God. And so Christ's death was imputed to them, retroactively, so to speak. It raises the issue of whether Christ's death can be imputed to other people geographically. And that's something we know very little about. But the possibility, I think, is there. The other thing is that the work of the cross defeats Satan. God had two agendas when he became a man and died on the cross. He wanted to rescue us, for sure, but he also wanted to defeat his old foe. The earth is sort of like Normandy in the Second World War. It's this little plot of land that's insignificant in and of itself. But because of the strategy of the warfare, Normandy in France became the central place where World War II was decided. It's called D-Day. So it is with the planet Earth. The planet Earth became, for reasons that are way beyond us, the strategic place where the war is decided. It was really always decided, but here the decisive blow is going to be struck. So in redeeming humanity, God doesn't only redeem humanity, he also defeats Satan in the process. He doesn't just free us and then continue for eternity to battle this enemy. He frees us and at the same time strikes a death blow to Satan. And then he enlists our help in finishing him off. Yeah. You're right. Jesus still calls him the prince of this world. Okay. But here's the sort of thing here. World War II was really decided at the Battle of Normandy. The war was effectually over then because it was no longer possible that the enemy would ever win. That was the decisive blow. But there still was a year of little battles here and there that had to be fought before the thing was declared. Maybe that's an analogy to what's happened here. Colossians 2.15 tells us that Christ defeated Satan on the cross. And yet we still know that we battle with him. In fact, we are called to be in spiritual warfare. And I think that the essence of that is this. He is in principle defeated, though there are still battles to be fought. Our job is to apply the victory that he's already won for us in our own lives and the lives of those we come in contact with. The victory's been won, though it hasn't been universally applied. Just like at Normandy, the victory had been won, but it took a year for the repercussions of that to swell up the whole earth. I think it's sort of like with our own lives. We are justified. We're rendered perfectly righteous by the virtue of the cross, though it takes about a lifetime for that to finally work its way out until our lives become totally sanctified. We'll talk about that later on too. But sin still lingers in our life even though we're rendered perfect. How's that? Well, it has happened and yet it's in the process of happening. We're butterflies halfway out of the cocoon. I don't know if that works or not. Go ahead. Okay, good. So even though the battle is fought, there are still individual lives at stake. And still, it's important to keep on fighting. Hebrews 2.14 tells us that Christ came to destroy death. How does the verse go? Christ came to destroy the enemy. Let someone read Hebrews 2.14. I can't think of it right now. 1 John 3.8, though, says that he came to destroy the works of the evil one. Hebrews 2.14, what does that say? something about death and the evil one. Okay, by his death, he destroys him who has the power of death, that is the devil. Okay, so in principle, this, Colossians 2.15, I think is the best verse here, because it tells how God did this. When Christ died on the cross, what he did was he took everything that was written against us. He tells that all the ordinances that were written against us, and he nailed it to the cross. he obliterated the sin issue on the cross. Everything that was ever written against you, that could ever be written against you, every rule you ever broke, that sin issue was completely obliterated on the cross, and that destroys the work of the enemy because he's got nothing else on us now. He's got nothing that he can stand on. His stand has been taken apart. Satan needs secrecy, and he needs guilt to operate and to destroy people. but in the cross what we have is the complete freedom of that. We're okay as we are. Who can lay any charge to God's elect? It is God who justifies, which means that Satan is put out of business. You see? Who can lay any charge to God's elect? Satan's name, Satan, means the accuser or the adversary. Revelation tells us that his job is to accuse the brothers day and night. But if Christians ever get a grip on who they are in Christ, that no one can lay any charge to God's elect, Satan is out of business. And that's how he's destroyed. He's got nothing else against humanity. He really doesn't have a leg to stand on because the whole sin issue has been taken care of. There's nothing for him to do. Whatever he could do, Christ has already redone on the cross. There's nothing left for him but to go to hell. Satan, go to hell. He'll be there before long. The trouble is, people don't know that. People don't accept that. People still fight their own fights, dig their own ditches, work their own works, and so Satan's got a leg to stand on. Christians do that all the time. We feel convicted. First thing we do is try to get puffy and try to argue with them. I'm not that bad. I'm okay. Look what I can do. Here's a good work and there's a good work. And here's another good work. Well, as soon as you start playing that ball game, you're a dead duck. Because there's always enough sin in your life to bring about all tons of conviction and cause you to be defeated. And the more defeated you get, the less righteous energy you have to live for the Lord. So the more defeated you get, the less energy you get. And you get on one of these downward spiral sin binges. And it's no good for anybody. know that in Christ no one can lay any charge to God's elect the best motivation for living a holy life is to realize that God's already made you holy because then you start thinking I can act like it it's true about me that's not a lie that's true Satan's one who's a liar alright here's the we're dealing with issues here so I'm going to deal with one objection here the objection here is this this seems immoral How can God take his son and crucify him who is innocent in place of guilty people and call it a done deal? Isn't that immoral? John's guilty, so I'm going to grab Sue, who I've got nothing against, kill her, and then let John off the hook. Seems kind of unrighteous. Seems immoral. Seems unlingual. Seems dastardly. Well, there's a couple responses. This has been the major objection to the doctrine of the atonement throughout the ages. Maybe you've had this question yourself. The first thing and most important thing that you've got to identify is that Jesus isn't a third party. You see, if I... What's your name? Michelle. Michelle here offended me. She spit on me. She kicked me in, so I'm really aggravated at her, and she's got to pay a price. By law, she's guilty, so she's got to pay a price. That's just. But now, instead of hitting Michelle, what's your name? Barb. Barb. Barb has been a righteous babe all of her life, just, you know, holy and sanctified. But I see her on the street, I say, listen, Michelle really offended me, so you're going to get her, do-do-do-do, a whale on her. You say, what kind of justice is this? This is pretty sick. And Michelle deserved it. How can you blame her and pound the daylights out of her and call that justice? Well, what you need to understand is that Jesus Christ isn't a third party, Like Barb, right? Like Barb is. Barb's a third party, so it would be unjust. But Jesus isn't a third party. He's not sort of an angel sitting out here. Jesus Christ is God Almighty. You're talking about the very party that's been offended, the very one who has the sin issue against us, the very one whose wrath burns against all sin. And so while it would be unjust for God just to yank an angel by the neck and choke him for our sins, It's not unjust if the judge wants to come down and receive his own judgment. The judge has the right to bear his own judgment. And this is, again, why it's so important to believe that Jesus Christ is fully God. If you don't believe it, you've got to butcher his view of the atonement. In fact, it's not surprising that all the views that deny that Jesus Christ is divine, is fully God, they also deny the atonement. Right? They do. Any of you that has an inferior view of Jesus Christ denies the atonement. Or they reword it and water it down in such a way that it's totally irrelevant. Jesus Christ is God Almighty who pronounces the judgment. You are deserving of death. He takes off his robe, becomes the accused, and dies the death. He has the right to do that because he pronounces the judgment. Second thing is this. Jesus Christ really did identify with our fallen race. It wasn't with individuals that God had the gripe. It was with humanity as a whole, which of course includes the individuals, but it's the humanity as a whole that is in trouble. We are by nature children of wrath. The race as a whole is a rebellious race that's fallen in sin. Jesus Christ comes down and he becomes one of us. And the Bible says that God made him who knew no sin to be sin for us. He really does, in a way that has got to be described as mysterious, he really does take upon himself the guilt of humanity, And so he really does deserve it. He identifies with us so strongly, it's as though he is made a cooperator in the crime and thus deserves the punishment. See, he absorbs, he becomes one of us so fully and so completely that all of our sins are laid upon him. And so it is just that he is punished because he is made sin. The mechanics of that I haven't figured out yet, but that's the gospel proclamation. Finally, Christ is rewarded for what He does. He is rewarded. There's a lot of verses that speak about these kind of things. It says in Hebrews 12, 2, that for the joy that was set before Him, Christ endured the suffering of the cross. For the joy. What was the joy that was set before Him? Anyone know? Right. It was us. Us? The church. It was the church. It delights Jesus Christ to save people. Hebrews says he forever lives to make intercession for us. It makes his day. He delights in forgiving. He rejoices in having our trespasses removed. He did it because he wanted us. I love that thought. He wanted us, and it gave him joy to do that. It also meant hell and crying and tears and pain and God forsakenness. But there's a joy in it. And the Bible portrays Jesus Christ. We are like trophies of Christ. Ephesians 1 talks about us. We're trophies of his grace as we're made righteous and perfected forever in the beloved. That's his reward. He gets off on it. It's not just for our sake. He loves to do it, though it is for our sake. But see, it's not incompatible. It's like he's saying, You ever have anyone do you a favor and say, okay, I'll take all the garbage, or, you know, all right, I guess I will. No, he doesn't do it like that. He loves to do it. It gave him joy. And so he is rewarded for it, and so it's not an injustice that happens to him. Comments and questions about the atonement. Really, you guys, if you have questions, speaking of forever, hold your peace. Are you getting every bit of it? For sure? no questions is it all just too clear I gotta make some things ok now we're going to talk about salvation this is the juicy stuff I like talking about God and Trinity and all this stuff but when we start talking about salvation it gets me going it's adrenaline stuff ok that was the atonement but why is it that not everyone in the world is saved. Christ died for the whole world. Sin's no longer the issue with the world. God's okay with the world. I mean, at least, there doesn't need to be any issue with the world because the price has been paid. Why then is the world not saved? And the ultimate answer is this. On the cross, Christ, in principle, purchased the salvation for all. But salvation occurs to the individual when they accept that gift. and damnation occurs when they reject that gift. There has to be an acceptance or rejection of the whole thing. We said earlier, God does not coerce love. He doesn't coerce it. He wants a loving relationship here. He's done everything metaphysically possible to establish that relationship. The only variable left is, are you going to accept it? And we'll see here shortly that God even goes farther and does everything possible to get us to accept it. Okay, I'm going to talk about the basis of salvation, and then I'm going to talk about the result of salvation. And I'd like to get into talking about the issues of salvation, but I don't think we're going to get a chance to tonight. The basis of the salvation is fourfold. The first basis is the atonement. The first foundational feature of our salvation is that Christ died for us. If he hadn't died for us, stop the conversation now, because we're not going to go any further. It's the death of Christ that makes salvation possible. The death of Christ makes salvation possible. The sin issue no longer needs to be an issue. And if that foundation isn't laid, nothing else could be built upon it. The second basis of salvation, and this is a very important point, and it also can become a controversial point. Would you look up John chapter 6, 44 and 64 through 65? 44 and then also 64 through 65. Christ's death on the cross provides the objective basis of salvation. That's to say, the fact out there that we need to be saved. But the Holy Spirit is required if we are going to subjectively or internally receive that gift. No one believes on Jesus Christ on their own basis. Okay? Something has to change in us. Even after God went to that extent and died for us, were we left in our own devices, we never would have accepted that. We'd still be blind to it. There's nothing in us that would have recognized that. The Holy Spirit is required if we are going to believe in Jesus Christ. So, for example, if you read a verse like Acts 16, 14, the Bible says there that the Lord opened Lydia's heart that she might receive the things that Paul was teaching her. The Lord had to open Lydia's heart. Even though Jesus had already died, it didn't do Lydia any good because her heart was closed to it. The Lord had to open up her heart. That was a gift that God gave Lydia. 1 Corinthians 12.3 says that no one can confess Jesus Christ as Lord except by the Holy Spirit. It's the work of the Holy Spirit to confess Jesus Christ as Lord. Many other verses talk about the Holy Spirit leading us to repentance. That's not something we do on our own. There's not that kind of internal goodness in us that would lead us to that. The Holy Spirit is required if we're going to come to faith. Ephesians 2.8 says that we are saved by grace through faith. And that, not of ourselves, it is a gift of God. Even your faith is a gift of God. It's something God does in your life. And that raises some questions, and we'll deal with those questions. What I just want to settle now is that it's not like there's one work you have to do, namely believe. That's not your work. Now the question is, do we have anything to do with that? Do we at least passively buckle under? And we'll have to address that. John 6, 44. You can't come to Christ unless the Father draws you. It's a work of God that you come to Christ. Go ahead. God has to enable you to believe in Jesus Christ. God has to enable you to trust in Jesus Christ. No one can come into Christ unless that happens, because everyone is dead in their sin. The Bible describes us as being dead in sin. Ephesians 2, verses 1 and verse 5, and Colossians 1, 13. We're dead in sin. And that means that we're corpses. We're unresponsive. Corpses don't do nothing. I don't know if you ever noticed that. They just sit there. It is cold. So God could love the world, become a human being, die on the cross, be made sin, that everyone might be made the righteousness of God in Him, and it wouldn't do anybody a bit of good, because we're still walking around as corpses, in terms of our relationship with God. So God has to go one step further. God exists in a third way, and that is the Holy Spirit. I hope you've seen the significance of the doctrine of the Trinity and all this. The Father comes to us, and the Son does all this stuff to us, and now God does something in us. And that's the work of the Holy Spirit. He enables us, he wakes us up to see that Jesus is who he really is. We can use a lot of arguments, and I think we should use a lot of arguments, to prove that Christ is divine, rose from the dead, da-da-da-da-da. We need all that kind of stuff, that's good. It breaks down intellectual barriers. But if the Holy Spirit's not in it, it's not going to do a bit of good. It will just fall flat. You can argue someone in the corner, and in the face of all the evidence in the world, they'll say, I still don't believe. Because if the Holy Spirit's not enabling them, it'll be futile. So you need the work of the cross, and then you need the Holy Spirit working in a person's life. This is why it really is futile to witness to somebody without praying. I mean, you need to pray that the Holy Spirit would be working there to break the darkness. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4.4 that the God of this age has blinded all those who don't believe. You need to pray that the Holy Spirit would break through that blindness. Until that's done, they're not going to believe. I don't care what you do. We should provide all the opportunities in the world for people to come to the Lord, to get rid of whatever obstacles we can get rid of, and do all of that. And the Lord can use that to bring people to Him. But we also need to realize that you can have the best evangelistic program in the world, be the most fluent speaker in the world, have everything set up just right, all the right arguments, and it will be flat as a corpse, because you're dealing with corpses. You can't save corpses. The Holy Spirit has to work on their life. Okay, the first work of the Holy Spirit is repentance. You don't repent. Acts 2.38. In Acts 2.37, the Jews say, What must I do to be saved? And Peter responds. The first thing he says is, Repent. Metanoia, which means to turn around, turn around, repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Repentance is the first thing that happens to a person when the Holy Spirit's moving in their life. 2 Corinthians 7, 9 and 10, Paul says that it was the kindness and patience and love of God that brought you to repentance. It's the love of God that does it, not the wrath of God, although that might have a role to play I'm not downplaying that but it's the love of God working in a person's life that brings them to the point where they're going to turn around where they want to change and that is itself a work of the Holy Spirit I think it's important to note that repentance isn't what brings the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is the one who brings repentance and even in a Christian's life even after salvation we always have this ongoing thing with the Lord I mean in some ways we have to repent every day I find myself turning every day because every day there's areas of my life that simply need to be repented of but repentance isn't the kind of thing where God's standing over there and we're over here and we go I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry and then we kind of try to butter up to him a little bit and kind of nudge closer and don't you feel like that sometimes like you go to pray and say can we be friends again and you kind of butter up like this. And the idea is that if you just repent enough and do enough penance and say enough Hail Marys, then you'll get close enough. I know you guys don't do that, but as a kid I did that. The idea is that after you sin, there's so many things you've got to go through before you're going to be acceptable again, which is playing the devil's game because now you're in the works project and you'll never win. Repentance happens, genuine repentance I don't believe happens in that kind of frame of mind. Repentance, I think, happens when a person realizes who God is. And when they realize that God accepts them anyways. That loves them anyways. And that's what breaks a person. What breaks me is not fear. For my first years in the Christian life, I was scared to death. I was going to hell. And I kept on doing this stuff anyways. Because fear doesn't break you. But when I realized that I was loved in spite of everything, that broke me. That melted me. and I was full of tears, to realize that I've been fighting against my best friend, I've been fighting against my lover, and now I realize what he did to save me. Repentance comes when we see the love of God. I had a friend of mine, he really struggles a lot with alcohol, and this was a real changing point in his life. Got up one morning, and he comes from a real dysfunctional legalistic background, too, like a lot of people around here. And one morning he said this, he got up and he got his Bible out. He was in the habit of always reading the Bible in the morning. That's a good habit to have, but for him it was just part of his legalistic duty. And even though he'd be drunker than a skunk and vomiting, he'd get his Bible out and just look at it. And sometimes he wouldn't read it, but he got a little bit of a spiritual buzz by performing the duty. But he got out this thing, and I forget which verse he read, but all of a sudden he realized that God loved him. Normally he just felt whipped, shamed, abused, beat up, and he'd go back and drink some more, because if that's your self-image, you're going to go back drinking. And he would think he would repent. I'm so sorry. Alcoholics always say that to their wives, to their kids, and to God. I'm sorry. I'll never do it again. They do it again. But a real breaking point, not the end of all his problems, but a fundamental turning point for him came when he realized, in that morning with a terrible hangover, head throbbing, being very sick, he all of a sudden said he felt God's arms around him. And the Lord said, I'm going to make you better. And it was in the middle of that love that he really began to repent because he began to sob and cry over the fact that God saw value in him. Repentance comes not when you're feeling low as a worm. Though there probably are areas of your life where you feel low as a worm, but when you realize the value you have, the value you have for God, that He loves you that much. That's what breaks you. And that's when you begin to turn. And it's not a fake thing like, okay, I'll turn, you know. I don't want to, but I will. No, it's God changes us by winning us over, by turning us around, by showing us His love and His beauty. That's when repentance happens. I guess when you're under that kind of bombardment, whether it's a hangover that you have or whether it's just some other kind of guilt or eating disorder or whatever it is, or maybe it's the small things, the small things, you lied today, or you were speeding, or I don't know, the devil can get you in any possible way. Repent from the inside of the hug. Get on the inside of God. Let him hug you and love you. And then the repentance comes, and it comes genuinely. It's not kind of a formal thing or a phony thing. It comes genuinely from the inside. Finally, comes faith. You're convicted of your sins. You realize your sin. Another question is, what are you going to do about it? And here's where you have what the Bible calls pistis, faith. It's a loving trust in the cross. Here's where you realize that you haven't got a hope, you haven't got a prayer, there's no way you can make it on your own. Everything is stacked against you. You are sinking deep in sin. You are deserving of death in terms of who you are in and of yourself. And your only hope is Christ. And you turn to Christ and you cling to it. And there's just too many verses to put down there. But the whole emphasis on the Bible is, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved. It's not talking about an intellectual belief there. Because the devil's also believed. James 2 tells us that. It's not an intellectual knowledge. There are people who have an intellectual knowledge, a theoretical knowledge, and have no relationship with God whatsoever. Because they have no sense of His love. They have no conviction over sin. There's no turning in their hearts. The Holy Spirit's not working there. Their heart's not open. Their head maybe likes the ideas. It's theoretical. It's neat and dandy and wonderful, and they feel intellectual or spiritual doing it, but their hearts are cold. Belief isn't the issue. Trust is the issue. Faith that He did it for you. And a faith that begins to grow in a real relationship with Him. That's what Paul means by the word faith. It's a full, loving, trusting relationship in the cross. This is my only hope. Questions? That's the basis of it. The result of it is this. You are justified. The result is justification. The Greek word is a good word to know. I don't know how to spell it. Dikaiosune. Dikaiosune. We'll just spell it like this right now. And it literally means to declare righteous. to pronounce righteous. When you believe on the Lord and trust in Him, you are declared righteous. Oh, we've got to read some of these verses. We'll close with this one. Here, when you believe in the Lord, the first thing that happens, and really the only thing that happens, the central thing that happens, is that God declares you righteous. The truth that sin is no longer the issue becomes true for you. What Christ did on the cross is now applied to your life. You see, it now catches hold in your existence. It was true in principle, but now you own it. You apply it to your life. You identify with it. It becomes part of your identity, and that's when you're declared righteous. All the blood of Christ is imputed to you, the work of Christ is imputed to you, and now there's no longer any sin issue with you. These are all in Romans, so maybe you could have one reader here. Would you read Romans 3, 24 and 28? Well, give us one. Romans 4, 4 through 6. Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an obligation. However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteous. David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from work. Paul lays out the whole thing. You know, if you work for it, you get a credit. God owes you a debt, and then you get paid. But God will not be a debtor to anyone, Paul says. So it's not a matter of works. But to the person who doesn't work, who realizes that work is futile, who gives up on working, but believes in God who justifies the wicked. It's the wicked that God justifies. The only prerequisite to being saved is that you've got to be wicked. know that you're wicked. That's it. The only prerequisite to being involved in the church is that you're a sinner. It's only for sinners. Jesus said, I don't come to save the righteous. I came to save the sinners. That means he came to save everybody, but there are some people who think they're righteous, and they're going to be counted out. But those who realize that they're wicked, then he says, David was talking about this when he says, Blessed is the one to whom God credits righteousness. Credits righteousness. Imputes righteousness is the word there. He just declares it. It's true about you. not because of what you do not because of how you look not because of who you are but in spite of all that he credits you righteous and the righteousness that he credits you with is not some menial low life kind of righteousness it's first class righteousness it's his own righteousness he says here let me take some of my holiness and it's yours and now I see you as you are in Christ I see you holy and spotless and blameless and we're going to share in this and rejoice in this for eternity that's wonderful stuff Thank you.
