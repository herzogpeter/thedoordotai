We find ourselves again this week, and I think it's important that we do indeed picture ourselves again this week, sitting at the feet of Jesus on a hill in Galilee. You remember the way the scene has been set. It was set for us in chapter 4, where he came and he began his ministry, and he began it with these words, The kingdom of God has come. The reign of God has come to earth. And those words were not just nice words. They were a declaration of war against Satan, putting him on notice that God has indeed come to earth and his reign has begun. And that kingdom that came was a kingdom of power and that power was demonstrated in that fourth chapter as he went about healing people who were sick and casting out demons. And that kind of razzle-dazzle attracts a crowd. And having attracted the crowd, he noticed something that we have been saying every week, these past several weeks and even months as we've dealt with the Beatitudes. It was as if he said, hold it, time out, we need to take a look at something. Some of you are coming because of the power. Some of you are coming because of the show. And you need to understand some things about the kingdom before we go on. And it began in chapter 5 to describe two things, the kind of person to whom the kingdom comes and the kind of person through whom the power of the kingdom flows. And we have been learning these weeks that it isn't the righteous and it isn't the pious, it isn't the self-important, and it isn't the powerful, but it is the broken. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs alone is the kingdom of heaven, verse 3. And blessed are those who mourn and that not to get out here what is in here. Blessed are those, for they're the only ones who are going to get comfort. The ones who are acting like everything's cool when everything's not are never going to know the kingdom. Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth. And blessed are those who have a hunger and crave after righteousness. They alone shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy. And blessed are the pure in heart, which which means blessed are those who understand that what's going on inside is what matters. They are the ones who will see God. And blessed are the peacemakers. You remember that a couple of weeks ago. Not those who are appeasing situations, but those who are bringing peace through the truth, which means peacemakers are confronters of carnality and sin and sickness. Blessed are those people, for they shall be called the sons of God. And one of the things we've been doing these weeks is noticing a progression. the progression started with brokenness and one of the things i said was it's an interesting thing about people who are genuinely broken you know what flows from their brokenness mourning they start getting out here what's in here and you know what flows from that gentleness i've never met a gentle person or bro i've never met a broken person who wasn't gentle and we saw a progression and there's another progression that we need to catch a hold of and that's this as we come to verse 10 we need to understand kingdom people that if these kingdom realities are really true of you if you are indeed broken and you are indeed mourning and that has given birth to a hunger in you for more and more righteousness and you have begun to see that what's inside is what really matters and how things look is not what matters pure in heart and if you have indeed become a peacemaker one of the things you can know for sure is going to happen to you you're going to run right smack into the enemy and you are going to confront the system in the world and in the church and you will run into hostility it's a guaranteed thing And so it is, he begins with these words in verse 10. Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. And blessed are you when men cast insults at you and persecute you and say all sorts of evil things against you falsely on account of me. Rejoice and be glad. Your reward in heaven is great. They did the same thing to the prophets who were before you. You're in pretty good company. Let's pray. Father God this has been a rich time in this sermon of yours these beatitudes and this is the final one and I pray in Jesus name that we would hear your voice I pray Jesus that we would really hear your voice that I would be set aside that the power of your spirit would come to this place that, Father, people would be who are in the battle and sensing a conflict in their spirit feel encouragement and strength to continue the battle. And, Father, those who aren't in the battle would be identified to even themselves as being on the sidelines and by your Spirit move them into the war of the kingdom and its reality. I pray that we would hear, as it were, the very oracles of God this morning in Jesus' name. Amen. It may be for some of you that there was a time in your life when you would have found yourself coming to this passage of Scripture and having a hard time relating to it. It may be that you still have a hard time relating to it. Persecution. For someone to even say, I've been persecuted, it even kind of sounds a little grandiose. I'm being persecuted for my faith. You're so spiritual. and I think a lot of times we kind of bring to this an anticipation of something we might anticipate or associate with persecution things like prisons and torture and executions and persecution happens in countries like Uganda and Russia uh other some little jungle in South America someplace and while we might be able to or even anticipate hearing this text dealt with by bringing stories of people who have suffered for their faith and hearing stories of missionaries who, because of a love for God, had planted in their heart a love for maybe a tribe in South America someplace that nobody knew who they were, but for the love of God they went and paid with their lives. And when we hear those things, we would understand that they have indeed experienced a persecution for their faith. And we would be moved, and rightly so. And it would cause us even to search our hearts, and rightly so. And it would cause us to look at ourselves and say, Dave, do I have the kind of commitment that that person had? Would I lay down my life? And something stirs in you and me if we are indeed kingdom people and we say to ourselves, yes, I would. I want to believe that about myself. And I love God with all my heart. But then we leave and we walk out into our culture and it feels a little distant, doesn't it? Persecution feels a little remote. And it might have been a time in your life when it did feel remote, but see, then something happened to you. And I don't know if it maybe happened to you recently or it happened to you 10 years ago or 20 years ago, but see, somewhere in your life very possibly, and I need to say this right off the bat, I'm talking to not everyone today. I'm talking to kingdom people. You see, there was a time in your life, those who I'm speaking to, when God really began to deal with you. And you can identify the time because it was identified, first of all, by a real breaking. And you were broken, and I don't know what the circumstances that surrounded that breaking were, maybe it was a breaking up of a marriage. Maybe it was a public failure, sin that overwhelmed you, a sense of your own inadequacy. Who knows? Maybe you were striving like crazy, trying to serve God, and you just wore out and you quit. And finally you came to God and you said, Lord, my only hope is you. And you were broken. And it felt scary and it felt hard. And maybe some of you are in the process of that right now. And you would do anything to not have it happen. And you'd like to run away from it. It's been wrenching. But somewhere along the line, as God began to do that breaking in you, you also found in the middle of the pain a real liberation. And something in you came to life. And you maybe were very religious before that time, but something suddenly was born in you, but it didn't stop there. See, having been broken, all the pretense was gone. And you started to mourn. And you started to mourn in ways that embarrassed you even. And you started sobbing sometimes through a worship service, and you thought, I hope nobody sees this. the brokenness gave way to mourning and you started dealing honestly with your sin and you quit throwing on a happy, phony smile when you were sad on the inside and you started saying it out loud and you started dealing with your sin but then something happened that you didn't expect those around you who were Christians and loved you didn't respond to it real warmly all the time you didn't expect that you kind of pulled away a little bit when you started getting real serious and pain started flowing. You see, the pain that was flowing from you wasn't real cute and it didn't look real good and it was real messy. But it didn't stop there either, you see, because something was born in you when you were broken and you began to mourn. What was born in you was a hunger that you couldn't ever push away, a craving for more of God, a craving for more of His Word, a craving for more of his power, and worship, as I said a moment ago, began to be for you like breathing. But then you notice that again, as that hunger was born in you, and that hunger was demonstrated, among some people there was a drawing away. And even you hit a wall of apathy sometimes. And condescension to you. Maybe, you know, we joke a lot about the camp experience, the retreat experience. And sometimes our young people come home all fired up. and we as parents sometimes look at them and go, you'll get over it. Someone said that to me once. I remember when I was 18 years old, God broke me in a camp. He broke me to pieces and I came back new, mourning. It was all over the place. An elder in my church put his arm around me and said those words, you'll get over it. It was my first experience with the wall you hit when kingdom stuff comes. That's pretty benign, though. You'll get over it. It doesn't feel like persecution yet. But see, not only is there a hunger that's born in you, something else happens as the kingdom reality comes to your life. You not only get a hunger, you get eyes. And suddenly when kingdom reality comes, you start seeing stuff you never saw before. And you start seeing things differently. Things that you used to deem as spiritual don't look spiritual anymore. People who are so very involved in the church and you thought, maybe if I get real spiritual, I'll be like them. Suddenly, you didn't even want to be like them. Because though they were involved with all sorts of things, you didn't notice a gentle spirit in them, and you didn't notice a loving spirit in them, and you didn't see the life of God in them. And it bothered you that you saw that stuff. But see, it got even worse than that. Not only did you get a new hunger and new eyes, but then it wasn't enough to see it, you had to start saying it. Dummy. And that is what a peacemaker is. Remember that from last time? A peacemaker is someone who is coming into conflict, and sometimes even by bringing the truth of God to situations creates even more conflict. And you began to move in your youth group, or your singles group, or your church, and you began to say out loud, this is shallow, and this is mush, and this is carnal, and we're not going to live like that, and we're not going to go that direction, and we're going to resist you. And when that happened, and you became a peacemaker starting to say what you saw because a hunger had been born through the breaking of your spirit, the world was laid at your feet. Remember that? And they started having parades in your honor. Remember that? And banquets for you. And thoughts of the Nobel Peace Prize started floating through your head. I can tell you what your experience was if you've gone through what I just described. It wasn't banquets in your honor. It was resistance to the max. From areas and directions you never would have expected it. What you got was persecution. Persecution simply means this, to chase, to pursue, or to harass. You don't have to be nailed to a cross to feel that tension. To be chased, to be pursued, to be harassed. You got reviled. Reviled simply means to insult. That means something thrown in your face. ha that's all you need that's a revile ha condescension you'll get over it got real spiritual all of a sudden didn't you date reviling made fun of to speak evil falsely means to slander you behind your back and when the kingdom came to you those things began to happen in you but you know what i'm talking to those of you to whom the kingdom has come this morning because I got good news for you. If that's the experience of your life and if because of your brokenness and your mourning and the fact that you began to see with new eyes that it's the pure in heart that are going to see the kingdom and you began to have new mouth which began to say what you saw, I got good news for you. When you got persecuted for that, you're in real good company. You must be doing something right. That's the whole point of this text. This is to encourage those of you who are in the middle of the battle. I want to deal this morning with four aspects of kingdom conflict. And in these four aspects, again, I think that you are going to find for yourself tremendous comfort if you are in the middle of the battle to keep on going. But I also believe that the Holy Spirit of God has a powerful confrontation for some among us who may be very religious, and this is kind of the last shot of these Beatitudes, but have never been broken. You are very concerned about certain things, but you have never been broken. And brokenness is not something that characterizes you. This will be a confrontation to you. Let's get to the four aspects. Aspects number one, relative to persecution, is this. The fact of it. The fact of it. Verse 10 says, blessed are those. Isn't that nice? It's kind of distant. Blessed are those. Anybody who gets persecuted. Then verse 11, he says something a little more personal. He says this, blessed are you. I'm talking about you. Who is the you? Well, I don't want to go into this deeply because I've already set this up. The you he's speaking to are those who have been broken, mourning, hungry, on and on and on. The fact is this, according to 2 Timothy 3.12, all those who desire to live godly in Christ will suffer, will be persecuted. To live godly means broken, mourning. Make sure you know that. I want to keep connecting that. Living godly is not acting godly, acting pious, being broken, mourning over your sin hungering and thirsting for righteousness those kind of people will run into suffering in fact not only is it a fact that it will happen to you if you're living godly it is a sign that you are indeed part of the kingdom you know we look around for a lot of things that affirm to us that we're saved that tell us that we're saved and we say well when you were six did you pray the prayer? okay then you're okay well maybe you did receive Jesus when you were six but the word of God here says that one of the ways that you can know that you're part of the kingdom is when you start coming into conflict. Where are you getting that from this? I'm not getting it from this text. I'm getting it from Philippians 1, 27 to 29. Verse 29 of Philippians, Paul says this. Good news. Listen. For it has been granted to you for Christ's sake, not only to believe in him, but to suffer for his say. Oh, good. Thanks. Great. Verse 28 says something interesting. Moving up from verse 29, it says, you have all sorts of opponents. Well, let me back up. Basically, it says this. I want to hear that whether I'm with you or not with you, that you are striving together for the faith of the gospel, arm in arm, moving toward the advancing of the kingdom. But know this, don't be alarmed about the opposition you're going to get, because you will get opposition. By the way, in Philippi, the opposition they got were Judaizers. They were the false circumcision. Remember them? They are religious people who have an external focus. Don't be alarmed about them, he says, because their opposition to you is a sign of two things. It is a sign of destruction for them and of salvation for you. I never understood that verse until I dealt with this concept. Their opposition to you is a sign that they are not part of the kingdom, the fact that you are being opposed because you're broken, mourning over your sin hungering and thirsting for righteousness not caring about the externals dealing with the internals that fact that you're getting opposed for that is a sign that you are redeemed. You want to check out whether you're in the kingdom or not? Look at who opposes you. You'll be able to tell right now. Who's on your side as it were. Paul to the Thessalonians said this in chapter 3 verses 3 and 4 I told you in advance I warned you in advance that you would suffer affliction. Please don't be surprised if you're really going to live like kingdom people that opposition comes. I really think we need to come alive and just be aware. It's like just saying, okay, watch for this. For this reality. I think most of us have a tendency, and this is a normal thing, to believe that conflict is a bad sign. If there's conflict or tension in the church, it's obviously we're doing something wrong. I think we need to understand that if the reason the conflict is coming is because the kingdom of God is really being presented in a powerful, real way, that is not a bad sign, it's a good sign. Most of us have an impression that church is supposed to be quiet and nice and serene and comfortable, and we've had even people leave telling me, well, it's just not comfortable. Fine. I hope it never gets comfortable here. A body, an individual who is not creating some sort of stir is probably not doing a whole lot in terms of the advancing of the kingdom of God. There is no confrontation of your life on the culture. And I mean the Christian culture as well. Turn with me to 1 Corinthians chapter 4. Some interesting things in terms of the life of Paul. He gives us an insight into how he views himself in the ministry. Again, this whole concept of being up against opposition. 1 Corinthians 4, verse 9. I think God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as men condemned to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men. Now, when I was in 1 Corinthians 4, you might have remembered when we went through this, but the term last of all, condemned to death, is a direct allusion to the fact that in Corinth, when the Roman conquerors would come through town, They would bring with them a big parade of all the spoils of war. And at the very back of the line of all the things that these conquerors would bring, last of all was the group of people that they had captured from the people they conquered. They were bound and stripped and destined to die in the arena. They would set the animals on them, tie them up, burn them at the stake, whatever. And he is saying, this is the perception I have of myself. When I came to Jesus Christ, I laid my life on the line. And I understood that I didn't just come into eternal power and all that stuff, but I came into a lifestyle that now I consider myself as one who is destined to die. Bonhoeffer said it this way, when Jesus bids a man, he bids him come to die. There is a fact, if you live kingdom life, there will be opposition. No doubt about it. It's even a sign that you are. By the way, that testimony of Paul is an incredible contradiction and a confrontation of the fact that very often in our culture we want to try to sell God with a lollipop. We promise prosperity. We parade celebrities, athletes, entertainers. I thank God for those who are in those areas that are truly reborn people. But there's somehow a different spirit. When I see ladies on the TV, you see, with little eyelashes that are so long, if they flap fast enough, they fly away, you know? and this is Christianity isn't God neat there's a different spirit with that and what I'm hearing with Paul when he says I consider myself as last of all condemned to die I laid my life on the line when I came the fact is this those who live godly broken mourning hungering and thirsting after God making peace which means confronting sin will be opposed guaranteed and don't even start coming into the kingdom or think you're in it, and I don't want to invite anybody offering all sorts of lollipops. Know that going in. Acts 1a, Jesus said this, and you shall receive power. After that, the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be my witnesses in Judea and Samaria and the uttermost parts of the world and on and on. And the word witness there is the word martyria, which means martyr. You are my witnesses. You're going to receive power, and you are my martyria. There is something in being a witness. There is something in being a kingdom person that says this. I am laying my life out. It's more than just sharing the four spiritual laws. I am openly and willingly giving myself to the conflict. That's a fact. Point number two. The reason for it. The reason for the conflict. Why do nice people like mourners and gentle people and hungry people, why would they be persecuted? Why would they be slandered and opposed? well it says right in the text it says for righteousness sake i know i'm hammering this home and saying this over and over again but what is righteousness acting righteous brokenness mourning hungering and thirsting that's righteousness those who are being persecuted and reviled and slandered because of their brokenness and mourning and all those other things they are the ones who are blessed okay i explain it but i still don't understand why they're persecuted what what is it that becomes so offensive to people let me say it this way you've got five people and these five people are all acting very nice and very pious and very spiritual and very appropriate very churchy but then among the five one of them gets broken by the spirit of god and that brokenness begins to turn to mourning you know what that person is going to do to the other four? Expose them. The fact that one is broken and the other aren't, the fact that one is mourning and the other aren't, is going to expose the fact that something is missing in the others. If you got five people and one of them starts getting a hunger for God and the others aren't, it's going to expose the fact that they don't. And as long as churches just be churchy and nobody gets to fire a God in them or on them, everything's wonderful. Get somebody in there who's hungry, get somebody in there who's been broken by God, mourning over their sin, willing to make peace, God's peace with those people, which means they say what they see, and you're going to have all sorts of what? Trouble. And you've seen that over and over again. Luke 6, verse 11, this is nothing new. Jesus, on the Sabbath of all things, had a man come to him with a withered hand. And the man stretched out his hand and Jesus touched it and healed that hand. And then in verse 11 of chapter 6, it says this, the Pharisees were filled with rage. And they began to plot what to do with this Jesus, how they could kill him. They were filled with rage. Why? Because he healed a withered hand? Because he did it on Sunday? Why were they so angry? Well, they had a rule that said you couldn't do that. Maybe that was why. They didn't like the healing. You know, They didn't like it when he did nice things. They were so evil, altogether evil, that they didn't like anybody doing a nice thing. You know, it's deeper than that. The reason the Pharisees hated Jesus was because his power revealed the fact that these Pharisees, with all their religiosity and orthodoxy and biblical knowledge, were absolutely impotent. You bring the power of God into a congregation that is fundamental but impotent, and those impotent people will resent the daylights out of that one who is moving in the power of God every time. It's a fact. It's always been that way. It always will be that way. Those who are godly will suffer. Guaranteed. The fact that he had an internal focus and wasn't impressed with their external show exposed them. That's why they hated him. And if you're a kingdom person, that's why they'll hate you. sometimes in the church we call persecution something that it isn't see what i mean by that is this i think sometimes what we present to the world isn't brokenness and mourning and it isn't a hunger and thirst for god what we confront the world with is our spiritual arrogance and superiority and rigidity you ever see that and then when we get reviled for being rigid and superior and, you know, just condescending to everyone, we call that being persecuted for righteousness. Let's not call it that. That's not what he's talking about. When it's issued from brokenness, mourning, hungering over your sin, purity of heart, that's who this applies to, no one else. It's extremely important that we get that. You see, I think there are a lot of people who are in conflict, and maybe even up to this point in the sermon, you're going, oh, I really am in a lot of turmoil, and I hope this sermon will be an encouragement. He said it would. There are people who are in conflict here this morning in turmoil, all sorts of tension. But you know what? Your tension and your turmoil could very possibly have nothing to do with the fact that God has broken you and that you're mourning over your sin and that you're hungering and thirsting for God and you just can't get enough. The turmoil that's in you very possibly could be because you're not broken and you're not mourning and you're not hungry at all and the people around you who are getting bigger and bigger and bigger in number who are hungry and broken are making you feel real uneasy great first peter 220 paraphrase says this if you're acting bitter and rigid and dried up and you're suffering because of that don't you dare put on the garb of a persecuted martyr you ought to be miserable pay attention to the tension you feel and let god use it to break you because that's probably what he's doing. But again, over and over I hammered this thing. If it's because God has broken you and you're mourning and you're gentle and you're bringing the gospel and you're talking about what's real and you get a pose for that, the blessing applies to you. The fact of it, the reason for it, third, the source of it, where does the persecution come from? Where am I going to find the opposition? I've already kind of given hints, hints, like a truck I've given hints. where it comes from. Easy. The answer to where you're going to get the opposition is this. The world. Okay? Satan's system. Real godliness. The kingdom will never get into the world. You see? Matthew 10. Turn to it. We see that Jesus at the very beginning understood the strategy himself. Isn't that something how he understood this? He set the strategy up. Hello. What we have here is he has already identified the 12 in Matthew 10, 1 and following. And in verse 5, he is sending them out for the first sending. This is not the final sending yet. He will eventually send them to the world, but he says this, the first time he sends them out, these 12 Jesus sent out, after instructing them, saying, listen, do not go in the way of the Gentiles and do not enter any city of the Samaritans. I don't want you to go to the world yet. The first place I want you to go is this, the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Who are they? God's people, that's who they are. Go there first. Go to the house of God first. And what I want you to do in the house of God is bring the kingdom there. Because the kingdom has to start there and if the kingdom doesn't start there, it'll never get into the world. But I need to warn you, he says, in verse 16, when I send you into the house of God, when I send you to people who think they're God's people, I am sending you, verse 16, as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore, be shrewd as serpents, innocent as doves. Beware of men, for they will deliver you up to courts and scourge you in their synagogues. He is not speaking yet of men who are in the world. He is speaking of religious men, Pharisees, scribes, chief priests. They're the first wave of opposition. Because your reality and your kingdom is going to confront their impotence. I think you probably do if you were here with us in Galatians. Remember the teaching on Ishmael and Isaac. It was in Galatians chapter 4, verse 22 through 29. And I don't have time to go deeply into that whole text. But fundamentally, we had Paul giving an allegory to the Galatian church that had become externally focused and they had lost their power and authority. And Paul came to them and said, let me tell you a story. The church has two different kinds of people in it. There are people who are really redeemed. There are people who aren't redeemed, but they think they are, and they play a good game. In fact, both of them call God their father. Abraham is called their father, Ishmael. He speaks of Ishmael, and he speaks of Isaac. And he uses them as his illustration, and he says both of these guys called Abraham their father. But there was a fundamental difference between these two people. Ishmael was born of the flesh. He was born of natural causes. He was not redeemed. He did not have the life of God in him. Isaac, on the other hand, was born of faith, supernatural causes. The life of God was in him. But they both called Abraham their father, so it became very confusing. With that fact established, he went on in verse 29 and said this, Just as at in those days, the one who was born of flesh, Ishmael, persecuted him who was born of the spirit, Isaac, so it is now also. The source of resistance, first wave, is going to come from the Ishmaels who are in the body, who call God their father, but the life of God is not in them. Jesus said it this way, the kingdom of God is like a field. You better know it. And the field has those who are real and those who are not. First wave of opposition is going to come from those who are not, because your reality will expose their hypocrisy. And if we are not willing to fight the fight on that plane, we'll never get to the world with the real kingdom message. Never. Galatians 6, 12 through 13 we remember that Paul was finishing up his thoughts to the Galatian church and he had been attacking these Judaizers again their focus had become totally external and he said of them this they love to make a fair show in the flesh which means this their motto is how things look is what matters and not only do they make a fair show they look good but they're going to try you to get you to look good also and play the game in order that, and here's where it gets weird, in order that they might avoid persecution for the cross of Christ. It's a little puzzling. Well, how would maintaining a fair show and working hard at continuing to pretend and not deal with what's real help me to avoid persecution and opposition? It feels kind of odd. So what that text says is some people continue to pretend, even though they don't want to pretend necessarily, but they do it because they know if they quit and they start being real that they're going to get opposed. It's really not that hard to figure out. All you've got to do is look at Jesus himself and the reasons for which he was persecuted. The reason he was persecuted, I've already gotten over that a little bit. He came into the religious system of his day and said this, folks, I'm not impressed. You look good on the outside, but inside you're full of mush. You're doing all sorts of good stuff, but I don't see love flow from you. I don't see peace emanate from you i don't see the power of god on you how things look is not what matters how things are is what matters and you guys look great on the outside but you're full of dead men's bones on the inside and when he gave that message they loved him for it right now they crucified him for it and you better know this that when we bring that message and quit pretending and more and more say out loud how things look is not what matters. And I see you all involved, but I don't see life. I don't see peace. I don't see love flow from you. We start saying that out loud. We will get opposed. And if we're not willing to fight the fight on that level, the kingdom will never get to the world, ever. Bring it here first. But then it does go to the world. Then it does go to the world. Now this is the level at which we have a little bit harder time identifying. I can identify with the opposition in the church. I've felt it. I've experienced it. I've instigated it. And I believe that for the rest of my life I'll be part of that. Because I don't think that battle is ever over, by the way. There are victories I've seen over the last six years. This is a milestone Sunday, though, by the way. This is six years today, I think, that we got together. And we have seen victory. But that battle of keeping the wolves out was going to be forever. but one of the reasons maybe i have a little bit of hard time getting my heart into the opposition i feel from the world the reviling we get from the world is because quite honestly we haven't gotten that close maybe it's partly because we live in a relatively tolerant society i mean nobody's arresting us for having bible studies and throwing us in jail but one of the reasons i wonder if maybe what we don't feel, the reviling from the world system, is because we haven't gotten that far. We haven't busted out the walls and really affected our culture. Again, I want to reiterate here something I've already said, but I want to nail it right here again. There are a lot of calls to get out and evangelize. There are a lot of, in fact, You know, some would tell you the first thing you should do in your church when you get to your church is get an evangelistic team and get them out doing it. I don't think that's true. I think what you should do is what Jesus did. Go to the house and find the lost sheep in the house of Israel, bring the kingdom to them, and then go out. I don't know if this is a prophecy or not, but I believe the time for open door has come to affect the world. I really believe that. I don't want to sound grandiose because I feel like for six years we have been bringing the kingdom to the house, confronting the junk. What's real is what matters. And I need to warn you, as this church and you who are part of it become more and more involved in literally advancing the kingdom and bringing the message of brokenness, mourning, hungering after God, and calling the people you work with and deal with to brokenness, mourning, hunger, purity of heart, you will find opposition. And we might experience opposition that scares the daylights out of us, Things we haven't seen. I warn you ahead of time. Okay? Make sure you hear that. Remember it. I warn you ahead of time. I don't even know what that means. What I do know is this. If we bring a true kingdom message to the world, it will not be welcomed by some. The good news is this. It will be welcomed by some. And people will be born alive into the kingdom. And it won't be superiority that we'll be calling into. or rigidity that we'll be calling them to. It'll be the kingdom of God that is characterized by brokenness, and mourning, and hunger, and peace, and purity of heart. The promise. This is the best part. The promise. It says here that if this is you, and you're hitting the wall because of your brokenness, that here's what you should do with it. Rejoice and be glad. It's worse than it sounds. I mean, the Greek indicates that the glad means to jump up and down and go, Woo! Yeah! Okay. Well, you better give me a reason for that. I'll give you three reasons why we can rejoice and be glad if you're experiencing it because of those reasons. One is because yours is the kingdom. Yours is the kingdom. Blessed are you when you're persecuted for sake of righteousness, for yours is the kingdom of heaven. So that means I get heaven. That doesn't help me much. I mean, I shouldn't say that, Dave. I'm a Christian. I like heaven, heavens. Great, great, great. I'm sorry I said that. I want to tell you something. The promise of the kingdom for those who suffer is a future promise, to be sure. But you need to hear something else. That is a present-day kingdom promise now. You will now, in the context of your suffering and in the context of your being reviled, because you brought peace and you focused on what matters, you will feel and experience and see the kingdom of God now. You will see the power now. Do you remember when we started the Beatitudes that one of the things I said was, and we saw it in the text, Jesus demonstrated power and it was the power that drew people. And then he said, listen, wait a minute. The people to whom the kingdom will come and the people through whom the kingdom will flow are people like this. And people like this. Here's where we begin to see and feel the power of the kingdom. When you get down to this level, supernatural stuff is going to start coming to you. What do you mean? I mean things like this Daniel, remember Daniel? Because of his focus on God and his unyielding obedience to him and his bringing brokenness and mourning and the kingdom if you will to his culture he got thrown in a lion's death have you ever smelled lion's breath right up to here? how scared was he? how scared would you be? that's how scared he was and he was cocky and arrogant i know that would be okay he was scared to death but it was in that context of obedience and suffering for that that god did something he maybe would have never done otherwise he gave him a miracle he delivered him out of that thing and he experienced the power of the kingdom now and jeremiah because he kept on preaching the truth and kept on telling the truth and kept on saying we got to care about what's going on inside that thrown into a pit, and at the bottom of the pit was quicksand, and he was dead meat, guys, and the power of God was unleashed in that situation, and he got lifted up, and we say things like this, that stuff doesn't happen anymore. Maybe we're not doing kingdom work, because when you move into the kingdom, and it's because God broke you, and you're mourning, and you care about what's inside, and you start bringing peace, you're going to be opposed, and when you get opposed, the power of God is going to get unleashed in our church, in your family, in our lives. Guaranteed. Kingdom then, you bet. Kingdom now, you bet. Yeah, but some people died. Didn't get delivered. Where's your kingdom now? One guy who died was Stephen. He's preaching. Jesus crucified and risen again. They started throwing stones at him, and he was about to die. So his promise was kingdom future, right? Yeah, but kingdom present too. You know what happened to Stephen when he was dying? You know. It says this, while he was dying, and the stones were hitting, he looked into heaven, and the heavens opened. You know what he saw? Jesus standing at the right hand of the Father. I've got to go into this. You remember this. You are in Hebrews. You know this picture of Jesus who stands at the right hand of the Father. And the picture is that relative to our redemption, Jesus sits down. Remember that? And it signifies what? That the work is done. Relative to your forgiveness, there's no more work to do because you are forgiven. And he is sitting at the right hand of the Father. But the glory of that picture, Jesus standing at the right hand of the Father, is this. That one of his saints, who is part of his kingdom and who is doing kingdom work, is in trouble. You know what Jesus, our great high priest does, he stands up. And he gave to Stephen while he was dying the power of the kingdom even to die. Words don't get that, do they? Do you see that? I read a story this last week written by a guy named Don Robinson who wrote The Peace Child. He wrote another book about a guy named Stan Dale who had a mission work in Erie and Jaya. And he was one of these people who went to a tribe that nobody knew about in Irian Jaya, the Yali tribe. And he paid with his life. But the story of his death is somewhat gruesome as these tribesmen, these cannibals, shot him with one arrow and then two and then three and then ten and twenty and thirty, fifty arrows filled his body and he still stood. And their glee at his death as the arrows entered his body He turned to horror and fear. You know what I think happened to that guy? He got the promise of the kingdom future. You bet. But I think that while he was dying, he got the promise of the kingdom now. He got the power of the kingdom there. And in your persecution, and in the times when you're reviled, you will have the promise of future kingdom, but you will have present reality as well. Without a doubt. That's the promise. Yours is the kingdom. Yours is the kingdom. Another reason you can rejoice and be glad is because it says this, great is your reward. What's the reward? Well, the Bible says something about crowns that we wear. So we're going to get crowns. But what I want to know is what are the crowns? Are they going to be literal crowns? Like the kind you get at Burger King, those things? You ever see them? You got kids, you know what I'm talking about. They hate the food, they like the crowns. I hope I don't disappoint anybody when I tell you that I don't think it's going to be crowns. In fact, I hope it's not going to be crowns because I don't look stupid in crowns. And will there be any stars in my crown? I don't know. We are going to get crowns though. You know what I think the crowns are going to be? You know what I think I'm going to wear and you're going to wear? Those of you who have been in the kingdom conflict because of your brokenness and mourning and all those things. The crown you're going to wear is the capacity to praise. It is going to be the Shekinah glory of God. That's going to be the crown you wear. And that, by the way, fits when we talk about the fact that in the Word of God, it says we are going to get a crown, and we will take our crown and cast him at his feet. The capacity of praise that I have as my reward, I'm going to take that praise and cast it at his feet forever. That's a future promise. I am going to get a reward, and it's going to be great. And I think it's going to be the capacity to praise, and it's a future thing. But you want to know what else about that future thing? I think it's a present thing. I do. And it's a present reality, by the way, that we can see in our body right now. There are people who are involved in kingdom reality. They have been broken. They are mourning. They are hungry. And you know what? When you worship, you know what? You can see the Shekinah glory of God, a capacity to praise. And you know what else you can see? Among others who have never been broken, who are not mourning, who are still stuffing it all in here, look sour as can be, no capacity to praise, I think they're going to look the same way in heaven. Saved as by fire. Great is your reward. What's going to be the reward? I'm speculating on what I just said. I don't know that for sure. I think I'm right. Want to bet? We'll collect in heaven, okay? I think I can get away with that one, too. You'll all forget. He will, too. He knows I'm kidding. whatever the reward is you know what it is? it's great you know what the Greek word great means? great here's another reason you can rejoice and be glad because not only is the kingdom yours future and present and not only is your reward yours future and present but you're in pretty good company because they persecuted the prophets who were before you I don't have to take long on this I just say it this way if you are being reviled and opposed because of your brokenness and mourning then what you need to know about yourself is that in the same breath that God would mention the name of Jeremiah and Isaiah and Daniel and Hosea would come to name John and Mary and David and Susan and you and me. Rejoice. Be glad. You're fighting the right fight if you're in this fight. One last word. And this just sets us up for next week. If it really is that kind of war and I really am going to get opposed when I bring this to the world by my neighbors and the people I work with and all those kinds of things. Kind of makes you want to just huddle together, doesn't it? Let's just kind of hang on to each other and sing songs, okay? Well, I'll tell you, that's what church is for. We come together to do what? Encourage one another. Stimulate one another. We come back here to get healed. You come back here to get your wounds healed. That's what this is for. to feel again the presence and the power of the body as it ministers to you. But you know what Jesus says at the same time? There is a tendency to want to stay in this context, to find a little commune where I can live and be isolated from the world. And that's why the next words out of Jesus' mouth is this. Listen, guys, it's going to be hard, and you're going to get hurt. And I'm sending you out as sheep among wolves, but you are the salt of the earth. And salt that stays in the shaker isn't worth much. And you are the light of the world. And what I want you to do with your light is not keep it in your house. I want you to put it on a hill. And when that light goes on a hill, you know what's going to happen? Men will be drawn to you. But there's something else you need to know about a light on a hill. It not only draws people, it'll make you a target. Rejoice. Be glad. Your reward is great. Yours is the kingdom. You're right in line with the prophets. You're fighting the right fight. let's pray God I pray that you would unleash this battle among us it has been released we have seen it but God I really do sense in my spirit as a body we are moving and on the threshold of another step into the world with the message of the kingdom and it is not an arrogant message we bring it is not a self-righteous message we bring it is a grace message of brokenness but there will be opposition and I pray, God, that you would make us bold in Jesus to go and to minister the power of God wherever we go. I ask these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
