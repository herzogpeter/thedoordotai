So what kind of God is God to a desperate man? Which is really the question we've been dealing with through the parables of Luke 15 the last couple of weeks. Because last week we discovered that for a lost sheep that's wandered from the fold, God is like a sheep owner who's not afraid to do the dirty work of raising his royal robes and trampling through the mud to bring that sheep home. And for a lost coin that's fallen through the cracks of life that no one else would care about or even notice that it's missing. God is like a crazy woman. Remember that last week? Who does what no one else would do relative to lost coins in looking for that coin because she lights the lamp and sweeps the floor and she won't stop sweeping until she finds this thing, this person that nobody else cares at all about. But what kind of God is God? To a son or a daughter who didn't just wander off or fall through the cracks in some way, but leaves with no intention of returning. The kind of God is God when you've written God off and you've squandered your life. Well, to find out the answer to that, I want you to open your Bibles with me, if you have them, to Luke's Gospel, the 15th chapter, beginning in the 11th verse. It's the third parable of this trilogy of parables we've been dealing with the last couple of weeks. Luke 15, verse 11, where we will discover that God is not just a shepherd who had 100 sheep, and he's not just a crazy woman who had 10 silver coins, but he's also like a father who had two precious sons. And it all begins with these words in verse 11. And he said, that is, Jesus said, a certain man had two sons. And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the share of my inheritance that falls to me and give it to me now. And so his father did. Divided his wealth between them. And not many days later, the son gathered everything together that was part of his inheritance and went on a journey into a distant country. And there he squandered everything he had, his estate, and he did it with loose living. Now, when he had spent everything, a severe famine actually occurred in that country, and he began to be in need. And he went and he attached himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed the swine. And suddenly this guy was longing to fill his stomach with the pods that the swine were actually eating, but no one was giving anything to him. But when he came to his senses, stop right there in the story. Among the first things that I noticed about this story, and I've already even alluded to it, and you especially notice this when you keep this story connected with the first two. It's this, that unlike the wandering sheep and the lost coin parables, this young man's wandering far from home into a different country is intentional. It's angry and it's rebellious. Remember we talked about that last week because sheep don't wander far from home because they're mad at the shepherds. They wander because they're stupid. They smell something and they start to follow it and they get lost the way we often get lost. They're not mad at God. They don't want to get in trouble. You get distracted and all of a sudden you start following something and before you know it, you don't even know where home is anymore and you wonder, how did I get here? And coins. in the symbolism of the coin. A coin, if you stay literal with it, like we did last week, has no volition at all. Indeed, last week I called these coins as kind of being the embodiment of the least, of the least, like disposable people who like a misplaced coin has fallen through the cracks. But this younger son is doing what he's doing on purpose. It's intentional, it's angry, its rebellion, thus making the response of the father much different than that of the searching shepherd or the sweeping woman doing anything to bring this person, sheep, or coin back because he isn't searching in this context. He isn't pursuing. He's letting this lost son go, Which at one level, I mean, if you've ever had children and, you know, maybe a little psychology and how this kind of stuff works, it's very good advice. Because sometimes, and you know it's true, the absolute worst thing you can do in certain situations is to keep rescuing this person. Be it your son or daughter or dear friend of yours, maybe even a parent, is to keep bailing them out. sometimes the worst thing you can do because all it really does in certain situations is to prevent them from experiencing the natural and necessary consequences that might actually bring them to their senses. But knowing when to do which, when to pursue and when to let go, requires wisdom. And we don't always have it. It requires a capacity to discern because sometimes we do need to decide, is this a wandering sheep that needs to be rescued? Or is this a prodigal that needs to be released? I mean, these are questions you have to do in ministry. You have to deal with that, and there aren't always easy answers to that. And you don't treat everybody the same, because sometimes it is a wandering sheep, and we're going to go get them. And sometimes it's a prodigal, and we're not going to go get them. We're going to let them go. Thus allowing them to maybe hit the wall that again may bring them to their senses. So we need to discern, is this a wandering sheep, a lost coin, or a prodigal son? Because you treat them differently. Last week, I told you the story. Actually, I don't think I told it in this service. I didn't think of it till the third service. So I told the 11 o'clock service about our son Caleb when he was 12, 13 years old, how he ended up in the backseat of a police car because he stole a packet gum from a convenience store. It was a delightful experience for him and us as well. There's a lot of things I remember about that incident. One was that we found out about it when we came back from a missions trip. Isn't that holy? You know, we're doing the holy God thing, and you know, in Africa, saving them, you know, whatever. And my kid is in the cop's car, and Gene and Dick McCauley were taking care of him because they were kind of their grandma and grandpa in those days, and Dick was so gentle with my son, but firm as well, and one of the things I remember about that season, I mean, how many of you know that a 12-year-old kid, given those circumstances in his age, that it might be too soon to let him go, you know? Really was a fascinating time we did this evaluation. In fact, we had to go to Brooklyn Center Police Department several weeks after this happened and do some things that were very important for him, and I went right along with him, and And they had this class that had to meet two or three weeks, and they basically scared the bejeebers out of them. This is, oh, it's going to happen to you, kid, if you ever do this again. And they had this evaluation where this counselor came and asked him a bunch of questions, and I was with him. And it was kind of a parole officer type of person, and Caleb was kind of going, what is he doing this for? And I said, Caleb, they're trying to figure out if you're a juvenile delinquent or just stupid. Yeah. And it turns out, Caleb, you're just stupid, Which is really good news. Because what that means, Caleb, and I didn't say this to him. I did say that to him. What this means is that this is way too soon, Caleb, to let you go. So we kept searching for him, and we kept intervening on him the way you do when you have a sheep that just keeps wandering off, but they're good, and they don't want to be lost. You bring them back. because at this time in his life he wasn't a prodigal. He was a wandering sheep. But sometimes you have to let them go, to let them hit the wall that might just bring them to their senses. And if you've ever had to do that with a child or maybe a parent or a friend, it's agonizing to watch. It's agonizing to do, but I think you know it's true that sometimes it's what you have to do. but as wise and as necessary as that approach sometimes is what's interesting about this parable is we dial back into the culture which is what we've been doing in the history around it in the culture of jesus day what this father actually does here when his son asks him for the inheritance and then he gives it to him was actually something that to the original hearers would have sounded quite bizarre. Because the fact is this, no self-respecting father in Jesus' day, having been asked for the inheritance by the son so he could take it and waste it, no self-respecting father would ever do that, ever. I mean, let me explain that to you. First of all, just some stuff about the inheritance. Because when this youngest of two sons demanded his share of the estate, and he demanded it now, What he was effectively saying to his father was this, I wish you were dead, because generally when you get the inheritance, it's when your father dies, I want it now, means I wish you were dead. In fact, say it this way, I want to live, Dad, as if you were dead. In other words, you're dead to me, so give me now what I would naturally get if you were dead. Kenneth Bailey, author and lecturer of Middle Eastern New Testament studies, This guy I've been referencing several times in the last couple of weeks relative to the history of this kind of stuff. In his book, Through Peasant Eyes, says about this dynamic this. That over the 15 years I have been asking people of all walks of life, from Morocco to India, from Turkey to Sudan, about the implications of a son's request for his inheritance while the father is still living. The answer has almost always been emphatically the same, and the conversations go something like this. He, that is Bailey, asks someone this question. Has anyone ever made such a request in your village? Never is the response across the board. Could anyone ever make such a request in your village? Impossible is the response. If anyone did ever make such a request, what would happen? The father would beat him senseless. is the response to that question. Why? Because this request means he wants his father to die. So, the fact that the father, or the son, asks for the inheritance before his father dies is supremely insulting. Okay, kind of think of how insults land in Middle Eastern kinds of contexts, but then the fact that the father actually gives this to his son makes the father, in the eyes of everybody listening to this story, given this culture, look like an absolute chump. Because no self-respecting father in the Middle East, in Jesus' day, would even think, would even think that that would be an appropriate response to this kid's request. So this story at this level is bizarre to them. You can almost hear them as Jesus is telling the story. You can almost hear them kind of saying to themselves, wait, wait, wait, wait, the father gave it to him, and then the father let the kid leave? Never happened. I don't, I mean, I don't know this for sure. I don't even think it did happen, but you can almost kind of people going, ah, this is a dumb story. I'm leaving. You've lost all credibility because what you're describing would never happen. Could never happen. He'd sooner beat the daylights out of this kid, lock him in a room and throw away the key. He'd never let him leave. but all of this stuff is intentional on the part of Jesus and he's pushing little buttons and it raises again this question the question again is this what kind of God is God because here the kind of God if the father is kind of God figure here right here this picture of God doesn't fit anybody's perception of God at all because in this particular picture, God looks weak and he looks needy, he looks vulnerable, and he looks like someone you could take advantage of. What kind of God is that? How could you worship a God like that? The kind of God is God. Well, given this, and this is something that, again, would be disturbing to these hearers, the truth, though, is this. I think it's the kind of God that's being reflected here who wants a relationship that isn't held together like a lot of relationships are held together. A relationship that isn't held together by the threat of force or fear or coercion, but love. Oh, it sounds so soft. So that if you stay in the house of your father, it is saying the father, and I hope you do stay in my house, says the father. If you do, though, I hope you do it because you love the father. But if you don't authentically love the father, I'm not going to beat you up. And I'm not going to make you stay. I'll let you go. But it will break my heart when you do. Indeed, one way maybe to see this dynamic a little more clearly, though I think what I just said makes it clear, but maybe a way to feel it a little more deeply is to change the analogy from a father and a son to a husband and a wife or a bride. And that is an analogy that's used in Scripture to speak of Christ, the groom and his church, the bride. some years ago, early days here at Open Door, many years ago, I remember getting a phone call from a man in our church, a younger guy, whose wife had just left him. And I knew why she left him, but he didn't know, at least at the time, that I knew why she left. And the reason he called me was to enlist me. You can kind of picture this. To enlist me in applying pressure to his wife to return to him to force her home. And his primary method is very interesting to me. You know, I was the pastor, and here's this young guy, and I was a young guy then at the time as well, but his primary method to accomplish his task was to read to me the Bible. He was reading to me the Bible over the phone, and he read to me all the verses that he interpreted to mean that he was the head that she should submit, and he was kind of one of those, God said it, I believe it, that settles it, Tell her it, guys. Now, I said a number of things that day to him on the phone, and I asked him a few questions, like whether he had any intention at all of actually loving his wife. I love my, okay, the way you like reading these submission verses, did you read the rest of that chapter about Christ loving the bride, loving your wife the way Christ loved the church, and the way he loved the church was to give his life away for her, to serve her, not forcing her. And we talked about what I knew was his behavior that had precipitated her departure. And I asked him some questions about that, like, do you know that she's afraid of you? Did you have any, like, idea why that might be? And we went round and round, and he gave me all these things, whatever. But in the end, I said this. What if it works? What if we could get her back your way by applying lots of pressure that forces her home? What would you have? Well, I'd have her. And we'd have our marriage. I just thought, wow. And in my mind, and then I talked about this a little bit, no, what you'd have is control. And that's what he wanted, and that's what he lost. And that's why he was mad. So if we could force her home, you'd have her physical presence. But would you have her heart? No, he admitted that, because you can't force that. so would you miss not having her heart? Would you want to have her heart? Would you like it if she was home because she wanted to be there? Yeah, but how? Well, first, you're going to need to realize that you can't force this. You can't make her feel something or want something she doesn't want. and you're going to have to let go of control and in fact let go of her but to do that you'd actually have to love her more than you love yourself which you clearly don't so you clearly won't i have no hope at all for you he hung up the phone never heard from him again. I'm a horrible counselor. They don't let me anywhere in your adult life. I'm just kidding about that. Bad story. Maybe not a bad story. What kind of God is God? Well, I think he's the kind of God who wants a relationship that isn't held together by threat of force or fear or coercion, but love. So that if you stay, and I hope you do stay, in the house of your father, the God who made you, if you stay in that context of life, I hope you do it because you love the father. But if you don't authentically love the father, I'm not going to beat you up or make you stay. I'll let you go, says the Father to, quite frankly, his lost creation. But it will break my heart when you do go. All of which, again, is a picture of God that the people listening, particularly the scribes and Pharisees that we met in verses 1 and 2 would absolutely reject. Because in this picture, God looks weak and vulnerable and even foolish. And God here in this story is actually doing things that they would never do. Remember the scribes and Pharisees? The context of these parables, I haven't touched on it again this week, but it was all about how Jesus' parables were spinning off of the grumbling and complaining of the scribes and Pharisees because Jesus received sinners and ate with them. and these parables were his explanation to the Pharisees of why he ate with sinners and received them because God cares about lost sheep and lost coins and lost people and they never did and they wouldn't care about lost sheep or people and they would never do this as well. Back to the story, the son leaves. Pick it up in verse 13. He gathers everything together and goes on a journey, a journey that I'm quite sure at the beginning it felt like an incredible adventure to a distant country and there he squandered his estate with loose living loose living and loose living might have included what we would consider immoral behavior but but really if you want to if you want to get the picture of this in a broader sense it it just means reckless with reckless living he had this precious thing this inheritance this boatload of money this is i'm buying everybody drinks you want something he He just gave it away. It just flowed through his fingers. He was spending what he had recklessly. And I'm quite sure that while he was doing all of that, it felt great. He felt free, freer probably than he'd ever felt in his whole life. And maybe even thinking of thoughts of his father who was so restrictive and what a horrible way to live. This is the life. Drinks are on me. but verse 14 says that when he spent it all recklessly just gave it all away a severe famine occurred now this is fascinating again this is not a true story Jesus is making the story up so everything has meaning and the the famine happening in this story of Jesus is just powerfully symbolic because it just adds to the picture of what inevitably happens in situations like this because sooner or later, all of that, yeah, recklessness, it dries up. Sooner or later, it will. End of verse 14, and he began to be in need. Verse 15, so he went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country. Fascinating picture there, again, is the attaching himself. It literally means he glued himself to somebody. Bailey, again, is helpful here, saying that this young man, having arrived in the community of this far off country would have been seen in the community as a stranger who didn't necessarily belong but he's bringing some resources and buying everybody drinks you know so okay he can be here but now that all of that stuff is gone he would have been seen as an unwanted hanger on and the polite this is interesting the polite middle eastern way to get rid of someone like that was to assign them a task that they knew they would receive thus ridding themselves of this hanger-on guy. Go feed the pigs. Verse 15, they say to him, and he sent him to his fields to feed swine, a symbol especially to a Jew who's concerned with what's clean and what's unclean of how far he has fallen. But then verse 16, it gets worse. He hits proverbial bottom, and he realizes that the pigs are actually eating better than he is. And he actually begins to long for the pods that the pigs themselves were eating. I'd settle right now for pig food. And no one was giving anything to him. And then he came to his senses. Verse 17. Now, I just, I presume that most everybody here has either a monumental way or even some small ways, had that feeling of coming to your senses like this. And there are some universal things that are experienced when that happens. Among them are these. In fact, the first usually is this. When you come to your senses, the first thing that usually happens is this, that we begin to feel the weight of what we've done. And that what we've done can't be undone. Because what you had has been squandered. It has been spent. And it is gone. There is no getting the inheritance back. And if you've ever experienced anything like that, it's a horrifying experience. To realize that what you've lost, you can't get back. And for the prodigal, obviously, what was lost was his inheritance, no getting it back. But for some of us, what was lost was a marriage because you spent it on something else. For others of us, what was lost was the trust of your friends or an opportunity you had to grow. And rather than use the opportunity to grow, you spent it. You squandered it. You wasted it. And now you're feeling the weight of it. What have I done? It's a horrible feeling. Some people, ironically, manage to avoid that feeling for a very long time. Sometimes, I suppose, people can avoid it their whole life if they never end up eating with pigs. But when the weight of this fell on him and he came to his senses, I find this fascinating. The prodigal began to think of home. Verse 17. stirred thoughts of home, and how many of my father's servants have more to eat than me. So I will rise and go to my father. But the moment you have that thought, this is another universal thing, I think. It raises the question. The question is this, I'll go to my father. What's the question? What kind of father is my father? What kind of God is God? And how you answer that question has absolutely everything to do with whether you're going to go home or not. Father, he said the word out loud as he looked off into space. Father, they used to say I look like you. His father's eyes, they said I had. But now even you wouldn't recognize me, Dad. If only I hadn't. If only I could. Start over. Go home. So he stood up and began to walk. I'm going home. Well, the road home was actually a lot longer than he'd remembered it. And always is. When he traveled it last time, he turned heads because of his style. If he turned heads this time, it was because of his stink. his clothes were worn, his hair was matted, his feet were black but it didn't bother him because he was going home and he was going home a different guy not demanding that he get what he deserved but willing to take whatever he could get, give me had been replaced with help me and his defiance had been replaced with repentance he came asking for everything with nothing to give in return he had no money he had no excuses and he had no he had no idea how much his father had missed him he had no idea the number of times his father had paused between chores to look out the front gate for his son the boy had no idea the number of times his father had awakened from a restless sleep gone into his son's room and sat by this boy's bed and the son would never have believed the hours that the father sat on the porch next to an empty rocking chair looking, longing to see that familiar face, that stride, that figure of a young man coming home. As the boy came around the bend that led up to his house, he rehearsed his speech one more time. Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. as he approached the gates and placed his hand on the latch, he began to lift it. And then he paused. Second thoughts were streaming into his mind and his plan to go home suddenly looked like a really bad one. What's the use? He heard himself asking, what chance do I have? And so he ducked and began to turn around and began to walk away. But then he heard footsteps. They were running steps, slap, slap of sandals running. Someone was running. He didn't even turn to look because he knew it wasn't his father. His father was a nobleman and nobleman in the Middle East. They don't run. The picture is ridiculous. You pick up your robes and you look like a goofy person. It just was not dignified. In fact, noblemen like my father have servants running to them. They don't run. so it probably was a servant running to chase me away or my big brother wanting to know what I'm doing back home so he began to leave but the voice he heard was not the voice of a servant nor the voice of his brother it was the voice of his father son, son father he turned to open the gate but the father already had The son looked at his father standing at the entrance. Tears glistened on his cheeks. His arms stretched from east to west, inviting his son to come home. Father, Father, I have sinned. The words were muffled as the boy buried his face in his father's shoulder. The two wept. For forever they stood at the gate intertwined as one. Words, not necessary. Repentance was real. Forgiveness was easy. The party began, let's rejoice, for this son of mine was dead, but he has come to life. But there were two sons. And the second son, who is, it's fascinating, is the mirror image of the grumbling Pharisees. In verse 2, where this whole thing began, was angry. Look at it in verse 28. It says he was angry and unwilling to go into the party rejoicing. So the father goes out to him. I love that. The father pursues him and began entreating him, which simply means inviting him, saying, come, come join the party. You can be part of this. Oh, son, don't you see, verse 31, that you've always been with me and that all that is mine belongs to you, not holding anything out on you. But son, do you see? Have you been paying attention? There's this sheep that was lost, and we found it. And there was this coin that nobody cared at all about, and it's been recovered. And now your brother, who was dead, has come to life. Rejoice. Get happy with me. But he couldn't, or he wouldn't. Bottom line, he didn't. And it broke the Father's heart again. So what kind of God is God? He's that kind of God. Let me close with this wondering. Given these images of God, like a father who releases us when we just gotta go and waits for us and then runs to us when we come back home. Here's what I wonder. When Jesus was actually telling this parable, did he use his hands? The way I do, like up here, you know, you use your hands, you get a little animated. Did he do that? And here's the other question I have, this wondering I have. When he got to the part where the father received the son, did he do what I did? A few moments ago, Did he open his arms just like this when he was telling the story? And did he perceive, when he was telling the story, did he perceive the thoughts of some of them in the crowd? Because some who were listening to this weren't all like the scribes and the Pharisees who might have been thinking, I could never go home. Not after my life. I wonder when he was telling this story, did he see a housewife look down at the ground or maybe a businessman shake his head as if to say, I can't start over. I've gone too far. I made my bed, I'll sleep in it. And did he open his arms thinking of those people even wider as if to say, you can come home. You can come home, yes you can. Well, I don't know if he did it that day. But we know that later he did. Because later, Jesus stretched his hands as wide open as he could, and he forced his arms so wide apart that they hurt really bad. And to prove that those arms would never fold again, and those hands would never close again, he had them nailed open. and they still are open. So what kind of God is God? He's that kind of God. Oh, heart of mine Why must you stray? From one so fair you'll run away And one more time you have to pay The heaviness, the needless shame Oh heart of mine, I'll come back home You've been too long out on your own And he's been there all along Watching for you down the road So come home running His arms are open wide His name is Jesus and he understands He is the answer you are looking for So come home running just as you are O child of God, so dearly loved And ransomed by the Savior's blood And called by name, daughter and son Wrapped in the robe of righteousness So come home running His arms all open wide His name is Jesus He understands He is the answer You are looking for So come home running Just as you are So come home running, His arms are open wide His name is Jesus, He understands Here is the answer you are looking for So come home running, just as you are Just as you are Thank you.
