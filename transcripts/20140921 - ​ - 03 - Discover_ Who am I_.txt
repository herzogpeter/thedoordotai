Well, here's the deal. Three weeks ago, we started this fall by inviting all of you on a journey. The journey is our mission, and we invited you to join us as together we pursue the struggle of becoming fully alive in God. You are invited. Last week, at the start of this journey, our senior pastor, Dave Johnson, gave a message where he sought to answer this question, Who is God? Well, that's a huge question, one that's pretty tough to do in 30 to 40 minutes. Dave gave it his best shot. And we believe that he spoke what is a critical message for us in defining what we believe about God, who God is, and what God is like. There's a great deal of confusion out there about who God is. And if we are going to be on this journey of becoming fully alive in him and pursuing him, it's critical that we think rightly about God. And we believe that message is a great place for us to start. So if you weren't here last weekend, we'd strongly encourage you to listen to that message online and stay in the journey with us Next weekend, we're going to look at the question of who are we as the church? Really, who are we? And for several weeks, we're going to look at that But before we get there this weekend, our spiritual development pastor, Vicki Degner Is going to come and help us take a next step on this journey by helping each of us Look at the very important question that gets at the core of our identity Who am I? But before Vicki comes We want to remember again That with every step on this journey For us to know and experience Who God really is And for us to become The people of God That he longs for us to be For that to happen That work requires A movement of the spirit of God And so we absolutely Have to be led by the spirit Empowered by the spirit And so again this week I ask that we together open our hearts, open our minds, open our spirits and let's go to God together in prayer. Holy Spirit of God, if we are to become fully alive in you, it'll take a work of you in us, individually and as a body. We want to change, we want to be your people but to do that, we have to have you among us So we ask again, as one body, we come and we say, Holy Spirit, have your way among us. Anoint every part of this room. Fill it with your presence. We cannot do this without you. We ask your blessing and your anointing and your empowering upon Vicki that the word you've given her, that the story that comes through her would have the power that it needs from your spirit to touch us deeply. And we ask all of this in the name of our Lord Jesus. Amen. Good morning, everybody. I could hardly wait to get here to see you this morning. So I'm glad to be here, and I'm glad you're here. I'm going to put you to work right away this morning. If somebody came up to you and asked you, who do you say that you are at the core of you? What is the essence of your identity? What is the most honest answer you could give that question today? Just think about that a little bit. How would you put in words today the essence of your identity? The only way that I can answer that question today, based upon what the scriptures say and what I have experienced, is to say that at the core of who I am, I am the beloved of God. To me, everything else about my identity, on a good day, flows out of the reality that I am first and foremost loved at my core. And I want us to be aware today, as we look at this question together, that it can be very challenging for those of us that have been churched for many years to sit with this question honestly, because we've been hearing for a lifetime, many of us, that God is love and I am loved unconditionally. But when it actually comes to our functional theology, the actual way that we behave, it tells something different about what we really believe, oftentimes. This morning, I want to create some space for us to wrestle with this question, who am I, by telling some story and sitting in some scriptures together. I want to invite us to listen to the word of God with our hearts this morning. Listen to the word of God this morning with the eyes of your heart, the ears of your heart. And let's try not to solve this question overly so with our beautiful minds. May God allow our heads to drop down into our hearts this morning as we spend time together. And I pray that the spirit of God, even now, Speak his words deep into your heart, into my heart, this morning. My prayer this week has been Romans 5.5. In that portion of scripture it says, The love of God has been poured into our hearts by the Spirit of God, whom God has gladly given us. So us connecting at a deep core level with the truth of who we are in God happens by the Spirit of God. And it is oftentimes mysterious. Paul speaks about it this way in Ephesians 1.3, about who we are. He says, how blessed is God long before he laid down earth's foundations. He had us in mind. And he settled on us as the focus of his love. To be made whole and to be made holy by his love. in my own life I've come to rest in my belovedness more and more over the years primarily through two types of experiences the first one is confronting my own distorted images of who God really is who I thought God to be and the second one is learning to surrender to the love of God in the deep darkness of my life. In the hope that it will help you connect to your own experience of your journey of becoming fully alive to God this morning, rather than just teaching, I want to tell you a story. I want to tell you a story of my journey in coming to answer this question, who am I in deeper ways? And as you listen over the next few minutes of some story, will you keep a couple things in mind? Keep in mind that our view of God has tremendous power to change everything about how we see ourselves and how we behave. And secondly, we might as well come to grips with the fact, people, that we all have things within us that protest this extravagant love of God. I grew up the oldest of six children. I had two loving parents. I still do. My mom had five of her six children by the time she was 25. I know. Ouch. My job in the family is the oldest. was junior mother. I helped raise my brothers and sisters. My life was school, chores at home, babies and siblings. There were rules in our household about attitude, obedience, the telephone, and curfew that were often quite a bit more restrictive than many of my friends. As a young person, I knew in my mind that God loved me because they told me so in Sunday school. But I did not yet know as a child or even as a teenager, I didn't have a lived experience of what that really meant. In fact, my developing and distorted image of God as a young person was that he was more like a warden that had a measuring stick about as tall as I was, that constantly during the day was measuring out my performance. And then God would dole out limited doses of his nearness, his affection, and his goodness, according to how I met up to some elusive expectation around performance and, frankly, perfection. I recall even as a young person, having an engine inside of me of anxiety around performance, always. I thought God to be real, but distant. Not willing or frankly even interested to engage with my heart or listen to my heart's deepest needs. As a young girl, it was obvious very early on that I was made as quite a sensitive, caring, and frankly emotional young thing. I was way attuned to other people's feelings I was moved to tears easily I had a heart heavy even as a young person with many concerns and fears and worries not only for myself but for lots of other people and I began to feel isolated with all that I was feeling early on a name I began to take on a lie I began to believe was, my feelings are too much for those around me. My feelings are too much for God. I am too much. And I began to take on shame for being made to show empathy in the world. I could not yet live it as my gift. Now moved to Vicki as a 20-something-year-old young woman. These distorted images of God that were developing me began to show up in my life in more costly ways. The first of which was my marriage. Unconsciously, I went into marriage thinking it was my chance to feel separated, alone, misunderstood, no longer. I would now have a partner of my very own to live life with who would notice me, listen to me, and feel every need in my aching heart. I know. Surprise, surprise. This isn't how marriage worked out. I had a big hole in my heart the size of Montana that was in the need of being filled by love. And I quickly found out that that hole in my heart that needed to be filled would never be able to be filled by Jerry. You know why? Because no human is meant for that. No human can meet that sort of need in us. Only God can meet our hearts' deepest cry to be loved and to be blessed. Well, I spent a good amount of the first 10 years of my marriage demanding emotional intimacy from my husband that he could not give because I had simply set the bar way too high. I let him know way too often that the love he showed me wasn't enough. Yes, I was a lot of work. And I'm embarrassed about it. I want you to know that I've since confessed and asked forgiveness of my husband. He's right there. We're good, right? For demanding so much from him that was not his to give. Now, I may have wore him out in those years, but you know what? I wore myself out. I became exhausted in this search. Some years later, I came upon a book called Life of the Beloved, written by Henry Nouwen. And I read some words in this book that spoke so deeply to the core of my experience so far in life. I'm going to read them to you, and you can follow along on the slide if you wish. But Henry says this, The way to spiritual exhaustion and burnout is the compulsive drive to find our well-being in something other than the fact that we are beloved of God in Christ. well you and I don't have to kill ourselves about that anymore because we are the beloved it's a fact we are intimately loved long before any parent any teacher, any spouse, any child or friend loved or wounded us that is the truth of our lives so began my lifelong journey of coming to God a very broken and needy woman searching for his love for me I could see that my drivenness my compulsive drive to find this need in me fulfilled other places was disordered and I knew that I had to settle something at the core of me. So I began to search and study the scriptures. For the places in which the truth, it spoke about the truth of who God was. And the places in which the truth of how God sees me was written about. And I prayed and I journaled and I meditated and sat in those scriptures for extended periods of time, over years. and slowly that inner engine that I spoke about earlier of compulsive searching in me it began to slow down and slowly my behaviors began to change I began to learn that the very broken part of me that part of me that goes into overdrive thinking that I can work for this love from God or that I don't deserve it that very broken part of me was suddenly becoming, as I noticed it, a very personal and urgent invitation from God to experience him as loving me right here, right now, in the middle of my brokenness. I began to practice the presence of some new things, some new names for God, like the God who hears me, the God who listens to me, the God that knows my heart, the God that made me sensitive so I could discern some things. As I moved through my life, I continued to experience becoming more fully alive to this love which is at the core of our existence. And in my 40s, I was still a baby. in my journey around this concept, and I would say that I still am, because it's so unsearchable, this extravagant love of God. While things had gotten easier in my marriage, thanks be to God, I began to experience some significant darkness due to the exhaustion of the reality of my son's autism in our lives. And I shared some of that story with you back in August, so I'm not going to repeat the details of that today. While I knew that God was still there somewhere in this season, I had no sense, no felt sense or experience of his presence like I had in times past. And this lasted for me many years. I couldn't see him or feel him. Jerry and I had started our marriage and full-time ministry together, And I had hopes that that would continue, but by now we had needed to give up many things just so we could conserve enough energy to care for our little family with such exceptional needs. It was challenging for us to even make it to church, let alone serve. In those days, the transitions involved for my son that were involved in going anywhere were more than he could handle. Just trying to get him dressed into the car was exhausting for us all. His little body would scream and kick and hit through the whole process. And then once we'd get him in the car, he'd scream and bang his head all the way to where we were going. It was exhausting. I was working as a nurse in those years, in this time of darkness in my life. And I remember going to work for a long period of time. I'd go to put in my evening shift, holding such deep concern and praying to God that I wouldn't make a mistake that evening that would cost me my job because I was having so much trouble concentrating from the stress and the chaos in our life. Between the ages of 6 and 11, my son was placed outside of our home for extended times of treatment four different times. And the stress of the work that that involved and the emotion that it was packed with for me was taking a serious toll on my health. I had always loved being around people. I made that way. But in this season of darkness, there were few opportunities for us to engage in that way. I remember one time some dear friends who lived out of town wanted to see us. But before they offered us an invitation to come and visit, they wanted to know if we were going to bring our son. So we ended up not going to visit because it was clearly going to be too uncomfortable for them. So these were the sorts of things that were contributing to this experience of darkness in my life. And I was feeling isolated and alone again. I was empty. I was stripped of any ability that used to be in me of needing to perform because I had nothing. I was stripped of my false self-strategies of feeling good about myself because I was being productive because I couldn't accomplish a thing, it seemed to me, that had any meaning. And as far as that self-image that looks nice and tidy, that wasn't working. I was experiencing what the Christian spiritual giants have described as the dark night of the soul. I was not in touch with my experience of being the beloved of God. My name was I am too tired and angry to care. Gerald May says in his beautiful book entitled The Dark Night of the Soul that the dark night exists for the sole purpose of furthering love, for deepening the love of God in our hearts. He talks about how in the dark night of the soul, we are invited to let some things go that mean a lot to us. And as we do over time, without realizing it, when we are in this dark night, we are coming to know a deep love inside of us that is non-compelled, that we no longer have to chase compulsively. It is mysteriously happening beneath the surface. In those years of dark night, mysteriously, I came to know and experience something about the love of God for me over time that has now become even deeper to the core of my identity. And it came gradually. It snuck up on me without me even knowing it at the time until I would look back and it would make sense to me. God was at work deep in the darkness like the crazy woman sweeping and sweeping and sweeping, looking for me, finding me. And I didn't know it at the time, but that's the way God was at work, finding me in this deep darkness of my life. My name slowly began to change from alone and isolated to God with me. my name slowly began to change from depleted and weak to God's strength in me. Slowly, the lie that I had been believing that I cannot hold this life together that God has given me began to change to a glimmering flame within me of the real hope that it is God that holds me together. It is God that holds those I love together. And it is God that holds all things together. My name is beloved. And so is yours. As a direct result of being stripped in the dark, I now know at my core that God is good. And God always wants good for me. His eye is always on me. I am never alone, even in the dark. And when he asks me to let things go as hard as it is, I am always going to get something back that is more valuable and deeper lasting. Because he loves me. So, you can see some of the things that have gotten in the way of me living like I am the beloved of God. For me, those things were fear. Lies that I'm alone. Lies that I'm too much. Distorted images of who God really is. My false self patterns around performance and image and productivity. And my profound experience deep in the dark. friends what gets in the way for you more fully living into the truth that at the core of your existence you are the beloved of God in Christ Jesus what gets in the way for you what trips you up what does your unfolding story how does it inform you around who you are I'd like to give us some space right now to sit under the truths of some living words of God as we answer the question who am I and I'm going to do the brave thing of simply inviting you to be still together. All of us together. How lovely is that? I want to invite you to close your eyes if it's helpful for the next few minutes. I want to invite you, if you have things in your hands, to just set them down. If you have children in your lap, hold on to them and pray these words of life into them. we're simply going to be still under some living words of God and I want you to allow these words to sink into you by the Spirit of God. I want you to listen for what God might be speaking to you. I want to invite you to notice the places in which you resist any of these words so you can talk to God about it later. I'm going to read slowly with some pauses in between and when I'm done, we'll just have a few moments of quiet where I want to encourage you to connect with the prayer that is forming in you in response to these words. And then I'll close our time and bring your attention back up to the front. So may the Holy Spirit be ambitious and active among us, pouring out the love of God into all of our hearts. Friends, do not despair thinking that you cannot change yourself after so many years. Simply enter into the presence of Jesus as you are and ask him to give you a fearless heart where he can be with you. you cannot make yourself different Jesus came to give you a new heart a new spirit let Jesus transform you by his love and so enable you to receive his affection into your whole being how great is the love that the father has lavished on us that he would call us children of God when I think of this I fall on my knees and pray to the Father that from his glorious, unlimited resources he will empower you with inner strength through his Spirit that Christ will make his home in your hearts and that your roots will go down deep into God's love and keep you strong. That you will have the power to understand with all God's people how wide wide enough to cover the breadth of your life experience. How long, long enough to last all of your days. And how high, high enough to greet you in life's greatest joys and celebrations. And how deep, how deep, deep enough to hold you firmly in the depths of life's discouragement and despair, how deep the love of God is. May you experience the love of Christ, though it is so great to fully understand. Then you will be made complete with all the fullness of life and power that comes from God. I have loved you with an everlasting love, and therefore with loving kindness I will draw you to me. You'll get a brand new name straight from the mouth of God. No more will anyone call you rejected. no more will you be called ruined you will be called my delight because God delights in you listening to that voice with greater inner attentiveness here at the center of your being, words that say, I have called you by name from the very beginning. You are mine and I'm yours. You are my beloved and on you my favor rests. I have molded you in the depths of the earth and knit you together in your mother's womb. I have carved you into the palms of my hands, and I've hidden you in the shadow of my embrace. I look at you with infinite tenderness and care for you with a care that is more intimate than that of a mother for her child. I have counted every hair on your head and guided you at every step. Wherever you go, I will go with you. And wherever you rest, I will keep watch. I will not hide my face from you. You know me as your own, as I know you as my own. Wherever you are, I will be. will ever separate us. We are one. Holy Spirit of God, set into us by the mysterious gift of your grace, these living words of life and love. Amen. As I was preparing for this weekend, I had an experience that seems important to share. after a full day of writing earlier in the week I went out for a walk in the afternoon and I asked God God what do your people need and immediately faces just came like this before my my mind's eye faces of you and I was moved to tears as I was walking. And there were faces of many of you that I've had the privilege to sit with over the years and we've struggled together over answering this question, who am I? They were the faces of those of you who horrible things have been done to. And they were the faces of those of you who have done deeply regrettable things that have hurt other people. And I had the very strong image as I prayed and sat with this picture that God was with you. God was with us like the crazy old woman sweeping. Looking and looking, always finding you. so whether you have experienced in the way that you wish coming fully alive to the fact that you are the beloved of god in christ jesus or you still find that deep knowledge elusive you need to know there are no outsiders to these words that we just sat under. The same words apply. The same promises, the same resource of the Spirit to be able to believe it. There are no outsiders, no matter what you've done, no matter what you've experienced. In fact, God wants you to know that your name is beloved more than you do. watch for it wait for it you are not your past God creates all things new God redeems the deepest wounds and tragedies of our lives and he calls us loved ones well folks as we close I want to just take a few minutes at least to put some concrete tools in your hands to walk away with that will help you practice the presence of something new in regards to this truth. I am the beloved of God. And the first one would be practice the spiritual discipline of silence and solitude on as a regular rhythm as you can because this is where God will speak to you of his love. Five minutes. Put down the journal. Put down the Bible. Just sit and let God love you. How crazy is that? Second, recognize the voices within you, not unlike the stories that I've just told you this morning, for whether they are truth or whether they are lies, what are the names that you have taken on like I did? I'm too much. I'm depleted. I'm weak. Or the names for God. God doesn't hear. God doesn't listen. God is like a warden. What speaks to your belovedness? Take those to the front of you. And more and more and more, may those lies and old tapes and patterns move to the back so that what you find over time is that you're hearing that still small voice within you speak of your belovedness. Three, keep looking for the people and the places that speak the belovedness of God over you. We need that. Right? Spiritual friends, family, mentors, counselors, spiritual directors, grandchildren. Get yourself there as often as you can. Four, celebrate the truth that you are the beloved of God in Christ Jesus. Say out loud to God, thank you. Thank you that it's true. And stop talking badly about yourself. I dare you. There is a greater truth that we need to practice. Friends, saturate yourself with the truth of God's care, love, and protection any way you can by reading scripture, meditating on it, listening to it, praying it. In our own bookstore out in the gathering place, there's some resources that will help you do this. One of our church fathers is Dick McCauley, and we have a CD out there called My Beloved, and it's seven minutes of Dick's soothing, loving voice speaking words of the message, translation of the Bible, of our belovedness over us. You can pop that thing into your car in the morning on the way to work. Read Life of the Beloved by Henry Nowen. Ob is Child by Brennan Manning. Transformed into Fire by Judy Haugen. You can go home today and go to our website and click on Discover. Click on Tools. And right at the top, you'll see a document that I've placed there called I'm a Beloved Child of God. And in there are all the readings that I read over us today. Scriptures, some additional prayers. sit with those things in the weeks ahead. Practice the presence of a new truth. The last thing that I'll mention, and we'll close it up, is come to the class that Al and I are facilitating, starting in October, on October 6th, called God Is, I Am. Al and I will be facilitating space for us to simply practice the truths of who God is and who we are in various ways through teaching, personal reflection, prayer experiences in small groups. We would love to see you there. This morning I want to leave you as we go with a benediction. So would you stand? And for those of you that something has come to the top this morning and you know you have an invitation from God around this idea of the truth that you are the beloved of God, please feel free to come forward. There will be people here to pray for you after the service. Or make a prayer appointment, restoration through prayer appointment this week. There's options, folks. Let's practice together, becoming fully alive to the fact that we are the beloved of God in Christ Jesus. Now, friends, may you go out into this day and into the days ahead, more and more living out of the truth that God loves you and is deeply fond of you so that when you go out into the world, others will know that God loves them like that too. Go in peace today, friends. Thank you.
