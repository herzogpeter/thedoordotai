Well today as we come to the table, this kind of service that we have once a month is not like our usual services. Jesus is always present with us whenever two or more are gathered. But he has promised that when we come to the very special table that he has set by dying on the cross for us and rising again. That as he asks us to partake of the elements of bread, and in his day wine, we've got juice. As we participate in those elements and have a meal with him, we together remember and know each other through his love. And we know him, and he knows us through his love. And we're reminded of that knowing, that wonderful knowing of one another. That's what this table is. And so today Jesus is here in a very special way. To come and heal. To come and stand beside you. To come and be with you perhaps in a way you'd never dreamed possible. That anybody could accept you or love you that way. And yeah, it's a mystical thing. He's here in his mystical presence. But I'm going to ask him to now come in a very special way. And prepare us to receive him and his word. Lord, we do ask for your presence. We know you're here. But we would ask more than anything that you would prepare us to receive you, prepare us to see you, prepare us to hear you. We ask that as we come to this table that you've made in the presence of the enemy, where you have defeated both the one who had wore on our soul, Satan, And defeated his tool death. That Lord Jesus you would come. And you would bring to us. The full measure of life. That you want for us. That is available to us Jesus. That this cracker. And juice. Though a little thing. Almost ironically represents. The fullness of heaven. And you for us. So we just commit this time to you. And the word that. We're about to read your word. In Jesus name. Amen. If you turn your Bibles to John chapter 4, I'm going to read a bunch of verses. And don't let that scare you. Hopefully I won't talk as long as I read. I hope. But John chapter 4, we're going to start with verse 4 and go almost all the way through this chapter. It's maybe a familiar story to some, maybe not to others. Basically it's the story of the woman at the well, a Samaritan woman. Samaritans and Jews didn't have much to do with each other. Jesus is going through Samaria with his disciples. Jews usually tried to avoid Samaria, but he's going through Samaria. And he stops at this well. And these 13 guys come at noon when nobody's at the well, because you know that's the hot time. Everybody comes to the well when the sun's down or the sun's just coming up. So they know that this woman has some odd reason being here when nobody else is there. And the 12 go off to town to buy food because they're in inhospitable country and hospitality, which is the norm of the day in the Orient, is not there between Jews and Samaritans, so they're just going to buy food. And I'd like you to just put yourself in the place of this woman today because what we find is that she being in this place of ostracism, of being somehow cast off and having to go to the well when no one else would be there, whether by choice or by the social kind of demand of the people she was with in that town. As she was there, something happened between her and Jesus that caused her to run back into the town and say, come see a man who told me everything I ever did. Now, two things. even though Jesus was a prophet and when he was hit by his tormentors before he died they hit him blindfolded and they'd say tell us who hit you because he was a prophet and the prophet could know and I believe it was Nathanael when Jesus called him as a disciple he said I saw you under a tree and that oh you're the Messiah you're the prophet you're the one that was going to come and yeah that's something Jesus does he has a word of knowledge about this woman But who she was was well known to the people, not known to him, and so she was going to try and sneak by with being somebody other than who she was. She was a hider, like many of us are, not knowing God's love. But what happened in her, as you read the story, that she can run into town and say, You all know me. Come and meet somebody who's known me in such a way that I'm changed. And the shame's gone. And the guilt is gone. And I've been known by even a man, a Jewish man, in love. Nobody used me here. They read my heart. And I got to meet God. Is this the Savior of the world? Verse 4. Now he had gone through Samaria. He came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph. Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour, noon. When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, Will you give me a drink? His disciples had gone into the town to buy food. The Samaritan woman said to him, You are a Jew, and I am a Samaritan woman. how can you ask me for a drink? For Jews do not associate with Samaritans. Jesus answered her, if you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water. Sir, the woman said, you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well and drank from it himself? As did also his sons and his flocks and herds. Jesus answered, everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again. But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life. The woman said to him, sir, give me this water so I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water. He told her, go call your husband and come back. I have no husband, she replied. Jesus said to her, you're right when you say you have no husband. The fact is you've had five husbands and the man you have now is not your husband. What you've said, just said, is quite true. Sir, the woman said, I can see that you are a prophet. Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem. Jesus declared, believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You Samaritans worship what you do not know. we worship what we do know for salvation is from the Jews yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth for they are the kind of worshippers the Father seeks God is spirit and his worshippers must worship in spirit and in truth the woman said I know that Messiah called Christ is coming when he comes he will explain everything to us then Jesus declared I who speak to you am he just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman but no one asked what do you want or why are you talking with her then leaving her water jar the woman went back to town and said to the people come see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ? And they came out of the town and made their way toward him. Then go to verse 39. Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony. He told me everything I ever did. So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with him. And he stayed two whole days. And because of his words, many more became believers they said to the woman we no longer believe just because of what you said now we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man really is the savior of the world we all of us long to be known but many of us fear that if somebody really knew us knew everything we had done or are doing now and knew what had been done to us, perhaps, that they wouldn't be able to handle it and they wouldn't be close to us. In fact, many of us maybe are known by other people and have some kind of a rap, a rep, and it's that very thing that, it's the ostracism, it's the shame that's put on us by others that tells us, you know, nobody would really want to know you that well and love you. but that's what Jesus came to do to a woman in Samaria who he shouldn't have even been talking to at first because she was on the wrong side of Jerusalem and Galilee from the wrong side of town with the wrong pedigree race family background and she was the wrong gender for a prophet to be talking to and she had the wrong reputation for a prophet to be talking to. Jesus doesn't care much about all our little rules, does he? But I think she was a little surprised when he saw into her life and read her life. That's a little unnerving, isn't it? We really don't like to be known that well. I, for nine years at this church, I started here in 19... When was it? 1992. And then for nine years I didn't speak because I'd come from a church where I'd had a horrific kind of spiritual warfare thing, and I was just wounded, and so I did a bunch of other gifts that I can do, and never thought I'd really actually speak again, and was quite happy with that. And God kind of pulled me out of that in the summer of 2000. One of the things I didn't like very much about it was I lost my anonymity, which I'm perfectly fine with knowing everybody, but there was something nice about being just sitting there, and people would come up to me after nine years and go, now, you work here, are you one of the accountants? And I'd say, well, you know, I do some of that stuff. I don't do that, but it was kind of nice. But after I spoke a few times, you know, then you're getting known, and you do a Krispy Kreme, and it's all over with, right? I was driving back in the summer of 2000, those first times I spoke, and realizing how exhausted Dave gets when he does this weekend thing, and anybody who does it, I worship people, everybody. It was about 1.15, and I was hungry, and I can get really hungry. And I was trying to get to the place I live, and I have to go through a little town, and that town had, it was early summer, had their kind of whoopie days or whatever you call those things, you know. And I was not feeling like partying very much with them. I wanted to get home, and so I was going to kind of go around the blockade and go through the road anyways. Oh, there's no parade here. I was going to sneak through. And all of a sudden, an officer, who I didn't see, walked up to my window as I was trying to sneak through. And he said, hey, where are you going? I kind of had that choice right then to be kind of, you know, push a little bit and just take my step. He was going to stop me, but push a little bit, you know, or be forbearing. And I kind of went in the middle. I kind of in the middle. Kind of, oh, officer, you know, come on, can't I just, no. And then he looks at me and he goes, how was church today? Ouch. And I was really glad. You know, I lost a bit of that sanctification, but not all of it, you know. And, but it's tough to be known, especially when you don't think somebody's going to love you and they're going to all of a sudden change their image of you. If they just knew. they just knew who you really were. I think down deep in us almost every day until we get to heaven we'll still have that little peace in us and God will continue to push at it. I love all of you. And we just are going to have a hard time believing it until we finally get glorified. And then we'll have the full light of that in our life. But we can have measures of that the scripture says like water bubbling out of a spring. We can have a free and full life now. And know freedom from even what others think of us who know our stuff. And we don't have to have secrets. Today, my heart breaks for those who can sit before this table or even come to this table and really have never let Jesus know them in their stuff. And sometimes you have to have somebody else know you. A person with flesh and blood. It says in the scriptures, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed. And that's why we have an altar team here for people to come and be prayed with. That's why we have therapists. That's why we have spiritual directors. That's why we have good Christian trusting friends who won't condemn us, who will stand along beside us and help us know God's love. Be Jesus with skin on. Well, this woman, she's really something else because she does find that intimacy with God. But she puts up a fight. She kind of represents many of us, you know. But this thing of being someone who is really outcast or thinking you've done something, and you don't have to have done something great. Sin is relative, what's been done to us. It can be a little bit great. I found the Lord as a senior high person, senior higher, after a couple, three years of being your typical rebelling pastor's kid in a very large church. My dad was a pastor. And I went to seminary. And while there, and I don't want to blame seminary because it sure is up to me to stay close, But something happened in me as I went into ministry. Maybe my own stuff came up where I wanted to be a big deal for Jesus or whatever it was. But I lost touch of that intimate knowing of him. And I knew a lot about it. I knew more and more about it. I knew more than anybody in my church in terms of Greek and Hebrew and all that stuff. But I gradually lost touch of knowing him in my place of deepest need, where you may be today, where we all are in some way. And I got real familiar with him. And I could argue truth. Boy, I knew the truth. But I didn't often know God in my need. And there came a point in time when I got so caught up with doing things for Jesus and knowing things about Jesus and trying to get all that done for Jesus. And God uses that, okay? He was there. People got saved and everything else. But sometimes you just don't get to have a big drink, you know, yourself. And I got to a place where I really got unhappy with myself, and I was neglecting really my family and knew that, didn't know how to get out of it. I had this urge to perform, whatever it was. And I was at family gatherings. I was acting again like that angry sophomore, being the black sheep again. And I was like, what is going on, Lord? And I just said, you know, I should go see a counselor. And that was really tough for me because I was in a church setting, and many of you have come from that, and I praise God it's not here, where the pastor couldn't be too needy. If the pastor had needs, that meant he was human. And you see, if the pastor has needs, that means I have to admit my needs, and that kind of blows the cover of our little church game, that I'm okay, you're okay. Yeah, yeah, we're all sinners, and we're saved, and we're saved by grace, but we really don't have any tough things ever going on in our life, right? That's the evangelical, shallow gospel that many people live imprisoned in, and maybe you have come from that or in that now in some system. And so I went to a counselor friend, and he was a friend, so I wasn't going to go to him. But I said, I need to see somebody, and he gave me the name of a psychiatrist, and I kind of thought, psychiatrist? Holy mackerel, don't you have to lay on beds and look at blots and stuff like that? But then I said to him, you know what, that would be a good thing, because I need somebody really tough. I think I can really be in my head pretty good. I need somebody who can make that 80 inch drop. I even knew all that stuff. I knew you couldn't even know all that stuff. I knew counseling stuff. I wasn't living in it. I was stuck. And I went to his office, you know, kind of just nervous that anybody would see me from my church would be over with, you know. And I got in there, and he told me, now tell me your life. I want to hear your life story. in chunks of ten years. And the first ten years were, you know, Disneyland trips. But then we got towards high school and college, and I got in touch with some stuff. And I left that office that day in the car, bawling, crying from my, just right down here, sobbing, you know, needing windshield wipers on my eyes and whatever. Because I had reached down into a well in my life. God had taken me with a friend who loved me, a new friend, who I was really even afraid of, but felt so kind and loving and had taken me there. Now, I was crying for the first time in five years, hard. If you haven't cried for a long time, you either have dried up tear ducts Or some well that needs some water and some priming. You need to be known. Well, this woman also demonstrated for us some things about being known that sometimes aren't even anything we've done. It's actually what God's done where people don't want to know us. If we're a different race, Samaritan versus Jew, African American versus Caucasian, Hispanic versus Caucasian, I've been overseas and there you know what it is over there? In Japan it's Korean versus Japanese you don't want to be Korean in Korea you don't want to be Philippine I don't know who the Philippines don't want to be like sin does that stuff it separates us from really knowing God and then knowing each other and being fully known and loved and that's what we talk about, the power of being fully known by God and others in love If you haven't experienced that, and it may be gender, you were going the wrong gender, and your family, women didn't count. Or maybe in your family, men in some way didn't count. You couldn't cry, or you couldn't be a man and cry. So you couldn't have full masculinity. I had an experience in my 20s or 30s, after I was married, where I'd taken a U-turn in Chicago, the city of Chicago. And I'd taken this U-turn, and I didn't see the sign there, and I thought you could take U-turns. So I was going to be really tough, and I was going to go downtown to Cook County Trapper Court and try and beat the ticket. Well, I sat there, and I was amazed, because I was the only Caucasian, there was a lot of Hispanic people, a few African Americans, but many Hispanic people. And that day, maybe. And the judge, in a very scowling, condemning, contemptuous tone, would call up the first person. Jose, come on up. Oh, you don't have your license? Well, here's the problem. You've got to pay this or go to jail or whatever you've got to do. And then Jose, and I thought it was amazing that two or three people would be named Jose, but after the sixth person, I realized what was going on, that his contempt was moving into his mouth and on these people. I got up there and he said, Well, Mr. Meyer. Everything changed. You know, a smile on his face. The officer is not here today. I was about to tell my story. It didn't even matter. You go over here. You don't have to pay. Have a good day. And then the next person, Jose, was contempt. And I don't know, he must have felt contempt for himself. And that's how this goes. maybe feeling contempt for himself as being in traffic court with a bunch of people he didn't want to be with. And he didn't know love. He wasn't fully known and loved for who he was, what he was doing. Well, this morning, we come to a table. We come to a Jesus who not only meets women at Wells back in Samaria, but today he meets men and women, teenagers, college students, young persons who are starting careers, children, anybody who thinks that who they are, what they've done, or what someone's done to them, makes them unlovable. He meets with you, and he'll meet with you today. You see, this table represents one who caught up on a cross of you and I, willingly. He could have called 10,000 angels and crawled down. He didn't have to call down. He could have flown off that thing. But he stayed up there, and what he knew when he was up there was everything you've ever done and you're ashamed of, and guilty of, everything that ever has been done to you, with all its shame and guilt. And he came to redeem who you are and God created you to be and to redeem you to live that out fully. And he did that and he knows everything. So you don't have to worry about whether he knows it or not. What today he calls you to is to be known fully by his love. And that's a mystical coming to him in your heart and your mind and just offering yourself to him whether you're in your chair and saying, Jesus, come and know me. no I confess to you sin I confess maybe even confessing sin and that's not the deal today you say Lord Jesus I've just been trying to hide it will you come and know me in it and lift it lift my shame know me bring intimacy or come to the table or come today to an altar ministry person or go see a counselor while you're shaking as you go through the door because you know what it's not that they're so scary but you're so scared to face what it is that's been done to you or you've done, as little or big as it may be. It's got a hold of you, and it's scary to look at that with anybody else. Paul Tournier, in the meaning of persons, has said, the freest person in this life is the person who has told everything that's been done by them or done to them to another safe, loving, non-condemning person. And I regularly go to this psychiatrist about once a year, and last couple times I've been to him, the time before, just to check in, update him on my life, I paid $120 to just tell him that God had given me so much joy in the middle of my head pain. Now isn't that nuts? But I want to tell you something. When someone knows you for 12 years, and when a spiritual director knows you for 7 years, and they know everything about you, there is no more place of life or circle of friends or mates who are just fully one. That's love. And God calls us to that table. I'm going to ask the communion stewards to come. And the altar team. And we're going to meet with Jesus. And the worship team. Thank you.
