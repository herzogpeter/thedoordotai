Well, in part because it's still the Thanksgiving weekend, and in part because Paul brings it up in the middle of this prayer that we've been examining for the last several weeks in the book of Colossians, the first chapter. I want to talk today about gratitude, about thankfulness, and about how the lack of it can sour the spirit, can blind the eyes, can literally destroy a life, which is at least part of why Paul prays what he prays in the middle of this prayer that, again, we've been looking at for several weeks now, that the people in Colossae would be empowered by the Spirit to become the kind of people who, among other things, would be able to authentically and joyously be giving thanks to God, the Father, Colossians 1, verse 12. But let's kind of catch that verse in the flow of the rest of this prayer that we've been looking at, because what he prays, what Paul prays for, the Colossians is this, beginning in verse 9. I pray, this is what I ask, that you may be filled up with that in your bones knowing of God's desire and love and heart for you and all spiritual wisdom and understanding in order that, remember that Hena clause there we talked about last week, in order that you may be able to walk in a manner that is worthy of, that is consistent with the Lord, desiring to please him in our respects, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God, strengthened with all power according to his glorious might, for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience, joyously giving thanks to the Father, to be a thankful people, to be a grateful people in the circumstances, in the context of circumstances that I think we've cataloged quite well over the last several months, actually, that were not particularly conducive to thankfulness and gratefulness, living as the Colossians did in the shadow of Rome, and Paul living as he did at the very time that he was writing this letter to the Colossians in a Roman prison, himself fully expecting his own execution. The question would be, how can you joyously be giving thanks to the Father for anything at all? And yet Paul really presses this theme. And not just here in this prayer, as if he just kind of throws it in from time to time in almost every epistle that he writes. And if you're familiar with Paul, you've kind of maybe dialed into this already. In every epistle he writes, there is either a strong exhortation or a heartfelt prayer like this one in Colossians 1, on behalf of the people to whom he is writing to be giving thanks always for all things. He says in Ephesians 5, verse 20, in 1 Thessalonians 5, 18, he says, in everything give thanks, for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus. Really struggling with God's will, here it is, be giving thanks in everything. And later in this epistle, Colossians 3, 17th verse, he says, whatever you do, in word or in deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, always giving thanks through him to God the Father. Why is my first question relative to this. Why is this important? Why is this actually so central to life in the kingdom of God, at least to Paul, again, because he brings this up all the time in the context of circumstances, again, not necessarily conducive to thankfulness and gratitude. And how is my second question. In other words, how can we realistically and authentically give thanks joyously in the context of circumstances like the Colossians had, but like we have, that seem to mitigate against gratitude and thankfulness? Well, let's deal first of all with the why. Because I kind of already touched on the answer to that, because here's the short answer. Here's why. You need to be grateful and thankful, because a lack of that, that is a spirit of ingratitude and unthankfulness can, in fact, sour the spirit that can blind the eyes, in particular to the good things in life that you have, that God has given. It can literally, a spirit of ingratitude, destroy life. And Paul knew that, maybe from his own personal experience, but he also knew it because he knew the story of the people of God. Being himself a Torah observant Jew, I think we know his story being raised under the Rabbi Gamaliel. He knew the scriptures and he knew the story of the people of God and there it was. The story of God's people for everyone to see. And part of their story that he knew very well was a graphic, even frightening example of what an ungrateful spirit can produce, not only in an individual, but in a whole group of people. the whole nation of Israel. The story actually is familiar to most of us, at least in some general vague way, and it begins in Exodus 14, where the people of God had just gotten some very good news and were experiencing something, finally, that they had always wanted, or at least wanted for, a very long time, having been slaves in Egypt under the power of Pharaoh. They'd finally been set free, and in their freedom, They were very, very happy and full of joy and grateful too. But that gratitude didn't last very long, and for some very good reasons, actually. Because the Pharaoh, after he let the people go, changed his mind. You may remember the story, and he began to chase them down. And with Pharaoh behind them and the Red Sea in front of them, it kind of looked like certain death. There's nowhere to go because the sea is there. Pharaoh is coming, and his intent is not just to bring us back. He probably wants to kill us all. And their response, their first response, predictably, was what your response and mine would be was fear. Followed quickly, however, by angry sarcasm and bitter complaints. And you can hear it when they come to Moses with these words, Exodus 14, verse 11. I mean, just imagine hearing this, being Moses and hearing the people say this. Is it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us here to die? A little sarcasm there. little angry sarcasm there. Why have you dealt with us this way, bringing us out of Egypt? We told you then we didn't want to leave. They didn't tell them that, but now they're bringing all this up. It would have been better to serve the Egyptians as slaves than to die here in the desert. Then Moses, amazingly, didn't lose his patience there. I think maybe understanding their fear, said to the people in verse 13 of chapter 14, don't be afraid. Do not fear. Indeed, stand by and watch and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will accomplish for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, and it's all you can see today, fact is you will never see again forever. I'm gonna wipe this problem out of your life forever. Verse 21, then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the waters parted and the people walked across the Pharaoh's army followed the waters, returned and covered the chariots. And Pharaoh's army that had gone into the sea after the people of Israel, not even one of them remained. You know that story. Thus it says in verse 30, the Lord saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians such that Moses and the people of God were very happy and full of joy and grateful too. Chapter 15, verse 1. So grateful that they began to sing this song. And they sang, it says, a new song to the Lord, saying, we will sing unto the Lord. This is our joy. We will sing praise to God, for he has triumphed gloriously. Remember this song, the horse and rider? Anyway, it's kind of my paraphrase of what's up on the screen. Therefore, verse 2, the Lord is our strength, and the Lord is our song, and he has become our salvation. This is our God, and we will praise him, and we will be grateful to him forever. And they were grateful, but not forever. Indeed, not for long. About 10 minutes they lasted. Actually, it was longer than 10 minutes. Three days after this incredible deliverance, two, they got out of Egypt and all of a sudden they're facing the Red Sea. God does an incredible miracle and they're delivered again. But in chapter 15, verse 23, they run into another problem. When they come to a place called Marah, three days later, they found that the waters of Marah were bitter and immediately, it says, verse 24, it didn't take them long, immediately, verse 24, the people grumbled at Moses again saying, paraphrase, what's the deal? Moses, where's God? No. Anyway, and what are we to drink? So Moses, again, not losing patience, amazingly, cried out to God, verse 25, and the Lord said, okay, here, I'll take care of you here. You see that tree? Throw it into the water, which is very weird. So he threw the tree into the water, and it turned the bitter water sweet. And the people of God were very happy and filled with joy and grateful to for about 10 minutes. Yeah. You guys, I just love this story. I've told it to you before. John Ortberg is the guy I heard it from. I'm not sure it originates with him, but it's that story of two parents who have a little seven-year-old child, and they're in a toy store. And predictably, this little kid, he's a little boy in the story, very quickly spots the toy of his dreams. He saw it on TV, and all of his friends have this toy, and he's dreamt of having this toy for as long as he can remember, which is about a week. So the little boy pleads with his parents, and as good parents, they resist, and then he persists, and as good parents, they continue to resist because you can't give them everything they want, but then he kind of pulls out the trump card when he promises to his parents, mom and dad, if you buy this toy for me, I will never ask for anything again, and I will be grateful for the rest of my life. They'd never heard their little Johnny say anything like this before, so they buy this present for him, and amazingly, it works. Just the kind of way it does. It works. He is grateful for the rest of his life, in spite of the fact that some very real problems come into his life. Later in his life, he got married young, had kids early, 10 years into his marriage. his wife left him with three small kids. As his kids grew up without their mom, they blamed him for being such a lousy father and a lousy husband and remind him of that daily. When he turns 50, the company that he'd been loyal to for 25 years decides to downsize. It's nothing personal, but he's fired, and in his old age, the social security system collapses, so he's living hand-to-mouth in his old age. But incredibly, this is incredible, He never, ever complains. Because when he was seven, he got that toy. So he was grateful for the rest of his life. And every single one of you know that's a stupid story. Because it doesn't work like that. It just doesn't work that way. And it didn't work that way in the story of the Exodus. I mean, just trying to get the picture. Back to Exodus 15. God had broken the power of Pharaoh, brought them out of Egypt, pushed back the waters of the sea, promised to never leave them, I will never leave you, nor forsake you. And that was embodied in this pillar of fire by night and a cloud by day. And he turned their bitter waters sweet, so you think they'd be grateful for the rest of their lives, having seen and experienced all of that. But three verses after, he turned the bitter waters sweet in chapter 15. We read in chapter 16, verse 2, that the whole congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron again. And said, would that we had died in the land of Egypt when we sat by the pots of meat, when we ate breads to the full. So they're looking back on their days as slaves, as the good old days. For you brought us out into this wilderness to kill us all with hunger. And the Lord said again, amazingly, not losing his patience still, verse 4, okay, I'll provide for you. Behold, he says, I will rain bread down from heaven, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day. And I will do this, by the way, whether or not they walk in my instruction or not. And all of the people were very happy and filled with joy and grateful to, And began to sing again these songs of praise to God. We will sing unto the Lord for he is triumphed. But then they got bored with the manna. Same old manna every day. It just gets old. And you've heard the jokes that are old as well about manna burgers and manna coddy. Manna bread. it's so old those are you grumbling about those jokes and before you know it they were grumbling and complaining again now i think all of us hearing this you know would acknowledge and agree that in gratitude the grumbling and complaining is a bad thing and and if you're actually hanging around someone who is a grumbler and a complainer there are people who are just kind of that way. It's a very irritating thing. But Paul presses it further than being a matter of irritation. And it may be part of why Paul prays what he prays in places like Colossians chapter 1 for people to be able to be joyously giving thanks. Because in 1 Corinthians 10, 1 Corinthians 10, interesting thing, because in 1 Corinthians 10, he's there kind of reflecting on the result of what happened when the people of God were laid low in the wilderness. That's the phrase he uses in 1 Corinthians 10, and he's kind of reflecting on the things that they did that led to this kind of death in their bodies and even in their spirits. And as he's reflecting on these things that laid them low in 1 Corinthians 10, he identifies five of the great sins of the people that kind of explain their plights as being, number one, in the desert they began to crave evil things. Number two was sexual immorality. Number three was idolatry. Number four was willful defiance to God, and number five was grumbling. They were grumblers. It says in verse 10, all five of those being among the reasons that they died in the desert, which all of a sudden makes this issue of grumbling a lot more serious, actually. Amazing, actually, because he puts ungrateful grumbling right up there. And this is stunning when I put this together. He put it right up there with idolatry, right up there with sexual immorality, and willful defiance to God is grumbling. In the same category, why? Well, here's why, according to the text, to put these stories together, because it leads to death. Exodus 16, 34 says, of the people of God in the wilderness that they died in graves of craving. That's a fabulous, frightening, actually, picture, and powerful in its symbolic value, that died in graves of craving. can kind of see them dying, but even in their dying, it's just never enough. So their cravings that were never satisfied, no matter what they got, blinded their eyes to what they got, ensoured their spirits, extolled their joy, ultimately destroyed their lives. That's a story, however, that's kind of repeated over and over again. It wasn't just the people of God then. Robert Hughes wrote a book called The Culture of Complaint. And in the book, he maintains that we're no different today. When he says this, we live in a society where people perceive themselves to be entitled to have all of their desires fulfilled and fulfilled right now, pretty much. And when that doesn't happen, they view themselves as victims. We live in a culture of complaint, he said. And it has formed and shaped our minds and our hearts. And if we slip into that mode, that pattern of thought, we run the risk of spending our lives waiting for, get this, waiting for some circumstance, something, or someone to come along who will finally give us a good enough reason to be truly grateful. Someone or something who will come along and give us a good enough reason. Like, that's not enough. To be truly grateful, but it never happens. And so we die in graves of craving, devouring things and people, devouring things and devouring people because it's never, ever enough. All of which is why in the time I have left, I want to give you four quick things just four quick things about gratitude about a grateful heart that we need to know or be reminded of actually there's four questions here that can be summarized in four words the four words are these who when what and then that word I said we'd get to how can we be grateful the first is who important who do I believe is responsible or who do you believe is responsible for the gratitude level of your heart, of my heart? Because if the answer to that question is someone or something other than you, I can pretty much promise you that you're gonna have a very long wait before you have a life that's characterized by gratitude or joy. But sad fact is this. Many people, many people live their entire lives as though the circumstance or person responsible for their gratitude or joy or for their lack of gratitude or joy is someone or something other than themselves. It's their boss, it's their spouse, it's their teacher, it's their friends, it's their career, it's their finances. But here's the deal. We just can't afford, this is too important, gratitude and joy, because the power that ingratitude has to steal your life. We can't afford to put our gratitude and joy into the hands of another, into the hands of a circumstance, even into the hands of a tragedy. because it really is possible to suffer loss and be disappointed and to even deeply grieve and still be grateful. Indeed, sometimes, you know it's true, because sometimes you've experienced this. Sometimes it's in the context of a loss that you actually become grateful. It's a weird thing when it happens. Some of you, as I said, have experienced it, And it's almost like the loss is what it took to wake you up to other things that you'd been taking for granted. It's just a weird thing. Sometimes you'll see it on the news where a tornado comes through a little neighborhood or a hurricane comes and they interview the people. And right behind them is a rebel of their house, but their family lived. And they'll talk about the loss, but more they'll talk about being grateful. And it's really kind of weird. There's a funny thing about gratitude. Because it isn't necessarily developed. Gratitude is not necessarily developed by getting everything you want. Indeed, gratitude, and again, you know this is true instinctively, often has very little to do with getting everything you want. A number of parents out there know that. The best way to raise really grateful children is not to give them everything they want. And some parents have learned that the hard way. Because you really love little Johnny, and you didn't want him to struggle the way you had to struggle, so you straighten out every curve, and you remove every obstacle, and he becomes a spoiled little brat that nobody can stand being around, including you. Because little Johnny is totally unprepared for curves now, because you straighten them all out. He's totally unprepared for obstacles, because you removed them all, and he's embarrassingly ungrateful for anything because you gave him everything. It's a weird thing. This time of year is a little odd for me. It sometimes takes me by surprise, but in the fall, beginning in late September and through the winter, I just get reminded. And sometimes I feel it in my body and that's becoming less and less, but I get reminded that it was in this season several years ago that three people very close to me and to my family, all in a very short period of time, in a matter of weeks, all died at the same time. My father died first, followed closely by a dear friend of ours in Chicago that we were very close with for many, many years, a kind of couple you go on vacations with once a year. Her name was Jody. She died the day of my dad's funeral. And then not long after that, just a few weeks after that, Dave Busby, who had been my dear friend for many years, died, and that all came together. But among the things I remember, as I remember those things just about every fall, was this, that right in the middle of all that pain and loss, there was this unmistakable sense, it would just rise up, almost surprise us from time to time, because there'd be, in the middle of all of that, a sense, at times, of gratitude. It was weird. Gratitude. For friends who stick around, for a community of faith, for lives that were well-lived, and for God, who at that moment was hanging on to our hearts, and who through his son Jesus provided hope that went beyond the grave. And it was the kind of gratitude that put tears in your eyes. It was like an unexpected, almost an incongruent experience to be grateful in the middle of that. But often, that's when it comes. It's just the weirdest thing. Bottom line, we can't put into the hands of circumstance our gratitude and joy because somewhere along the line, I am responsible for the gratitude level of my heart. Second question, when? When? When is it a good time to be grateful? Well, the scripture says that today would be a good day. Psalm 118, 24, verse you've heard probably many times, that this is the day that the Lord has made, so we will rejoice and be glad in it. And at the risk of sounding glib, I will say this. That verse when he says we rejoice and be glad in it. It doesn't say yesterday. That was a really good day. We were happy back then and had reason to be grateful. And the verse doesn't say tomorrow. You know, things will be better tomorrow. And we might have reason tomorrow to feel grateful. Today is the day. You see, the problem, again, for many of us is this. That we're waiting for our circumstance to change. And when it does, then we'll be grateful. My dad used to call that the when-then lie. He used to talk to us about that. There's this people that says, when, then? It's baloney. It doesn't work that way. It just doesn't. This leads to the third question. The third word is what? For what should I be grateful? Well, Paul says in Ephesians 5.20, and this will irritate you, for everything. Give thanks to God the Father at all times for everything. Let me clarify, and this is very important. I'm not trying to change this verse at all, but it's very important. When he says for everything, he does not mean give thanks for horrible things. That's not what he means. He does not mean give thanks for sin or pain or tragedy or disease or death. No. Instead, what Paul, I think, is after here, and he's after it every time he presses this issue of joyously giving thanks to God the Father in context of circumstances that sometimes are tough. What Paul is after is what I would call a perspective on life that learns to experience as a gift and appreciate with wonder with what other people take for granted. Let me say that again. What Paul is after is a perspective on life that learns to experience as a gift and appreciate with wonder what other people take for granted. And I love that expression because it reminds me of my dad again, who was grateful for everything. It is a weird thing. I mean, I was talking to my brother about this just a week ago because this thing comes up whenever we talk about my dad, and my dad is often a topic of conversation, believe it or not, in our family because he was kind of the centerpiece. A lot of life came out of him. But I remember as kids, my dad embarrassed us. He was so grateful. And he was loud, too, in public places, in restaurants. My dad was deaf. I don't know if you knew that. Maybe I've mentioned that. It wasn't something I didn't talk about often, but I think he thought everyone else was too. So, in fact, that's maybe why I talk so loud, because I, dad! Anyway, but we'd be in public places, like a restaurant, and this cup of coffee, this is a true story. This would happen over and over again. The waitress would bring a cup of coffee, and he would talk really loud about, this is the best cup of coffee I ever had, and he asked the waitress, how do you make this thing? Do you have some special process? Is there some special bean? and these eggs are amazing and again he was loud so everyone heard and we'd be sitting there thinking picture 14 year old kids around that overly excited guy about screaming dad act like you had eggs before true story when he retired my mom and dad bought a townhouse in Florida it's the law you have to move there at 75 so they did it And they bought this townhouse. And it was like everybody else's townhouse. But he was thrilled with this thing. Couldn't believe. It was like dream come true kind of stuff. They had one bedroom and a little den. I mean, that was it. But it was nice. But he would go out into the call sack, meet his neighbors, and he would start, his eyes were wide, he would start telling his neighbors about the incredible great townhouse that I live in. And they got so freaked out by how excited he was, they wanted to come over to see what he had that they didn't. at Christmas our kids still do grandpa I mean it really is I guarantee in a couple weeks when we open gifts our kids will go they'll start opening and the whole group will go whoa because grandpa did that before he got the present he was grateful before he saw what it was he was very weird individual honestly when when we were adolescents all our kids all of us we we talk we just saw he was crazy and he embarrassed us like crazy. In time, however, we came to discover that he wasn't crazy. He was just grateful for everything. Even when he died, he was grateful. I remember in the hospital visiting him at North Memorial Hospital and he was going down and getting worse every day and he would talk about how grateful he was to the nurses who were giving him the best care he ever had. You're dying! Anyway. Last question, how? How can you be grateful, especially in light of that? You're dying. Well, here's where the practice of what Karl Barth refers to as defiant gratitude comes into play. And it's rooted in a biblical text. I love this. Habakkuk chapter 3, verse 17 says it this way. Though the fig tree should not blossom, And there be no fruit on the vines. Though the yields of the olives should fall and the fields produce no fruit. Though the flock should be cut off from the fold and there be no cattle in the stalls. Yet I will exalt in the Lord. I will rejoice in the God of my salvation. And that is defiant gratitude. Because the truth is this. Hear me. The gratitude in this life will always be in spite of something. Gratitude in this life will always be in spite of something. Worship at times, and many of you have done this. Maybe you were doing it already this morning with tears streaming down your cheeks. is sometimes, worship is sometimes, an act of defiant gratitude where I decide to sing and say, though the fig tree should not blossom and there be no fruit on the vine, though my heart today is broken and my future is unclear, in this moment, in this time, I will exult in the Lord. I will declare his faithfulness to generations. I will rejoice in the God of my salvation. oh yes I will and I really believe that's part of why Paul prayed what he prayed in Colossians 1 11 that the Colossians in spite of their circumstances would become the kind of people who could be joyously giving thanks to God the Father because he knew that an ungrateful spirit can sour the spirit can blind the eyes, can literally destroy life. And all of that is why as we close today, we want to provide some space to interact with this word, to remember what we're grateful for, to worship and to maybe worship in spite of some things, be grateful in spite of some, and maybe to get in touch with some ingratitudes. some things that maybe have just taken for granted and then to write it down I don't know if you see it but yeah I'm sure you see the candles but there's sheets of paper here and there's writing all over these papers these papers all decide people came last night and just wrote down what they're grateful for and a lot of it's in spite of some things though the fig tree should not blossom though there be no fruit on the vine yet I will exalt in the Lord an act that for some is one of defiant gratitude. Let's go to worship. Thank you.
