each year as we plan these Novembering services, we've consistently seen the value of somebody sharing their story around grief. Those of you who have been with us the last couple of weeks have heard Pastor Dave speaking with us about mourning and being comforters. He's given us small glimpses into his own story as he shared with us. So as we were planning this special service this year, it really made sense to us. To ask Dave to share personal story, personal journey, as he remembers those that he has loved and he has lost. So we asked him to do that. To come and to let us in on his remembering. So we asked Dave to share with us now. Thanks, Vicki. It was 10 years ago, right around this time of year, as a matter of fact, three people very close to me and to my family died. 10 years ago. Can it really be 10 years ago? It didn't seem like it could, so I checked. I went into my file and pulled out my notes from the funeral. I looked at the program. There it was, September 21, 1997. He died September 16th, my dad, that is, at North Memorial Hospital of a lung infection. The day of his funeral, a dear friend of ours from Chicago, her name is Jody, Jody Russell and her husband Larry. Jody, the day of my dad's funeral, died of brain cancer. It wasn't a surprise. We knew it was coming. In fact, with my father's funeral in Chicago, we'd had a chance to see Jody earlier even in the day and knew it would be soon. But they were close friends, the kind of friends that you go on vacation with. Even after we moved to Minnesota, we still found ways to connect with them several times a year. Then three months after that, the funeral of my father and the death of Jody, one of my best friends at the time, Dave Busby, who I've spoken of often here, died as well after a lifelong, actually, battle with cystic fibrosis. So when I said yes to do this talk this way around this theme, though I didn't know all of what that meant or how I would feel about it, I did know that I was saying yes to remembering. And in that, hopefully, helping you to do the same. That as I kind of share remembrances of mine, that it would be actually an invitation for you. to remember your soul. What do you remember? The fact is, I remember lots of things. I remember my mom and dad taking their annual fall trip to visit us. The agenda for the fall trip was to see the family, my two brothers and their families and wives and all the grandkids. But real high on the list right after that was football and church. Those kind of two things were in our family, football and church. My dad loved football, particularly Bethel football, where all three of us boys played football 50, 60 years ago. My brother, Steve and Mike and me all played at Bethel. And when Steve, my brother, became the coach at Bethel, it became an even bigger deal. It kind of looks like Bethel, not just Bethel, but Bethel football is going to be kind of part of our life forever. And my dad loved to hear me preach too. It was weird, even in my 40s. My dad died, I was around 43, I think, 40, 45. Even at that age, if my dad was coming into town, I was nervous all week. I just wanted to do good when he was there. I remember realizing when they did show up for this fall connection, realizing that he was a lot sicker than we thought. We knew he was sick, but when I saw him, I remember telling Bonnie, he's much, this is much more serious than we knew. And I remember him getting to the game on Saturday, and wondering how he was going to be able to climb the stairs and get into the bleachers. I remember him coming to church on Sunday, and I remember him being in the hospital on Tuesday. And I remember that Tuesday when he went to the hospital. What I remember, among other things, is that my dad, my dad couldn't get out of bed by himself. He was staying at our house. So I carried him to the bathroom. But he didn't make it to the bathroom. So I cleaned him. And I remember how embarrassed he was by that. And I also remember what an honor it felt like for me to carry him and to clean him because he'd carried me his whole life. One week later, he was gone. I remember lots of things. I remember getting the news of Jody's death at my dad's funeral, during the funeral. And I remember Dave Busby getting sick soon after the funerals of my dad and Jody. Funny thing about Dave and his battle with cystic fibrosis, in the ten years that Bonnie and I kind of hung around Dave and Luana, at least once a year, David would get so sick that we would wonder, is this it? He's going to die now. He'd go into the hospital at least once a year for a week, maybe two. The treatments that he'd received there were brutal, extensive, exhausting. And every year, once a year, we wondered, is this the time? Well, this was the time. And I remember being with Dave in the hospital the day he died with a group of friends, small group of friends. And I remember kneeling next to his bed so I could look him in the eye, just moments before he died, telling him how ticked I was that I had lost the bet. The bet. The bet was a joke between the two of us about which one of us would do the other's funeral. I know this is dysfunctional in some way, but joking about weird stuff like this helped us talk about stuff like this. I teased him about faking it. Your cystic fibrosis, it's a scam. You just get all this sympathy and... And it was weird because he laughed and helped us talk about, you're going to die someday, Dave. It could be soon. And we had a bet. Who's going to do the other's funeral? I lost the bet. I was going to do his. I remember Luana that day, Dave's wife. Actually, in fact, I called her yesterday to get the details of this. said, LaWanna, did you do this just before he died or when he died? And she told me, she remembered, she was watching his heart monitor and it hit zero. And when it did, she crawled into that hospital bed with him and sang at the top of her voice, beautiful voice. And she sang this song, it is well with my soul. When sorrows like sea billows roll. She sang a song of lament, a song of hope and faith. She sang when he died. I remember at the funeral she wept. She couldn't sing that day. I remember preaching here at Open Door. it wasn't here, it was at Robinsdale, the week after my dad's funeral. Not sure it was a good idea to preach that soon after. The elders gave me lots of room not to preach. Takes a week. But I had some stuff to say and I thought it might be healing. I thought it might be helpful to me and even to the community as well. So I talked about some things that I'll never forget. Some things that I remember, like the care and compassion of people, particularly friends who were sitting Shiva with us. Sitting Shiva is a term that we're familiar with now, because I've kind of been talking about that the last couple of weeks. But we didn't call it that then. Back then we called it, thanks for coming. Back then we called it, thanks for being with us. but some of what I remembered around that time was actually troubling like what I've referred to even in the past as a tremor of doubt at the moment of truth I had one of those when my dad died we weren't ready you see for what we saw when we walked into the room that final time my dad had died but it didn't look like him in the final hours before he died the doctors decided to make some last-ditch efforts to try to save his life. And because of those well-intended procedures, his face had swollen, he was black and blue, he looked like he'd been in a fight. Next morning in my prayer journal, I wrote these words, Dear God, my dad died last night. Oh, boy. You know, you say that one time in your life. I went on to write these words. We had an amazing time with the family before his death around his body. The word of God hidden in our hearts over years was accessible and rich. Isaiah 40, 41, 43, Psalm 90, 91, 2 Corinthians 5. The scriptures just kept coming and flowing. The power of your presence was palpable, but so was the grief, even some fear. So help me, Lord, with this, I wrote. As we gathered around his lifeless body, I struggled wondering if he really was with you. Lord, how could I wonder about a thing like that at a time like this? But here's the truth. What seemed most real at the time when we were gathered around his dead body was not life, but death. It's weird, but true. When you're looking at death, when you talk about death, it can be a different thing. But when you're looking right at it, it looks like death wins. My prayer was this. I wrote it in my journal. All I can see right now is what is seen. Lord, help me see what's unseen. But there it was. Before I could think about it, before I could think not to think it, this tremor of doubts at the moment of truth. My dad used to say, Dave, you can't prepare for the evil day in the evil day. It's too late then. You've got to have to have some money in the proverbial bank of your spirit to stand firm in the evil day. So, was I not prepared for this day? Was I failing some sort of faith test? 4.30 in the morning, a full moon, a cloudless sky, so bright was the sky that you could read a book by it outside. I went outside to look. I couldn't sleep. I looked at the stars and the sky and the moon. It looked so vast and it looked so distant. There have been times that the heavens have elicited from me, just like they have from you, a sense of wonder and worship. But this time, in this context, their vastness overwhelmed me. And I I remember even thinking these goofy thoughts. They were full of fear, but they were just goofy thoughts. Like I looked at the stars and I thought, God, my dad was so bad with directions. Did he get lost? Out there. And I laughed just like that. It's like I do joke to help me talk about it. But actually it was a frightening thought. Where'd he go? I thought of young parents a few moments after that. This is my dad, and, you know, he's 73, and we thought it was too young, but, you know, this happens. I thought of parents with young children. I wonder if they ever had experiences like it. I wonder if you wonder. Did they get lost? Use this. I heard in my voice, use this to breed compassion, Dave. A few hours later, my wife woke up, And I shared all this crazy stuff with her. And almost in a whisper, she said, Dave, go read Psalm 139 and Isaiah 40, 26. Isaiah 40, 26 says this. Lift up your eyes on the high and see who has created these stars. The one who leads forth their host by number. He calls them all by name because of the greatness of his might and the strength of his power. Not one of them is missing. And then like a whisper, and neither is your dad missing. Later that day, our family gathered at my brother's house, my brother Steve. And I shared all this with them somewhat sheepishly actually. To my surprise, every single one of them had also had a tremor of doubt at the moment of truth. I found some comfort in that. Maybe it was normal. Maybe we weren't nuts. Maybe this wasn't some failed faith test. Maybe we were just feeling what people feel at times like this. Maybe we were just being human. It's hard to be human. remember we've been talking about that for the last couple weeks to admit that we are because with that admission comes this admission that we need God and people my dad used to say Dave you need to speak truth to yourself because sometimes you forget the truth all of us do so here's the truth God is with you in the fear he doesn't magically make it all go away He will be with you in the fear. God is invisibly present when you are in the dark and God hangs on to you when you've lost your grip of him. The eternal truth of God stands firm. The anchor holds. Your dad is safe. And so is Jody. And so is Dave. And so are you. I remember lots of things. Things I'll never forget. I'll never forget the faith of my father. Two days before he died, it was a Sunday, seven men, including the pastor of the Moraine Valley Baptist Church. That was the church my dad pastored for 32 years. After church, for them, I can just see these guys kind of coming up with this idea maybe just before church. They boarded a plane and came to Minneapolis to be with and pray for my dad. They were just sure he couldn't die. Not Bill. Not Pastor Bill. So much to do, they said. He still has so much to say and so much to give, they thought. Yeah, you got to dial into this. These guys are from the south side of Chicago. That's where I'm from. And it's really right out of that Saturday Night Live skit. Da bears, da bulls. Only with these guys, it was da Lord and da Bible. I'm not kidding. And as they prayed, they were convinced he had more tattoo for da Lord. They did. And as they prayed that way, full of hope, you know what I heard of? They prayed and they poured out their hearts and they prayed for healing. And what I heard was, they just love my dad. They just love my dad. but convinced. He had more to do and to say. And when they did that, this weirdest thing, Hebrews 11.4 kind of flashed through my mind. Hebrews 11.4 says, Abel, though dead, still speaks. And what dawned on me with that text relative to what they were praying was this, they're right. My dad isn't done. He's not done speaking, giving, affecting, influencing. For even if he dies, His life, his faith, his love will continue to ripple out, affecting as if he were still here. Marriages, churches, relationships, the hearts of men and women. I will never forget the faith of my father. And because that's true, my dad, though dead, still speaks. By the way, that's true of all of us. though dead one day our lives will continue to speak and it makes me wonder what is my life speaking i don't mean my words because some of us by how we live speak death to our spouses and our children and our friends and some of us not with just our words but how we live speak life And I promise you, when we're dead, it will continue to speak. So what are we speaking? What kind of life? One last thing I'll never forget beyond the faith of my father. In fact, greater than the faith of my father. I'll never forget the God of my father. For he is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You need in your mind to go back to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Every single one of us are from someone. We're from some place. A story of faith and courage and failure and stumbling and coming back. He is the God of amazing grace. He is the God of love and joy and peace and mercy, power, wisdom, and strength. He is a God worth knowing and worth loving and worth serving with your last breath and every ounce of strength. Last week in our dealing with what it means to become a good comforter when people are mourning, I talked about Job's three friends. Remember? I even told you that most of what I learned from Job, I learned from my dad and his exegesis around that incredible book. What I didn't tell you last week is that his favorite part of the book of Job was in Job 19. Job 19 is about the halfway point of the story, and so his suffering isn't over. There's still more to be played out. But in Job 19, after his friends were battling with him, and he was battling back and disagreeing in ways that I described last week, he just runs out of gas. And he kind of falls into this pit of despair, saying basically, well not basically, He says exactly this. Pity me. Pity me, oh, you my friends. And again, he's a lot of gas. He's got no fight left. And as he falls into that little pit of despair, it was like a little light goes on in Job's mind. As he remembers something that's true that sometimes you forget when you're in a lot of pain. And as the memory of this truth that wasn't going to change regardless of his circumstances came to him. He says, give me a piece of paper. No, not just a piece of paper. I want a book. I want to write this in a book. No, wait. A book isn't enough. Give me a rock and an iron pen. I want this written on a rock because in ten minutes, I'm going to forget that this is true and I need to be able to look at it again. Write this on a rock, he said. I know that my Redeemer lives and He will stand and someday so will I. It's important to remember so what do you remember what do you need to remember Lord help us to remember well Thank you. Weak and wounded sinner, lost and left to die Raise your hand for love is passing by Come to Jesus Come to Jesus Come to Jesus And live Now your kingdom's lifted And came from the name And precious blood Has washed away the stain Sing to Jesus Sing to Jesus Sing to Jesus and live back in your heart baby don't be afraid to call and remember when we walk sometimes we fall fall on Jesus fall on Jesus Fall on Jesus and live Sometimes the way is lonely And still filled with pain So if your sky is dark And pours the rain cry to Jesus cry to Jesus cry to Jesus Oh, when the rhythm of love spills over The music fills the night And when you can't contain your joy inside Dance for Jesus Dance for Jesus Dance for Jesus and me If your final heartbeat Kiss the word goodbye Then go in peace And laugh on glory's side Fly to Jesus Fly to Jesus Fly to Jesus And live Fly to Jesus Fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus and live. Before we come to the table today, we are aware that many of you here today are currently in the process of mourning somebody, that you have lost a loved one. And we'd just like to make you aware of a few places in this community in which you could enter into that process more fully. First, we have a wonderful group of people who are currently in the midst of their own process of grieving that are meeting together about every two weeks on a Tuesday night in a group here at church called Grief Share. This is an open group and you're welcome to join them at any time. So if you're drawn to this, please don't miss the chance to pick up some information on the memorial table out in the gathering place before you leave today for dates and details. Secondly, every year at Novemberain, we've had the memorial trees out by the memorial table in the gathering place, and they're there today as well. So we'd like to invite each one of you to go out and write a name or a message on one of those leaves and hang it on the tree as a prayer or in remembrance of someone. And then lastly, today as we celebrate the Lord's table together, you'll have the opportunity to come up in front here during communion and light one of these candles in remembrance of someone. You can come up as a family, you can come up alone, light a candle and place it in the sand of one of these bowls sitting around the stage. We'd just like to remind you that as you do that, place that candle towards the back of the bowl so those coming after you will be able to have some space to do the same. These are some small ways of being on this journey of remembering together. You don't have to do it alone. It seems so fitting to combine this time of sacred remembering with sharing communion together today as a community. Our Master Jesus himself spoke these words after he had given thanks. When he said, this is my body, broken for you. Eat this in remembrance of me. And the same way with cup, he said, this is my blood. my new covenant of promise with you. Every time you drink, remember me. So today as we participate around the table together, may we be so mindful. May God give us and grant us the ability to know that our master Jesus can utterly and completely companion us in every grief, the deepest sorrow, the most significant loss. And not only can he companion us, but he'll carry us if need be. So today we participate in this Feast of Remembrance together. I'd like to call the communion stewards to come forward and as they're coming forward, I'd like to just give you a few instructions as to how we do communion here at Church of the Open Door. First, this table is open to everybody who is a follower of Jesus. You're welcome here. In a moment, the communion stewards will receive communion and then they will go out to different stations throughout the room, in the viewing rooms, in the gathering place and up in the balcony. And when you're ready, you make your way over to any one of those communion stations. You will be given a cracker and then you can dip that cracker in the cup while the communion stewards speak some words of blessing over you. For those of you that have children with you that are not ready yet to take communion, that's your decision, parents. You know best. Just let the communion stewards know and they will be happy to pray a prayer of blessing over your child. during this entire time we'll be singing songs of worship we want to make you aware that the cross is up here as well please feel free to come up and to pray, to sit, to stand come up and light a candle and Steve will let us know when there's one song left to sing so that everybody has a chance to participate in communion this morning would you join me as we pray father we are so grateful for your presence here with us we are thankful for the opportunity to participate and interact in remembering what it is that you have promised us and we are so utterly grateful that our Master Jesus is completely capable and willing to companion us in our griefs, our losses, and our sorrow. Bless this bread and bless this cup as we share together. Amen. Amen. Let's stand together. Let me get to worship.
