This session I'm going to talk about some perspectives just to have as a helper, whether it's in a formal kind of setting as a pastor or a counselor or teacher or something like that, or just someone who has opportunities periodically to enter into helping someone in your life, someone that you just care about. because I really think that we can be a great help to other people, but helping others doesn't mean controlling the outcome or fixing or taking care of things like that. And a lot of times the struggle in being a helper or in trying to help someone, whether it's in a formal setting like a counseling setting or just as someone that you care about, the struggle is not helping that other person so that you're okay based on them getting better. And so there's two aspects in terms of caring for others in a graceful way. And the first aspect is fighting our own fight in the process. Because, you know, I think that I've already talked about part of the struggle in our fight is remembering who we are and those kinds of things. And then we want to help others fight the right fight, too. and we want to do things that are beneficial for others and that encourage them in their process. So the two aspects are fighting our own fight first and then helping others fight their fight as well. So the first aspect in fighting our own fight would be remembering who we are. And I'm going to get to a big section of who we are in the next talk, but there's just some perspectives that I want you to understand in terms of who we are more as a helper or what job is ours and what job isn't ours. In 1 Corinthians 3, verse 5, Paul says, What then is Apollos and what is Paul, servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave opportunity to each one? The thing that's significant about that is that the Corinthians were, the confrontation that Paul is having on the Corinthians is that the Corinthians were getting okay because of Jesus, plus they liked Paul a lot. And so one group of people was saying, well, I'm of Paul, and the other group was saying, I'm of Apollos, and the other one was saying, well, I'm of Cephas, and then the really spiritual ones, they were of Jesus. But the point was, the confrontation is because these people were pointing at Christ plus something else. That's, once again, the confrontation. Later on in the Corinthians, they're pointing at Christ plus the fact that they have certain gifts. And that's what validates them. And Paul gets real upset about that. I think that this is almost like the seeds of denominationalism. It's the baggage that we hang on to besides just the cross. And so we're of Christ, plus we're Baptist, or plus we're Pentecostal, or plus we're Catholic, plus we're Lutheran. And it isn't even that being those different things is bad. It's just that that doesn't have any power to validate us. That's just a personal preference thing. But it doesn't have any power to add anything to us. So the Corinthians, there's this group of Corinthians that were saying, Paul's our guy, and that's what makes us cool. It would be the same thing as people who would point at me. It's like to say, well, we listen to Jeff and we like what he says and that makes some makes you kind of more special than somebody who doesn't agree with me. Well, that's a lie. And so what Paul is doing here is he's kind of pushing this away, and he's saying, what then is a Paulist and what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed. So who we are, who I am, who Paul is, who Paul is, who Dave Johnson is, who you are even, for who all of us are, even if you're not standing up front talking to people or sitting in a counseling office and counseling people, but you're just being a friend to somebody who needs help, is a servant, if you can get the perspective, a servant through whom? And what that conveys is more like we're a channel. Now, that's a bad word these days, I suppose. But we're like a vessel, okay? We're someone or something through whom something flows to somebody else. We're not the originator of it. We don't own it. We can't take credit for it. We're just here. And God just uses us. And so don't be pointing at us. That's what Paul is saying. Point at him. And see, a lot of people that I know take responsibility kind of for being the fixer or the changer, or it's their job to cause results, or it's their job to make something happen, or to change someone's mind, or whatever, or to save their cousin. And all Paul is saying is that we are servants through whom you believe. God made something flow through us to something else, so don't inflate your view of us so much. Don't do that. And Paul is constantly pushing that kind of thing away. And the reason that's a struggle is because you can't see Jesus and you can see Paul. And it's a lot easier to hang on to stuff you can see than that you can't see. The next thing to remember is to remember who causes the growth. Whose job is it to cause the growth? I know a whole lot of parents who think it's their job to cause their kids to grow or to change or whatever. I know a lot of pastors who think it'S their job to cause the congregation to grow. And a lot of counselors who think it'S their job to cause the clients to grow. But what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 3, 6 is, I planted, Paul s watered, but God caused the growth. God caused the growth. I planted, Paul s watered, but God caused the growth. Now, at Church of the Open Door, I think that through the last 12 years, Dave Johnson and I have had a kind of relationship that fits here, in that I have sensed maybe that maybe Dave stands up on Sunday morning and he plants, you know, whatever that means. And then Monday through Saturday, what recovery groups and ministries like that did, was we just watered what he planted. Or else it might be that we planted and he watered. I'm not sure, okay? but it doesn't matter because God is the one who causes the growth. So don't be planting at the one who waters and don't be pointing at the one who plants. Just keep hanging on to the one who causes the growth. But that perspective, by the way, has been very freeing to me to realize that it's not my job to cause the growth. As a dad, as a pastor, as a counselor, as a teacher, it's not my job to cause you to do anything. It's not my job to get you to change. It's not my job to stop you from doing something. It's my job to plant, if that's my job, or to water, if that's my job. And so I need to be a faithful planter or a faithful waterer, and if I do that, then I'm done. And then God causes the growth or he doesn't. So let's say that we're involved in some endeavor, and you plant, and I water, and no growth happens. What does that mean? It means that God didn't cause the growth. But see, a lot of times we think that it's our job to cause the growth, and so then we just keep trying harder and indict ourselves because no growth has happened, when really it's just our job to plant and water. Jeremiah is an example of somebody who planted and watered and nothing happened. He was so bummed out by what was going on in his ministry. Basically, he goes to God one day and he says, This stinks. I hate this. I mean, you called me to do this, and nothing happened, and nobody changed, and nobody got it, and nobody responded. And as a matter of fact, my family all left me, and they think I'm stupid, and my kids don't listen to me, and my servants laugh when I tell them to do stuff. Everybody's left me. I hate this. I'm not doing this anymore. And he says, well, no, I can't quit doing this, because when I quit doing this, it burns inside of me. So I'm going to keep doing this, but I hate this. And so, see, at the point at which he felt like it was his job to cause something to happen, he gets really frustrated, you see, but when he realizes, once again, that his job is just to say it, okay? And now here we are 6,000 years later, and we read Jeremiah, and we get stuff out of Jeremiah, and that means something to us, because he was faithful to plant their water or whatever it is he did back then, you see, even though he didn't get to see the results of what he planted and watered. I think that a lot of what, most of what God does is in a supernatural way, a spiritual kind of way, and most of what he does we can't see. In terms of helping someone as a counselor, what I've learned is just because someone looks like they didn't hear you doesn't always mean they didn't. But some people have a lot at stake to act like they didn't, because they know you'd like it too much if they did. So they act like they didn't, and then you get all bummed out and frustrated because you thought it was your job to cause something to happen here, and then you look around and nothing happened. I was the junior high pastor at Colonial Church of Edina from 1975 to 77, and I didn't see anything happen. I mean, if these people liked you, they hit you. I didn't know that about junior hires at the time. But if they thought you were an okay guy, they could come up and hit you and kick you and tease you and stuff like that. I just kept taking all that personally, not knowing that that was the way that they showed that they approved of me, you see. But see, the issue is this, that I planted and watered for two years and saw no growth, nothing. I saw one thing that was a tangible thing, and that was one time we were getting on a bus with about 75 junior hires to go to a certain event, And in order to get off the bus, if you wanted to get off the bus once you were on and had paid to get on, we stamped your hand with this little stamp, you know. And one of the guys had, you know, figured out what the stamp looked like, and so he drew it and, you know, counterfeited a stamp on his hand. And this is a guy that I had worked a lot with, spent a lot of time with, and just hung out with and things like that. And so he came on the bus, you know, and we were checking people's hands. And he came on the bus and he showed me his hand, and then he walked past me, and then he stopped. He just stood there and stood there and stood there and stood there. He took a deep breath, and he said, I can't lie to you, and he gave me a dollar. That was it for two years. The only thing that I could tell that something had happened here. Now, I mean, we're talking about taking these folks to Yellowstone Park in the Tetons for 10 days, And while we're on this trip, they're dunking each other in the geysers and making racial slurs out of the van and, you know, the people and tossing Bowie knives in the air as far as they can toss them in the air and then running like crazy, you know, in the public campgrounds at Yellowstone Park, that kind of stuff. And me threatening to fly people home from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and et cetera, et cetera, all this kind of stuff. Awful, terrible stuff. We're talking about one of the leaders smuggling back a case of Coors beer because you couldn't buy it here at the time, see? And me being so upset and angry with him that I started hollering at him, and he said, if you holler at me, I'm not going to listen. And I could have just... Okay, so last year, I'm in the church service over here in the gym, And this guy comes up to me. He's about this tall. He comes walking up to me. He says, you're Jeff Van Vonderen, right? I said, yeah. He said, where were you the day that Elvis died? And I thought, oh, man. I mean, you know, so this guy probably saw Elvis, or I don't know. I don't know, man. in some counseling session with a psychotic person here. Who knows? I don't know. So that's a weird question. You understand that? Just out of a blue, perfect stranger walks up to me, asks me where Elvis died. But what's even maybe stranger is that I know where I was the day that Elvis died. And where I was was I was driving in a church van from Colonial Church of Edina on the road in between Yellowstone Park and the Grand Teton National Park with this group of kids. And I told them that. I said, well, that's where I was. and he said, well, I was on that trip. And you know what? This guy loved the Lord like crazy. And he goes to Open Door and he just loves the Lord like crazy. And see, I think God caused some growth there, but who'd have known? I mean, when I spoke at Colonial in January, I had people that were in my junior high group at that time coming up to me with kids and thanking me. I couldn't believe it. I mean, I was surprised that they weren't in jail. but you see most of what God does he does in a way that you can't see and if you're in charge of causing the growth you're going to be really frustrated and feel really defeated and really indicted but if your job is just to plant or water whatever it is, however that looks then just do that and God causes the growth and if you plant and someone waters and there's no growth, God didn't cause it or else he caused it in a way you couldn't see. And that's not your job anyway to do that. Three, we need to remember who we serve. Now this is really tough. There's a lot of people in the ministry especially, I certainly have run into this rule myself, that have a rule that says, You're supposed to serve God, and you're not supposed to make anybody unhappy, both at the same time, which can't be done. Because if you serve God, somebody's not going to like it. And I'm not saying that you should just have an attitude like, well, nuts to you, I'm serving God. I'm just saying that if you have yourself in a place where you feel like you're supposed to please everybody and please God both at the same time, you're not going to do it. And so in 1 Corinthians 4.1, it says, Let a man regard us in this manner as servants of Christ. Servants of Christ. The word there is bond servant. It's a slave who has sold himself into slavery. It's not a slave that has been taken captive and is being pressed into service against their will. But it's a bond slave who has sold himself into service to Christ. If you have a perspective that you're here to serve people, you might please people, but you might not serve them. if you have a perspective that you're here to serve Jesus you will serve people but you might not please them and that's a struggle because once again you can't see Jesus who you serve and you can see all these people who like it or don't like it and that's just a struggle so you need to remember who we're slaves of we're not slaves of the system we're not slaves of the church we're not slaves of the denomination we're slaves of Jesus I remember one time I was a speaker up at a Christian Missionary Alliance family camp. Now those of you who go to Open Door, you might not even know this, but Church of the Open Door is an affiliated church of Christian Missionary Alliance. We're kind of a poor Christian Missionary Alliance church because we don't push that stuff. They leave us alone, we leave them alone. But I'm the speaker at this camp. And the president of the denomination is at this camp. And he's the speaker too. So there's me at this camp and then there's the president of the denomination at this camp. And in the morning, I'm the morning speaker, and I'm saying that obedience is so important that it needs to be a real thing. And if you're just doing stuff on the outside to try to earn points with God, it doesn't count. And if you're going to the mission field because you think God needs you there or because you're trying to earn his approval or get him to like you or be able to check that off your list of Christian things to do. God pukes on that. That's basically what I'm saying in the morning. And then in the evening, he's saying that if you don't go, and there's 80 million people who go to hell every year, and it's your fault, basically, so you better go. That's what he's saying in the evening. So there's this little, you know, tension between the two things. And about Friday, after my morning talk, this couple comes up to me, and they're kind of looking around to make sure nobody sees them talking to me, you know. And they said, so they came up to me and they said, how did you get in the alliance? And I said, well, okay. See, here's Jesus. I had a piece of chalk, okay? So I said, this is Jesus. And I'm just looking at him and following him and trying to do what he wants me to do and, you know, just serving him. And one day I look up and I'm in the alliance. So, you know, I just want to keep doing this and following him and serving him, whatever that means. And, you know, one day I might look up, I won't be here anymore, but that's not the issue. Do you understand? That's not the issue. We're not here to build a denomination. We're not here to build a church. You know, we're not here to build Jeff's kingdom. We're not here to build. We're here to build God's kingdom. We're here to serve him. And if it works out that they let us do it here, we'll do it here. But if they don't let us do it here, we'll do it someplace else because that's what we're here to do. So that's a helpful perspective. Also, in terms of who we serve, there's a little teaching in Matthew 11, and this is about maybe the end result of trying to please people. Jesus says in Matthew 11, 16 So like, somebody's always going to not like what you do. That's the way it is. So do what you have a sense that God's telling you to do. And that's who he served. Remembering our job, that would be the fourth thing, is remembering what our job is. And this is really tough because I was taught the wrong job, basically. In 1 Corinthians 4, 1 and 2, it says, Let a man regard us in this manner as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries. Stewards of the mysteries. it is required, moreover, that a steward be found trustworthy. So our job is to be a steward of the mystery, and more than that, to be a trustworthy steward. 1 Corinthians 4, 1 and 2. Stewards of the mysteries, and it's required of stewards that one be found trustworthy. The thing that's so interesting about this passage is that the Greek word there translated steward really means table waiter. we're table waiters and see the thing about a table waiter is and maybe some of you have been waiters or waitresses the thing about being a waiter is you don't own the restaurant and you don't even cook the food the job of a table waiter is to get the food to the person in as close a condition as when it was prepared and if you do that you've been a trustworthy steward understand this? when I was in seminary I was taught to be an untrustworthy trustworthy table waiter. My job was to change the food to fit what I thought you really wanted or what you really needed. So our attitude was kind of like you don't really know what you need or want and if I say this, this, you might get upset about that or this isn't quite strong enough and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to salt and pepper it a little bit and change it. Even though it's broccoli, we're going to take off the broccoli and give you cauliflower. We're going to make the food fit you because we know what you need better than you know what you need. Kind of like that. And so what I was taught with the sermon, I was taught to use the sermon no, I was taught to use God's word as an opportunity to bring my message. Okay, following this? Instead of using my sermon as an opportunity to bring God's work. And so that's why you'll notice when Dave Johnson preaches that he spends a lot of time verse by verse by verse by verse is because he wants to tell you what it said. The Holy Spirit's going to have to tell you what it means and what it means for you and how you're supposed to apply it necessarily. But what he wants to do is he wants to study and study and study and study and find out what it said and then tell you what it said is in a closer condition than what it was meant when it was cooked. And so a faithful table waiter, a faithful steward, their job is to bring the word in as close a condition as when it was given. And then the Holy Spirit's going to have to cause whatever growth or whatever changes that need to happen. But a lot of people, because they think it's their job to cause the growth and control the results, use God's word as an opportunity to bring their message for you. And so that's why you see someone who uses the scripture to prove a point, you know, like to get you to change or get you to do something different. And that would be an unfaithful steward. A faithful steward is someone who just tells you what it means. Now, actually, what I just did with you, what I tried to do with the word steward is do what a steward does. Understand? Like when that word was written, what that meant was table waiter. And so what I tried to do with that word was bring it to you in as close a condition as when it was prepared, and then God's going to have to apply that. And that's what a steward does. Waiters that act like they own the restaurant get fired. You know, they lose their job. And waiters that insult the, you know, condescend on the patrons lose their job. And so our job is to be a faithful steward, a trustworthy steward. So this is just our fight. These are just some things that are helpful that if we could remember them in terms of our own self before we even come to try to help somebody else, this will be a freeing kind of thing. It should lighten your load. It doesn't even necessarily mean that you would do less activity. It just kind of clarifies why you do what you do and what you're trying to accomplish by what you're trying to accomplish. The second part of this, though, is in helping others fight their fight. How can we be graceful helpers that help others fight their own fight? And the first aspect of this is that we can be graceful, we can provide people with graceful, full of grace, graceful reminders about who they are and what God says about them. This is the story that isn't, I'm going to tell you a story right now, and this is the story that I call The Summer I Got Famous. And the summer I got famous was 1982, summer of 1982. And just to set the stage, my dad died on May 16th of 1982. And so I decided on May 9th to go, he was in a hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. I took a bus down to Madison, Wisconsin to visit my dad, and of course he said, oh, you don't have to do that. I said, I'm not coming for you. I'm coming for me. I need to do this. And so I took the bus down there, and the deal was that I had some seminars out on the East Coast that I was supposed to do that year, and one of them started on May 14th. So really, I got to Madison, Wisconsin, and then Holly brought two of the daughters down to Madison, Wisconsin in our Dodge Colt, gave me the car and the daughters. I headed for the East Coast, and then she took the bus back here. And the plan was that later on, a couple weeks later, she was going to fly out to New Brunswick, Canada and meet me, but she couldn't make the trip in the car because she was too pregnant. So that's the scenario. So I go, and I have this awful, incredible, terrible, horrible, wonderful, beautiful time with my dad. It's like I decided that I'm going to say everything I wish I would have said if I don't get to say it. And so I said it all, and he said it all. And we cried and hugged, and we grieved his death together before he even died. I mean, we got angry. We said, this stinks. This is a ripoff, you know, all this kind of stuff. And it was great. But we really connected. And an example of this is that the second day, I was there for three days. The second day that I was there, I started experiencing all of his symptoms. And that was really weird. And I remember getting out of the car at the hospital and slamming the door and looking up at his hospital room and all of a sudden getting this wave of his symptoms. He was nauseous, I was nauseous. He had the chills, he had a fever. I started getting these things. I actually had a fever. It took my temperature, I had a fever. But we did it all. So when it was time to leave, I told him that I knew I wasn't going to see him again. And that really stinks. But I have this seminar I've got to go do in Connecticut. And so I'm going to go do the responsible thing. Which, if I had to do it over again, I'd cancel the seminar. But that's a different thing. But see, he understood. He understood. He went, yeah, I know. Because he kind of helped wire me up that way. You understand? I mean, he was instrumental in helping me do the responsible thing. So I went and did the responsible thing. And the farther away I drove, the better I felt. And by the time I got to Cleveland, all the symptoms were gone. Of course, then I still had to deal with Cleveland, but that's a different thing, too. So I got to Connecticut, and I gave the seminar Friday night and all day Saturday, Sunday morning, preached in church. Sunday night, I'm giving the last session just like this, and the phone rings. And this is this little dinky church in Connecticut, and you can hear the phone ring in the back. And so the pastor gets up and walks out, and then he comes back, and he comes over here, and he whispers in my ear, he says, your mom's on the phone. Excuse me. I go take the phone call. You know, he does a little tap dance or whatever he does. I don't know what he does. I come back in. My dad died. My mom told me my dad died. I came back in, finished the seminar. Okay, now I'm letting you in a little bit on what a performer I am, okay? Finished the seminar. Got in the car with my two daughters. Drove down to Wilmington, Delaware. Dropped them off with my sister-in-law. drove to Philadelphia, took a plane, flew to Green Bay, Wisconsin, did three days of funeral and family stuff and all that stuff. Got back in a plane, flew back to Philadelphia, got in the car, drove to Wilmington, picked up the daughters, went up to Maine and did a week's of seminars. Got in the car, went up to New Brunswick, Canada, did another week's worth of seminar, then Holly met me up there with our other daughter, plus she was pregnant. But while I was in Canada, they never heard any of this stuff. Like for people here, even today, you've heard some of this stuff before. Maybe some of you have heard lots of this stuff. Maybe you've heard the exact same stuff. They never heard any of this stuff. They went nuts. They bought all the books. They bought all the tapes. I told them all my stuff. They ate it up. I told them Johnson Institute stuff from 15 years ago. They ate that up. I made stuff up. They ate that up. It's like they put me on Canadian cable vision. I mean, I was like this hero over in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. And what happened was I got a big hit about it. And that's why I called it the summer I got famous. I got really famous about it, you see. And I was kind of feeling like God was pretty lucky to have me on his side. And I even told Holly, you know, when I get famous enough, maybe we'll just take the summers off, okay? I can still hardly believe I said that, but I said that to her. And, okay, then we exchange daughters. I take the daughter that flew out there plus one of the daughters that drove with me, and the other one flies back to Minneapolis with her, and we drive the whole north side of the Great Lakes, all through Canada, you know, and then we come down through Sault Ste. Marie, and then we go to Hayward, Wisconsin, where my mom lives, and we spend a couple days with her, and then we come back to Minneapolis, and while all this was happening, we were having our house remodeled. So our house in north Minneapolis, We walk in this house, and there's sheetrock dust all over everything, and all of our earthly belongings are piled up in the middle of our living room floor with a big drop cloth over the top of it, and everything's half done. So we can't even go home. So we move into the guy who's doing the work. We move into his house. We've got to commute back and forth to our house for two weeks. And finally, we get to come back to our house, and about a week later, our fourth daughter was born. Okay, so this is July now. By August, I was so depressed. One of the reasons I was depressed is because it was like God responded to my fame by just making sure nobody wanted to hear what I had to say. So I had no seminars. I had no, nobody came for counseling. Nobody called me on the phone. Nobody wanted to hear anything I had to say, period. Okay? So I'm sitting there feeling sorry for myself. You know, like, you know, poor, I feel sorry. I don't know who they are anymore, but a couple of people, you know, straggled in off the street to talk to me. And when I talked to them, I said stupid things anyway. Like, I'd say things and I'd go, oh, I can't, you know, try to reel it in and I just couldn't, it was too late. And I'd go home to Holly and I'd say, I can't even believe the stupid stuff. And I'm telling people, I don't even think this stuff, I'm telling people this stuff. I'm so depressed. And see, because God, it was like God said, okay, big shot, take the summer off. And he just gave me the summer off right now. But see, since I had gotten famous from what I was doing, what that means is that I was getting my sense of identity and validity from what I was doing. And then I wasn't doing anything. So all that was down the drain now. Plus, because I wasn't performing anymore, you see, all this stuff about my dad dying kind of landed. See, I was able to push all that away as long as I was cranking it out. But as soon as there's nothing to do, it all kind of landed. So August, I was so depressed I couldn't move. So I'm sitting in my office, feeling sorry for myself, and there's a knock on the door. And I say, come in, and it's Dave Johnson. And he comes in, and he sits on the back of my sofa. So he's not sitting on the chair. He's like this bird up on perched on the back of my soul. So he's just looking at me like this, you know. And he says, depressed, huh? And see, those of you who don't know, you might not know this, but one of the reasons why Dave hollers is because his dad is deaf and his grandmother is deaf. And, you know, when you go to the restaurant with that family, it's like the Loud family goes to the restaurant. It's like, Bill, Bill, it's time to order. What do you want? You know, like that. So part of the reason why he talks so loud is just because that's how you get hurt in that family. So he goes, I'm depressed, huh? And I said, yeah. He said, I bet you know why, too. And I said, yep. He said, I bet you know what to do about it, too. And I said, yep. He said, I bet it didn't help either. And I said, yep. he said well I'm preaching out of Hebrews 4 he starts giving me a sermon and the text is Hebrews 4 14 and she starts telling me this verse since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our confession for we don't have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses but one who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin I said okay stop if you're going to tell me that Jesus has been through this and he knows what I'm going through I already knew that and it already didn't help he said no that's not what I was going to tell you I was going to tell you the next verse and what the next verse says is let us therefore draw near with confidence let's draw near with confidence to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. I said, so what? He said, well, he said, you know, this talks about Jesus being a sympathetic high priest and we can draw near to him, blah, blah, blah. But he said, I think that Jesus is turning you into a sympathetic high priest. I said, what? He said, yeah, he said, I think that he's turning, He's helping you become a sympathetic high priest. And probably, you know, he said, this isn't going to sound like good news, but probably this isn't going to fix your depression. But I just want you to know this. He said, someday, probably, safe bet, somebody's going to come in your office and sit down. They're going to be so depressed that they can't get out of the chair. Instead of giving them a bunch of advice and a bunch of pat answers and a bunch of Bible verses, you're going to know exactly just how they feel because you have felt that way, and you're going to give them grace and mercy to help in time of need. Because, you see, that's what sympathetic high priests give. I'll bet that you can think of the people in your lives that have tried to help you, and you can tell who are the unsympathetic high priests and the sympathetic high priests. The sympathetic high priests are the ones that give you grace and mercy to help in time of need. The unsympathetic high priests are the ones that give you advice. Because, see, you're already tired, and then they give you more to do. You're already toasted, and they give you a list of things you're supposed to do, and they're not sympathetic, and it doesn't help. Sympathetic high priests give grace and mercy to help in time of need. Now, I'm going to say this in the same vein as Dave said this to me. There are people here, I don't know who you are, but there are people here who have been through a heck of a lot of pain and stuff in your life. And when I say this next thing, it's not going to make that go away. But what I want you to know is that somewhere down the line, somebody's going to show up, and they're going to tell you a story, and it's going to be your story. And when they tell you the story that you know all about because you've been there, you're going to give them grace and mercy to help in time of need. So all that pain that you went through, it will not be wasted, even though it's not gone right now. And even though it doesn't make it okay to get abused just because you get to help somebody later on, it's still not okay. But you just need to know it's going to be redeemed, and you're going to be able to give people grace and mercy to help in time of need because you're going to be a sympathetic high priest instead of an unsympathetic one who gives people little formulas and Bible verses and more things to do. And see, I don't always know what to say to a person about a specific issue that they have, because I'm not trained in everything. I'm not trained in hardly anything. I don't know about all the stuff in the DSM-3R diagnostic manual and how you treat those kinds of things. But you know what I do know about? I do know about giving people grace and mercy to help in time of need. And I already told you how simple that is before. Sometimes it's just a matter of not falling off the chair or getting blown away by hearing somebody's story, but just going, yeah, okay. And just reminding them that who they are and their identity is a settled issue because of Christ, even though right now they don't look too good. And what that is is grace and mercy to help in time of need. So that's one of the perspectives that I want you to have. Another perspective in helping others fight their fight, number one and then B, okay? Number two is learning to watch for God. Learning to watch for God. And watching for God is a tricky thing, especially if you haven't been taught to watch for God. And let me show you what this looks like. In John 5, 19, Have we been taught to look around and watch what the Father's doing? Unless it is something he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in like manner. Verse 30, I can do nothing on my own initiative. As I hear, I judge. My judgment is just because I don't seek my own will but the will of him who sent me. So that's a little bit more of a statement about whose kingdom even Jesus is building. He's building the Father's kingdom, not his own. But what he says is the Son can do nothing of himself unless it is something he sees the Father doing. Whatever he sees the Father doing, this is what he does. The picture I get is that Jesus gets up in the morning in Jerusalem, takes a shower or whatever he does, walks out on the street and looks around to see what the father's doing. And whatever the father's doing, he goes and does that, because that's whose kingdom he wants to build anyway. Now I'll give you an idea of what this looks like, because it sounds kind of maybe spooky or weird or whatever, but I'm in a counseling session with a married couple. So I say to the couple, why are you here? Why are you here? Why did you come? And the wife says, this isn't working, this isn't working, this isn't working. You know, this needs to change. I'm sad, I'm frustrated, I'm hurt. He does this, he doesn't do this, and she bleeds all over the place. And I say to the husband, well, why are you here? He goes, I don't know. Well, like, why did you come? Well, I don't know. Well, like, what do you need help with? Well, I'm not sure. Well, is there anything that you need help with or that you would like to work on or that isn't working that you'd like to change in your life? Even if she wasn't screaming about it. No. Why did you come? Because she wanted me to come. Okay. When that's happening, I'm looking at this couple and I'm thinking, okay, where's the father doing something here? Where? You tell me. Where's the father doing something? As far as I can tell, Father could be doing something with everybody. Do you understand? But as far as I can tell, what we have over here is a soft heart, and what we have over here is a hard heart. We have that the Father's already brought up issues and softened this person up and heightened their awareness about what's going on. And I know that I can go toward that person with help, and the help will help. But I also know that if I go toward this other person with help, I'm going to get a debate. I'm going to end up trying to convince them why they're supposed to listen to what I have to say. guess what? I don't have time. Are we that short of people who want help and need help and know they need help that we've got to spend our time trying to get people who need help but don't want help to try to take help? No. Now see, in seminary, I wasn't taught to watch where the Father was and go where the Father is and bless what the Father was doing. I was taught to look where God wasn't doing anything, go there, do a bunch of stuff and ask God to come and bless what I was doing. And hopefully he shows up and bails me out. And if he doesn't, you know, it's a bad thing. This happened with Passages Counseling Center. In 1982, I started, or 1980, I started doing these seminars and things out in all these different churches. And so many people called me for counseling that I couldn't do all the counseling. So in 1982, I got this idea, you know, wouldn't it be great to have a licensed Christian outpatient counseling center so that I don't have to do all the counseling, which I can't do anyway, plus Christians' insurance could pay for counseling, because right now, you know, the counseling that their insurance pays for, they don't want to go to because it's not Christian, so in order to get Christian counseling, they've got to pay twice, once for their insurance they don't use, and once for the counseling. So let's do, you know, and so I started to write this license, and I started to do all this work, and for two years, I banged around trying to get this thing going, and nothing happened, and I was so discouraged, I couldn't figure it out. It was such a great idea. And it was like, you know, I went to God and said, God, here's this great idea. I'm going to go do this. Come bless what I'm doing. And he said, see ya. So I went off and did all this stuff, and he just didn't follow. So after two years, I'm like exhausted. And I come back like, I don't get it. And God says, well, we've seen what you can do. now I'll show you what I can do and in a two month period there he brought a person named Fred Peterson into my life who was an administrative genius see I never thought about buildings and copy machines and staff and all that kind of stuff see I knew what people would get when they got there but I didn't have a clue how to get them there and then God brought me this person who knows how to get him there. And within two months, there's this thing called Passages Counseling Center that's cooking like crazy, and now it's four different centers. But see, it was like, now, how can I say this? Okay, it's better to run behind God than it is to run ahead of him. Understand? It's better to run behind God than it is to, you know, the Israelites, when they came to the promised land, what they said was, on the edge of the promised land, they said we would rather stay here with God than go in without him. Even though this was the promised land. So we need to learn to watch for God. And sometimes, you know, when this husband now, who's got a hard heart and is going to debate me about why I really don't have anything for him to say, sometimes I say, so you're okay, right? And he says, yeah. And I say, well, then go be well. See you later. I mean, you are okay, right? Yeah, well, I mean, it's kind of foolish for you to pay me a bunch of money if you're okay. Right? I mean, go do something else with the money. And sometimes that person says, well, you know, come to think of it. And they start telling me their issues, and now I've got a client. If you're going to be a counselor, you've got to have a client. And sometimes they storm off, you know, when they say nuts to you, or what's wrong with that guy? And two years later, I get a phone call, and they say, you know what? You were right then, even though I didn't know it, and now I know it, and can I get help? And now I've got a client, you see? Okay, number three. Be a sower who understands soil. This is in Mark 4. This is in Mark 4, and I want to read this to you, but I also want to say that, once again, I was taught this passage as if Jesus was talking to me as the soil. So the way that I was preached this or taught this is that you're the soil, so you better be good soil. And then you better receive the seed, and then you better grow a bunch of stuff. Like that. But this is not taught to the soil. It's taught to sowers. Jesus is teaching his disciples this teaching. And see, his disciples are sowers. They're in the business of sowing, just like Jesus. And he's equipping them as good sowers to carry on the ministry of sowing because in a couple years he's going to split and then it's going to be their job. So here's Mark 4. It says this, verse 3. And listen to this. Behold, the sower went out to sow. And it came about as he was sowing. Some seed fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate it up. Another seed fell on the rocky ground, where it didn't have much soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil. And after the sun had risen, it was scorched, and because it had no root, it withered away. And the other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it and yielded no crop. And other seeds fell into the good soil, and as they grew up and increased, they were yielding a crop and were producing 30, 60, 100-fold. And he was saying, He who has ears, let him hear. that's a way that's how he would have said get it? so get it? and they went no okay so he's got to explain it and what's funny about this I think hilarious is that here's what it says and he was saying he who has ears let him hear get it? and as soon as he was alone his followers along with the twelve asked so it's like they didn't go excuse me Jesus but I don't get this they waited until everybody left and then they sneaked over by him and they said okay now what did that mean? he says okay here it is Sower goes out to sow here's the field here's the road here's the rocks although I'm going to tell you about them in a minute too here's the thorns and this is all good soil. Soil goes out to sow. Now the way they used to sow is they'd have a bag of seeds and they'd just walk down the field and broadcast the seeds like this. So a soil goes out to sow, let's say it starts here, goes down the field, broadcasts the seed like this. And some of the seeds fell on the road, but nothing happened to those. The birds came and ate those up. Now what does that mean? What that means is, as you're sowing, because that's what we're supposed to be doing is sowing, just know that some of the seeds are going to fall on the road, and the ones that fall on the road, don't get too excited about those, okay? Because nothing's going to happen. Plus, don't sow your seeds on roads on purpose, okay? Even a sower knows that, right? So he turns the corner, sows more seeds, and some of them fall in the rocky places. Now, actually, the rocky places, in Minnesota, what the rocks look like is that the ground kind of vibrates them up to the top. So you've got to go pick the rocks out of your field, and then a couple years later you've got to go back and pick more rocks out of the same field. But this wasn't that kind of rock. This was bedrock. This was like the top layer, and then underneath was a shallow layer of soil, and then underneath that was a bedrock, a layer of rock with a little bit of soil on top of it. And so what happens is that the sower sows a bunch of seeds, and some of them fall in the rocky places, and they shoot up right now, you see, because actually because there is not a lot of soil there. So there's only one direction they can go, so it goes up. And when it seeks to put a root down deeper, it can't go any farther, and so the sun scorches it, and it dies. So what you need to know is that as you're sowing, if some of your seeds fall in rocky places, don't get too excited about that. And for Pete's sake, don't throw your seeds on rocks on purpose. Now see, I was taught to sow my seeds on rocky places. I was. I was taught to go to the rockiest places I could find and get it to try to grow stuff. Try to make it receive the seed and grow a bunch of stuff. You can't make rocky places grow seeds. Now see, this soil here, this used to be rocky places. You understand? And then the wind beat it up, and the water and the rain beat it up and turn it into soil, and now it receives. But seeds don't make rocks turn into soil. The elements make rocks turn into soil, and when it does, then it grows good stuff. So then what happens is that they turn a corner and it goes over here, and some fall into thorns. They grow too, but don't get too excited about that because nothing's going to happen, and don't throw them there on purpose. And then everything that falls into good soil grows a bunch of stuff. so if you were a sower in as much as you could tell where are you supposed to throw your seeds? on good soil is it that we're short of good soil? is it that there just aren't enough people around who could receive this and understand this that we've got to go over to the rocky thorny places and try to get them to grow stuff? I know a person who was a missionary in Japan for 20 years and never had any converts never had any results. Get out of Japan. Now, if God tells you to go to Japan, go to Japan. But if you have a sense that God wants you to go someplace but you don't know where, go to Korea. Go to Argentina and Brazil because you know what's cooking there? Lots of really good soil. They got 500,000 person churches there. They got such good soil that there's stuff growing all over the place. And if you do go to Japan because you sense that that is where God wants you to go, and maybe you aren't sowing seeds at all. Maybe you're just the wind and the waves that God is using to beat up the rocks so that later on someone will come and grow some stuff there with their seeds. Don't be naive about what that is then. But in as much as you have a sense that God wants to send you someplace and if you don't know where it is, find out where the good soil is and go there because good soil grows stuff all the time, you know, real easy. Also, I want to say one more thing about this. in this verse 8 it says they were yielding a crop and were producing 30, 60, 100 fold the word producing there is that the soil produces the fruit or the seeds were producing the fruit so the seed is the word of the Lord and it produces the fruit later on when he's explaining this he says the last good ground and those are the ones on whom the seed was sown. The seed is what produces the fruit. And they hear the word and accept it and bear 30, 60, and 100 fold. See, when he switches the metaphor to start talking about the receivers of the word instead of the word, it's the word that produces the fruit. It's the hearers that just bear it. We don't produce the fruit. Do you understand? We just bear it. In John 15 where Jesus says, he who abides in me and in him, and the same bears much fruit. Well, we're the branches, and our job is to hang on to the vine. And when the fruit comes, it's the fruit of The Vine, not the fruit of The Branch. And by hanging on to The Vine, the branches are strong enough to bear the weight of The Fruit that The Vine puts on The Branch. But it't not our job to produce the fruit. It's our jobto hang on to The Vine. It's The Vine's job to produce the fruit. And it's not our job to prune ourselves. It's the Father's job to prune us. That's what the verse says. Yet I went home Sunday after Sunday for most of my Christian life trying to produce fruit and prune myself. You know, all week long going, oh, got to get rid of this, got to get rid of this, cutting stuff off that shouldn't be here and trying to crank out stuff that should be there when John 15 says abide in the vine. And if you abide in the vine, the vine will produce the fruit, you'll be strong enough to bear it and the Father will do the pruning that needs to be done. number five number four speak the truth speaking the truth in love doesn't mean necessarily saying it nicely it might mean saying it nicely but speaking the truth in love simply means without strength in other words if I speak the truth in love to you what I'm doing is I'm saying this, and then I'm done. And you don't have to like it or not like it. You don't have to change. You don't have to not change. You don't have to like me or dislike me. You don't have to receive it or not receive it. Speaking of truth and love means, here, there it is. Now I'm done. And then God causes the growth or whatever he wants to do with that, but I've done what I can do. And in Ephesians 4.25 it says, Therefore, laying aside falsehoods, speak truth to each one of you with his neighbor, for we are members of one another. In other words, don't lie, do tell the truth. And a lot of times, you see, if I say something to you and you don't receive it, like I don't convince you, if I'm not speaking the truth in love, I'll say it again, and I'll say it again, and I'll say it bigger, and I'll say it stronger, and I'll say it this way, because it's my job to get you to change by speaking the truth instead of it's just my job to speak the truth. And see, if I'm speaking the truth in love, I just say it and then I'm done. And I don't have anything more to say. And you can receive it or not receive it, but that's not my issue. So speaking the truth in love. And then the last thing I want to say, number five, is understand false gods. And the big profound thing here about false gods that I want you to understand is that false gods are false. And what that means is that false gods promise, but they don't deliver. And if you can't help someone, if you have someone with a false god in their life, and they don't want to give it up, give it back to them. Because it's possible that the false god itself will teach the person that the false god is false. I have someone come in my office, and they've been using cocaine for 15 years, and their nose is bleeding, and they've got a hole from one side to the next, and they've got heart palpitations, and their roommate's chasing them with a gun, and the cops have a warrant out for them, and they say, what do you think I should do? Well, for starters, stop using cocaine. Now, not because that's the solution, but because if cocaine is the thing they're using to medicate their issues, and they stop using the cocaine, the issues might come to the surface, and I might get a client. So while cocaine is not the solution, I mean, while not using is not the solution, it might be part of the solution. And they say, oh, no, I can't stop using cocaine. Well, cocaine's not the problem. No. All this other stuff is the problem. No, cocaine's no big deal. Well, then keep using cocaine. What? Well, yeah. See, your problem is probably you haven't used enough cocaine. I'll bet if you use cocaine for another 15 years, all this stuff will clear up. What? See, when somebody turns to something to fill them up that actually has the power to fill them up, they don't end up looking like you. Pay attention. Have you looked in a mirror? Go look in a mirror. This is not the result of pursuing a God that has the power to deliver. But if you don't believe that, then you just need to go chase that false God for a while. I have had people in my office slide their chair back like, whoa, yuck. Like, when you hand them their false God on purpose, they go, yeah. Guy comes in my office, he's having his fifth affair. He's living like a secret agent. He's got peptic ulcer and high blood pressure. Oh, Jeff, what should I do? Well, for starters, stop having affairs. See, not because stopping having affairs is the solution, you understand? But if he stops using these women to medicate his issues, his issues might come up to the surface and I'll end up with a client. Oh, no, I can't do this. I can't break off with this woman. Oh, no, this little lady is such a gift to me. God's gift to me, this guy said. She's a gift from the Lord. Oh, yeah, okay. well I know what your issue is your problem is you haven't had enough affairs yeah that's it I think that you should probably have three four more affairs this guy says to me I thought this was Christian counseling I mean the guy's having his fifth affair and all of a sudden he's concerned about Christian things you know it's like he's become the official spokesman of what Christian counseling should be about See, I don't think you've had enough affairs. So if you think that affairs can fix you, you'd be fixed by now, don't you think? You've had five affairs. But if you don't believe that, keep having your affairs. Someone comes in, they've been playing church organ for 20 years. They hate it. They were tired of it 10 years ago. They wanted to quit. They've been doing it for 10 years. They hate it. Plus, they're ticked off at you because you can play the organ and you didn't volunteer. Well, quit playing the organ, I say. Oh, I can't quit playing the organ. If I quit playing the organ, who will play the organ? Like God is some doofus who can't figure out how to get somebody to play the organ. What a puny God who can't figure out how to get somebody to play the organ that he's got to keep somebody who's toasted playing the organ. Well, I know. You should probably just play the organ for another 20 years. Yeah, that's it. Go play the organ for another 20 years. And when you finally burn out, then come back and we'll talk about something else. But if you don't think that's an issue, keep doing it. Now, let me show you the verse that ties this up. Isaiah 57, 10. You were tired out by the length of your road, yet you did not say it is hopeless. You found renewed strength, therefore you did not faint. Now, this is not a compliment. See, a lot of Christians would take this as a compliment. You were tired out, but you didn't give up. No, what a perseverant believer you are. good for you. You were tired out by the length of your road, yet you did not say it is hopeless. You found renewed strength, therefore you did not faint. Of whom were you worried and fearful when you lied and didn't remember me, nor give me a thought? Was I not even silent for a long time, so you do not fear me? In other words, what God is saying is, you were so busy pursuing what you were doing, and you got tired, but you didn't give up, and you were so busy doing this that I left. So I'm over here now, and you were so busy, you didn't even know I was gone. I will declare your righteousness and your deeds. Notice that he doesn't say, I will declare your unrighteousness. See, I will declare your righteousness. I'm going to take your righteousness and put it on a bulletin board. I'll declare your righteousness and your deeds, but they will not profit you. When you cry out, let your collection of idols save you. So when you finally hit the wall, let these women that you've been sleeping with save you. When you finally bottom out, let cocaine save you. When you finally hit the wall, let your playing the church organ save you. But the wind will carry all of them up and the breath will take them away. But he who takes refuge in me shall inherit the land and possess my holy mountain. So the issue is that if you've got someone in your life that you know about that's pursuing false gods and they're not willing to let them go, give them back big. And it's possible that the false god itself will convince the person that the false god is false. And once they know that, see, then they're willing to listen to maybe a story about a real god. Okay. Any questions before we take a break? Yes? Yes? I didn't hear the question. Yeah. Part of it is, part of giving a false god back to someone is simply encouraging them to pay attention to whether or not this is giving them what they think it's going to give them. In other words, if I saw a person in a counseling session that was trying to get their self-esteem from a clean house. I mean, there's people like that, right? I would say, well, you've had a really clean house for 10 years. Did it work yet? And maybe the reason it didn't work is not because you didn't have a clean enough house, but because clean houses aren't powerful enough to do what you're asking them to do. You understand? For someone who's got a preacher as a false god or a religious movement or whatever like that? Well, that's a tough one because the way that Paul does it is he says, you know, when someone says, I'm of Paul or I'm of Apollos, aren't you mere men? In other words, aren't you evaluating things on a purely human level and not on a spiritual level? You're not ascertaining your value based on Jesus. You're getting your value from men. and it doesn't work. So if this person, maybe their false god is a certain religious course of action or whatever, if they've done that for some time, then if it had the power to do what they were asking it to do, perhaps it would have done it by now and they can pay attention to the fact that it hasn't. That works with any false god, do you understand? You have little kids that try to get okay from clothes, so now they've got the clothes are they okay? no well then maybe it's not because they don't have the clothes maybe it's because clothes can't do that so just help people pay attention to those kinds of things that they're asking to give them what they don't have the power to give them and you could pray that you know that somehow God breaks through that and shows a real regular human side of this other person to the person who's getting their sense of identity from them. I mean, I figure if you guys are getting your sense of identity from coming here and listening to me, we probably blew that up last night with the Rice Krispie story, right? Don't get okay from me. If you want to listen to me, that's great, but don't point this is not about Jeff's crowd here. This is about God. And Paul even says in Galatians, if I or an angel from heaven come back and tell you something different than what you heard, run for your life. So is this person who is the person, the minister or whatever, encouraging this? Yeah. Uh-huh. So maybe it's more on the other side that the thing that was the false god is blown up now, and people are so disillusioned about that that they don't want to even try anything anymore like that. Yeah. When a person... Haven't you ever had a false god that you really depended on and when it finally failed you were really depressed or disillusioned or felt chumped? That's the best that it gets with false gods. Thank you.
