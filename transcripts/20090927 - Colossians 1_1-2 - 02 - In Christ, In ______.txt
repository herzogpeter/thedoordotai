Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Lord, I think there's a lot of people in here that want that to be their prayer. The life that I now live, I live in Christ, but there's a lot of other things that compete for that in my life. So, Jesus, give us the gift of seeing you in such a way that you captivate us. That the life that we live, we want to live in you and through you. Amen? Amen. We'll open your Bibles to Colossians chapter 1. Week 2, people. Yeah. Colossians 1, verse 1. We're going to get all the way to verse 2. Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy, our brother, To God's holy people in Colossae, the faithful brothers and sisters in Christ, grace and peace to you from God our Father. In Colossae, there's a lot of things going on in Colossae and the families in Colossae. Parents were dropping their kids off at preschool. Teenagers were getting grounded from using the family chariot. people were getting promotions and people were getting laid off but there was a bigger story in which was supposed to hold all things together in Colossae and that was at least in the first century it meant that you were under the all-pervasive shadow of the Roman Empire the bigger story that was supposed to hold all those things together was the Pax Romana which meant that Rome through the emperor Caesar was bringing worldwide peace to you and your family. The way you would participate in that peace was to pledge your allegiance to Caesar. Because to believe it, to be living in Colossae, at least in the first century, meant that you were pledging your allegiance to Caesar as Lord and Savior. Caesar as the divine Son of God who forgave you, who forgave you of your sins and delivered you into peace. To be in Colossae was to be in Caesar. With all your little stories happening, preschool, getting grounded, getting laid off, the thing that held everything together in Colossae was to be in Caesar. Now, I think it's a powerful thing to be in something. We all have our little stories. These stories shape our character and set the direction of how we behave and how we think. And the biggest ones can even overtake us. So with the help of this whiteboard here and my amazing artistic capabilities, which Dave last night made fun of me of, by the way, which he should have because they're terrible. Nonetheless, we're going after it. Drawing a little picture of a man here. We're going to give him some glasses and some curly hair receding. Little soul patch, all gray. I can't write gray. But this guy here, lots of little stories happened in my life. And one of them was I was a severe stutterer when I was growing up, up until about age 12 or 13. And when I was little, I mean, I could barely get a word out. And that affected my character, how I thought, how people treated me, how I thought people treated me. It was a big deal. And then when I was in seventh grade, my dad got a promotion and transfer, and we went from Southern California to Belgium, which some of you guys might think is exotic. To a seventh grader? That's like getting sent to Hades. okay when you're like some people said well that's Southern California to me okay fair enough fair enough settle down clappers okay well I grew up and then I got married I skipped a lot of things in there but I began to live in the story of marriage, and the first two years of my marriage, when they're supposed to be so golden and beautiful and wonderful, Hades. We fought all the time. We were both depressed. It was hard. Then I became a pastor, which was sometimes Hades, sometimes awesome. And then we started to try to have kids, and a few years into it, we found out that we were struggling with infertility. And we did that for 10 years. Those 10 years, incredibly marking in terms of our character and our behavior, the way we thought about each other, the way we thought about God. All these stories affect who I am and have the power to shape who I am and who I will become. And some of the biggest ones even have the power to get in you and overtake you. And if we had the time for you and the courage for you to share your stories on a whiteboard, some of the words that would be up here would be sexual abuse and divorce on kind of the negative sides. And some of you would have great success stories. CEO, winner of these awards, writer. And all these things have the power to get in you. And when they get in you, they start coming out of you. And the biggest ones have the power to overtake you. So being in something, in a story that affects you and shapes your character, is enormous. And you know that. Well, when Paul wrote this letter to the Colossians, one of the stories he was living in is he was in prison. And we know that from reading the scriptures that he was in prison three times during his life, three different times. And he also lived in constant conflict with people. Maybe that was part of his personality, but also part of the message that he lived out and preached. He was in conflict with Rome. He was in conflict with the religious authorities that didn't like what he was doing. He also lived in the story of pain. We read in 2 Corinthians that he writes about, and we don't know what this is necessarily, but he writes about a thorn in his flesh which tormented him, is what the scriptures say. And he asked God three different times to take it away from him, but God did not. And so he had to live with it. And he called it God's grace to him. It was the way in which he experienced the grace of God. But none of those things, prison, conflict, or pain, was Paul's biggest story. None of those things were Paul's biggest story. Being in Christ was Paul's biggest story. In the epistles, he writes of being in Christ 97 times. it's all over his writings it's who he was it was his story and it was his song so while i was preparing for this message this week i emailed my friend vicki degner if you know vicki i mean she is a deep deep well of wisdom and insight and so i said vicki listen from your perspective paul was in prison he was in pain he was in conflict how was it that he authentically do you think, lived out the story of being in Christ as his biggest story. And so this is what she wrote back. I mean, and this was like, it was like five minutes later she wrote this back. So it wasn't like she crafted it, and this was just what was in her. And I want to read it to you. Paul's awareness of Christ in him was so vivid that Christ in him set the tone for his writings, his prayers, his greetings, his closings, his stay in prison, and his concern for those around him. He was in captivity and he was in conflict almost continuously, yet his awareness of Christ in him, his adoption as Christ's own, and his encounter with Christ would drop him to his knees. Those other things he was in, in prison, in pain, in conflict, didn't overtake him. The living Christ did. Those other things that he was in, these things for Paul, didn't overtake him. The living Christ did because Paul, for Paul, there was a bigger story that could hold all these things together. And that bigger story for Paul was that he was in Christ. so he could be in prison he was in prison in christ he could be in pain he was in pain in christ he could be in conflict almost continuously and he was in conflict in christ and so this is what began to got to get into paul this reality of being in christ so much so that it characterized his character and it set the direction for his behavior and it is what came out of him. And we read about it 2,000 years later. Paul found his biggest story to be in Christ. He writes about this reality in Philippians 4, verses 12 and 13. He goes, I know what it is. to be in need. And I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well-fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. And then here's the verse that everybody knows, right? Philippians 4.13. Let's claim it. Did I write sarcasm up there on mine? Because I can do all of this or all things through Christ who gives me strength. Now, you heard some of the sarcasm come out, but that's because I've heard this verse quoted so many times and misquoted so many times that my eyebrow kind of raises every time I hear someone talk about that verse. I think I have a healthy amount of skepticism when I hear someone say, I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength. I can throw a no-hitter this Friday night through Christ who gives me strength. I can get five sacks tonight and the Vikings will win today through Christ who gives them strength, right? And there's just a part of me that says, really? You can do everything then. Then why do you need God? So what Paul's saying here, I think, is this. If he was up here talking to us, if I could interview him, he would say, listen, listen, listen. Here's how I can say that. I can do all things through Christ's existence. It's not a Hallmark card or a thing to put up in a locker room. I can say that because I know what it's like to be hungry, you guys. I know what it's like to go days without eating. And I know what it's like to not just have what I want, but I know what it's like to not have what I need. And after doing those things, you know what I found out? I found out I could do it. Because there's a bigger story that's holding me together than being well-fed or having what I need. I can do hunger. I can do having, not having what I need because I do it in Christ. Now, I think there are some of us, and we never say this out loud, but I think there are some of us that think being in Christ would mean that we would never go without our next meal or that we wouldn't ever have to struggle through things like infertility or divorce. And when Mary and I were struggling through this infertility, again, for about 10 years, and all the craziness that accompanied that, all the tests and the weird conversations that people would have. How come you guys aren't having kids? You know how that works, right? Oh, I mean, all this stuff. People, it's amazing what people would say. And when we were going through it, most of the time, in fact, almost all the time, we just wanted that to go away. We wanted infertility to go away. And that's how we would pray. And it's okay, it's okay to pray for a baby. That's what we did. We prayed for a baby. But we also started asking the why God questions. Like when things got raw and when our politeness would leave our faces, we would say things like, why are you doing this to us, God? Because we would see some 18-year-old that was a student in our student ministry get pregnant, and they didn't even want the baby. And we would be like, oh man. We would just get angry. It didn't seem fair. But I'll tell you this, honestly, with all the pain and anger and confusion that characterized that whole time for us, even before we had Isaac, we learned something. This is real for us. We learned that we could do that in fertility because there was something bigger that was holding us together. We learned about how much God intimately cared for us during that time. Sometimes through little words we would get, sometimes through people. In our anguish and pain, we experienced a God who was intimately with us and holding us together without any promise that infertility would ever go away. We learned that we could do infertility through Christ who gave us strength. As hard as it was, and as much as it characterized our story, and still does, it didn't have the power to take us out. Because being in Christ doesn't mean that your problems will go away or that your pain won't be painful anymore. It means that whatever it is that you are in currently does not have the power to take you out. Being in Christ means that even in those things, you have something bigger that holds you together when everything else is falling apart. It's happened to Paul more times than one. He writes this very raw passage in 2 Corinthians 4, starting verse 8. He writes this, We are hard-pressed on every side, but not crushed. Perplexed, but not in despair. Persecuted, but not abandoned. struck down but not destroyed. And then verse 10, we always, this is so interesting, and it doesn't show up on any Christian bumper sticker that I've ever seen. We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus. We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, the suffering of Jesus, so that his life may be also revealed in our mortal body. weird Paul had this story that he was living in being in Christ meant that even though he was hard pressed on every side and life was very difficult there was something bigger that was holding him together he was in Christ so he could do in pain in Christ in prison in Christ, in conflict in Christ but it's not just the painful stories that we find ourselves in that can shape us and shape our character and be our biggest story sometimes the things in which we experience success can identify us and shape our character in ways that are pretty radical. We can begin to grow confident in things that are here today but may be gone tomorrow. With painful things, you pray for them to go away. But with these success stories, these positive things, you're praying that they never go away. And Paul had something to say about this as well. in Philippians 3, verse 7. He writes, But whatever were gains to me, these successes, whatever were successes to me, I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. And then it's like he's just writing extemporaneously here. What is more? You know what? I got a little more to say on this. I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage that I may gain Christ and be found in him. I consider them garbage. Now the gains that he was talking about in verse 7, if you want to read it yourselves in Philippians 3 verses 1 through 6, are what he calls his confidences in the flesh. He was a Pharisee and he was the best of the best. He was circumcised on the eighth day. He was of the tribe of Benjamin. He was faultless in terms of following the law. These are the things that were on the top of his resume and it would have gotten him any job in any place in the world. He was the best of the best. But now he considers them all garbage. All the successes of his life, his badges of honor that he would wear around, that he used to wear around, he says, garbage. I found a bigger and more powerful story in which all those things pale in comparison to gain Christ and be found in him. And when the translators translated the word garbage, they were being really super polite. The Greek word translated as garbage is skubalon, one of my favorite words in the Greek. Skubalon. Because it means excrement. You got... Let me explain why it's my favorite word, okay? See, Paul is using a very vivid and colorful language here that would have made junior hires giggle like me. But it would have made the grandmothers blush because Paul is saying that everything that used to be his biggest story, his badge of honor, the top line of his resume is now scuba on it. It used to be in him and characterizing him, but it has gone out of him, and it is now laying on a pile on the floor. That's what he thinks of it. His biggest success stories that used to characterize his identity is that on the floor compared to the all-surpassing greatness of gaining Jesus and being found in him. And Paul's letter to the Colossians is all about telling them that even though they're putting their little kids on the bus in preschool and grounding their teenagers from taking the chariot and getting laid off and having fights and getting divorces and people are dying. He's saying, the biggest story in your life, newsflash, it's not Caesar. Pax Romana, scubalon. He's saying there is a bigger story in which you can be found and it's the story of being in Christ. I want you to listen to how Paul applies the story of Jesus to them as if it was their story. This is radical what Paul does in Colossians. But he's saying that your stories are no longer even fully your stories. They're not even the truest thing about you anymore. The truest thing about you is that you've been adopted into the story of Jesus. So I'm going to race through these verses. They're not going to come up on the screens. But Paul associates our story with five huge milestones in the life of Jesus. Paul writes to the Colossians that they've been adopted into them. In Colossians 3, you might want to write these down and look them up later, but in Colossians 3.3, Paul writes that they have died with Christ. In Colossians 2.12, they're buried with Christ. In 2.12 and 3.1, they're raised with Christ. In 3.1, they're seated at the right hand of God with Christ. And in 3.4, they are revealed with Him in His coming. That's a pretty big story. Amen? Maybe the biggest. And that's the story that you are being adopted into. So grace and peace to you, Colossians, because there's a bigger story. Death, burial, resurrection, ascension, and second coming. The story of Jesus is now our story, Paul writes. And the writers of this book called Colossians Remix that I referenced last week, they write about the significance of this way, and I quote, Paul tells us that Christian identity and behavior are rooted in our identification with and participation in these events. The death, burial, resurrection, ascension, and second coming. The story of Jesus is our story. This is the story that shapes our character and sets the direction of our behavior. So question, how does that work really? Like beyond the sermons and the great sounding nature of that story? How does it work? How do you even begin to adopt the story of Jesus so that it shapes your character and sets the direction for your behavior? And the reason why I ask is because I constantly find myself lost in my smaller stories. You know, the other night, I think it was Tuesday night after a long day of work, I came home, and it was just, it was just normal life, right, at my house. Chaos! And, you know, my wife Mary stays at home with the kids. She works full-time at home, And so whatever organization, Saints People, I'm submitting her name, okay, for sainthood. She's amazing. You know, I sound like kind of a broken record on this, but the chaos that accompanies three kids, two and under, is oftentimes my biggest story right now. So on this night, I got really mad at Isaac because he's acting like a two-year-old. Now you laugh because, you know, he is a two-year-old. The problem became was when I started to act like a two-year-old. Okay? Amen. We're preaching now. Well, I had a dish towel in my hand, and when he did this thing that made me bad, I found myself instinctively balling up that dish towel and reaching my arm back. And luckily, I did not throw it in his face. But that is what I wanted to do. So on those nights, and I remember we put the kids to bed, you know, Mary saw it, you know, and I said, honey, I lost it kind of there. She goes, I know. That's not what I want to do. But on those nights when I'm lost and I'm living in a small store, I need something in me that's bigger than self-control or wise decision-making or even my desire to be like Jesus in all things. I need something bigger than my want to. And this, you guys, is when it gets even better because it turns out that it's not just me in Christ or me with Christ. It's Christ in me. Because when the story of Jesus becomes my biggest story, it starts to get in me. In Colossians 1.27, Paul writes these mysterious words. to them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is this, Christ in you, our hope of glory. This is a weird and radical concept if you can get your minds around it because all throughout the Hebrew scriptures we read about God with people. God with Abraham, God with Isaac, God with Jacob, God with Moses, God with King David, God with the prophets, God was with us through the cloud by day and the fire by night, but now it's no longer simply God with us. Because of the death, burial, resurrection, ascension, and promised second coming of Jesus, He has sent His Spirit, and Christ, the creator of the universe, the image of the invisible God, the one in whom all things hold together, that Christ is in us. That's a bigger story. that is a bigger story in which to live no matter what pain you are going through in johnny we read about jesus and this woman caught in adultery you've heard this story maybe many times and these religious leaders who catch her we don't know how that works and how does that work how do they catch her were they there do they hear about it but anyway they bring her to jesus and they knew that according to the jewish law she was to be stoned because she was caught in adultery. And so they bring her to Jesus. And the reason why they bring her to Jesus is because they know he's going to say something different. He's going to throw a curveball into the law. And as a side note, you got to love that about Jesus. That the religious leaders would take this person to him because they know he's going to do something different. They were trying to catch him. So he does something different. He gives them permission. He says, you know what? Fire away. but hold on, before you do that let the one who's without sin throw the first stone and you know it's not just the woman who should have been there being condemned so these religious leaders drop their stones and walk away and then Jesus, he was writing something on the ground his grocery list or something like that, waiting for them to get it he looks at the woman straight in the eyes and says, woman has, where are they? Have they left? Has no one condemned you? She says this sentence, first time she could ever say it in her whole life. No one, sir, has condemned me. Then I don't condemn you either. Go now and sin no more. because Jesus lived in the bigger story of God's redemption. Remember, Jesus said, I am in the Father and the Father is in me. He could say to her this, the story of the law has condemned you and sentenced you to death, but in my story, God has condemned sin and you are free to go. What do you think her story was? I guarantee you it was condemnation. now if she were to let this redemption story in really in what do you think would start to emanate out of her and when when jesus says go and sin no more i mean sometimes we're either like yeah but he you know he tells her go and sin no more i think if that message of redemption got in her no one would have to tell her that you know i mean she wouldn't have to oh yeah she would start living it out. Because she would start to realize that she was living in a bigger story of Christ in her. And some of you are living in the story of condemnation right now and it's killing you. You went back to pornography even though you promised your wife that you wouldn't. You had sex with that person again even though you promised each other and yourself that you wouldn't. you fell off the wagon even though you promised your sponsor that you wouldn't you worked late again even though you promised your husband you wouldn't some of you can't even lift your head up because of the weight of shame because the condemnation has gotten in to you so what if you could let this story in Jesus the creator of the universe, the one who holds all things together, the image of the invisible God looking you right in the eyes and adopting you into his story, he says this, in me God has condemned sin and you are free. There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ. we just have to believe that one of our mentors with this next gen thing which has taken off in a really cool way is this great guy named Mike and Mike's had a pretty hard life lots of condemnation it was in him big time but these days he's kind of living in this story of Jesus and the reason why I know that is because it's coming out of him and we got an email from this mom that said her son was really hesitant about coming on Wednesday night because frankly he didn't know whether he would be accepted. And so, you know, he went and, you know, the mom, you know, if you're a mom, you know how this goes. It's like, oh, please, God. Well, when she picked him up, the first words out of his mouth were these words, I'm in. She said, really? Thank you, God. Why? this kid said because I met Mike I mean that is unbelievable that someone's presence would change someone else's story I met Mike means I got accepted I got accepted I never get accepted Jesus said this in John 8 verse 34 amazing words very truly I tell you everyone who sins is a slave to sin now we all know this a slave has no permanent place in the family but a son belongs to it forever so if the son sets you free you'll be free indeed. So what's your biggest story that you're living in? Maybe it's a painful thing like adultery or pain or conflict or debt or stress or maybe it's even a sort of thing you're putting confidence in. A promotion, a job, some recognition. What if you could honestly say those things aren't my biggest story. I'm going to live in them. In pain, in Christ. in debt, in conflict, even in success. I'm going to live those things in Christ. And it doesn't deny the reality of your other stories and the consequences and the pain associated with it. You're going to be hard-pressed on every side. But if you live with the truest and biggest thing about you, meaning that you are in Christ, and because of that there is therefore now no condemnation, the story of Jesus would begin to get in you. and come out of you. Now, I don't know of any other way to start this process other than you have to identify the primary story that you're living in. It might be condemnation. It might be success. It might be pain. It might be debt. It might be divorce, adultery, cheating, whatever. You would need to say it out loud. This is my story. It's debt. so we're going to close with an experience Stephan's going to sing the song that he sang during the offering I live in Christ and during that song I want you to write the phrase in Christ in blank and then just write whatever it is that you're in right now and if you don't have a piece of paper or a pen just think the phrase in your mind in Christ in blank and when you write that word down when you write it down and you feel the feelings associated with it, you look to the left. Because to the left is the bigger story that you are in as a child of God, that you've been adopted into as an heir with Christ to the glorious riches of God. Because you really are in Christ. which is the biggest story imaginable and it has the power to overtake you and set you free from the smallest story. So as Stephan sings, just have some time with God. We want to create space for you and time for you. And then when the song's over, I'll come back up. Let's pray. Jesus, we need courage to be honest about the stories in which we're living. And then we need power for you to come in and announce to us our freedom. To convince us that the story that you live in is really the biggest story there is and that we can live in it. So Holy Spirit of God, we pray that you would come. It was prophesied The dead returned to life The deaf will hear and the blind have sighed And so it came to be when I fell to my knees The Son of God took pity on me The life that I now live I live and cry The life that I now live I live in Christ I'm sad of Him I'm blameless without sin The Lamb of God who makes us right again And so I count the cost And everything is lost I fix my eyes And pick up my cross The life that I now live I live in Christ The life that I now live I live in Christ And death has no hold on me Of whom the Son has free Is free and dear Death has no hold on me Of whom the Son has free Is free and dear And only through His sacrifice Are we truly made alive? The life that I now live I live in Christ The life that I now live I live in Christ This is my song This is my story This Is My Hope The Hope of Glory This Is My Song This Is My Story He Is My Hope The Hope of Glory I live in Christ The life that I now live I live in Christ I'd like to read a benediction over you. It's a gift for you. These are the words of Vicki Degner. who wrote about the Apostle Paul that I changed the words to write about you. So I want to ask you to stand and receive this benediction. And some of you might want to just put out your hands if you are aware of a need that you have. may your awareness of Christ in you be so vivid that Christ in you begins to set the tone for your work your prayers, your greetings, your goodbyes your success and your failures and your concern for those around you in your captivity and in your conflict may your awareness of Christ in you your adoption as Christ's own and your encounter with Christ drop you to your knees. May those other things that you are in not overtake you. May it be the living Christ who overtakes you. Amen. Amen. you
