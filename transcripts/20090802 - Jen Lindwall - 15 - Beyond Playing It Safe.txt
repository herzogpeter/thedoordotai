Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. My name is Jen Linwall. I'm on staff here as the Metro Impact Pastor. I also get to speak up here every few months or so. It's great to be with you all today. Last week, Dave told us a parable about a shrewd manager who he said Jesus was affirming for the unconventional and what a lot of people thought was dishonest way that he dealt with his master's resources. Dave told us that Jesus was actually calling attention to the way this manager went outside of the box, blowing past responsibility and duty to leverage the resources that he had available to him in a creative, dynamic way. And then Dave challenged us to think about how we could go beyond being just nice and polite and rule-following people to those who use the resources of our lives, be it money, relationship, passion, time, in creative, dynamic, unconventional, kingdom-impacting ways. And as I listened to his message, I have to admit, I got pretty excited. It sounded really adventurous, maybe even a bit dangerous, which is how I like to picture myself anyway. And so I romanticized it a little bit, thinking about myself sort of oozing with this creative energy, you know, this overflowing sense of all the things I could do, moving freely in my messy home because I was so preoccupied with all the interesting things going on in my life. But this image broke down, of course, when I started to think about my actual life and my actual self, because as exciting and adventurous as this may have sounded, I'm an oldest child. I happen to be quite attached to responsibility and reliability, to following through on my commitments to fulfilling the expectations put before me by other people. And if I follow the train of thought that Dave laid out, it leads to this place that's a little bit reckless. maybe even a little risky. And I only want to go outside of the box if I'm sure that I can maintain my commitments, that I can fulfill the expectations, that I can be responsible. And so my question for Dave is, could I just get risky every once in a while, but play it safe the rest of the time? I was remembering this class that I co-taught in women's ministry a couple years ago, and a woman did a presentation on people who hold signs on street corners, saying that she really admired these people, that she was really drawn to them, because their desperation and call for help was right out there. She saw this reckless abandonment in their need as their greatest need was literally written on a sign for thousands of people passing by to see. And then she gave us each a piece of cardboard and a marker and invited us all to write our greatest need, our deepest sense of desperation on it, and to walk around the room in silence and look at each other's pieces of cardboard. And I remember sitting there with my marker and my cardboard with this thought, what could I write that would seem like I was being vulnerable and open without actually doing that? I was racking my brain for this way to seem like I had it mostly together, but then I had some sort of deep need that showed how self-aware I was. I wanted to seem risky without actually being risky. For a lot of us, blowing past expectation and duty might sound good in concept, but we're just not those kind of people. And if not us, then my question is who? What kind of people can blow past just following the rules, just being responsible, and let themselves go out of the box to leverage what they have creatively and dynamically? And that's what we're going to talk about this morning. Pray with me as we get started. God, we believe you're calling us to something in terms of how we use what we have that might be out of the box for us. And so give us the eyes to see, the ears to hear, the courage to think about what that would look like in each of our lives. Pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, there's a story found in Luke 21 one that I think gives us a great picture of the contrast between those who follow the rules and those who give and blow right past that. Jesus is speaking to a crowd in the temple. At the front of this temple was a trumpet-shaped box into which people would put their offering into. Each worshiper would come to the front, and it was required that they put their tithe in. Jesus sees the people coming and putting their gifts into this treasury, and he stops and asks the crowd listening to turn their attention to what's happening. You can follow along with me in Luke 21. We're going to start in verse 1. Jesus has just been condemning the Pharisees for the ways in which their temple system was oppressing the poor, specifically the widow. And then he starts to just give this kind of running commentary on the very temple system that they've designed, playing out before their eyes. The Pharisees and the scribes were seen as the responsible, dutiful, rule-following religious folks of the day. I picture them sort of going throughout their days methodically, rhythmically, intentionally, designing a temple system that would keep things neat, keep it clean, follow the rules, and I think the rich entering the temple get that. Let's do this the right way. Let's follow the law that God has given us in the way that we give our gifts. But right before this passage in Luke 21, at the end of Luke 20, Jesus actually says that these Pharisees and scribes will receive greater condemnation for all the things they're doing, their long prayers, their flowing robes, their important seats in the synagogue. And I kind of wonder if Jesus' harsh words and then the story of the widow were a little bit confusing to them. Now they would receive greater condemnation, but this widow who donated two lepta, which was the smallest coin in use at the time, was a hero. It would have taken 128 lepta to make up one day's wage. But she gave more than all of them combined. How could that be? let's read this one more time together Luke 21 verse 1 as Jesus looked up he saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury he also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins truly I tell you he said this poor widow has put in more than all the others all these people gave their gifts out of wealth but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on the rich gave responsibly and adequately regularly and with great commitment but they were so blinded by this commitment that they did not see the oppression happening right in front of them and this widow blew past them in their gift giving because she gave more than all of them combined, she gave the one thing they did not give, everything. She gave everything she had to live on. She gave it all. Could it be that the person who blows past just following the rules and being responsible and playing it safe is simply the one who gives it all? The one thing the widow gave that no one else did was everything she had to live on. Jesus chooses an interesting contrast of words here. When talking about the rich, he says that they put in their gifts. I wonder if that's how they saw it themselves, because a gift is generally something that you give to someone else. And so they walk up to the front of the church, maybe smiling to the heavens, thinking, I am giving part of what I have to the work of God. But the widow didn't give a gift. She didn't have a gift to give. All she had was everything. Everything, a fraction of a penny, which Jesus knows won't complete any temple repairs. And right after this passage, Jesus actually tells his disciple this entire temple will be destroyed. I think Jesus is talking more about money here. Because a fraction of a penny is not much. I think he is praising the reckless abandonment. that this widow displayed when that small plank-plank of her two coins echoed throughout that temple, because it was everything that she had. A few questions come to mind when I read this, the first of which is this. What does it mean to give everything you have to live on? To give it all? Because to me it sounds like some sort of worship song that I've been singing my whole life, and I actually have no idea what it means. Lord, I give you my all, but what my all is, I don't really know. you know I think back to the invitation that I had to write my greatest need on a piece of cardboard and I think that was an invitation to give an offering a small one and so I walked up to the front of the church in front of that treasury and I was faced with the decision to play it safe and follow the rules or to throw it all in and I chose to play it safe I did what was expected of me. I followed the rules, but I didn't give it all. Putting my great just fear out there would have been something that I don't think I could have done. I mean, I can't really afford to be doing things like that, especially at a place that I work or at a ministry that I'm trying to lead in. That has to be understandable. What if giving your all means parting with that thing that you don't think you can survive without. For me, at that time, that thing I couldn't survive without was the image I really wanted people to have of me. And if I had gone there, I would know it, because it would have felt like someone was prying something from my white-knuckled grip. I was chatting with a woman from our congregation recently, and she was telling me that her family loves to do things to serve people. They've done a lot of service projects, they've done work with the homeless, they've been in relationship with a lot of different kinds of people. Lately, her passion for serving has opened her eyes to the need in her own community, specifically to a woman who's the mother of her son's friend and is a drug addict. And as a result of this addiction, she has great need. She has no teeth, she's socially awkward, she is a mess, and the people in this community who know her know that. She sounds like the kind of person who, if you're seen talking to her in the grocery store, people start to talk about you. So in a community where it seems easy, even natural, to talk about helping the poor in the city, this woman is being faced with a big question about how she really gives her all in serving people that she sees who have needs. And in the process, maybe having to give up things that it doesn't seem like she can survive without. Our all, or as the Dictionary defines it, the whole of us is not the same. But each day, numerous times a day, whether we're a stay-at-home parent, an executive, a teacher, a spouse, a friend, a daughter, a son, we're invited to walk up to the front of the church and give an offering and make a choice. And most of the time, I think we choose to play it safe. We do that thing that doesn't break the rules but doesn't put us at too much risk. Think about the last time you had an argument with your spouse if you're married. And they did that thing they shouldn't have. And you pick them apart by passive-aggressively suggesting that they never get it right. You were playing by the rules. They did leave their stuff all over the house, or they didn't do the thing they said they'd do. And they always do that. But I bet there was this moment, Because there usually is, for me, when something wells up inside of you, and you consider telling them that you're just really tired and overwhelmed, and you're not sure if you have what it takes to be a parent or do your job, and you really just need someone to listen to you. But that would have made you just a little too vulnerable. And that's not something you can afford to give when you're trying to win an argument. And so you played it safe, and you walked away. There have been other times for us all, whether by choice or by force, we've had to put it all in. And that thing that you didn't think you could live without, be it financial security, a dream you had for your life, your image was taken away from you, and it made you feel afraid and doubtful, like something was being ripped from your white-knuckled grip. But you gave it all that time, and in doing so, you went past just rule following and duty and responsibility, and most likely your eyes were opened to an entirely different world of possibilities and choices and outcomes for your life. If this is true, if the kind of people who can go past just being responsible, dutiful, rule following folks are those who give everything that they have, it leads me to another question which is what kind of people do that because when I think about the widow it doesn't seem like she had that image of sort of holding it all in it seemed like she just walked up and put it right in without so much as a wince I imagine there had to have been a day when it wasn't so easy when she felt like she would die without those two coins when she was sure she would not survive if she had to give them over so what happened to make her the person who walked up and put it all in? It makes me think about Paul who says in Philippians 4.11 I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need and I know what it is to have plenty. I've learned the secret of being content in any and every situation whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. To which I say, you've got to be kidding me. I mean, how would a person even do that? I think about Paul being knocked onto the ground and going blind and all the times when he must have felt like he was losing everything. I wonder if somewhere along the way, the widow and Paul just quit being afraid of their own poverty. And what if the person who can give it all is the person who is not running away from the poverty inside of them? we don't like to admit it but there is poverty inside all of us sometimes material, relational, emotional, spiritual we like to think that if we have enough stuff or we have enough ways to make ourselves look good that no one will really know about the poor places that are deep inside of us I was talking with a guy who grew up in inner city Chicago and he ended up living with a family in suburban twin cities and he said the first day everything looked so pristine and great and it was just a bunch of people walking their dogs around neighborhoods but it took him no time at all to see that things out here were just as messed up as where he came from. He said people just screamed at their kids with the doors closed or they just didn't talk about how their 15 year old might be pregnant or how they felt so severely depressed. He said it was so obvious that there was poverty everywhere, it just looked a little bit different. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 12, 9, I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. I know I have poverty. I know it is inside of me, and I will not run away from it. I will run towards it. In case it wasn't super obvious, Ben and I are having another baby. I'm sure some of you were awkwardly wondering that. In November. Thank you. And a few weeks ago, a friend asked me, you know, how are you feeling about having a second child? And I said, you know, honestly, I'm excited, but I'm kind of freaked out by it. and she asked why and I told her the dynamic of just adding another kid and having two little kids running around and trying to be a mother to both of them and trying to, you know, work at Open Door and be a wife and a daughter and a friend seems like it could create sort of the perfect storm for me to have some sort of meltdown or something, you know? Some sort of crisis and totally lose it. And then she asked the next question which was, well, why does that scare you? You've got to love having friends that ask you things like that, don't you? And I had to think about that for a couple days and think about it kind of seriously. Why does that really scare me? And it came to me. It's because then everyone would know that I don't really have it all together. You know, all this striving and trying and proving and nurturing and all these things I'm doing are really just an act to cover up what's really inside me. The mess that lies beneath the surface, who I really am. And I'm afraid and ashamed of what's in there. And so even though I know it's there deep down, I'm going to do everything I can to manage it so that everyone around me might just think it doesn't exist. The widow had no choice but to move towards her poverty. Not only had she endured the loss of her husband, but that had left her with the title of widow, which put her at the bottom of the social hierarchy. She had no income. She had nothing. It served as a constant reminder to her and everyone else that she was destitute and in need. But Jesus praises her offering precisely because of where it came from, not what it amounted to. The natural result of going to those uncomfortable places of abandoning ourselves, of writing the hard thing on the cardboard sign, or befriending your drug-addicted neighbor, is that it forces us to see our own poverty. And as difficult as that is, it's only when we know the depth of our strength and the depths of our poverty that we even understand what our all is. And only when we understand that can we really give from that place. Henry Nowen, a brilliant man, has impacted a lot of people here. He's an author, a teacher, he has a doctorate in psychology, and he was a professor at the universities of Notre Dame, Yale, and Harvard. And though he was a brilliant and successful man and professor, at that time his friends knew him to be troubled and lonely and depressed and restless. And so in an effort to deal with this feeling of emptiness, To answer some of this stuff bubbling up in him, he made a change. He decided to quit his job as a professor and go and live with mentally handicapped adults at the L'Arche community in Toronto, Canada. Let me say that again. He quit his job as a professor at Harvard to go and eat and sleep with people who lived in a home for adults with severe mental and physical disabilities. With the daily task of doing things for them that they couldn't do for themselves, like dressing and bathing and shaving them. Somehow, when Henry looked at the resources of his life, a PhD, a brilliant mind, he decided they would be best spent not as a professor, but dressing and bathing adults who would never utter one word to this world. The adults that Henry would later call his greatest teachers and inspiration, the ones who showed him more about God and love and mercy and forgiveness and grace than anyone else in his life. What allowed Henry to do that? I think beyond not running from his own poverty, Henry was not afraid of the poverty in other people. To give our all requires us to come to grips with the poverty inside us, but it also requires us to come to grips with the poverty in each other. Some people in our midst don't have the luxury of hiding their poverty because their need requires them to stand on a street corner with a sign or they have a disability that they cannot hide. And we talk a lot about learning from people on the margins of society around here because we can learn to come to grips with our poverty from people who have been forced to come to grips with theirs. Jean Vanier in his book Becoming Human says, We're frightened of the ugly, the dirty. We want to turn away from anything that reveals the failure, pain, sickness, and death beneath the brightly painted surface of our ordered life. Could this be the reason that Jesus keeps calling his followers back to the poor and the downtrodden and the outcast, and in the case of this story, to the widow? My next-door neighbor, Gary, is a really interesting guy. He wanders around from pretty much March to November with no shirt on, which is great. And he has a gorgeous backyard, which he waters like three hours a day. He also happens to be really cranky most of the time. He's been a fixture on our block for 20 years, in which time he has managed to get into it with almost everyone. And I'm talking like throw down fights in the street, lawsuits, restraining orders. Totally crazy. We like to refer to him as the grumpy version of Wilson Because there's a fence between our yards that we never cross And you only can see part of his face when he talks through it And he loves to talk through the fence Usually giving neighborhood gossip or complaining about someone's loud music or long grass Sometimes he talks about himself And in that time I've learned some things about him He's a vet, a recovering alcoholic, divorced has a sister who committed suicide, is estranged from his kids, thinks he has grandkids, the oldest of which might be 10, but he doesn't know because he's never met them and hasn't talked to his kids in a long time. So on top of being cranky and socially awkward and chatty, it appears that Gary is relationally and socially bankrupt. Interestingly, one of Gary's favorite things to do is buy my family gifts. Ranging from the strange, like a female razor for me and swim trunks for Ben. For real. Should have brought him in. To a life-size teddy bear for Esme that she loves. And the first new outfit for our baby. And I've noticed that I actually have no idea what to do when he gives us these gifts. Which he does pretty frequently. I'd like to tell you that I think it's sweet and that I receive it with open arms and I'm so glad, but most of the time I find myself just kind of annoyed and agitated and uncomfortable. I sort of wish that he wouldn't do this. But sometimes I actually think maybe we should start having loud parties or something so he doesn't like us. And then I don't have to wonder what to do with this sort of way that he's trying to connect to us. Because if he can't interact like a more normal person who's going to have us over for dinner and ask me questions about my job and my family, then I don't really know what to do with him. And I'm afraid that if I move towards those areas of poverty in Gary, I'm going to end up in some situation where I don't know what to do or taking some sort of risk that I'm not comfortable taking. And I'd prefer to not do that. I wonder if what allowed the Pharisees to create a system that was so oppressive and horrible for the poor in their day is that they wouldn't let themselves see the poverty in the people around them, in people like the widow. They literally blocked it out. So they wouldn't have to wonder what it would require of them, what they'd have to sacrifice or give, or how they'd have to change if they knew. That's why I fight to stay away from the poverty in Gary, or the people in my family or my community, or the homeless in our city, or the hungry halfway around the world. Because I just can't reconcile all the things together. And if we allow ourselves, if I allow myself to see that poverty, to go towards it, I might actually have to do something. I might have to change. Jean Vanier also says to give food to a beggar who knocks on the door once can be quite easy. But if he keeps coming back with his friends, then what do we do? We're at a sea with no horizon. in an unknown territory without a map. The Pharisees seemed to be looking at Jesus, and I wonder if they were thinking, if we gave like this widow, do you have any idea where that would leave us? What a mess we would be in. What a mess our whole society would be in. We can't redo the entire temple system just because it's not working for a couple people. Just because it's not working for the widow, it's our life, it's our worship. We cannot live without it because it's all we have. Paul says something really amazing, writing to the Corinthians in 2 Corinthians 8, verse 12. He says, For if there's willingness there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have. Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard-pressed, but that there would be equality. At the present time, your plenty will supply what they need, so in turn, their plenty will supply what you need. The goal is equality. And I love that picture of others' plenty supplying my need and my plenty supplying their need, whatever that plenty or need looks like. Again, whether it's relational, material, emotional, spiritual. Because we are talking about more than just money here. Still, ignorance can be bliss. Because the farther we go down the road towards our poverty, then we see it in others. Or maybe it's the other way around, we see it in them, and then we see it in us. And it makes us ask really difficult questions. Like, what if there isn't enough left over? What if I get tired? What if I want out? What if things don't all turn out the way that they're supposed to in my life? The amazing thing is that in Jesus' praise of the widow, he does much more than affirm her offering. He tells us something about himself, about who he is and what he wants. He wants it all. Which means that when we give everything that we have to live on, and it makes us ask those really difficult questions, Jesus is right there in that place of desperation and need. He doesn't just accept her two coins with a grudge. He takes them with open arms because it's what he wanted all along. Everything. And I think he's aware of what it'll cost us when we give over the good and the bad. the wealth, the poverty, the desperation, the expectation, the brokenness, everything we have to live on, the whole of me, the whole of you. But Jesus is present in those places of suffering and confusion and desperation, of reckless abandonment in a greater way than anywhere else, which is precisely why the widow was praised for her offering, because I think Jesus knew that only in that place would she and would we come to trust and rely and depend more on him. Let's go to the table together. Thank you.
