We've been referring to it these last four weeks as a journey of the heart. A journey, I think, makes it sound a little easier than it actually is. A journey, a stroll through the park is a journey. I don't think this journey of the heart is a stroll through the park. More like a battle for the heart, this journey of the heart. Because that's true, I believe it to be true. I see this communion service on this particular weekend as we gather around the table as a kind of rest stop for this journey of the heart that is, in fact, a battle for the heart. I see it as an opportunity to maybe get our bearings just a little bit, to maybe get some nourishment for the journey, which is something you might do at a rest stop if you were on a journey. It occurs to me, however, that the only way this analogy of communion as kind of a rest stop in the middle of the journey makes any sense is if you're actually on this journey with us. So let me remind you of where we are on this journey of the heart that I think is a battle for the heart. And why if you are where we are on this journey, you may just need a rest stop. If you are where we are on this journey, you might right now, this weekend, as we come to the table, need a reminder of who you are and whose you are and what's at stake in this journey for the heart. you may need more than a reminder. You may need an encounter this morning with the God of your heart, with the God who sent his son to rescue your heart. See, last week, using the story of David and Goliath that we found in 1 Samuel 17 as our point of reference, the primary principle that we dealt with was this, that you can't deal with the Goliaths of your life by avoiding them. Goliaths, those nine foot nine bigger than life problems that you're not in denial about. You know it's there. You see it every day. It taunts you all day long, but you're hoping it will stay over there. The principle, the thing we gleaned after two weeks of seeing David and Goliath in the armies of Israel was this. You cannot deal with the Goliaths of your life by avoiding them somewhere along the line, you have to go toward them. But you learn how to do that, move toward the Goliaths of your life. We learned last week by, first of all, facing your lions and your bears all along the way. We said it this way, that bold hearts, the kind that was embodied in David in 1 Samuel 17, the kind of heart that isn't intimidated by the Goliaths of life, but instinctively moves toward them. Those kinds of hearts are formed in the everyday crisis moments of everyday life. And lions and bears are part of everyday life. We drew that from verse 34, 1 Samuel 17. Remember verse 34? David had seen and heard Goliath when he showed up, the taunting that he had been delivering to the armies of Israel. He was stunned that no one had responded. His response to Goliath was this, verse 26. Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God? Eliab, David's brother, told him, in effect, why don't you go back home? You know what you're talking about. Just be quiet. Get out of here. I didn't quite say it that way. He was much meaner than I just was. David did a very important thing. It's what we need to do with the Eliabs of our life, to those critical voices of our life. He turned away from him and continued with his question and said it again out loud for everyone to hear. Who is this guy? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine? Who on earth does he think he is that he can defy the armies of the living God? Word of that got to Saul. Saul called him in. David said, look, no man's heart fail. It's all about people's heart failing. And David is fighting for, among other things, the hearts of God's people here. I will go fight that Philistine. Saul's response was, you're just a youth. This guy's been a warrior from his youth. Verse 34, David explained to Saul why it is he was able to, ready to, move toward this Goliath when everybody else wanted to avoid him. Let me explain to you, Saul, why my instinct is to go toward him. Verse 34, David said to Saul, your servant was tending a father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock, stop right there, that could best be rendered this way. Saul, whenever a lion or a bear came, meaning lions and bears when you're a shepherd are kind of part of life. They come all the time. Whenever a lion or a bear would come, I had a way of handling them. I kind of did the same thing every time. I wasn't sure I was going to survive, but I always did the same thing. Whenever a lion or a bear came, verse 35, I went out after him and attacked him. The point of those verses, that encounter with Saul was this. If you're a shepherd, lions and bears are part of everyday life. And bold hearts, the kind we see as embodied in David, bold hearts are formed in the everyday filings of lions and bears in our life. They come with the territory. They're part of life. And when they came to David, even when he was very young, once again, he began to develop early in his life a way of handling, a pattern for handling those kinds of issues. verse 35, he went out after them. He went toward them. He engaged them. So that when Goliath came, and as scary as lions and bears are, Goliath far more, but the bottom line was having done bears and lions, when the Goliath showed up, David just did what he always did. He went out after him and attacked him. With no guarantees that he would prevail. When he went after the lion and the bear, he had no guarantees he would live. He went after Goliath. He had no guarantees that he would survive, that he would prevail. When facing their Goliath, and their Goliath had a different name, his name was Nebuchadnezzar, who said, you bow down to me or I throw you into this furnace of fire. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego said, here's the deal. Our God can deliver us. Sounds like David. Not only that, our God will deliver us. That sounds like David too. They added, however, this reality check. But even if he doesn't, and he might not, even if he doesn't, we still aren't buying down to you. I'm still going after that bear. I'm still going after the lion. I'm still taking my stone and throwing it at Goliath. And every time you do that, go toward the Goliaths of life, the lions and the bears of life. Last week we learned that your heart gets a little bigger, your spirit gets a little bolder, your faith gets a little stronger, and every time you don't, you become more and more like the armies of Israel and Saul the king. Every time you don't and you avoid the lion bear or Goliath of your life, you get a little weaker, you get a little smaller. You feel a little bit more like a coward every time. You don't go toward, you avoid. So the word from last week, the encouragement from last week was this. Identify, excuse me. I'm going to need some water. Like... That was Keith. Thank you. I got it. Identify your lion. Identify your bear. Identify your Goliath. It's got to be bigger than this. Stop avoiding them. Begin to move toward them, taking what we call last week in analogy, the five smooth stones of how it is that God wired you, the five smooth stones of how it is God's gifted you, and give that gift, throw that stone, whatever it might be, and throw it as hard as you can, believing that God is with you when you do. Here's the question that brings us ultimately to the table. Last week, at the end of the service, I asked you in prayer to ask God to identify to yourself, what's my Goliath, what's my lion, what's my bear that I have to go forward toward this week? How many of you did that? How many of you this week went toward a Goliath or a lion or a bear? I see some hands here and there. How many went toward a Goliath or a lion or a bear, but you don't raise your hands? Raise your hand. Okay, there. I knew there was more. Yeah. See, I know for a fact that a number of you went toward your lions and bears and Goliaths, and even if you didn't, they kind of maybe came toward you, and you were facing some things down this week that weren't very pleasant. I have another question for you. How many of you wish you hadn't faced down your lion, bear, and Goliath this last week? How many of you had a little bit of energy this week spent on being angry at me because I was encouraging you last week to face down your lions, bears, and Goliaths. Because this last week when you went after that lion that you felt so sure you were supposed to do last Sunday when we closed in prayer and your heart was full of faith and hope and confidence in God, that lion you went toward that you were supposed to, that Goliath you threw your stone at that you were supposed to, The problem is he didn't just fall over dead like it sounds like he did in the story. In fact, all that really happened after you went after your lion bearer, Goliath, was you just made him mad. And now he's coming after you. You should have let sleeping dogs lie. There really is something to be said for avoidance. So my talk this morning is the virtue of avoidance. I want you to notice something in verse 35 that would be easy to miss it's kind of a nuance it's the kind of thing you miss when a lot of action is packed into a little verse and you don't really just step back and wonder how that scene had to transpire look at verse 35 it says when I went out after him he's talking about either the lion or the bear and attacked him and rescued it that would be the sheep from his mouth, the lion's or bear's mouth. And when he rose up against me, stop right there. That speaks of a sequence there. I went out and attacked the lion or bear, and I would assume he did that with a stone because that was one of the things he did. So there's the lion or bear going off with the sheep. We talked about last week the fact that whenever you help the helpless, that's the symbolism in this, and put yourself at risk to do that, God's with you. I hit the bear, I hit the lion with the stone, dropped the lamb, turned around, and began to roar at David. Then I seized him by the beard and struck him and killed him. The point is this. The prospect of facing down your lion's bears and Goliath isn't as clean as sometimes we think it's going to be when we just, again, read the story in the verse. It isn't as easy. It isn't as clean. This prospect of facing down your lions, bears, and Goliaths sometimes takes some time. It's usually very messy. It's almost always frightening. It really is a battle, and it's a battle you have to fight. I wish I could make it easier, this dynamic of facing your lions and bears and Goliaths. It isn't easy. They don't all go down after you throw one stone. Sometimes there's kind of a face-to-face. This was face-to-face stuff here between the lion and the bear and David. He got his hands dirty. He got real sweaty. Probably got some blood on him. I'm not appealing to blood there. I'm appealing, however, to the mess of this. You know, the same kind of thing happened with Goliath. Look at verse 49. And David put his hand into his bag and took from it a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine in his forehead. And the stone sank into his forehead so that he fell on his face to the ground. And I like it when my Goliaths go down like that. My impression is I have some distance. I'm not really getting that close to him. I got a sling or a gun or something or maybe a word I'm going to throw at him. I don't think you should do that. And he went down. Oh, I won't ever do that again. That was easy. And so from a distance. And the problem is solved because I spoke up at work. or I confronted my husband or my wife or my kids, and they fell down. No, the next verse says, verse 51, not the next verse, but verse 51. Then after he threw his stone, he ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath, and then he killed him. It wasn't dead yet. And cut off his head with it, which is, I just read that because I just think that's really cool that he did that. you know what here's the picture I want you to get and I'm going to spend a lot of time on this I just want you to know going over and cutting his head off I'm not going to try to hack that out this is messier than I think we think it is when we say yes to God about this stuff on Sunday morning when last week when the move of the spirit is so strong and we are identifying the bear we have to go for, or the lion, or the Goliath. And they maybe do get affected when we speak the word we were supposed to speak, or move into the situation, but they don't just die right there, and then there's some hand-to-hand, face-to-face, sweaty, bloody, processed stuff involved in this, and we weren't ready for that part. With all of that, let me get back to the original point, the thing I said at the very beginning of the talk this morning. See, the only way this analogy of the communion table this morning being like a rest stop for this journey, the only way that analogy makes sense is if you're actually on this journey. Is if you actually have begun at the level I'm describing to be going after your bear or your lion or your Goliath, because if you are going after them, if you have been going toward them, if you've broken from the pattern of avoidance relative to these kinds of issues that you've been stuck in, if you've begun to move into those things, here's what I know about you. You may just be a little tired this morning. If it's true, then you may just need a little nourishment this morning. So take and eat and come and drink. So you may need to stop and get your bearings a little bit. You may need a fresh encounter with the God who is with you. You may need this morning a little reminder of who you are and whose you are and what's at stake in this journey of the heart. So let me remind you, before we go to the table this morning, of some things we talked about, the very first Sunday we began this journey. I talked about some things I want you to pack in your suitcase. The analogy I was using was, we haven't even started the journey, we're just kind of still in the driveway. I want to remind you of just a few things that we talked about when we were still in the driveway that you might need to be, I think you need to be reminded of, especially if you've engaged in this journey of moving toward your lions, bears, and Goliaths, and they haven't all fallen down dead like that. First thing I want to remind you of, relative especially to the heart of the matter, is that your heart is central. This journey of the heart that may be at risk right now because the Goliath didn't die right away, your heart is central, and it is worth fighting for. So guard your heart. For from the heart flow, all the issues of life, but you're going to have to fight for it. You're going to have to fight for your heart. There's no way to get around that. And that leads to the second thing I want you to remind you of, and it's the explanation for why you're going to have to fight for your heart, is because your heart's under assault. Remember we talked about that when we left the driveway. before we left the driveway four weeks ago. C.S. Lewis said it this way, the story of your life is the story of a long and brutal assault on your heart by the one who knows what you could be if your heart came alive. And he fears that. There really is a glory to your life that the enemy sees, even if you don't. Therefore, the enemy is hell-bent on destroying it, that is your glory, so he attacks your heart. so guard your heart fight for your heart John Eldridge in his book Waking the Dead says it this way the plan of the enemy from the beginning was to assault the heart make people so busy they would ignore the heart wound them so deeply they don't want a heart twist their theology so they despise their heart take away their courage, destroy their creativity make intimacy with God seem impossible for them of course your heart would be the object of a great and fierce battle. It only makes sense. It is your most prized possession. For without your heart, the passions of your heart, you cannot know God. Without your heart, you cannot know love. Without your heart, you cannot have faith. Without your heart, you can't even find the work that you were designed by God to do. In other words, without your heart alive, you can't have life. leads to the third thing I want to remind you of that we talked about before we'd ever left the driveway on this journey for the heart. It's this. That the mission of Christ, the reason God through his son left heaven's glory was to rescue your heart. So he could recover your heart. So he could wash clean your heart, redeem your heart, Give to you a new heart and a live to God heart. Remember Ezekiel 36, 26? The prophet Ezekiel was given this message relative to what the mission of Messiah would accomplish. And this is what Messiah would accomplish. The new covenant, the kingdom of God would accomplish. It's this. I will give to you a new what? Heart. And I will put a new spirit within you and I will remove your heart of stone and I will give you a new heart. We've been saying it this way. Almost every week of this journey, I've been reminding you of this, that while in the church, we talk a lot theologically about what's called original sin. We need to also talk about original glory. What it was that God originally intended for men and women to be and to live in and how because of sin, that original glory has been lost. but how the mission of Christ from the beginning was to recover and restore that glory. Isaiah 61. Speaking of Jesus, in fact, it's Isaiah 61 that Jesus himself quotes in Luke chapter 4 when he identifies who he is to the people and what his mission is. Isaiah 61, Luke 4, Jesus says this about himself. You need to know something. The spear of the Lord is upon me, for he has anointed me to do something. Among other things, this. He has anointed me to bring good news to the afflicted and to bind up the broken, what? Hearted. The mission of Christ is to bind up the brokenhearted, to wash your heart clean, to redeem your heart, to give you a new heart and a life to God heart, and whatever else this table says, and whatever else this table means, it says and means this. mission accomplished. Amen. So come and eat. And come and drink. And come and get some nourishment. And the more I suspect you have engaged in the journey that we have been on that has been encouraging us for the last couple of weeks to move toward those issues in our lives that we tend to avoid and hope will go away, but God is calling us to move toward, and now you're in the battle, especially, come, you, come. You who are weary from what resulted even from your obedience, that that bear rose up and attacked you back, and you come and get some nourishment. You come to this table and find your bearings. You come to this table and be reminded that the truest thing about you, if you are in Christ and if Christ is in you, is that you have a really good heart. It may not be a perfect heart. Something else we established in the driveway, as it were, a few weeks ago. In fact, this morning it may be a weary heart, weary from having started the journey authentically. It may be a wounded heart. It may be a wandering heart. But if Christ is in you, if you are in Christ, you need to know, you need to be reminded that your heart is a washed, clean heart. It is a redeemed heart. It is a brand new heart. It's an alive to God heart. Accomplishing that was the mission of Christ. And this table says the mission has been accomplished. So come and eat and come and drink. I'm going to ask the altar team to come, but also for the stewards to come and take their place as we serve them as they prepare themselves to serve you. And Jan, I'd like you to come and bring us to the table. For those of you who are new to Open Door, you will notice that we do communion in a specific way. There will be three things going on at once. First is communion, second is prayer, and third is worship. All throughout the sanctuary, there will be communion stations. And when you are ready, we invite you to come to the table. There is a small diagram in the front cover of your bulletin, and you will begin to understand how you can move towards those stations. When you come to the stations, we ask that you would hold your hands open before the communion steward, and they will say some words to you and place the cracker in your hand, and you will take that cracker, the bread, and dip it in the cup. While we are receiving communion, there will be altar team people up in front who can receive you for prayer either before or after you receive communion. And all this time is bathed in worship as we sing in one voice to our Lord God. I'm going to ask in preparation for communion this morning that you do something a little bit different, and that is to take your hand and place it on your heart. We are all in so many different places as it comes to this journey of the heart, and especially for those who find themselves a little weary and needing a special touch this day. Those things that Dave talked about this morning are truths, that we are the chosen ones of God, that Jesus has come that we might have life. And the life that he wants to give to us is a life that is full and free. And with all these things in mind, we go to the table and remember that on the night in which our Lord Jesus was betrayed, he took the bread and he gave thanks. And he said, this bread is my body given for you. Take and eat of this in remembrance of me. And in like manner, he took the cup, and he again gave thanks and said, This cup is the new covenant in my blood. It is shed for you and for all people for the forgiveness of sins. Drink of this in remembrance of me. Let's pray. Lord God, we do pray that as we come to your table this day, that we may encounter you. God, feed our hearts. Feed our lives. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
